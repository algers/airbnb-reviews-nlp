618658345,its in a great neighborhood and close to a lot of cool places  theres quite a big price jump at the end of checking out so be a bit weary of that  also the heater was not working as well as the couch outside near the heater not being the cleanest  the street parking seems to be free but its a bit confusing on when you can use it   obviously the weekend is fine  but during weekdays we werent so sure  other than that I had a great stay here and would love to come back with some things being closer paid attention to  just pay a little closer attention to detail  the guests before me I assume had leftover food in the microwave  the shower had quite a bit of mildew on the wall  as well as that weird older piece having some  the bathtub was missing a knob so I didnt feel comfy using it  it would be nice if the heater outside worked as well as the couch being a little cleaner so it was more useable  also the odd price jump to almost double was a bit disheartening and im not sure why it happened  other than that its in a great neighborhood and close to a lot of things that were very handy  I would love to stay back here with some improvements and a better understanding in the change of price  thank you  the price about doubled when I checked out  wasnt sure why especially with there being some knicks and dings on the walls  as well as not having a working heater outside that we assumed was in working condition
616427415,Our stay in this place was supposed to be a joyful one  We came for a few days to celebrate my daughters birthday  This place is very close to Barnes hospital which made it a perfect location to get together   It was very disappointing from the beginning  The bathroom was not cleaned and full of hair from the previous guest  A set of dirty linens was thrown in the closet if bedroom number one and in bedroom number   the linens were full of hairs  The companys response was slow and unapologetic and they did nothing to remediate the situation  We had to buy our own sheets  The next day they came to clean but  in spite of our request  they did not leave toilet paper  Avoid this place at all cost  The WiFi was not working  The username and password was incorrect The host kept avoiding the issue of dirty linens and bathroom  They insisted that we make the bed with a non existing spare set of linens  Actually there were dirty linens crumpled up in the closet  A clean space and a more responsive host  We will never again stay with this company
