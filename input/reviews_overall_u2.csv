616427415,Our stay in this place was supposed to be a joyful one  We came for a few days to celebrate my daughters birthday  This place is very close to Barnes hospital which made it a perfect location to get together   It was very disappointing from the beginning  The bathroom was not cleaned and full of hair from the previous guest  A set of dirty linens was thrown in the closet if bedroom number one and in bedroom number   the linens were full of hairs  The companys response was slow and unapologetic and they did nothing to remediate the situation  We had to buy our own sheets  The next day they came to clean but  in spite of our request  they did not leave toilet paper  Avoid this place at all cost  The WiFi was not working  The username and password was incorrect The unit was not cleaned after the previous guest left  The linens were not changed and the bathroom was full of hairs from the previous guest  We had to buy our own toilet paper The host kept avoiding the issue of dirty linens and bathroom  They insisted that we make the bed with a non existing spare set of linens  Actually there were dirty linens crumpled up in the closet  A clean space and a more responsive host  We will never again stay with this company 
584025767,Not great  Skip this listing for now until they get their systems improved  First negative review Ive written over dozens of stays  Cigarette marijuana smoke really triggering our breathing at night  Check in was not smooth  Waited about an hour to get the key problem figured out  No shower supplies  The place is bare bones   a bed  a few glasses  and a tv  Awful refund policy since we had to cancel     back  Really negative stay  well choose a hotel next time   Listing said washer and dryer  none in this unit   Shower supplies  better check in  all around could be improved 
621467578,Dont stay there  
428631482,The only thing I enjoyed about this property was the memory foam mattress  Other than that it was a total miss  Check in was very easy  And location was great for us  However  every night as we tried to fall asleep there was constitution sounds like hammering all throughout the night  There was food left over in the dirty refrigerator  The bathtub was covered in hair  The floors had not been swept and the rug had not been vacuumed 
590797389,Do not try to change your dates  Marty will say   No Problem  Then Marty will say   just cancel your reservation and i will rebook you for the dates needed  Then marty will tell you that RIGHT AFTER you cancelled someone swooped in and took your dates  Sooo sorry  BUT dont worry  i have an inferior room for the SAME price  You booked a   bedroom  well  this one has one bedroom  and it costs      for   nights on AirBnB   however   its going to cost you good folks      for   nights  the cost of   bedrooms  just because i know you are in a hospital having cancer surgery and its probably incredibly inconvenient to find other more suitable accomodations with so little time now  Sigh  Marty  you little enterpriser you  Double charging for inferior accomodations is bad business  But having people cancel and then taking advantage of them is just grotesque  You should be ashamed of yourself for double charging me for an inferior room  If you were a good person you would have charged me the proper amount  especially after you made a mistake by not taking care of my reservation like we discussed  Im dying so i no longer mince words  Karma is real  The next time you get taken advantage of  i hope you think of me  May you get everything you deserve in       Marty      That we would be able to change our dates with ease  After being double charged for an inferior room  nothing was easy   Host told us he could accomodate switching our dates  but he instead had us cancel our reservation  then waited until it was booked by someone else before offering us an inferior room with one bedroom for the same price he booked us two bedrooms  When we looked up the room it was half of what he charged us  We were double charged for an inferior room   As i was having cancer surgery at the University of Chicago nearby  we had to stay near the hospital a week after   My    year old mother slept on a couch  I dont understand how Zen City is allowed to operate with such shady business tactics  If the host had not swindled us by pretending he could accomodate a date change  that he let someone else book after asking us to cancel our reservation  then offering us a one bedroom       for   nights room  but charging us      like we were still getting our   bedrooms  DOUBLE CHARGING US FOR AN INFERIOR ROOM  How is this allowed to occur  We would not have cancelled our reservation or asked to change the dates had we known Marty at Zen City would do that  If i hadnt been attached to    cords in the hospital i would have found other accomodations  but after having my torso opened up  i had no strength to fight the power  Nothing zen about zen city  I feel taken advantage of in my time of need frankly  Marty should be ashamed  there are things you dont do to the dying  Ripping them off surely has to be one of the unspoken rules 
586273846,There were a couple of issues with this listing that were purely cosmetic  a broken smoke detector that was never fixed though we reported it  blood stains and dirt on the comforter  and a severely clogged tub    But the dealbreaker was noise  Every morning other than Sunday and a Wednesday that fell on New Years Day during a week long stay  we were awakened by trash collection noises  dumpsters rolling over pavement  revving and beeping trucks  that began between      and      am and lasted between    minutes and an hour  This is because both sets of bedroom windows overlook the alley where trash collection  takes place  a fact not mentioned in the listing  In addition  the apartment is located directly above the buildings trash room  which dumpsters were rolled in and out of repeatedly  Though we reported this issue to the host and provided photo documentation of trash collection happening immediately below our bedroom window  they denied that trash collection was occurring     and suggested the problem was our  sensitivity to noise   Had there been mention of the alley and the trash noises in the listing  we would never have booked this Airbnb    In short  noisy  dark  and not super clean  Hosts denied the noise was a problem despite ample documentation and refused to give a partial refund for the disruption to our stay  Though the building and location are lovely  I would steer clear of this unit and perhaps ZenCity altogether  Your business model seems to be to fail to disclose crucial details about your listing  noise  and then deny there is a problem when guests complain  The reason I didnt respond to requests for further clarification about the other stuff  smoke detector  gross menstrual blood stains on a comforter  is that it was relatively nbd  but together with being awakened by truck beeping and dumpster rolling     days of our vacation  it made for a pretty shitty experience  Rest assured I will be escalating this to Airbnb and letting my many local friends  Im a native Hyde Parker  know never to rent from ZenCity   Every morning other than Sunday and a Wednesday that fell on New Year u    s day during a nearly week long stay  we were awakened by trash collection noises  dumpsters rolling over pavement  revving and beeping trucks  that began between      and      am and lasted between    minutes and an hour  This is because both sets of bedroom windows overlook the alley where trash collection  takes place u     a fact not mentioned in the listing  In addition  the apartment is located directly over the building trash space  which dumpsters were rolled in and out of repeatedly  Though we reported this to the host and provided photo documentation of trash collection happening immediately below our bedroom window  they denied that trash collection was occurring     and suggested the problem was our  u   csensitivity to noise  u   d Had there been mention of the alley and the trash noises in the listing  I would never have booked this Airbnb   Tub was clogged  Comforters had bloodstains and dirt on them  In addition to the gross conditions in the bedroom and bathroom   which we might have ignored if not for the horrible morning noise   we reported a chirping smoke detector upon our arrival and were told a work order to fix it was submitted  However  the smoke detector remained dismantled and nonfunctional throughout our week long stay  Noisy  dark  and not super clean  Hosts denied the noise was a problem despite ample documentation and refused to give a partial refund for the disruption to our stay  Though the building and location are lovely  I would steer clear of this unit and perhaps ZenCity altogether 
577531086,Ive never had a problem with Airbnb before and Im sure this was a miscommunication that can be easily fixed  We were unable to get into the place  The instructions were clear and we followed them   they just didnt work  The key from the lockbox did not open the door of the house with the correct address  Not sure why  We tried multiple times and tried to get in touch with the host but it was late and cold so we never got to use the place  The pictures look great and Im sue it wouldve been a great stay if we were able to get in  Hey there  Im not sure what happened  Ive been using Airbnb since      and have never had an issue  Im sure this was a miscommunication but we were not able to get into the airbnb  We tried several times  We were able to retrieve the key from the lockbox but it was not opening  It was the right building as well  It was freezing so after    minutes of trying we gave up and went to my apartment  It was a bummer  Wish I couldve gotten in touch with you because the place looked great from the photos  Hope it can get fixed for the next person   We were unable to open and get into the accommodation   We were not able to get into the location 
563978116,WARNING  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL   Misleading description of this accommodation  This accommodation is above a pub and unbearable loud music is played till      am  We tried to sleep as we had long business days ahead of us  but the music was so loud that the floor was vibrating from the speakers and was impossible to relax or sleep   It was clear for us  we cannot stay in this apartment and be fully functional for our next business day s  Half an hour after we tried to go in the bed  around   pm  we booked another hotel  and left the apartment with our entire luggage  The other reasons we decided to leave this place was the cleanliness of the apartment   so unacceptable   the mid frame of the split window next to the oven was with a greasy black layer and full of black sponge pieces  looks like dead flies laying on it  I tried to sit on the coach before to go to the bed and watch TV  but it is an old piece of furniture  looks like collected from the street with unpleasant smell and broken springs  I could not sit more than   min before I felt the hurting pain on my bones from the broken springs  The ventilation fan on the ceiling  greasy and dirty as well  additionally was generating loud noises like tractor  which I stopped with the hope that it will reduce the noise in the apartment  The  nd bedroom door was with penetrated hole  THE BREATHING AIR IN THE APARTMENT WAS HEAVY AND STALE  I lost        CAD thanks to the hosts misleading information and in spite of proving them wrong  the host refuse to reimburse me at all  Here is the misleading description at the time of our booking that the hose word it like that     The home is just a short walk from the park and the lake and stones throw from number of bars  restaurants and entertainment venues    This   stones throw  is not the same as above the bar in one wooden ceiling distance  A child can even throw a stone at least    yards  Ironically at the time of our booking  the House rules    says   Quiet time after   pm  Please read it twice before you get burned as we did with this booking and Zencitys management company   Misleading description  nIt says       stone u    s throw from number of bars        BUT does not say that is above a bar and loud music run till     am  nIronically a rule of house    is    Quiet time after   pm   when the floor is vibrating from the pubs music underneath   Old and scratchy place   Greasy black layer on the middle window frame next to the oven   With the first look  looks like dead flys all over on that frame  but happen to be old black pieces from falling apart sponge   Greasy ventilation outlets  some of them broken   Unpleasant smell coming from old and broken coach   Heavy and stale air  unhealthy and damaging my lungs  Second bedroom is with a penetrated hole  look from inside of the room  unpainted  scratches etc  The host nether responded to our request for additional person  The host did not admit the misleading and slippery description of the apartment  hide the information of loud music every night till      am and refused to reimburse me with         CAD for refusing to stay in their accommodation  Unlisted from AirBnB and save other people money and the frustration we had to go through 
561429598,Not a good stay  We have used Air BnB frequently in the past   months  and had a really disappointing experience here  The space had glowing reviews for being clean  which we did not find to be the case  The building was shabby and had a very unpleasant smell  The heat was locked at     so we couldnt get the room to cool down making it impossible to sleep through the night  We also could not get the hot water to work  We left for a hotel after one evening   We didn u    t feel the photos accurately represented the space   Some stray hairs in the bathroom  a pretty unpleasant smell in the building and the room  building was shabby and felt unsafe  The area surrounding was great but the building was not cracked up to what the description painted it to be  We paid far too much for such an unpleasant experience  We only stayed one night and ended up moving to a hotel because we were so uncomfortable in the space  Lost about      for a one night stay that was supposed to be a fun  relaxing getaway weekend 
656766909,I was not able to access the apartment from the front door because the key did not fit properly and the lock was loose  I then proceeded to speak to Zen City customer service representative  Marty  who was very cold  callus  condescending  and rude on the line    I explained the situation about not being able to get into the apartment  then he replied that we must not have been turning the key properly which is quite a jerk move to assume that adults are not able to place the key in the hole properly  and  it is very a ableist assumption    He then suggested that we go back downstairs   which the listing does not say that you must go up three flights of stairs to access the apartment  also  not ADA compliant  to look for the back up key  alas  there was no back up key when we went back to the lockboxes   As we  my friend and I  explained to Marty that there wasnt any back up key in any of the lockbox that he suggested  he accusatorially asked if we were sure that there were no key in the lockbox  He was extremely frustrating to work with     He finally suggest that we go to the back of the building to access the apartment  We couldnt figure out to get to the back of the apartment  So  while on the phone with Marty  we asked how to access the back of the apartment  in a very annoyed voice  he condescendingly told us that hes trying to help us and we need to listen to him    He explained that we needed to go through the common area of the building through the alley to access the back of the building  this is an alarming safety issue  walk up six     flight of stairs and didnt specify which back door to access  we tried the key for all of the four back doors and we were finally able to get in    Once  inside  I had asked Marty if we could get accommodated for another Airbnb that would be on another floor or another apartment  he stated  No   Then  I inquired why and he explicated thats they were fully booked  which was not true because we did not see anyone else in the building that we were in except for apartment  A  he was able to accommodate us  but refused    He then asked us for video evidence of us not getting into the apartment  we felt that he was being callus because we explicitly explained that we could not get into the front door due to the lock being not sturdy  He made us feel as if we were liars and that we were exaggerating on getting into the front door of apartment  A   Once  we were inside from the back door  we could NOT exit from the front door  a major SAFETY ISSUE just in case of a fire or other issues that could be unforeseeable   We highlighted to Marty that we could not exit the front door either  He then asked us again to send video proof of us not being able to exit the apartment  we took the video as well because we felt like he was accusing us of lying about not exiting the front door as well    It was extremely disheartening because we paid for the apartment in full and expected to have a great experience as well as good customer service without micro aggression  condescending behavior  and callus communication from the customer service representative  Marty    Moreover  the toilet was broken  but due to our very hostile conversation with Marty  the representative of Zen City  we decided that we would tell onsite maintenance staff   who were a supreme JOY  about the toilet not being functional    We were not compensated with a partial credit  we were not offered another place to accommodate us  nor did our initial concerns were rectified by Zen City    Zen City was very satisfied with taking our money and not doing anything to fix our safety concerns    Also  the apartment is extremely hot in the bedrooms  I had to purchase my own fan to not be sleeping in sweat for the days that we were there    Overall  I would suggest another apartment that is not  A with Zen City or go completely somewhere else that would have better customer service

566246496,Unfortunately  I cant comment on the space  since I was not able to access the loft   I arrived and followed self check in instructions  but found no key in the lock box   I tried for over an hour to reach the host  via phone  supposed    hour urgent response line  and airbnb message  but after receiving no response  I ultimately had to make other plans  it was getting late  I had to be ready for early meetings    Hopefully  this was just a mistake on their part  but the communication went from great before my arrival to very slow and incomplete after things went wrong   I had to scramble to find alternative accommodations and am still working on getting a refund   I can say that the location seems to be convenient  near the convention center and restaurants    Please process refund grievance   No idea  aside from the lack of key where there should have been one   I can really only rate the check in here  since I wasnt able to access the apartment and  due to the late hour and a full schedule for the rest of my stay  moved to other accommodations after waiting more than an hour for a response to multiple messages by phone and over airbnb   Prior to this  the communication had been good  so I was surprised when I arrived to find no key in the lock box and no immediate response to my calls texts  No idea   The lobby was fine  The communication was great before my trip   However  this broke down when things started to go wrong with check in   I called the host phone number  and got to an automated messaging system   The system was strange  because it went back to the main menu once no matter which number option you pressed   Once I figured out that you have to go through the full system twice  I left two messages on the  urgent     hour message response system  and one on the regular help line hoping for a response   At the same time  I wrote to them via the airbnb messaging system   I arrived at   pm  and waited in the lobby until     before starting to look for a safe walking distance alternative place to stay   I stayed in the lobby for an additional     minutes doing this  while hoping to hear back from zencity   After moving on to a hotel so that I could use the facilities and get some sleep before early meetings  someone did finally reach out with an alternative code  via airbnb   they never called me back   but I had already gone to bed   So far    days after check in  I have only received one follow up message  telling me to cancel   Other requests for compensation have not be answered  nor has my grievance received a response  Would have been great  So far       for a very stressful  not at all zen  arrival for my first visit to St  Louis is not a good value   If the place is as advertised  would be great 
292262127,This place is very clean and functional but it IS NOT what it looks like in the pictures  Theres no washer and dryer  no marble counter tops  no tv in the bedroom  no luxury amenities as shown in the listing   Check in was very long  We didnt receive keys until   hours after checking in  This was my first airbnb so this wasnt a great experience   The record player  fresh sheets  towels  and comforters were a huge plus but I wouldnt book here again   This listing is NOT as described  The unit looks nothing like the pictures    The concierge did not have keys to give us upon arrival  It took   hours for us to receive keys  Host evaded the fact that the pictures that were shown did not match the actual unit  
159769196,If we could rate this half a star  we would due to multiple issues we had with our stay at Chriss residence  as well as the service with Chris as a host  The only positive is the neighborhood     The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price        per night   The building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that its in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator and freezer  as well as faulty hardware in the bathroom  We also noticed that the dishware was not properly cleaned and had yellow caked on residue from previous usage    Chris was extremely unprofessional  and needed to visit the residence multiple times during our stay which really made us feel uncomfortable  and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays  let alone hotel stays for comparable price points  There was a showing of the space scheduled during our stay  which was completely unacceptable  Chris also needed to retrieve a garment for a  supposedly  previous guest while we were staying  which also made no sense to us  Why couldnt these things be handled after our stay was finished     Furthermore  we had booked a stay at one of Chriss other listings which we had to unfortunately cancel due to a change of schedule in our business trip  The fact he was unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at the other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didnt settle well with us  Especially since we had booked a longer stay at his other listing    All in all  we are completely unsatisfied with Chris as a host  and even though the Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area  we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing    Unfortunately  we wont be able to provide you with a five star review due to multiple issues we had with our stay in your residence  as well as the service with you as a host     The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price  The building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that its in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator and freezer  as well as faulty hardware in the bathroom  We also noticed that the dishware was not properly cleaned and had yellow caked on residue from previous usage    We mentioned this to you during our stay  but the unprofessionalism of constantly needing to visit the residence during our stay really made us feel uncomfortable  and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays  let alone hotel stays for comparable price points  The need for you to schedule a showing of the space during our stay is completely unacceptable  And the need to retrieve a garment for a  supposedly  previous guest while we were staying there makes no sense to us  Why couldnt these things be handled after our stay was finished     Furthermore  the fact that you were unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at your other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didnt settle well with us  Frankly  it pissed us off  and we would have much rather have canceled the second reservation if we knew we wouldnt incur this ridiculous fee again  Especially since we had booked a longer stay at your other listing  You have every opportunity to refund this charge  AirBnB doesnt hold you to this  Weve already sent a refund request  yet we see that you are much more interested in taking advantage of funds from potential guests     All in all  we are completely unsatisfied with you as a host  and even though your Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area  we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  Additional comments   u   cThe building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that it u    s in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did   u   d    The retrieval of the keys was communicated very well  and it was easy to get into the building  however the elevator was broken and this was not communicated with us    Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  towels and linens  dust  odors  bathroom  kitchen  Additional comments   The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator    Although in a great neighborhood  the apartment was overpriced and not of value  For the same price of the stay  we could have stayed in a hotel with clean linens  and an overall higher quality environment

623266665,I did not actually go to the property but they took my money for the whole stay  Very dishonest company  who choose to not respond to emails on their site  I would be very careful when booking with them  I have a lot of Airbnb travel experience and this was the most dishonest one I have ever experienced  This has been the worst and most dishonest experience on Airbnb ever  I booked nd they repsonded  will let you know within    hours   Since I needed the place that same night I cancelled  They charged my card for the whole   day stay which included cleaning  I did contact airbnb to resolve but Zencity said they had a very strict refund policy  I got nothing for my       They simply took all of my money for the whole   day stay  Cleaning fees and airbnb fees  Taxs etc   A reputable company would never behave like this  BE VERY CAREFUL when handing over your credit card to this dishonest company   They charged me for a booking I cancelled  Very dishonest company  I emailed them on their website to cancel and they never responded They charged me for a cleaning fee and I never used the place They never responded to my communication  They took my money for the whole stay  Beware of this company  I did not go to the home at all  This is my VERY WORST Airbnb experience ever  They took all of my money after I tried to cancel  Be very careful when giving this company your money

616467131,Dont do it  Unclean   uncaring Management owner by the name of Marty  plus my wallet magically disappeared when I was the only   in my unit besides the house maid or whatever she calls herself  I am extremely disappointed  Maybe you should try hiring a new house maid or having someone inspect the properties personally bcuz both my units were not clean  I had  dust the hangers off along with cleaning out the microwaves  the refrigerators  the tubs and sweep the floors  Not   mention the bed sheets and pillow cases were filled with different types of hair so I didnt even sleep on the beds at either   of the units  The doorman even had to take the trash out bcuz it was left in the room  I also purposely placed seeds underthe chair in one unit and behind the table in the other and it wasnt cleaned  Its probably still there if you wana go and see for yourself bcuz I doubt she cleaned the rooms properly  Theres so much more than an unclean room that I endured   I will just say that I will not be renting anymore Zencity properties   also  I do not appreciate the way the man by the name of Marty didnt handle the situation I was in but I am sure you let everybody know   The cleanliness  The actual check in process was fiNe  it was walking into a used room and having   clean up after a late check in that was the problem  The doorman even gave me Clorox wipes   clean with  I have photos   video footage of how the place was when I checked in  I had   clean up myself   I still didnt sleep in the bed  The doorman that checked me in even had   take the trash out when I checked in bcuz It was full  I even purposely poured sunflower seeds on the floor under the chair that was there and I went back in the unit the night after I checked out due   my wallet missing and after the cleaning lady left   guess what was still there   Sunflower seeds  under the chair    Besides these units being unclean bcuz I had   different units    I will NEVER rent from them again  my wallet seemed to magically disappear when I was the only   in the unit besides the cleaning lady   Thats not even the half of it     Way   much   write but I will say I spoke to  of the owners of Zencity by the name of Marty and he didnt help the situation at all  He didnt even care  Told me hell call me back and a week later I still hadnt gotta call back so I called him and he didnt even care  remember who I was    And the Way he was talking  me really pissed me off  I have also told my family   friends to stay away from Zencity properties as well  No response even after   days worth of voice mails  Location was cool if it was actually clean and the management owners werent so fraudulent
703760845,This studio would be ideal for short stays  The value is not the best for longer stays  with lack of long term parking unless you are able to reload the meter every   hours  The meter maids are literally so quick to write a parking ticket  It was hard for me as a night shift nurse  parking on the street during the day  It seems the host sometimes overlooks messages  so if you havent received a response within a reasonable length of time  shoot them another message  The response to my message hinting to have things fixed in the apartment didnt have the response I had hoped it would   the blinds were fixed after about a month and the shower head was still hanging out of the wall when I left  The rooftop access mentioned on the headline is actually at another building down the road  not at the actual building the unit is in  The rooftop access was a huge selling point for me to book  and it came as a disappointment when I found out it wasnt at the apartment building point  The bed was the best part of the stay   it was actually very comfortable  All in all  do your research and make sure this is the best option value wise  I felt like I overpaid   Photos  blinds missing slats  host fixed this issue about a month into stay   shower head dismantled from shower wall  never fixed  nAmenities  no rooftop access at unit building  was at another building down the street  bugs noticed to crawl behind crevices behind bathroom walls and kitchen counters  bathroom and closet wafted of marijuana at specific times of the day  and unfortunately my Louis Vuitton Keepall brought this aroma home with it Attempted to cut stay short due to issues mentioned above  but host never responded to my message asking to change reservation check out date until another message was sent regarding receiving mail    new netflix user named  Worst Airbnb Ever  however was added to the users on the netflix account that was signed in on the smart tv in unit  This was addressed with the host  who said that it was no one from the team that created this new user  However  it was not me either  The astonished faces of my coworkers were comical  when I told them I was paying       for a studio downtown  People at work told me they were paying roughly      less for a  br  ba mortgage just outside downtown 
669413907,Booked this place because a friend came in from out of town  We saw how their listing stated they did ultra cleaning so it made us want to book it especially because this is during covid  This place was the opposite it was SO dirty  There was a hair ball in the toilet and hairs on the seat  When we checked the bed there were hairs too and the table had dirty marks on it  I contacted the host immediately with pictures too and did not receive a response until the next day  We wanted to use the dishes that night and when we grabbed a dish it was dripping with water  The stove had dirty marks too  I was surprised that the host did not respond to at least accommodate  After check out I requested a refund and they said they can assure me the place was clean and that it was discounted too much already so they couldnt  I contacted air bnb support after and told them my experience and they refunded me the cleaning fee thankfully  I wish I would have gotten refunded for the whole thing as the host did nothing to accommodate  This place is unsafe  Dont stay here trust the reviews  This was the worst experience especially having a friend come in from out of town I was embarrassed  Hair in toilet and on the toilet seat  Hairs in bed  dirty marks on tables and spots on couch  The stove also had big dirt spots and dishes in the cabinet that were supposed to be clean were wet and dripping with water 
627404246,FRAUDULENT LISTING    The address is on Pearson Street  around the corner from the Hermitage address  It is questionably connected to a different apartment building on Hermitage  but NOT the one on the listing  The questionable address that it is supposedly connected to has a porta potty in the front  with caution tape on the fence  and is in terrible shape     The photos do say that it is not exactly like the actual apartment because it is a new listing  Fine  But all the photos of windows show it is at an upper level  Which is true if it were in the correct address  Instead  it is direct from the sideway into the doorway  These are the apartments that get broken into in this neighborhood because theyre easy in and out    To add to the lack of safety  the door knob does not shut all the way  It was handmade drywall that didnt line up properly when they were trying to rehab the apartment  So the deadbolt works  but the door opens about an inch because the knob does not connect properly    It is connected to the remainder of the unfinished rehab apartments  which had THREE smoke detectors chirping  Unless the central air fan is on full blast it is every minute of that loud  low battery  chirp   I went in and tried to turn one off  but it still would not stop    Zencitys communication was terrible  I have transcripts to show for that  too    I HAVE PHOTOS DOCUMENTING EVERYTHING  I cannot speak for other listings  but either Zencity does not check their properties before they list them  or they are a fraudulent organization  Zencity  check your properties before you post them  If you are an honest company  and you sincerely did not check beforehand that it was a different building and address  then that is something you should look into in the future  If you do not care  I wonder if all of your listings are fraudulent  If you need proof that your company is representing a fraudulent listing  take a look at      W Pearson      N Hermitage  and     N Hermitage   The address is WRONG  They say it is     N Hermitage  It is      W Pearson  It is in NO WAY connected to     N Hermitage  It is connected to     N Hermitage      N Hermitage has a porta potty in front of the building  caution tape on the fence  and is in terrible shape   n nIt is not a second floor as the photos suggest  I know it says that it isnt exactly the pics because its a new place  but the multiple photos of windows suggest it is a second or third floor unit  First floor buildings are unsafe in that neighborhood   n nThe messages from host  when they actually responded  said it is connected to     which is FALSE  Either this company does not check their properties before posting them  or they are trying to get away with showing     as a nicer building than the one it actually is in   n nI have photos to prove this   I asked multiple times why it was a different address  no response  They did not respond until I went to the building to see it was  in fact  a different address and wrote them to tell them the door does not close all the way  It locks from the deadbolt  but the hand made drywall door frame is unacceptable  The doorknob itself does not close all the way  Even when locked with deadbolt  the door opens approximately   inch because the doorknob isnt lined up properly   When they finally did respond  the representative said they would send a  handyman  over and that never happened    Very disconcerting  Hours went by without hearing back from the host  When they did reply  it was false information  Listing address is a completely different building and street 
669420299,The pictures showed a larger place with a kitchen table and chairs  a full size couch and larger bed area  We got a tiny place with barley enough room to set up a pack n play for our   month old  No kitchen table  no chairs and the  couch  fits   person comfortably  I dont know how people get away with renting places with pictures to obviously another unit they are renting  Id update your pictures to the actual place you are renting  The pictures showed a larger place with a kitchen table and chairs  a full size couch and larger bed area  We got a tiny place with barley enough room to set up a pack n play for our   month old  I don u    t know how people get away with renting places with pictures to obviously another place   It would have been great if it was the place of the pictures that we booked
651002990,The hosting company Zencity has terrible customer service  I was not able to enter the rental on time and they did not give the rental a thorough cleaning between visits  The key was not even in the lock box upon my arrival  Considering COVID     they should have spent more than    minutes cleaning and sanitizing the space  Unprofessional 
621072318,This was an experience that started out fine and ended horribly     Price gouging   We booked the space for six nights  Though the keypad was giving us issues every time we tried to enter the apartment  we once waited       minutes for Zencity to change the code since the keypad wasnt working   we wanted to extend our stay   They refused to give us the new daily rate  which was about     cheaper for those same new dates that we wanted to extend into   They said that if we extended it wed have to keep our same rate because they couldnt change it for us   Annoyed and frustrated  we said fine because we didnt want to have to move and the place was nice enough   After going back and forth  they finally sent a modification that actually added an additional day on top of what we requested   We were flexible  so we didnt say anything because we were already pretty annoyed and wanted to not have a sour relationship with Zencity   RODENT  I E  MOUSE  and poor response   A little past the midway point of our stay  I saw a mouse in the kitchen go from under the oven to under the dishwasher  and later to the bathroom   Now   my partner is TERRIFIED of mice  Terrified   I immediately messaged Zencity  asked them during one call to send someone  they said they would   then asked them on a second call  three hours later  to send someone  they said they would    About four hours after that  around      hours in total  they sent someone who said he just got word an hour before his arrival   In the meantime  like any reasonable person  I had to find another Airbnb last minute  which ended up costing more than this location   Despite the fact that we found large holes throughout the apartment  laundry room and bathroom  and the door doesnt have a door guard  so anything can slide right in        all of which we documented  we were only refunded half of the money we paid for the remaining days of our stay after Zencity ignored our messages and started only communicating with Airbnb     It really started out as a promising trip  but my partner is still reeling from the experience  Im out of a few hundred bucks unexpectedly and I dont even know if Ill have a job in a month  I will NEVER rent a place managed by Zencity again  The space was nice until I found a mouse   I think you all should consider plugging up the holes around the space  laundry room area  bathroom  and put a door guard under the doors  The keypad didnt work for the first few tries  There was a mouse in the kitchen  and we didnt leave food out  When we couldnt get into the apartment and when we found a mouse in the apartment  we experienced pretty slow responses  When I booked the place  you were charging     a day   When I tried to extend it  you all were booking it for     a day at the time and refused to give me that rate   I extended anyway because of COVID    to be nice   Then you extended for one day more than I wanted originally  But I said fine   Then I find a mouse    you wait over    hours to send someone  who told me when he got there that he had only gotten notice an hour before   and then you only give me half my money back for the remaining three days  which shouldve been an additional two days had you not extended my time    I had to find another place last minute  which resulted in me spending even more money that I intended  and I dont even know if Ill have a job in a month    
511719147,I reached out to the company  host  as our power was out for a majority of the stay  Was told that someone would come and never did  We ended up leaving the property before time  Because of this situation  the good looks and location were over shined  I reached out to the company  host  as our power was out for a majority of the stay  Was told that someone would come and never did  We ended up leaving the property before time  Because of this situation  the good looks and location were over shined 
622864247,After check out host asked me to pay     for a Pillow that had been drawn on  Which was not from me  Hi I agreed to pay it just to not have an issue then they came back asking for another     for the same reason which Im not about to pay  After I left host asked me to pay for a Pillow that was drawn on which was not for me for a payment of     which I accepted and paid  which I should not have  after that then they requested another    for the same issue 
670562219,Hard to find key and unit  Host not willing to work with me on refunding money for the reservation even though I didnt stay
621937629,This place is cute st first glance however upon waking up at night to use the restroom  I discovered this place had roaches and these bugs were huge  One was in the bathroom and touched my toothbrush and i showed another in the bedroom  As you can imagine i was disgusted  I informed the host and sent photos but they did nothing  Also though it sys there is no parking on oremus  understand it really means that   There is NO place to park if staffing here   Honestly i feel like i deserve a refund  i wouldnt recommend staying here  I appreciate you letting me rent your space however im incredibly disappointed with how the ROACH  situation was handled  No one ever came to address the issue  I did Mohr sleep the next two nights after seeing bugs in the bathroom and bedroom  Very upset  The carpet head crumbs on it  There was a lime of dirt and crumbs and atop off these air conditioner  The walls of the shower were not clean  There were bugs iight took   hrs after me notifying the host before i recieved a response  They were shooting outside the window  The entrance to the building isas nooottt rally accessible also street parking was almost nonexistent  Cute setup but not worth the bugs and headache 
619905216,Very gross and dirty  There were hairs all over the bathroom floor and the bathtub as well as the entire bed  sheets  comforter and pillows  You can tell they dont even clean it and only get away with it because the place is up to date so it looks clean and nice at first   This was during the corona virus outbreak too  very gross   Our fire alarm also went off every single time we used the oven  and continued to beep every minute for   whole days  Asked the front desk to look at it or try and fix it and they kept saying they would but never did  Other than the neglect and uncleanliness  the place was very accessible and had decent parking space nearby  Location was great too 
622907426,Zen city  Patch up mouse holes communicate with people at your property provided more sheets and towels and blankets  Never messaged or answered responded    hours later  Mouse holes in walls and broken knobs Never responded had dangerous situation Being better hosts
629064232,Good luck in your search and always price check  Prices are not that great   A message was sent to me saying I overpaid     dollars for a airbnb in the Skyline building  when I tried to book the same place that week  it was not available and nothing was said or done about the money i paid    weeks later it was available  I really liked Zencity until the last   trips  A refund would be nice as I always followed the rules and kept the places clean  Thank you  When I asked about the overpaid refund  Same as above A refund or a free weeks stay 
624151641,Terrible  Do not stay at this place or any Zencity location  The person renting out this place did not have the rights to the apartment as their lease had ended  As a result  we were kicked out a couple hours into the stay by the landlord and were not even issued a refund   The host did not have the right to rent out this unit and we were therefore forced to leave a couple hours into our stay  
664902188,Dont go with zencity  they failed to have the apartment cleaned when I arrived  The bed was slept in  dishes in the sink  trash in all the garbages and used toothpaste in the bathroom sink  Then on my last day of the stay a maintenance man unlocked the door and came in while I was sleeping at     am  They would not make it right  Its big corporate and you get the run around  Having the matinace man come in while I was asleep is horrible  If I had been a girl I would sue you for sexual harassment  Having a locked door open at      am out of your sleep in your underwear is not a good experience  All that after non cleaning   It u    s much much smaller than the pictures make it look   The key pad does work  The bed was unmade  dirty dishes in the sink  the trash was not taken out  they literally did not clean it after the last person had been there  they apologized but only gave me    dollars off for the whole ordeal I had to get a different place  which they did pay for   but was very unprofessional and I had to fight for my    instead of them making the wrong right  Also the iron does not work  and there customer service is horrible  The matinace man walked in on me while I was sleeping  Clearly he thought the place was vacant so they have communication issues as well   Its also in a rental place were its probably illegal to have air bnbs  It would be fine if they had better customer service 
623307502,Read carefully All my food for that stay spoiled since I was in a hotel without a kitchen   No mention that there was a flight of stairs outside making it handicapped inaccessible   No handsoap  no disinfectants anywhere  floor was sticky upon entry  Told them I was NOT staying there apparently that wasnt enough to convince them

650523880,Look elsewhere for decent accommodations  The place REEKED of cigarettes  even thought there is a non smoking policy  Our hair and clothes smelled like cigarettes after the first night  Going out and about smelling of cigarettes was awful   Sleeping in that was unpleasant  to say the least  We absolutely could not spend a second night at the apartment and found new accommodations the next day and checked out  We washed our cigarette smelling clothes ASAP  It was really gross   Sam and I are not ones to complain usually  but this had to be addressed  There were a variety of smaller issues  which are easily overlooked  considering the basic requirements of cleanliness are held up  However  this was not the case as the place was an ashtray  The apartment and its furniture were falling apart  The fridge leaked  The toilet did not flush  the shower took a solid    minutes to warm up  and the water pressure was very weak  Some other minor things  like the blinds were all convoluted and not attended to properly   All in all  The biggest issue was the reek of cigarette smoke that made our stay unbearable  besides the variety of falsely advertised amenities  Also  Zencitys reluctance to properly address the situation was disappointing    I contacted and explained our issues with the apartment to Zencity  First they offered alternative accommodation  but for another date  Which of course  visiting Chicago  we needed a place to sleep then and there  They initially charged us for the second night we did not stay  When I declined their offer and further explained the cause of our cancellation  Zencity went quiet and has not responded to my request for a refund  Ive tried to contact them for multiple days now   Spare yourself the headache  money  and unpleasant consequences of booking with Zencity and go with another Airbnb host  I wish I could leave a good review and not have had dealt with all this  The new place I booked is cheaper  in a great location  and is truly CLEAN and properly maintained  Hi Zencity   can somebody please get back to me regarding my stay and refund for checking out  Thanks   The place reeked of cigarettes  even thought there is a no smoking policy  The apartment and its furniture were falling apart  The bathroom had issues with the toilet  water heater and pressure   Reeked of cigarettes  Made our clothes and hair smell like cigarettes  The fridge leaked water  The bathroom plumbing was awful  Responsive at first  and then not at all  when confronted with a complaint and the request to resolve a refund  Accurate description of expected environment 
652351810,Air conditioning doesnt work and they didnt fix it the entire time we stayed there  It was very hot and we contacted host multiple times about this  They said they will send maintenance team but no one arrived to fix this  The place is not at all worth of the money  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE   They didnt let us know about the air conditioning issue  Fixing the addressed problems and being nice to the customers  
632304466,This stay was disappointing   Wifi didn u    t work and host was unresponsive   The host forgot to approval my reservation after check in time

621153530,I will not personally ever recommend this place  Horrible experience  Very strict building to be in  No personal space  Room photos look smaller in person  If you want fresh air theres no windows that can be open in this room  Horrible security  Horrible property manager  Just save your time and headache away from this place

624544419,Well I paid for my place little did I know they gave me wrong codes answered my text or my emails with automated responses and then at the very end they offered me     of my money back which I thought was a joke if I gave them     of their apartment back after renting it they would not have been very happy about that but since Im a great guest and I always leave my places in excellent condition  why would they think I would be happy with that offer
714125531,They cancelled my reservation hours before I was supposedly to get there  They cited  maintenance issues   I asked what kind of maintenance issues they were and why they would take all five of the days that I had reserved  They had no answer  I had to settle for another place  as it was the last minute and I needed a place to stay  Very stressful and disappointing 
629613866,Do not stay here  Entry box was broken and I couldnt get in  Host owner called me back two hours later and called me a fucken bitch because I was unhappy that I was locked out  I am   months pregnant and drove    hours to attend my sisters funeral only to be cussed out  lose money and not have anywhere to stay  I am devastated  Go out of business  This was listed as luxury  upscale  Instead the box was broken and I couldn u    t get into building   Box was broken  Called the owner host for access  Im  months pregnant and drove    hours for a funeral  Only to be called a fucken bitch when I called the host owner and was threatened by him as well  I ended up not having a place to stay during the trip  Owner called me a fucken bitch and hung up on me when I called because the box was broken and I couldnt access unit Owner was rude  irate and unorganized  Called me back hours later only to blame me for not accessing the unit  Called me a bitch and threatened me  Place is run down and entry box is broken  I took pictures so there is proof  I was never able to stay in the unit and lost money and had nowhere to stay for my sisters funeral 
672958151,  
672974944,The place was comfortable for one person not two and if your not from here its in a bad area The place was comfortable for one person not two The key was not in the box we had to go through a whole thing just to check in
658523246,There were a  multitude of issues that werent addressed  First and foremost  this place is advertised with AC but that is not the case  The unit in the living room is so tiny  it doesnt even cool off the living room and attached kitchen adequately  When I brought this up  I was told by Zencity that they would have maintenance come and install at least   AC unit  if not   in the two bedrooms  The way the place is set up  the bedrooms are down a hallway from the living area   there is no way in hell this tiny unit would be able to cool the bedrooms  The towel rack was broken  They said maintenance would also fix that  MAINTENANCE NEVER CAME  We slept on the floor of the living room because the bedrooms were so hot  Which caused me to have neck and back pain  Its one thing to have an issue  its another to make promises and not deliver  They also said that there was a fan in the closet   there was no fan when we got home on Friday night  We found   blood stains on the rug and a used condom wrapper on the floor of one bedroom  We had issues checking in as there was no key to the building in the lockbox nor instructions on the alternate way of getting into the building  Also  after sleeping on the floor and picking up the comforter to clean up the space  it was filthy underneath  I dont think the floor has been vacuumed in some time which made me even more nervous because of covid  While they were timely in their responses to my concerns  none of them were actually fixed  Their solution was to let us leave on Saturday and get a small refund  not even     saying it didnt  seem like a good match   We were there for a funeral and did not have the time or the mental space to search for another place and move all of our things  This is the first time Ive had a negative experience with Airbnb  I still love Airbnb but definitely not this place  You need to get your stuff together  One problem after another  that you did not address  You made promises that were not kept  Im very disappointed   There is a tiny AC unit in the living room that was so small and weak  it did not even cool the living room and attached kitchen adequately  The way the space is set up  the two bedrooms are down the hall from the living room   there is NO WAY even a high end AC unit would be able to get to them  When I called about it  I was told that maintenance would come and install at least   unit  if not   in each of the bedrooms  Maintenance never came  I was told via messenger that there was a fan in the closet that we could certainly use and when I returned  there was no fan either  Maintenance did not come on Friday when we checked in nor Saturday  I did not sleep well either night as we slept on the floor   and in fact  had neck and back pain   There was no key to the building front door in the lockbox  There were detailed instructions on getting the key to getting in the front door to actually getting inside the unit  But there was no key to the front door  I re read the instructions a few times and finally called ZenCity  I was told the  code  to get into the building after waiting on hold and waiting in the heat outside  If their instructions were so detailed  why werent they updated in the instructions  They later told me that the last tenant  took the key   I dont believe that for a minute  We found a used condom wrapper on the floor of one of the bedrooms  Because the AC didnt work  we slept on the floor in the living room and when I picked up the comforter  it was filthy on the bottom which means it hadnt been vacuumed in some time  This of course  is a concern during the time of covid  We found   blood stains on the carpet in the living room  the towel rack in the bathroom fell off when we put a towel on it  Communication was good and somewhat timely but it was all lies  They promised maintenance would come with   AC units and would fix the towel rack  That never happened  Its one thing to have issues which can happen  its another to make promises and not deliver on said issues  Its completely unprofessional  If you advertise AC  then there should be adequate AC which there wasnt  Every host should be cleaning more than thoroughly with covid in the air  If there is a problem  fix it   they just made a bunch of empty promises  This was the worst Airbnb experience Ive ever had  Truly disappointed  The  solution  they had was attempt to kick us out on Saturday before our departing day of Sunday  saying  it wasnt a good fit   We were there for a funeral   there was no time or energy to look for a new place and move all of our things in between going to the wake and funeral  How about you just deliver on what you promise  I believe we should get a     refund for the problems we had   Airbnb was not helpful either 
635512070,Pending    Follow up contact was less than desirable 
633015624,I would never suggest booking with this host  They are very dishonest and will not respond to legit concerns  Our place did not have lights in the bathroom for   days  They never came out to fix it  We had to use our phones as flashlights to shower  They told us that it was not an emergency  Who does that   There was only one set of towels for   adults  Our reservation got changed a day before we came into town  I tried reaching out to the host only to be ignored  They are very shady and I will never stay at their properties in the future  They ruined my first time in St  Louis  Also the photos that they post is all smoke and mirrors  The place is sooooo much smaller than the pictures depict  Cheaply made furniture and there was damage to the property as soon as we got there  The bathroom had a dirty tub and dried up poop stuck on the toilet  Renters Beware     You guys suck  You ruined me and my friends first visit to St  Louis  I will never be back  I hope you all are happy with my hard earned money  Businesses like yours will never prosper because all you care about is money and not the actual person  I saved up for months for this trip just to have it ruined  I hope you can sleep well at night knowing how you operate your business   Our booking got switched the day we came into town  This was not our original booking  They moved us from the heart of downtown to the   Hood    They would not respond to any messages about the mix up  We were forced to stay there because they only wanted to refund less than half of our money  I will definitely be contacting the Better Business Bureau about this host and Air B B   There was dried up hard poop in the toilet that must have been there a while  The tub was dirty as well  We actually had to go out and buy tissue paper as well as extra towels  We had no lights in the bathroom for three days  They told us that it was not an emergency and that they wouldnt be able to fix it  We had to shower and get dressed using our phones as flashlights  I was hosting this trip for my friends  can you imagine how embarrassing this whole experience was    The placed us in a bad neighborhood  This was not the original listing that I signed up for  I paid almost      to stay   days in a cramped  dirty  dark apartment  I will never rent with Zencity again  I took so many pictures to back up what took place  I also have every screenshot from the constant contact that I tried to make with the host  Very unprofessional and dismissive 
634334623,Do not book  You will get a roulette of apartments none of which will be cleaned  Do yourself a favor  dont book with Zencity  Wow   This is not the unit I booked on air bnb  This is a false advertisement with no contact with the host what so ever   Pet hair and other hair all over the apartment including the bathroom and bed sheets  Microwave had red sauce splatter all over it 
634255763,If you want to wait outside the unit for an hour and have soaking wet carpet that smells awful this is the place for you  The only thing that was good about this Airbnb was the kitchen  I suggest making sure everything actually works and smells nice in your units before giving them to visitors  Carpet was soaking wet and left an awful smell  and air conditioning did not work   Lock did not work to get into unit  Had to wait an hour to be switched to a different unit that seemed like they just cleaned while we were waiting  I would reccomend this place be listed at    
670210965,Unfortunately  we had a male use the key code we had to come into the house and as two sisters staying there  it was very unsettling  The next morning we also found cockroaches  If these two incidents were taken care of and prevented  then I would recommend this place but cannot until this is dealt with  We had a man break into the house using the same key code that you gave us  He came into the house and closed the door before we got over to the stairs and he let us know he was in the wrong house  While this seemed to be an innocent mistake  there have been people who use this approach to check to see if a house is a good place to come back to and burglarize  My sister and I did not feel safe in this house after that and its very concerning that someone else would have the same key code that we did to this place  I messaged you immediately and never heard a response which is also very disappointing   The next morning we also found cockroaches in the kitchen drawers  the brown banded ones  Im not sure why we would be paying an     cleaning fee  which Im sure each customer is paying and still find cockroaches in a house   Both of these were very disappointing because both of us were very excited to stay and were ready to book again until these two incidents occurred  Had cockroaches in multiple drawers in the kitchen  Check in communication was great  I however did not get any response to my concerns about someone breaking into the house 
651044591,The apartment is smelly   elevator is dirty   nasty   common area is just horrendous  Parking is difficult to find   street parking   I paid      for two horrible nights  Read the cleaning fee and parking accommodations before renting   not worth it   
650182512,Do not rent from these people They are liars and deceivers  What they advertise is a lie  I have a medical condition which excludes me for the governor of wearing a mask I went into the building and was thrown out of the  building because I couldnt wear a mask  They did not tell me this  Nothing was open as they advertise it was  And they wanted to charge my account without my approval when I never stayed in the room  Beware there are plenty of places do not spend it with these people they will steal your money and will not give you a refund  Beware You are the worst place I have ever engaged  Your lies and your deception will catch up with you  Taking money from peoples accounts and lying to them is unacceptable and it will come back to you   They lied about everything they advertised nothing was open  Terrible just terrible They lied about everything they advertised just terribleTerrible No  These people lied about this place  False advertisement  I never stayed at the place and yet they still wanted to charge me on my credit card and I never authorized it  Dont stay with these people
651009021,Be very wary when booking your stay  Online description does not fit  Very rude and unhelpful  They will not assist you to make your stay comfortable especially during hard times No comment Was in a wrong listing
636931679,Make sure WiFi works before you check in  mine didnt work for a entire   night stay  Also be weary of a heavy smell in the bathroom from something unknown   No WiFi  dirty dishes were unexpected  also who would expect a stinky bathroom  Dirty dishes stain on sheet on arrival  stinky bathroom Working WiFi and not a stench in the bathroom of mold or something dead
641163310,DO NOT BOOK HERE   Host is unhelpful and apartment was not clean  This was the worst experience I have ever encountered on Airbnb   To add to my frustration I saw that multiple other guests had posted similar issues regarding cleanliness   I booked this at an advertised      night and was charged         night  Room was not clean Dirty dishes in dishwasher and in cupboard   Stains on walls  doors  cabinets   Food debris and trash on floor around and under couch   Hairballs on the floor by the bed   Pubic hair on walls of shower  Marty was evasive in his responses and unproductive in solving the problems Clean conditions  responsive host  amenities that demonstrated the host actually wanted their guest to feel comfortable   No detergent for the dishwasher or washing machine
622155959,Wouldnt recommend this unit   AC is malfunctioning in bedroom and dust was so bad that I had to turn off both AC units   Literally got a sore throat from only staying inside unit during quarantine   And couldnt sleep with windows open by of downtown traffic noise Checked in about issues with ac unit and dust in heater   No response   Can not recommend this unit and contacting AirBNB for resolution
641165332,WARNING  For our entire stay the apartment flooded   There was a lot of water that was coming in from the walls and eventually went into the master bedroom and completely soaked the carpet to the point we couldnt walk on it  The hallway was filled with water  The host never once fixed the issue  They said they would get maintenance there and never did  We had to deal with the flooding and actually use our own towels to clean it up since there was not enough   The host is now ignoring my messages despite sending them proof of all the flooding  which they have known about since another guest stated it flooded during their stay as well  I would highly recommend staying somewhere else as this may flood during your stay as well   and the host is not in any rush to help fix it or make it right  It is clear they do not care about their guests safety satisfaction  Horrible experience  I will not be booking with ZenCity again  Instead of trying to make money  put your guests firsts  I have tried to be patient and kind to you throughout this experience and your company has done nothing but ignore the fact you allowed us to stay in a flooded apartment and did NOTHING to help us  You refuse to provide us a refund and ignore my messages  I will never rent from your company again  Host was not concerned at all about the flooding issue happening in our apartment during our stay   was told there was nothing we could do as the apartment hallway completely flooded as well as bedroom floor was soaking wet  Did not even provide extra towels as we had to use our own to clean it up  Never once sent maintenance and never once tried to refund us for all the issues  The host knew of flooding issues happening in the apartment from January and still has this place listed knowing it may flood when it rains 
640108989,A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet  A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet   A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet   When I communicated to the Host about the room they stopped replying  False Advertisement Not worth the stay 
659659784,RODENT INFESTATION    UNCLEAN    UNSAFE    TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE    Mouse seen in the kitchen  Rodent traps already placed in the utility closet  Sticky floors  Dirty walls  Towels smelled like cigarette smoke  No salt  pepper  or cooking oil provided as advertised  I am still waiting for a call from management that I was told would happen  and my refund for staying in a rodent infested apartment Stopped responding to issue altogether Good location  Being clean and having described amenities would have helped
661173417,No WiFi the whole stay  Couldnt work  couldnt use Netflix or any streaming service  The apartment smelled like sewage every single night to the point we didnt even want to be in our room    However the location cannot be beat  Hoping for them that this just happened to be an off week   
645461541,Let me first start by saying that i hadnt checked into my stay until       PM on July   st        and I checked in with a very pleasant woman    The walls themselves were dirty and we noticed the second we walked in  but we didnt pay much attention  When i walked into the bedroom the towels were dingy and hair hair in them  The shower curtain was yellow and orange  with hair in the shower as well  There were dirty handprints above the bed I was expected to sleep in  In The kitchen  the sponge was not replaced so I can only imagine how dirty the dishes were  In the unc leaned freezer  the ice tray was half full and look as if it was used as an ashtray or something   the previous occupants left   uncased beer  And the microwave was BARELY in working condition  There was a fist print in the refrigerator and the A C was not dusted  Immediately upon noticing all of these things  I contacted a Zencity rep through the Airbnb app and he had me send pictures and seemed as if he wanted to be helpful  It was going smooth until I was told that he  didnt understand what was wrong from the pictures that I sent  so I called  While on hold on the FIRST call  I walked downstairs to speak with the lady that I checked in with  but she was no longer there there was a young man and he was very helpful he provided me a different number  One that I hadnt called already  I got a little further this call  they told me they they would have a property manager call me  I ATTEMPTED to express my concerns with him   frustrated  YES  frantic  YES because it was very hard to even get to speak with him  He immediately cut me off and said  maam  maam   you need to calm down  and proceeded to tell me how he had complaints about me harassing and threatening door staff   which NEVER happened  Even after everything was settled I spoke with the gentleman who only gave me a phone number and was MORE than compassionate and understanding  the Property manager that I spoke with  Gary  told me that security was notified of these false allegations and that they were going to come up and  AND I QUOTE   DRAG me off the property  Im not sure if thats how they run their business but I want no parts and I dont want anyone else to have to encounter this unprofessional business    Not to mention the time i was lied to    When speaking with the Zencity rep through the AirBNB app  he told me that the room was cleaned THE DAY that I checked in            but the whiteboard posted had the date           on it      All in all AirBNB was extremely helpful in getting me my money back  he was friendly and responded to me in a very timely manner so that i wasnt without somewhere to stay my first night in Chicago  He even gave me a voucher for my next stay  So i was satisfied in the end 
662439756,So first of all let me just say the place is beautiful but it absolutely is not what they have shown in the pictures   The whole entire layout is different and it looks like theres a balcony but there is not  Second of all I got there and the air conditioning didnt work at all  I reached out to the host and they said they would contact maintenance and bring me fans  They also said they would give me a partial refund for my inconvenience  I NEVER RECEIVED EITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS  It was    degrees In Kansas City when I arrived  I was literally drenched in sweat before I even unpacked a single thing  In the beginning the host was very responsive and I truly thought I would get at least the fans and hopefully my  partial refund  that THEY suggested to give me  I honestly am so disappointed in the way they handled this situation because I have stayed in a different air bnb through Zencity and didnt have a single issue so I thought the experience would be great  Honestly  if they would have at least brought the fans I wouldnt be so upset  It was soooo not  They have been ignoring me ever since I checked out and have yet to give me my refund as promised  I do not understand why they handled this the way they did but I definitely wont be booking any more AirBnBs through these people  The location was great though  very close to everything but thats about it  You guys are so unprofessional for the way you handled my stay  No air conditioning  it never got fixed and you said you would bring me fans and give me a partial refund and I never received either of those things  I will be notifying Air BNB and figuring out how I can get my refund because this is absolutely ridiculous
662410507,This was our  st First booking with Airbnb  Considering Covid   and the disclaimers stating additional cleaning will be done  That was Not the case  We had to use our Clorox cleaning wipes to clean the bathrooms  the kitchen  the refrigerator Ect  The floors were not clean  The rug wasnt vacuumed  There was a dirty air filter in the laundry room just sitting there for who knows how long  The corners of the bathrooms havent been cleaned in a longtime  There were chip bags under the beds  I reached out to Zencity provided pictures and they said theres nothing they can do  They charge a cleaning fee but the apartment wasnt cleaned for our stay  After several calls and emails they said they cant do anything  All I asked is to be refunded the cleaning fee  They refuse to make this right  I will Not be booking with this company again  Waiting for Stuart which is a supervisor to contact me back   This was our  st First booking with Airbnb  Considering Covid   and the disclaimers stating additional cleaning will be done  That was Not the case  We had to use our Clorox cleaning wipes to clean the bathrooms  the kitchen  the refrigerator  The floors were not clean  The rug wasn u    t vacuumed  There was a dirty air filter in the laundry room just sitting there  The corners of the bathrooms haven u    t been cleaned in a longtime  There were chip bags under the beds  I reached out to Zencity provided pictures and they said there u    s nothing they can do  They charge a cleaning fee but the apartment wasn u    t cleaned for our stay  After several calls and emails they said they can u    t do anything  All I asked is to be refunded the cleaning fee  They refuse to make this right  I will Not be booking with this company again   They blew me off by saying well investigate and get back to you  That never happened and they knew they werent going to help me  They even stalled so I cant even get help from Airbnb  This is not okay all  Just be honest with people  We spent over        for our   day stay  Honesty goes along way  You shouldnt waist peoples time
619430171,The place was a mess from the previous guests  Obviously the cleaners didnt come through  I contacted the host and didnt get a reply until I contacted air bnb directly  He assured me the cleaners would come the next day  we had to scramble to find a place to stay somewhere else the first night because there was no clean bedding or towels or detergent to wash them  In the morning he again did not reply to my messages about a refund for the first night or when I also asked what time the cleaners would be by because they still werent there by       pm  He didnt respond until I contacted air bnb directly again and they got me a new place to stay and a full refund  Air bnb came through and helped me out a lot but I can not say that for the host here
661296240,The apartment is a basement apartment where the bedroom window was left open  the window screen was up and was not able to be locked which is concerning   The apartment otherwise was fine  but I couldnt get past the safety concern with anyone being able to have access into the bedroom of this apartment   I left and stayed in a hotel but was still charged the price for the majority of the stay for my booking   which should not be the case as I left for safety concerns   The apartment is a basement apartment where the bedroom window was left open and was not able to be locked which is concerning   poor customer service when I had a safety concern with the host
441075293,This was by far my worst AirBnB experience and I can only advise everybody else to not make the same mistake and book the apartment   The entire apartment was extremely unhygienic and dirty   there were hairs and even traces of food in both of the beds  In addition  the floor had obviously not been cleaned and the table in the living room was so dirty that we couldnt even put our things on it   When I informed Zencity about these issues  they did not take any action  regardless of the exorbitant price that we paid for the apartment  Once I brought attention to this problem again  they stopped replying at all  so dont except any cooperation or assistance from their side  Is that how you treat your customers   The final disappointed happened the day of our check out  We were supposed to leave at    am  However  Zencitys cleaning staff entered the apartment about half an hour earlier without a warning  At that time  I was coming right out of the shower  covered with nothing but a towel  I felt extremely violated in my privacy   All in all  our stay has been beyond terrible and I certainly cant recommend neither the apartment nor the host  I am still waiting to hear back from you 
660334756,If safety  cleanliness and communication is important to you I wouldnt suggest booking  Photos are deceiving  I left and canceled Not even knowing where I would go  But I knew I wasnt going to stay there  Please take the time to go to place and look around  Would you want your family Coming from out of town to stay here or experience  bad communication or for place to not be ready at time stated on booking  I suggest serious upgrade s including entry and inform people to be careful in this area  Cleaning is so important especially during this COVID   times and I m disappointed that this is Not top priority with your company   The photos in add don u    t show stains dirty window and the bad area  Thank  I asked for early check in since I was driving from out of town when i booked  Didnt get a response so I assumed it was alright  I was told I couldnt and place wouldnt be ready at the time stated I could check in  They would notify me  They didnt notify me at all I have photos of sofa  with stains carpet  stains   walls need painting  Windows dirty  There is a wire going across the floor that is so dangerous  We were getting bit by bugs  Rust around shower in bathroom  In need of upgrade and  TLC  Horrible at communicating  Question s asked at booking NOT answered  Even asked several times with no response i was told they would notify me when place was ready  Sat out front for        No response Area looks very unsafe  People around and going in and out of building  suspicious  looking  Dirty and not so neat looking surroundings  For the area and the looks of the place   dirty furniture and carpet  price was a little high  I expected  better 
616391083,Horrible host  not worth the money for the smell  broken toilet and dirty sunken couch  Dont recommend zen city at all stay away  Overlooked and ignored my questions 
717288295,Unsanitary bathroom and bedroom  Small and large hairs all over the shower  clearly not cleaned   Small and large hairs all over the linen  Not cleaned properly   Cleaning supplies found in the place were  fresheners   No laundry soap for the washer  Likely does not have proper cleaning supplies  ex laundry detergent  to clean between stays  Hot water for shower did not work well  Had to cancel stay    Host did let me retrieve forgotten item   Hot water in shower did not work  Unsanitary bathroom and bedroom  Small and large hairs all over the shower  clearly not cleaned   Small and large hairs all over the linen  Not cleaned properly   Cleaning supplies found in the place were  fresheners   No laundry soap for the washer  Likely does not have proper cleaning supplies  ex laundry detergent  to clean between stays  Poor insulation Had to get a full refund through Airbnb because owner was not willing to fulfill request  Hot water in shower did not work  Wanted us to clean  Very very unsanitary

672163291,AirBnB ers  please beware of this apartment  If your intention is to stay at a place that is clean this is not the place to stay  The bed linens were infested with hair from previous occupants  not just the one before us  but throughout the existence of this air bnb   They also smelled of body odor  The bathrooms were DIRTY with stains and hairs  It seemed as if the counter tops had not even been wiped down  There was an awful stench throughout the apartment  almost of sewage   The walls and baseboards are dirty and full of dust  The overall condition of the apartment is filthy and not worth a penny of your money  The views through the  very tall  windows are inaccessible if youre below    but beautiful if you meet the height requirement just be careful  you might inhale a dead bug from the windowsill s  that was never wiped away  The host does not respond quickly  The location is great  but the apartment is not worth the location  Inaccurate description of the cleanliness of the apartment   The photos depicted a clean space but that is not at all what my family and I walked in to   Bed sheets were full of hair  Sofa had multiple stains and hairs  Bathrooms were not wiped clean  The tubs had multiple stains from the previous occupants  The window sills were full of dead bugs  The walls and baseboards were dirty and full of dust  The entire apartment had an awful stench  Spider webs in numerous corners of the apartment  Delayed responses Accuracy of description and cleanliness of the space
660246068,Booked for two nights   stayed less than an hour due to  critters  as he calls it on the pillow  I was told to cancel my booking which would result in me receiving none of my money back for a place I didnt even stay in  Besides the bugs the place is beautiful 
659124602,Great view and location but needs deep cleaned badly  I had to send in many pictures of uncleanliness  The sheets in one of the bedrooms had pubic and strands of hair on them  Upon arrival  we were forces to wash the linen to both of the beds  sweep floors  and clean spider webs from the walls and window ceilings  Lots of scuff marks on the walls  The location and scenery outdoors were amazing  Unfortunately  the place needs some deep cleaning and a new couch  The couch is filthy and we had to place a comforter on it before sitting on it  It was disgusting 
633653625,Dont expect much
717300131,Do not rent from them   I was giving crappy check in instructions then asked cancel with the print of full refund only to be scammed       You wrong for not giving me my   back knowing I never stepped foot on your place but its ok because nothing good will come your way for scamming me        Wasn u    t replying right away  Check in didnt work   days straight   The host had me to cancel stating Id get my full refund only to then not agree to give it back   I never stepped foot inside here  still did not get my   back   I had to call more then once to get response   No parking Horrible host money hungry 
717719008,Th hey had damages to the apartment and blamed me for it and the host kept messaging about a party and there was only me and my sisters there  He disturbed us the entire time  I was bothered all night about things already discussed before the booking  The couch and chairs were broken
627469989,Not bad place  Thought it was a little bigger  Went in the middle of a riot but over all  Its a pretty decent place We called zencity and told about our issue and they told us they cant do anything about it We was in the middle of the riot downtown in st  Louis tried to call and let some one know  Nobody even got back with me  We didnt stay out second night and had to going somewhere else to sleep
610540497,Unsafe practices  other people had access to my unit  belongings were moved and an item stolen    Stay at your own risk  Your company utilizes unsafe business practices and seems to care very little about guest safety 
719460988,Great location  STOP   No heat for   days except for a on bedroom space heart   Freezing   Workers can two different times   Could not fix first time night  Finally got it working the  rd day but left the work mess    Loud clanging radiators all through the night  like a bunch of spoons rolling around in a dryer  that were trying to work but didnt  Unbearably loud   Arrived to dirty dishwasher  soiled living room furniture  toilets that take two flushes to get  residue  down the chute  door knobs coming off    I mean  yes the location is great but this entire experience has been more than disappointing  This place was NOT ready to rent   no heat  old apartment   Dishwasher had a lot of caked on food in its   the couch and chair in living room were soiled 
717986524,Checked in very late after driving    hours  still couldnt find it in me to stay  Absolute filth  The lockbox was jammed  instructions complex  parking was scarce  neighborhood sketch  but the icing on the shit cake was the condo itself  Floors have never been mopped  carpets had NEVER been vacuumed  Toilet had pee in it and wouldnt flush  It felt like someone had left their dirty house unexpectedly and then we checked in  The tv was on  couch was clearly recently slept on  dirty laundry in the bedrooms  Trash in the cans and they had the nerve to leave one piece of paper on the paper towel roll as decoration  AVOID THIS PLACE   
718098013,Really wish it was a better experience for my first interaction with Zencity   The pictures implicated that the room was a lot bigger  The room was unacceptable and the guest were put to blame  Upon arrival the house keeper didnt have us booked at all the room was wrecked there were blades on the floor the microwave was dirty the washer was filled with dirty dishes there was a black sticky substance on the toilet seat and water stains on the counter top and mirrors   Sprayed but not wiped 
717715230,I would not recommend this company or property to anyone  Horrible holiday trip for the amount of money I spent  One issue after another with no response from any member of management  Pictures are deceiving  waste of time and money for my daughter and I   There was one towel  it actually had shampoo and conditioner  There was no working lights in bedroom or working ceiling fan  The bed sheets were a wrinkled mess  There was no extra pillows  sheets or even an extra blanket  The pictures clearly were better than in actuality    For the most part it was clean  Not sure when the last person has stayed there so it maybe have been sitting  There was trash in bathroom area  bathtub was dirty and there was trash under the bed  Broken blinds in living area  so I was unable to open or pull up blinds so it was pretty dark inside  I called several times to let management know about problems and I was very unhappy with room  I was told he was in a meeting  which apparently lasted the entire day  This was a terrible night that got worse in the am  To begin my holiday stay I was welcomed by an elevator that did not allow me to use it so I end up waking seven flights of stairs to my room  This continues as trip is still in progress  Several people were and called with no response except manager was in a meeting  I tried to reach out to remedy the issues and find a new place however no one has responded to my emails or calls  It is very inconvenient to deal with all the issues when a large amount of money was paid  Tried to enjoy a holiday trip  instead Im stuck here till I checkout  I wouldnt recommend Zencity  unfortunately I didnt research the properties or the company 
413518084,The Good   Apartment was in a great location in Hyde Park  I was visiting UChicago and it was an easy walk to campus  with several restaurants  cafes  and a drug store also nearby  Accessing the apartment was easy  with clear instructions and a lockbox in place  Zencity was prompt and helpful with communication throughout the process  and was quick to answer any questions or concerns I might have  The apartment was well stocked with amenities  including an iron  a steamer  a lint roller  extra towels  etc  It is well sized for one or two individuals with a small gas stove  a full sized refrigerator  and a small breakfast nook  I enjoyed the low key decorating style    The Bad   Water pressure in the bathroom wasnt great I usually ended up washing my hands in the bathtub because the waterflow in the sink was frustratingly slow  There was some hair around the bathtub and toilet  which didnt bother me  but I can imagine other future guests may be particular about that  As other reviewers have noted  the lighting in the main room is unusual the kitchen lights need to be on to use the outlets on the far side of the apartment  which is where the television is located  This wasnt a problem for me  but again  I can imagine other guests wanting to be able to watch television without the lights on or wanting to watch TV right before they go to sleep    The Ugly   My phone charger and headphones inexplicably went missing on my second day here   The room came stocked with a phone charger  and a charitable explanation would be that someone came in while I was gone to retrieve that charger and accidentally mistook my charger for that one  It is also POSSIBLE that I may have put my headphones in my pocket and subsequently lost them outside of the apartment  I think this is the most likely explanation for how both items ended up missing   A less charitable explanation would be that someone deliberately took two items that were placed right inside the door of my room      I spoke with the Zencity management about this  and they assured me that no one on their crew came into my room while I was staying there  And I can understand how ridiculous this sounds from their perspective  if someone told me that his phone charger went missing  I would assume he had misplaced it and it was somewhere in his bag  or hed left it in the bathroom  or left it at Starbucks or something  But I am clinically OCD about my stuff  I rarely misplace things  let alone lose them  and I spent several hours scouring the apartment  unpacking my luggage over and over again  and even sorting through the trash can multiple times in an effort to find these items  I am quite confident that I do not have these items  and I am genuinely perplexed as to how they went missing  It seems unlikely that anyone on a cleaning crew or a landlord with an extra key would take the time to come into my room and take these two small things  But any other possible explanations I can think of a burglary with no signs of forced entry  A previously unknown occasion of sleepwalking where I took these items outside the apartment  seem even more far fetched   I dont mean to be throwing around reckless accusations  I chose this apartment because it was well reviewed  and it sounds like most guests have had a really positive time staying here  But this was my experience  I left feeling uncomfortable and unnerved that someone had gone through my stuff  This is the first time when using Airbnb in which I feel like my trust has been violated  and while I dont think it was prompted by any personal animus again  I think the most likely explanation is that someone came into my room and took my phone charger by mistake I would not stay here again  Some hair in the shower  and around the toilet base 
622529890,Place was listed as non smoking  Terrible smoke smell and cigarette butts in this apartment  Bed sheets stained  Hair in bathroom sink  Leftover food in refrigerator which stunk  Reached out twice  no resolve was ever offered  Very disappointed  Will never stay with Zencity again  Asked for partial refund  no response  Refrigerator had food in it and stunk  Bed sheets had stains  Cigarette butts and suppose to be non smoking apartment  Reached out to host twice to explain situation of place smelling  like smoke  First response was  okay  thanks for letting me know    no resolve  Second time I contacted host  no response 
479941797,Trash place no parking 
666867196,I have stayed with Zencity now a handful of times  hoping the experience would eventually get better since the properties are so beautiful  It becomes obvious that their customer service is ran by an automated response system   you very rarely get to talk to an actual person  There have been occasions where Ive actually called instead of messaging   never actually spoke to a person  On all of my stays but one  I have received the check in information as much as   hours after the check in time  As well as checking into an apartment only to realize that its a completely different home than advertised without the promised amenities  I advise you to save the time   hassle  For very similar pricing you can find equally if not better listings in the area  Stay away from Zencity  You can find better deals staying at hotel in the same area
632600899,This was worst experience with Airbnb  The bed had hair all over I asked for new sheets and even those  looked nasty     there were no pots or pans to cook with no even a dish towel     no paper towels in the kitchen      there was no dish soap or dish towel to clean off the couple plates they had        I would like a full refund because this was just the worst really  This was hair all over the bed and I asked for new sheet and even those where unclean If the bed was clean 
434804845,I would have forgiven several thigs and given a five star review because the bedroom was nice  but they tried to charge me      for some cheap chair I never touched   Room was nice but building was a little run down and sketchy overall  Told me I couldnt check in early because the space needed to be cleaned    then the bathroom wasnt clean  hair on the floor and in the bath shower Quick to response until I refused to pay      for a cheap particle board chair I didnt use strange part of town would have given five starts anyway if they didnt try to charge me      for a chair I didnt break
669935197,I would NOT recommend this apartment to anyone  I was looking for a modern cozy apartment  but this was anything but that  The apartment did NOT look like the pictures that were posted  It was outdated and misrepresented  According  to Zencity the place recently underwent a renovation which is why the pictures differ from actual apartment  However  the said  renovations  made the apartment look worse  The apartment was not clean to my satisfaction  The apartment window seals were dirty and the blinds were COVERED with dust  The toilet was broken  I have a video  and a light was blew out in the bathroom  The apartment is located in CWE  loved that  but they are doing construction  Construction workers wake you up at the crack of dawn  if youre in to that kind of thing   GO FOR IT   The people who represented Zencity were anything  but helpful  They were snippy and rude  You can see them argue with customers in the review comments under other postings  You can count on that they ARENT going to do the right thing by their customers  All they can offer you are excuses and insincere apologies  Do not book with Zencity   If you are looking to rent here RUN     A total catfish  This apartment looks NOTHING like the pictures  which the exception of the sheets on the bed  Next to the cleanliness  THIS WAS MY BIGGEST CONCERN  They lure you in with a modern look  but the apartment has anything but that  I u    m unable to upload pics of the actual apartment  When I notified Zencity of my concern they stated the apartment had recent renovations  I thought renovations where supposed to make spaces look better   not worse  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE      The apartment was not cleaned to my satisfaction  The window seals were dirty and the blinds were so dirty that they were gray instead of white  When I brought this up to Zencity  they did not see it as a concern and advised me that this was the apartment that I booked  Zencity is RUDE and unapologetic  As you can see on other posts they like to argue with their customers and point the finger  No responsibility  Location is not horrible because it is in the CWE  but they are doing construction and you can here it every morning at the crack of dawn  If you are looking for a getaway to get rest   dont stay here  The apartment looking as host presented in photos 
700265059,Honestly a great Airbnb in a beautiful are  alittle far from the airport and from the tourist spots but still a great deal  My only problem was the rude staff and waiting hours to check in just to be told  people have lunch breaks you know 
555294053,The location was great but we ended up getting locked out of our loft for some reason that no one cannot explain  The host blaimed the loft manager for the locks they left on but also said it was not the first time it happened  We had to pay a locksmith to break in the lock so we can get in  I think its horrible that we did not get a refund for paying the locksmith  We waited for almost   hours with   babies just for the host  to tell us he couldnt let us in  He promised a refund for the Saturday night but I asked about it He ignored my messages and this wont be the end of it  We also tried to get our clothes back that we left in the dryer  and he only responded back one time and after that we heard nothing back  I tried calling and no answer nor call back  So now we are also stuck with no refund or our clothes back  Get your stuff in order and more organized  Im sorry this had to go this route but I refuse to let it be unnoticed I think its horrible that we did not get a refund for paying the locksmith  We waited for almost   hours with   babies just for your company to tell us you couldnt let us in  You ignored my messages and this wont be the end of it  We also tried to get our clothes back and you only responded back one time and after that we heard nothing back  I tried calling and no answer nor call back  Get your stuff in order and more organized  Im sorry this had to go this route but I refuse to let it be unnoticed Got locked out room  was stuck outside for almost   hours with my wife and       year old then WE had to pay      to a locksman to break in the loft because the  handyman  the host sent had no idea how to get us in  And they refused to refund us or pay us back When we asked about our refund to pay us back to get inside theyre loft they did not respond back AT ALL and we forgot clothes in the dryer and tried to set something up to get them but they only responded once and after that would not respond anymore so we are stuck without those clothes
611321709,If you want to be harassed every time you walk into the building this is the place for you 
628922820,Good location Not a great space if youre not a fan of roaches CockRoach Still waiting on a response for a refund  I had to leave after being there only a couple hours because there was a huge cockroach in the bathroom
628349360,This guy accused me of all kinds of stuff that wasnt true tried to blame me for his broken window and accused me of absurd things then wanted to request more money from me    for the maid to have to wash a few dishes when I was rushed out with people knocking at the door at       I paid a cleaning fee once and would have cleaned the few dishes had I not been rushed out at           I dont know if hes just hurting for money or what his deal is but I was shocked and appalled
708541466,Our stay at Zencity was very short lived  Upon entering the apartment  the tables  toilets  walls and flooring were not clean  The whole place smelled horrible because the dishwasher was full of water and dishes  We had to leave right after when checked in related to the poor conditions  Although we did have great and expeditious responses from customer service  we still were not fully refunded what we originally paid  I would not consider renting from zencity in the future  I wanted to say thank for your quick response and customer service  but this apartment really needs some upkeep and deep cleaning performed before it is rented out again  I am also upset that I lost one night on my refund  But I was pleased with the quick responses from Marty   The photos made the place look clean and upscale  When in reality  it was the complete opposite   The tables  toilets  walls and floors were disgusting  The whole place smelled like dead fish because the dishwasher was full of water and dishes  It was absolutely not worth the listed price 
311173223,We moved out after night   of a planned   night stay due to cleanliness and maintenance issues  Situation made good by Airbnb after only a small refund offered by the host     Property was still being serviced when we arrived to check in
344408147,There was a terrifying domestic disturbance in the apartment next door  The police came and diffused the situation but according to the other neighbor  this happens all the time  There was no WiFi and the  owner  of the Airbnb told us several times the WiFI was fixed when it wasnt  This is the problem with these Airbnbs that are one of many owned by the same company  The actual owner lives far away from the property and has several people who work for them  making it near impossible to get issues resolved  Thanks for nothing   Zen City   The host gave us inaccurate information over and over again 
571832075,An odd place to stay  Felt very bare with not much on the walls and an odd style which seemed like they valued the look of he furniture vs  the actual comfort  Check was easy and no direct need to communicate with the host  Location has good access to the L  Random  but all the light switches and toilet were rather low to the ground  Just a note for taller individuals  Could have been better with more things on the walls  Felt very bare   Not sure what was up with this place  but everything was set up for a human of a smaller stature   Check in was easy and instructions were clear  Generally clean  Both the sink and shower were clogged  Never communicated  But also didnt need to  Location was good  For the feel and dynamic of this place  I did not think this was a good value  Couch was terribly uncomfortable to sit on 
710962860,This place was the worst AirBnB experience I have ever had  The people are not communicative and do not try to help  I highly recommend not renting from this company  Wifi bad  place unclean  tv broken  support unhelpful        Wifi horrible  appliances bad  can hear everyone outside and above you  Hair on the sheets  diry floors  dirty bathroom Horrible took weeks to respond to emails and when talking over the phone people who said they would come out to fix an issue never did  The only good part of the listing Find another spot
658050724,This place was horrible  Its a crumby apartment  but what made it insufferable was that it was filled with a stench of cigarette smoke  We were forced to leave and contacted the host to receive a refund  but the host had still not responded  I am requesting that you immediately issue us a refund The entire apartment smelled of cigarette smoke Refund requested but no response
503591948,After I could not get a key out of the automatic lock box at the property  I was without a place to sleep for almost    hours overnight  The property Managers access code for their lock box was incorrect on the initial email and the subsequent code sent failed to open the key repository     After numerous phone calls to an answering service and only a single message sent by the Airbnb app  I was finally granted a refund from Airbnb  The number supplied to Airbnb and on their website does not go to any actual employee of the company but a answering service    The property Management company of these apartments is disconnected from the St Louis area  after having stayed in a property in the same facility that you manage I was looking forward to staying here again  Your communication and technical facilities are lacking   The messages from the host did not help in this situation   When finally contacted about the key box not being accessible and me being locked out for the first day of my trip  a non apology was sent   They stated as if the lock box   seemed   not to work   The property Managers failed to ensure I could enter the property  I had only   hours sleep in a terrible motel before heading to work  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me  The property Manager only responded once during my support request overnight  After the information they gave me was ineffective  they didnt respond again until almost   hours later  Their support line after      p m  is a message taking service  nothing more  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me 
660638539,No one deserves to get money robed from them  If you agree dont book with zencity  They are thieves  This small unit is next to a unit occupied by a full time tenant of the building  If you lucky enough you will hear punk rock  screamo  and tribal music blaring all night with one one to turn to help for but knocking on a stranger door who gets in fights with his party guest alot   lol  People coming and going all night  dogs barking  horns honking  Drag racing and cruising on the street out the bedroom window   Not safe cops always rolling around  Save yourself days of trouble trying to get a refund  This is not a pretty looking part of downtown  smoke stacks right out front billowing smelly fumes all day and night  The hosting company does not respond personally everything is automated by a  rd party add on service  You will not experience that if you stay with a real human in a real house with a real host  You are booking a motel  I brought it to their attention that the listing was      misleading the guy confirmed I was at the right address and right unit  He told me there was no where to transfer me then hung up and blocked my number I wasnt on the phone for more than   seconds before he hung up  The photos are  brightened with photoshop  There was rotten take out food in the refrigerator with a receipt dated             I booked           The towels are stiff and old  Calling the number listed again the next day because Airbnb told me to reach out one more time  He said if I called again he would take my security deposit wow  Please do not stay with this  company  not even if your desperate
502490967,The Bed was comfortable and the location is nice  but the dishwasher didnt work  the Electric water boiler didnt work  and the Extra linens were dirty  There also wasnt enough dishware for four people  For the price  we expected these amenities to be available  For      a night the dishwasher should work  the hot water boiler should work  and the extra linen should be clean 
626439223,The  host  that message you  dont speak proper english  It smells like weed everywhere  Too loud at night because of people throwing parties  The  step by step  instructions were shit  I even messaged you guys for help  because what I was told was incorrect  Then whomever responded back to me  said that it was my fault  You guys need to learn proper english  A few minute drive to downtown  that was nice and handy 
672965074,DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY   I hope this review will save EVERYONE from ever having to deal with what we endured on what was supposed to be a fun family getaway  I have NEVER taken the time to write a review  but this experience was so unbelievably awful  that I wont waste the opportunity to help warn others about this terrible company    We purchased a unit that specifically  listed it had   queen beds to accommodate our family  Zen City posted a listing for a unit with exactly that in an area that was relatively close to the things we wanted to see and do in downtown St Louis  so we purchased the unit   As soon as we get to the unit  we knew something was wrong  The first thing we noticed was that the place was absolutely filthy  Hair and dirt EVERYWHERE  So what does that hefty  cleaning fee  they charge go towards I wonder  Certainly not CLEANING THE UNIT   So  right off the bat  that was disgusting    Next thing we noticed was that we didnt have the   queen beds we were supposed to have  We got in late  but we contacted the host right away to tell them these things  They ended up trying to go into the listing and CHANGING THE LISTING  to the unit they had put us in  Luckily  we still had pictures of the original listing we purchased and our confirmation email showing everything we were supposed to have    This company repeatedly try to put the blame on us saying several times  Oh  I see how you could have been confused  and  Sorry  you must have overlooked and bought a different listing   after we kept providing proof of what we originally purchased   As you may have already guessed  this host refused make the situation right  hung up on us  and told us to go through AirBnB  So  we did  AirBnB immediately saw right through this deceitful company  They saw that they tried to update the listing AFTER we initially contacted them  as well as the lies they told through the messenger  We ended up receiving a FULL REFUND  and immediately got our belongings out of that nasty dump and went to a nearby hotel  where we were able to salvage the rest of our trip    Of course  this company will do anything other than accept responsibility and be accountable for their deceitful actions  so Im sure we received a delusional review in response to this one  reminds me of a    year old child throwing a tantrum screaming  I know you are  but what am I       However  if this review can save ANYONE from having to deal with this God awful company  then taking the time to write this review will have been well worth it   DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST    Please stop messaging us through AirBnB messenger  You act like a little twelve year old who is so insecure that they feel like they have to have the last word  You lied  You got caught  Be an adult and own it   This host deceivingly posted pictures of a different unit with different accommodations  only to get caught and try to deny it  AirBnB saw right through their lies and issued us a full refund  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST   We were given a completely different unit than we purchased  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  This host will charge you a  cleaning fee  without even cleaning the place  Hair and dirt all over the bathroom  dirty floors  etc  Absolutely disgusting  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  They do nothing but lie  even when they are caught red handed  Thankfully  AirBnB saw right through them and issued us a full refund  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  Regardless of where the location is  this company is ran by horrible human beings  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  After getting a FULL REFUND from AirBnB due to the outright lying and deception of Zen City  we found much better value at a hotel nearby that didnt have hair and dirt al over the floor  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST 
585158276,The worst place to stay ever  when I read the reviews for this place I was comfortable but then when I got there I was shocked  The host wasnt helpful when you ask about places around the apartment  The apartment was super small and different from the pictures that were provided  The most problem that I faced is I cant adjust the AC temp  It was extremely hot and when I talked to the host he said just open the windows and itll be fine  Also  he lied to me by saying you can adjust that and it took him two days to say that theres no way to completely to turn on the A C control since its building controlled Even if you open the window theres a lot of noise from the train and the cars outside  Theres no parking spot close to the apartment  The elevator smells like Marijuana everyday  I was uncomfortable the entire trip  Gives a wrong information
721091014,As a fair warning  just look elsewhere  My rental unit was not adequately prepared though my reservation was made well in advance  The bed sheets and pillow cases were lined with all sorts of hair   short and long  I literally bought sheets to change those with because it was very unhygienic  Additionally  the bathroom has hairs  of various contributors  posted all over the walls as if it hadnt been cleaned in weeks  My biggest issue is that the listing and check in clearly states access to a key fob for use of the multiple entrances of the building  Upon checking in  this wasnt available  When I asked when it would be I was told  maybe tomorrow    This was a very unprofessional response  I never got a key fob and had to resort to screaming the building access code outside the single intercom access door in the middle of Chicago when it was    degrees outside  When I brought these issues up to Zencity and asked for financial compensation  it was blatantly ignored by their support staff  Stay else where if you value amenities like cleanliness and a functioning key  I would suggest really focusing on cleanliness and accuracy of your check in instructions  Also  ZC support representatives could be better versed in dealing with these types of issues because the support was not beneficial at all  Also make sure youre providing whats listed in your listings   I e  a key fob  I booked a unit that was to be clean and provided a key fob   I did not have this in my experience   I was provided no key fob for getting into the building though clearly listed in the listing itself and check in instructions  Stray hairs left on towels and bed sheets  Bathroom walls have not been cleaned in who knows how long as various contributors of hair are plastered and line the wall  I wouldve much rather stayed else where  Zen city lacks the ability to effectively facilitate their own guests  Will make sure to not stay with Zen City in the future and warn other renters 
624084536,Not what I expected
538414983,I have stayed at AirBnb locations across the globe and this is one of the worst experiences I have had  Terrible check in on an unlit street  extremely dirty  hair everywhere  All over the sheets pillows  towels  shower  sink   and loud  The walls are paper thin overlooking a train station and but the biggest issue is the other tenants   The instructions guide you up   flights of stairs  NEVER MIND there is an elevator  Accesible from the side entrance or if you walk to the  st floor from the entrance they instruct you to use   Worst check in experience Ive ever had  Dark unlit street a block away from the actual location of the airbnb  The code given for the lockbox did  not work  Had to get a code for a backup lockbox  DARK CURLY HAIR EVERYWHERE  On the sheets blankets  On the towels  All over the shower and sink  Code given for lock box did not work  called  phone number provided was answering machine  left a message no one called back  messaged on Airbnb app finally got a message back  Good neighborhood but literally on the train tracks  Very noisy 
625986401,Whatever you guy think about renting this apartment DONT  You will regret it I promise you the pictures are misleading they have a washer dryer in the bedroom the room is small and it doesnt even work right   The kitchen is dirty as well   dishes   cups   dirty frying pans mouses running around the apartment  my son is   years old and he was scared to come out of the bedroom  spiders everywhere with spiderweb all around the place and the WiFi wasnt working   I wrote all of this to the host and he never got back to me   I was in   other apartments from Airbnb and never had a issue but lets put it like this I felt like was stuck in a hell hole for    days  Very bad experience    Very bad experience you could of at least got back to me about the mouse and WiFi my son was scared to come out of the bedroom  Washer and dryer was in the bedroom     cups   dishes   very dirty frying pans    The back bathroom no cold water only very hot burning water   The walls were very dirty I was very disappointed in the apartment   In my opinion Airbnb shouldn u    t not have this apartment on your website    There was spiders everywhere and most importantly there was mouses running around    the bathroom were filthy and lets just say with everything going on these days everything should of been much cleaner   I rented the places for    days and  I felt like I was stuck in a hell hole worst experience in my life  I texted   times about the mouses and there was no WiFi in the house and he never got back to me The place had to be cleaner and if hes doesnt have Certain stuff like in the kitchen dont say you have them   Say that the WASHER  DRYER ARE IN THE BEDROOM      
601481898,The apartment was not clean  The bed sheets had multiple long strands everywhere and the sheets were wrinkled as if somebody had just slept in it  Somebody pooped and left it there so the bathroom smelled  There were multiple stains on the couch and the sink was not clean either  The host still has not responded for my request for a refund a week later  We had to find another hotel room at      am  This will be my last time using Air bnb as when you do request a refund  they dont allow you to request the full amount  I would like a complete refund please  The bed sheets were not clean  They had multiple strands of long hair and were all wrinkled as if somebody had just slept in them  Somebody pooped in the toilet and didnt flush it so the bathroom smelled  The couch had multiple white stains and the kitchen sink was not clean either  I called the host when we arrived to let them know and I sent a message to her my money back and have not received a response 
720122761,Check in instructions werent clear  Cant even get in the side door they say to go into where the lock boxes are  Theres a man and a woman at the main door that youre forced to enter without choice  whom dont wear masks  and harass everyone that passes through the front door to access their units  Unit was missing key amenities and the host became Unresponsive and ghosted us when we reached out to them  Bring your own TV of you wanna watch TV at all   There isnt a remote for the TV and its human proofed without any buttons  as they expect you to watch a blue screen in Spanish language your entire stay  They pay the service fee which is  To help Airbnb run smoothly and to cover the costs of the products and services we provide  like      customer support  we charge a service fee when a booking is confirmed     Yet because they pay the service fee  you dont get the support you need for the issues that you are faced with when renting from them  Also  if you do choose to take the risk of renting from them     TAKE PICTURES OF EVERYTHING WHEN YOU ENTER THE UNIT and WHEN YOU LEAVE  My final thoughts       Everything Zen   I dont think so      Key amenities werent available upon checking or for the entire remainder of my stay  Host was Unresponsiveness and ghosted me after receiving payment   The instructions werent clear and it took a good while to figure it out  also there is a man and woman who stand at a desk to the entry way of the main door   they question every person on where their staying why their there  where they parked and just basically anything and everything THAT ISNT THEIR BUSINESS  This place wasnt immaculately clean or upto the airbnb essential cleaning standards which is why we bring our own cleaning supplies everywhere  Host was Unresponsive which has lead to unresolved trip issues  location is sub par and for the price I think parking should be included  Not worth a dime
640229639,You can expect that one of your guests wont be able to shut their bedroom door because the door is laying on the closet because it was knocked off of the hinges  You can also expect there will only be one bar chair to sit at the island and two chairs are so low that your chin will probably touch the top of the table  Wifi didnt work  You can also expect any concerns or issues you may run across you have to deal with yourself because the host is unresponsive   I had   guests for this   bedroom air bnb   guests traveling from Minnesota  I checked in before my guests arrived and one of the bedroom doors were completely off the hinges laying on the closet  So now one of my traveling guests don u    t have privacy to shut their paid for bedroom door  I expect to see what was advertised in this listing and that wasn u    t the case  The pool table was filthy the sticks were broken  One bar chair for island the rest of the chairs are short so don u    t expect to sit there with your guests  Mediocre for the price  Update photos for this listing   The host or Air Bnb never responded to the place smelling like cigarettes or the broken bedroom door laying on the closet  Horrible experience overall 
617769803,Update pictures this pictures is nothing like the apartments Update pictures
721988090,From my experience I would say Zencity is a terrible property manager and I would not use them again  I was notified   minutes before my check in that the housekeeper took the keys out of town and they didnt know when she would be back  It was extremely disappointing and I was left scrambling to find a place last minute  To top it off they offered me a stay somewhere of half the value or a refund for half of what I paid for the air bnb  All in all I felt like I got scammed and I will be fighting for a full refund In my opinion there needs to be some major restructuring of how zen city manages properties  it was unacceptable to be notified   minutes before check in that I wouldnt be able to stay there and was left scrambling to find somewhere to say  The air bnb I was offered was significantly less than the one i booked meaning I would lose money then they tried to offer me half of a refund when I never even stepped foot on the property  I refused to cancel my reservation because this was in no way my fault nor did I have anything to do with why I couldnt stay there  Whoever is in charge of making sure check in will go smoothly needs to be notifying guests at least    hours in advance so they can make other arrangements  This whole situation was just absolutely unacceptable and I felt like I got scammed   Again I wouldn u    t know because I was informed   minutes before check in I wouldn u    t be able to stay there  I was told   minutes before check in that there was a  lock issue  and was offered a place to stay that was less than what I paid for the original place I booked when I asked what the lock issue was they said the housekeeper took the keys out of town I wouldnt know I was informed   minutes before check in that I wouldnt be able to stay there  They waited until   minutes before I was supposed to check in to tell me they didnt have the keys to the room because the housekeeper took them out of town  Then took even longer to try and come up with a half assed solution All I know is what the parking lot looks like Not good if I paid over      and couldnt even stay there 
719773589,Upon arriving at the location in Stl  my host did not send me check in instructions  After calling them it took another    minutes for them to find my information  As I enter the room the Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone would come to help with the alarm  They Completely failed to take care of it   so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in          would not recommend  this location or host  Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in   This is absolutely ridiculous that I have to go through so much to get a refund for such an awful stay  I will continue to reach out and request my money back   Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in   Host did not send me check in  instructions  Took    minutes in the cold outdoors foe them to figure it out Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in 
631539043,A THIS IS A SCAM     DONT STAY HERE   It was VERY dirty  there was HAIR in the bathroom all over  Dirt  dust  and crumbs in the kitchen   on the floor   in kitchen chairs and more  The pillows were dirty  The microwave door was broken  The futon was broken  held up by pieces not meant for the futon and it was also very dirty  I sent a message and they offered to clean the space  but instead I asked for my some of my money back as this was not what I was not an accurate representation of what I was paying for  I took videos  which they asked for when they offered to clean  which should have been done according to a signed note on the wall  They never responded until check out asking me for a good review  Maybe   hrs later they sent me a message requesting      for damage for microwave  stained table that was stained when I arrived  and a broken drawer tv set  which was destroyed in the picture they sent to me but it was not destroyed when I left   This is a SCAM A THIS IS A SCAM     DONT STAY HERE   It was VERY dirty  there was HAIR in the bathroom all over  Dirt  dust  and crumbs in the kitchen   on the floor   in kitchen chairs and more  The pillows were dirty  The microwave door was broken  The futon was broken  held up by pieces not meant for the futon and it was also very dirty  I sent a message and they offered to clean the space  but instead I asked for my some of my money back as this was not what I was not an accurate representation of what I was paying for  I took videos  which they asked for when they offered to clean  which should have been done according to a signed note on the wall  They never responded until check out asking me for a good review  Maybe   hrs later they sent me a message requesting      for damage for microwave  stained table that was stained when I arrived  and a broken drawer tv set  which was destroyed in the picture they sent to me but it was not destroyed when I left 
617280915,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival  This is an automated posting 
713103476,Everything was dirty and I didnt feel very safe  I cancelled the reservation and got a refund  I even found chewed gum in the bedroom  The host wanted to charge me and rent the space out the very next night  which is against zencitys claimed policy of having a gap between guests to clean the place  They have awful business practices  I wont be booking with them again  This place was disgusting  have better business practices   pictures looked the same  it wasnt advertised as a garden unit   easy enough to check in  the number combination was generic enough that I wasnt sure it had been changed and I didnt feel comfortable  It was clear the place hadnt been cleaned before I go there  The sheets were stained  the floor was dirty  and I even found chewed  dried gum on a chair in the bedroom  After contacting the host to say I was cancelling my reservation because the whole place was a mess  air bnb got back to me way before the host did  and the host only offered to change the sheets so Id keep my reservation  He also wanted to charge me for an extra night so that he could rent the place out again that night  even though zencity says they have a gap between stays to professionally clean their places  Close to work  where I needed to go  was not told it was a garden unit  The location was creepy and not  well lit  This place was so gross I cancelled my week long reservation the next day  If I knew to call air bnb that night to complain  I wouldnt have spent any time there 
400594828,I  was scammed out of my money and a great experience  I would NEVER suggest anyone to utilize an Air Bnb if this will The result  I was NEVER acknowledged or apologized too in regards to this inconvenience  Im NOT sure if this company  or the host is racist  Im very upset and disappointed  Ive NEVER beeen treated like this before in my entire life   I am not refunded my money In a situation in which I contacted the host during the stay to Report a problem that was was never resolved during the stay   He never apologize or acknowledged the misrepresentation and lack of concern of Zencity end  This unacceptable   Proper preparation prevents poor performance  Never again Before you all scam others Out of a great experience  the lesser you can do is provide dish washing soap and heating in unit  When a guest contacts you in regards to this  atleast respond  Proper preparation prevents poor performance  Zencity performed and represented poorly  Never again will I book with Air Bnb or through Zencity again
588448936,Blood on the sheets and bathroom was filthy it was never cleaned before me and my   yr old got there  Just nasty I paid a cleaning fee just to have to clean up soon as I got in the door and buy blankets  I feel I should have been refunded my cleaning fee Blood on the sheets and bathroom was filthy it was never cleaned before me and my   yr old got there  Just nasty I paid a cleaning fee just to have to clean up soon as I got in the door and buy blankets  No parking at all If it was clean
571860734,First things first  the pictures of the apartment on the post is not the one you will get  We arrived at      PM  had a very long flight  however this is no hot water  no hot shower  Contact the host at      PM  and got reply the next morning at     AM  I dont blame the late reply because it was late in the night when I found out there is completely no hot water   The next morning my colleague told me her bed is very dirty l  lots of black and brown particles   Also I noticed there are hairs on the towel  After   hours waiting  The host sent a building manager to check hot water   and confirm there is completely no hot water in the shower  In the kitchen he was letting the water running about half an hour and start to feeling some temperature  The most ridiculous thing is  the host charge us     cleaning fee  He was doing nothing but wasting our time  There is no compensation for our time  the miss led pictures of hosts post  the awful experience of our stay    I have notice this is a so called professional management company  under its name of Zencity there are several airbnb properties    I will defiantly be caution and  wake away 
489343789,The place was acceptable the views were great  The A C was ok but not great  The bathroom had peeling paint on the ceiling and the light fixtures were rusted  My wife slipped and fell in the Bathtub that had no mat or anti slip coating or grab bars  Once we reported this and that she broke a rib  the host abandoned us  For those who follow us  we bought a mat for the tub so no one else would experience the same humiliation  We had no help once we reported the problem  We will not reccomend or rent from this group again  When we had a problem you abandoned us  Peeling paint on ceiling rusty light fixtures in bathroom  Floors not fully clean  oily substance on floor  We had a problem and once we let them know all communication stopped 
480832069,The place is fine  decorated well and in a nice area  But it smells very bad  check in was very difficult and you may be accused of taking random things from the room that the cleaning person decides have gone missing and charged for them later  We called Zencity customer service to help us with check in to get into the building and they couldnt even help  We just had to wait    minutes until someone came by willing to open the door for us  The check in gave us a keypad code for the door to the apartment  but the whole apartment building was locked and we were supposed to have a FOB available to unlock the building  The door is not manned at all times to let people in  Complete sewage smell going through the apartment that wasnt in the hallway outside in the place  Wouldve been great  until the host told us the cleaning person reported iPhone docks missing that were not in the apartment at all to our knowledge and tried to charge us nearly      There are way too many factors to accuse guests of taking some random object from a place  especially when they werent there in the first place 
362546015,Not recommend  The host would be so unresponsive and  irresponsible when you encounter some problem even though it is not your fault  In my case  he just told me to call the building technician  which was not free  when I was locked out  because I got no key on check in and  the two locks on the door both work  Now the host still ignores my request for the reimbursement of the stupid money I paid   Last issue   the Wifi is not so stable and fast even after being restarted  We did not get the fob to the main entrance when we checked and no one sent it to us after we notified the host The bedsheet looks quite old and a little bit wore out The host is so irresponsible  Firstly  he did not inform us that there were two locks for the door which both worked well  When we were locked out because of the door knob lock  he just told us to call the building maintenance and did not send us the key  In the end  we had to pay eighty dollars to the technician for sending us the key  Ironically  he sent two of his men to disable the door knob lock the next day and finally gave me the fob but still did not admit that it was totally his faut 
325721274,the bathroom flooded   times  Water overflowed  Notified the owner said he would send maintenance and when we came back from dinner water was still there and bathroom was not clean  went and got maintenance from the front desk and stayed up till   am cleaning everything  Next morning used it again over flowed and just decided it was time to leave  Told the owner we used the clean towels to make a barricade so water would not flow into the living room asked to send towels in the morning  sent them at   pm next day  Ruined our first night in Chicago  Nice place  just never renovated the bathroom  Asked the maintenance if it was our fault even tho we only used it for number    he replied no the building has this issue 
603234505,When my family and I arrived  the thermostat in the apartment read    degrees    it was only    outside in Chicago  I tried contacting via message and     hour  support  The apartment hadnt been recently cleaned and it seemed as if no one had stepped foot in it for a while  I left   voice messages with no reply  I chatted with one person back and forth about that and issues with the cleanliness of the apartment and after about    minutes  she stopped responding to my messages after telling me theyd try to find building maintenance but couldnt guarantee because it was a Friday   I finally had to contact Airbnb directly who actually talked to the host  as he ignored my messages and calls  and was told that he couldnt handle it as it was a Friday night  At this point  it was almost midnight and no other property could be booked   Due to the frigid temperatures  there was no way we could stay and were forced to find a hotel    which most were booked for the evening  Communication is key  The lack of responsiveness via message and phone was frustrating  Also  checking location before guests arrive would have solve the problems experienced 
627334983,Terrible stay 
640083008,Do NOT stay here  Do not support Zencity  Absolutely the worst experience  Dirty furniture  dirty pillows  reeked of smoke and alcohol  there was cigerette burns  carpet stains  worse yet extremely dirty hand prints and gross muck over all the handles and doorknobs  Dirty mop water left in toliet  Worst yet  there was a red fluid smeared all over the place  on furniture and the drapes   absoluely disgusting  This all started with them giving me a   hour delay on my checkin  then when i finally get the room  it was a horror show  I called and asked for a different room and asked them to come to room to see the issues  They said they were all booked and couldnt help me  i said i would stay at friends and they would send a really good cleaning crew and would fix the room in the morning  I came back to the room the next day at  pm and they didnt send anyone  Room was the exact same  So i called to get a refund and they would not answer my calls or texts  They do not care about their guests health  If you are at all worried about Covid do not stay here  They are taking no measures for guests  You treated me completely terrible and with total disregard  i am literally traumatized by my experience   Literally zero compassion or care for your guests health or well being   From the two hour late checkin  to the completely disgusting room  and then you promised me to clean room and lied and never sent anyone to fix  Then act like you doing me a favor by giving me    dollars  The absolute worst host ive ever seen  Im not done with this    Showed up and place was not ready  Had to wait in lobby as they  cleaned  the place   Finally got my room at    So a two hour late check in  and then the room was disgusting Dirty furniture  dirty pillows  smelled of smoke and alcohol  cigerette burns  carpet stains  dirty hand prints and gross muck over all the handles and doorknobs  Dirty mop water left in toliet  All this topped by  a red fluid smeared all over the place  on furniture and drapes   absoluely disgusting  They did not care when i called  asked for a different room  they said they were booked but would send out a cleaning crew to fix the room  They never sent anyone and would answer my calls  They do not care about their guests health You like your health  Dont stay here  They are not a responsible host   Btw Airbnb was completely unhelpful    hour wait times on phone  Keep moving me to different responders  Supposed to be contacted and moved to another place as part of their guarantee and they never responded back 
661158798,DO NOT STAY HERE  UNSAFE   The door to my Airbnb automatically locked when the door closed  The door code was on my Airbnb app  I walked out the side of my room and the door closed behind me  My cell phone was inside  Luckily I had my wallet with my ID  So I thought Id be fine  I was wrong  I went to the lobby of the apartment building and used the phone in there  I didnt have any numbers so I called the number listed on the door of the building  I was basically told that they could not help me  They wouldnt look up the number to a locksmith for me  I called them a total of four times begging for help  I told them I have my ID and everything  They refused again and again  They told a single woman at      in the morning to walk the street and figure it out basically    It was appalling to me to hear someone tell a young woman to do that  This is totally unacceptable  If youre going to have an automatic locking device you should know that theres a chance someone can get locked out of that without the code  You should have a procedure in place  Im contacting my attorney  I suffer from PTSD and Im so shaken up  I was put in a dangerous situation due to negligence and I am very upset  Dishes were dirty in cabinets  Drawers in bathroom were dirty  Fridge was dirty  Appliances had film  We were locked out of our Airbnb at around   PM  with no cell phones because of keypad entry and auto locking device    We could not log into airbnb due to security features    I used the phone in the apartment buildings lobby  We had no numbers because our phones were locked in the room    I called the buildings number listed on the door  I was told that they could not get in touch with the Airbnb host  They could not help me get into my Airbnb  They could not log in to any electronic devices on my behalf  They refused to look up the number to a locksmith  They told me that I would need to find a phone to use  So I was basically told to wander around Kansas City Missouri at night as a single woman  I was terrified  My safety was totally put at risk  I was downtown  I was lost    I suffer from ptsd and I was so shaken up  I didnt know who to ask to use a cell phone    I couldnt get into my Airbnb for five hours  I was on the street until close to   or   AM  I was unsafe 
643949008,BEWARE     the apartment I was in had DAMAGE already in several areas   Closet doorknob broken off and lying on the floor  golf ball size hole in the bottom of the bedroom door  hole scratch in closet door  etc etc    I luckily had the forethought to take pictures of all of the scratches and holes in doors when I arrived  They tried to charge me      for a broken doorknob and a scratch on the front door  that one I hadnt seen  In total there was about   things damaged in the apartment  So they completely picked and chose which damages to charge me for amd which to ignore completely    I have a feeling they charge people for damage that they never end up fixing    and thats how they make money  Its disgusting  I will be fighting this issue  I rejected the request for money and had heard nothing from them since after I yelled at whoever was on the phone  So we will see  Its sad because the apartment and the view was gorgeous  But I WILL NOT be renting from them ever again  They have several apartments they rent out  BEWARE OF ZENCITY 
646694542,Very unresponsive  definitely would book elsewhere if your not wanting to stress over your room on vacation at all 
722199816,WORST Airbnb experience EVER  Awful instructions and NO PARKING  We were locked out for HOURS because our key fob did not allow us access  We made it in with help of apartment tenants  The individuals working this scheme dump were fairly quick at responding but not at all helpful  The place itself was NOT cleaned and smelled like CIGARETTE smoke  The sinks in the bathroom as well as the shower had HAIR in it  Plus the couches and lounge chairs also had a horrible smell and significant amount of hair in it  The worst part was the BED  There is no way ANY person on earth would find this mattress comfortable  We felt as though we were sleeping on a wood plank  We were both afraid to make any quick movements in fear we would break a bone or paralyze ourselves  VERY LOUD ambulances all evening long  We were supposed to stay   nights and ended up leaving in the middle of the night to get a hotel nearby  Locked out of building for HOURS Hair all over couches living room chairs  hair in sinks and showers  bed comforter stained  sheets and pillows also did not look washed  Somewhat quick responses Awful parking options
622515880,Make sure you take pictures of the place before you stay they will blame you for existing damage Burn marks on table that they accused me of
622741752,Never again Horrible  Worst experience ever  My car and purse was stolen and I tried having a different card billed and they just couldnt get it correct for the life of them
628497897,The place had not been cleaned since the previous guests   You could tell someone picked up but the carpets were not vacuumed and had god knows what in them  The floors were half swept  the bedding smelled like it had been slept in  The instructions to get in were not clear  You have to hold your hand up to the lock and use the code they send  The AC unit has no physical control unit so it was FREEZING and there was nothing I could do about it  The windows had no screens  Sticky cabinets  I wish it had been cleaned because if so it was honestly a cute place in a quiet neighborhood  During the pandemic  One would think improper cleaning should result in an internal investigation  I honestly do not understand how this place was so dirty  I had no idea how to use the lock I had to google it Hair left everywhere  crumbs  dirty smelling bedding nobody vacuumed the carpets  You cannot control AC Unit    Corona Virus Central Cleanliness
628936807,This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with booking  Upon arrival which was after  PM the entire apartment was filthy  not dirty but filthy  When I reached out to the host  there was no response until  pm regarding the nature of the apartment  By this time a woman arrived at the apartment without knocking  entered the apartment and did not state who she was  It was revealed upon me asking she was the cleaning person for the apartment   arriving   hours later  This is unacceptable with COVID being popular  I even sent pictures to the host showing how dirty the apartment was  I had to wipe down the entire apartment with disinfect wipes and change the sheets myself  The only thing the cleaning lady did was sweep and take the trash out as I had already did her job  Which is something I should have not been compelled to do  The host was not accommodating as I expressed how upset I was  for what I experienced  The response was   well she cleaned it now  No I cleaned it  She just took the trash out  I will NEVER rent here again  Rent at your own risk  If you like piss smell and a filthy environment  this is the place for you  Sometimes reasonable cheap is not worth your comfort 
624616469,The place was infested with bugs  I reached out to Zencity three times and I was told that a maintenance man would be out  They never sent anyone  Imagine bugs being all over the walls   floors  night stand  and bed  They suggested I use some spray that was there  I did  It did not work  I even asked if they had another Airbnb available  They did not  They offered no compensation    Also the walls are thin  You can hear everything outside your door  I asked for a refund and have not got a response  The bedroom was infested with bugs  The place was infested with bugs  I reached out to the company three times  They finally responded and said someone would be out but they never came out  Imagine bugs all over the bedroom night stand and bed  It was horrific  It seemed like the more we killed the more they came 
627858649,Honestly I could see Zencity having really great airbnbs  but I got unlucky  No working lock for three days  massive leaks from dishwasher  maintenance coming in and out  construction going on   asked for towels and got them on the third day  I have nothing but complaints and asked for my money back or help and got no response  Awful  They sent me the wrong key code  AFTER I had to call and ask for it   Then when the lock didnt work the rest of the time it was suggested that I was not typing in the right code  On my third day  or not having a working lock and relying on the doorman to let us in and out of the flat  they said the electric lock is broke  Guess it wasnt my fault after all  Dismal  Response rate slow  closed after  pm  not very professional
671899189,The place wasnt cleaned when I got there  I had to stay in a hotel instead  The host has not refunded me    weeks later  My place wasnt cleaned out at all when I got there  I had to find a hotel at    at night   You promised a refund   weeks ago and I havent gotten one  Please refund me immediately 
623563772,   stairs but its beautiful  The place looked beautiful but it really need some changes  Thank you for allowing me to stay  When I arrived the unit smelled like the cleaning staff took a poop and left  It was a long lingering stench  There was no tub stop to take a bath  I had to run out and buy one and when I returned and turned the water on the knob fell off in my hand  Thee was huge wet stain on the couch like someone had sex and left  I tried to negotiate another couple days because I accumulated a lot of things and the unit was on the fourth floor   They never responded and then said the unit was booked  It forced me to leave pre maturely and I wasnt prepared  It is a few feet from a train that ran all day and all night  I couldnt sleep much because it was very noisey   It was    stairs to get to the unit  If you are not able to do steps you will lose your money  I was exhausted  It needed repairs and new furniture 
645261912,The place is fine  The location is fine  Just note  I went to the CVS on Sunday night      pm for water and I was locked out of this apartment on July    through  July    at      am because their  electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  All of my things were already inside the apartment  I called their number and they said they could not help me until tommorow  They also did not have another spare key to get into the apartment  I went back to the apartment at      am and finally someone came to open up the apartment  They removed the broken electronic keypad and gave me a key  They do not know what went wrong  I also noticed this place is charging me for all the days in the apartment even though I could not stay there on Sunday night  Very shady practice    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience I was locked out of your apartment on july    through  July         am because your electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  Then at      am someone came to open up the apartment    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience I was locked out of your apartment on july    through  July         am because your electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  Then at      am someone came to open up the apartment    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience
652910643,I was refused entry after notifying the hosts and Airbnb that I tested positive for COVID  I wasnt offered a refund  yet instead was promoted to cancel on my own  while paying over half for the stay   Then when I communicated that I wasnt able to where masks  short supply at the hospital  and my disposables were destroyed  after being hospitalized and having no support  canceling my flight  and driving   hours to St  Louis to stay in the listing  I was told  the check in was in fact accessible through a door man  and was threatened if I show I wont be able to enter and that my code to do was indeed revoked   I was stranded  no place to sleep and slept in my rental car  I also had to find abandoned areas to use the restroom due to COVID and me not wanting to enter any stores or restaurants and infect other ppl   This all could have been avoided had Airbnb either intervened or if the host would have canceled  seeing as I wasnt allowed in the listing and also a health threat to everyone in the building    Also  I was allowed to still stay even though I was positive I was refused entry because I didnt have any face coverings  I didnt bother to  check in  anyways for fear of my safety  or the police being called  With all that I experienced from having COVID  this wasnt worth it   Beware of positive COVID guests  however this hosts posses proper professionalism until I refused to gave cancelation penalties    I cant rate what I didnt see  so my rating reflects just that   Wishing you well  Ryann
630473008,The host sent us the wrong access code and so we were unable to check in  When we had trouble accessing the property  there was no response from the host  We ended up having to contact AirBnB to handle the issue  We were unable to stay in the apartment  and had to find a hotel that could accommodate us at the last minute  We were really disappointed with our experience  Absolutely unacceptable  We were sent the wrong check in information  and we were unable to contact the host for assistance  n a Host did not contact me until I first messaged them on the morning of our arrival 
654834111,The locks to the building and the apartment took forever to open due to outdated door locks  The WiFi didnt work  It wasnt Covid    ready  No hand sanitizer  face masks  or anything of that sort  The host didnt respond to any of my calls during my stay  It was a terrible experience  The bathroom and bedrooms werent that clean  There was only one garbage bag for the kitchen trash can  Ive tried to reach out to the host several times  however  no one answered nor returned my missed phone calls  The wifi did not work at all  It was a struggle to get inside the building and inside the actual apartment because the locks are extremely old and require a lot of wiggling the keys  The location was nice  It would have been nice to utilize the Wifi  It would have better if it was cleaner  There wasnt any hand sanitizer  face mask or anything to help keep us save during the Covid    
714589123,They cancelled on me hours before I was supposed to check in and I had to stay in a filthy unit in a sketchy part of town with a dishonest owner   Zen City told me I couldnt have the unit because of  maintenance  issues  When I asked what maintenance issue takes five days  they had no reply  So  they left me stranded on the streets of St  Louis  Deplorable  You never answered what maintenance issue takes five days to repair  Not that I would believe any answer you give me  having experienced your lack of regard for customers who have made and paid for reservations days in advance  I suspect you just got more money from another client and didnt care if I was raped  robbed  or killed on the St  Louis streets Deplorable 
711149100,I would recommend to get every detail you can before renting from this company  Parking is horrible and Zencity arent good at communicating 
630251543,This place has serious cleanliness issues  The host did not offer appropriate solutions  There was hair from several people all over the floor and the surfaces were noticeable dirty  Little to no effort to clean and disinfect  I noticed the morning after a late check in and was horrified  There was even something that looked like a bloody smear on one wall  It is abundantly clear that they are letting the place go between several guests with minimal attention  Hopefully they will fix these issues going forward  However  I would advise anyone traveling during the pandemic to avoid this place AT ALL COSTS   it is not safe and the hosts seem ambivalent about it  They hadnt even bothered to empty the bathroom trash between guests  and it was nearly overflowing   The amenities were poor at best  Cheap bed and pillows  no soap in one of the dispensers  stained and grimy furniture  I ended up getting a refund and booking a hotel for the same price 
671224681,I would not recommend spending this kind of money on this building  It is unclean  and more of a hassle than a  vacation   I would really like my money back  This is not a clean  safe environment  There was a poop stain on the sheets  It is obvious that they do not clean or change the sheets  I contacted the host about the poop stain on the sheets Saturday afternoon and received a response Sunday at   am  We were leaving on Sunday so that really didnt help  It was just a hassle  The buildings elevator was  reserved  for the day and we had no way of knowing there was an additional one in another part of the building  To get to it we had to leave the building and walk a block to get to the other side  I at one time had to walk up the   flights of stairs 
630558777,Booked this Airbnb last minute because I was coming home to KC for some family stuff  Tried getting into the unit around  am after getting into town and the code for the door I was given was wrong  Tried calling leaving messages   but no one answered until the next day  If I would of been in a city I didnt know I would of had to sleep in the hallway  but luckily I knew people in town for a place to crash  Next day I got a new code  got into the Airbnb and was changing when a maintenance guy walks into the unit  He said he didnt think anyone was in the unit  but was told there was supposed to be a photo shoot later and that I should call to make sure I have the correct unit  When calling zencity they wanted to still do the shoot at a time I wouldnt be in the apartment  but verified that I had the correct unit and that I could stay in it  I was supposed to have a late check out the next day to compensate for all the miscommunication and that was not communicated with the cleaning lady and she also walked into the unit while I was still I was there and verified that she was never told about the late check out    Zencity refused to give me a refund for the night that I couldnt get into the unit even though they gave me the wrong code to get in  Because of that and the fact that there was clearly no communication with staff to update them on the status of the room  and I had my privacy and honestly safety compromised multiple times I will not be booking this unit or any other listing that uses zencity going forward 
637485809,Place was not clean it all floor very sticky had ants all over and to top it off it was hot as hell with the weather being in the   s my whole stay the air was only set to go to    which was not sufficient enough it was hot there were no brooms or mop in sight have to buy one and also have to purchase a fan
634325531,I would not stay here again  When I entered the apartment  it was apparent that the management of the property does not align with the curated finishes and furnishings of the space  There was long black hair laying on the kitchen counter  When I took a shower the bath towels and wash clothes were covered in pubes  The unit is undoubtedly trendy but was not clean  One roll of toilet paper was left for a week long stay  After reaching out  it took two days before I received a response and have more dropped off  I had to go out and buy toilet paper which was not ideal as this was meant to be a safe retreat during covid while visiting a family member reviewing chemo treatment nearby  After a few nights of my stay  I asked to receive a partial refund so that I could check into a hotel  Various members of property management will respond to you  sometimes the next day and sometimes several days later  While waiting on a response  my week stay ended and I was informed I was no longer eligible for a refund  Other things I wouldnt mention if the rest of the experience had been better   the key fob to the entrance is broken and there is no way to get ahold of management in a timely manner so you have to wait for someone to exit and let you in  the unit is in the basement and the only windows are part of the property dog park  the entire basement unit smelled of musty mold  the elevator was very sticky  the outdoor rooftop was not open  the hand soap is watered down  and when it was raining the living room started flooding 
650181735,I do not recommend this place  It is completely over priced  The pictures are very misleading  The structure of the place is nice and it does have a lot of space and a nice balcony  The place was disgusting tho  I saw a bug  the couch was so nasty and badly stained that I had to put a covering over it just to feel comfortable sitting on it   The toilet seats were so badly stained  completely unacceptable  I was there for business  couldnt find the iron   messages the host multiple times about it   very slow responses and no attempt to fix the issue  I couldnt even control the air system on my own and once again  very slow or no response from the host  Multiple things were broken  it was just an overall disgusting experience and if youre looking for a nice place to stay  This isnt it  This place was just genuinely not what I expected  The pictures were absolutely misleading   the place was disgusting  The couch was so dirty and stained that I refused to sit on it without something covering it  There was bugs  the stove was disgusting  the refrigerator was disgusting  Needs new appliances if youre going to charge this much for it  Maybe I just like luxury and for the price I paid  This just wasnt it  By far my worst AirBnB experience ever  Even with communication  terrible Overall 
636913071,Checked in on July   and walked into an awesome view of all the fireworks in the surrounding neighborhoods  But things went downhill from there   The AC in the bedroom was out before I got there  Instead of informing me about the situation beforehand they allowed me to have one of my worst experiences ever in an Airbnb  Bc the The broken AC started to leak from the pipes underneath the floor  Zencity did try to get the situation fix but the repairs were too major so I checked out early  Im not a complainer but I was a bit confused on why the only supplied only   towels and   washcloth for my   week stay   I did get more after requesting   The kitchen was well prepped with silverware  pots and pans  and a few spices  Parking isnt too bad  You can usually find parking relatively close  This place does have potential to be really good once the repairs are made  It was bad luck for me 
704278898,Ive previously stayed with Zencity through Airbnb   had such a positive   accommodating experience that I had high expectations for this stay with them as well  Check in was very easy   the location is great  Unfortunately  that was the best part of this eleven day stay  The apartment itself has so much potential that it could be a fantastic stay but the cleanliness of the place was terrible especially during a pandemic  when the cleaning should be very thorough between guests  The smell of the building  apartment was terrible so much so that I had to buy several wall plug ins as well as candles  The washer wreaked of mildew and the dryer makes the most obnoxious sound when its on  I reached out to Zencity about maintenance and was told they would let maintenance know and hopefully the issue would be resolved soon   and then nothing came of it  There were pubic hairs from previous stays in the shower and the tub doesnt drain so when youre showering the water is around your ankles  Hair that was not mine was found on the bedding  in the refrigerator and an entire clump of hair was sitting on a shelf   All of the silverware was dirty  There was a pile of dirt that had been swept up and just left on the floor  from the cleaner Im assuming    There was already trash in the trashcan upon my arrival  These things truly made my stay terrible  Again  not bashing Zencity as a whole because I have stayed with them before and had a great experience but this place in particular needs WORK 
718658529,Booked then was sent check in information that didnt work   We could get into lobby but the code given to get key didnt work  Was supposed to check in  pm day before and never got in ended up sleeping in our car while trying to find another Airbnb for the next day   Worst experience ever from my home town  
636236068,Firstly  am very mad that I cant give a no star on this review  This is just a terrible experience for me and I would advice anyone thinking of booking this place to back off immediately except you dont mind dwelling in filth     this host handed me keys to an unsanitary environment  There was dust and dirt everywhere  food residue on the carpet and floor  the kitchen utensils were half clean and I found blood stains on the bathroom walls  To make matters worse this host offered me no solution and kept lying that the place was just cleaned  I literally had to partially clean this place myself just to get through the night because Airbnb werent answering my calls for solution  I have pictures of the whole experience and I await my FULL refund from Airbnb     
700257562,This is my first and only critical review on Air BnB and Ive used Air BnB a lot  over several years now  Even on the rare occasion that a BnB let us down  Ive always found hosts to be honest and responsive   When we checked into this place  it was not yet cleaned after the previous guests  Like bedding in the living room  food and dirty dishes out in kitchen and dining table  That too during a pandemic where other BnBs have taken immense efforts towards the safety of their guests  I tried calling them  then sent images of the place via the messaging app   no response until I explained to the door person at the apartment that I was going to cancel    They explained to the door person that the cleaner had   other apartments to clean and this would take an hour  Only after I walked out did they message me  And when I asked them to cancel and fully refund my booking  they just sent me their cancellation policy  When we tried to mediate through Air BnB they falsely stated to them  that the problem was that we checked in too early  When in fact  we left well after check in time and no cleaner had arrived    Air BnB did a great job mediating but Zen City was terrible  Pretty apartment and would have been such a good experience if they were atleast moderately responsive or responsible 
660307410,Nice location
669623964,I want to be able to recommend this  because had it been clean it would have been great  Hoping its a fluke  But the place was gross  Food stuck to the stove backsplash  sticky alcohol rings on the desks  hair on the carpets and in the sinks   I didnt stay here  I have to travel for work or I wouldnt  WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC  corners cannot be cut on cleaning   Plus  yes they refunded their part but  I still lost     in service fees and    to park in their garage for the    minutes I was there  Not a great experience  I know its not one specific persons fault  but in a normal world I expect to not have hair clumps on the rugs  rings of sticky alcohol on the desks  etc  In a NORMAL world  We are in a worldwide pandemic  Protocol needs to be better The instructions do TRY to be clear But they need updated because the key pad is broken  you have to call a    go to a whole New garage  Its just a bit of a hassle  And then there are elevators right inside the door that ARE NOT the elevators you have to use so thats confusing  Then the elevators have a scan pad outside AND inside  i had to have someone help Me  They made an effort but It wasnt immediate 
663313973,Beautiful place but it has large rats  I would bet stay there if I was you  The place it self was beautiful however  it has a rodent problem  I saw a few large rats and they were running up and down the hallway late at night  Also  they were eating my bread and fruits  I would never stay there nor would I recommend it to anyone else  Had issues with getting into to the building and the unit upon check but even though in was after hours the host did respond quickly  However  later I had additional issues with with digital key  Still the host was very responsive  Thanks for that  Nice place beside the rodent problem  But there was a big RAT in my unit
663015374,This experience was very unfortunate  Working in hospitality myself  from start to finish I did not feel like my comfort as a customer was placed at the forefront  I waited in the pouring rain for a delayed response of the check in details  The next morning there was shattering glass at  am right below our window due to the construction  Theres heavy road work AND construction happening right below the apartment that starts promptly at sunrise  The bathroom reeks of mold which is probably due to how old the building is  When I went to turn on the water  the entire handle fell off  The pipes were hissing and due to the handle literally falling off  it made it an incredibly difficult to just take a shower  Worse of all was Zencitys delayed and seemingly unconcerned response  basically saying I should have manage working with a broken shower on my own  For the price that their charging per night  it seems well within reason to expect a working shower and to be at least treated with a grain of care  Truly a disappointing experience  This experience was very unfortunate  Working in hospitality myself  from start to finish I did not feel like my comfort as a customer was placed at the forefront  I waited in the pouring rain after reaching out once I booked for check in details since it was passed  pm  The response came in about       mins later which generally might not be in issue but as a traveler in the middle of a pandemic  it left me waiting  drenched in the rain  The next morning there was shattering glass at  am right below our window due to the construction  Obviously not within your control but I do feel you should have a disclaimer to your guests that theres heavy road work AND construction happening right below the apartment  The bathroom reeks of mold which is probably due to how old the building is  When I went to turn on the water   the entire handle fell off  I did try to latch it back on to at least take a shower but the knob was too difficult for me to turn on my own  the pressure and temperature would fluctuate because I couldnt get a good handle on it and the pipes were hissing the entire time  Regardless of anything  you charge your guests      to be their own plumbers  Worst of all  is the delayed and minimal response and effort to even being helpful or wanting to satisfy your customer  Instead you say that I shouldve managed  not having an easy accesible shower in the morning  I stand that as I guest  it is not unreasonable to expect a working shower and at the very least your response in the world of hospitality  should be that of wanting to accommodate  It begs the question  why name yourself se city if this is an experience your comfortable giving to your guests 
716085187,I would not recommend this air bnb owner gave   men our codes to get into our air bnb to fix the heat but never notified us and we didnt have heat for   days on our extended day which was the   th day of our stay they decided to fix it we were freezing holes in the sheets  Rug linty boiler room was leaking  Forks and spoons were very dirty not like we were going to use them anyways but still HORRIBLE The key was hard to unlock we had to knock on neighbors door several times and also contacted the host multiple times during our stay  There was holes in the sheets like cigarettes holes   We didnt have heat at all for   days stay on our extended stay the  th day they decided to let   men we didnt know in our bnb he gave them our code without telling us as we are returning back to the air bnb the men are coming out of the apartment  Unprofessional as hell  The boiler room was leaking all the way to the bedroom floors and now they are trying to charge me for damages what damages  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
620785771,DO NOT STAY HERE  AND READ THIS REVIEW  I dont really know where to start with this review  I have never had a bad experience with any stay on AIR B B till now      First this place is filthy  I am talking dirty floors  dirty counters  Considering we are in an actual HEALTH PANDEMIC at the moment this is unacceptable  The  cleaners  and I say cleaners very loosely considering they did not actually clean  Tidied up no trash yes  at first glance it looked clean  Until you touched the counters  felt the dirt under your feet  opened the fridge and get hit with an old rotten food smell  Or just look at anything for longer than a minute   Stains everywhere  loved the big questionable stain on the master bedrooms carpet   sticky  overall  just absolutely disgusting  Not to mention the dirty BANDAID left in the master bedroom  I wish I would have brought with me cleaning supplies  but I did not expect to clean at a location with a     cleaning fee   Onto the couch situation and the kitchen chair   As soon as I step into the place  I noticed the couch  It was a bit lopsided thought this odd    on closer inspection the couch was broken  The legs of the couch were not installed properly or installed by someone who has never put together basic furniture one even with a crack  I immediately reached out to the renters regarding both the cleanliness the couch   chair   Received no aid in the matter just a  we know    also they knew the kitchen chair is broken as well  I expressed my need for actually working furniture since this is a basic necessity and I mean BASIC  I even asked for tools to fix it myself  No reply  Go figure  I actually had to flip the couch myself and attempt to jimmy rig it with a knife  I actually did better then the person who put this together Ill tell you that much   I didnt try to fix their kitchen chair   Maybe I should of since they clearly dont care   Lastly  we have the patio   You see that nice patio offered in the listing hell its even in the name    well guess what you cant access it  The door does not open to that area  So  you can waive at it from the couch   If you want to do some handywork first   Honorable mention  The lack of a clean sponge or dish soap in the kitchen  I did find a dirty sponge that had actual dirt on it and dishwasher gel  guess this is better than nothing  loved the empty hand soap dispenser it really added to the ambiance of the stay  I also have pictures of all of this   Followed by pictures of how I left the stay just as my own insurance  You can never be to safe 
718884193,This is not the first time this has happened  When I arrived the key pad wouldnt let me in  I attempted to contact and was unable to reach anyone or have anyone return my calls  I ended up having to get a hotel 
702119492,Very serious maintenance issues  Toilet  bathroom and kitchen sink did not drain  sewage pipe water bubbles up from the kitchen sink  giving the unit a foul raw sewage smell  Toilet did not drain  so we were not able to go to the bathroom in the unit  a basic expectation for a habitable unit  We were told a plumber would arrive  but never did  Hosts demonstrated extreme negligence for a serious maintenance issue  Again  we arrived to the unit to these conditions  Communication was timely  but largely unresponsive to inquiries or requests  I provided an opportunity to rectify the situation prior to writing this review  but you failed to take steps on repeated occasions  Bathroom and kitchen sink did not drain  sewage pipe water bubbles up from the kitchen sink  giving the unit a foul sewage smell  Toilet did not drain  so we were not able to go to the bathroom in the unit  a basic expectation for habitable unit  We were told a plumber would arrive  but never did  Responded  but did not answer inquiries and did not address problems 
554124458,Do not stay here See messages and emails See emails and messages Quality furniture and cleanliness
421475388,couldnt open the apartment door with the key given to us I had to pay for a hotel called several times with no response at all terrible experience overall couldnt open the apartment door with the key given to us I had to pay for a hotel called several times with no response at all terrible experience overall
704234978,First Id like to say considering staying in Hyde park I assumed that regents was going to be ok to stay in during my visit  The experience I have over the weekend was horrible  First off  the walls were dirty  the couch  and the kitchen sink was linking from the bottom  The bathroom had surfaced mold around tub and ceiling  the bathroom sink had a disgusting build up around faucet  This location needs a serious upgrade  The most worst experience I ever had
706211828,Very disappointed   Easily the dirtiest Airbnb Ive had to stay in  If I were at a hotel I would have requested a new room  Unlucky for my boyfriend and I  we got there late and had a flight early the next morning so we had to sleep in that filth  There was hair everywhere in all shapes and sizes  The sheets  extra sheets  bed spread  floors  walls  along the toilet  and bathroom floors all had hair  There were stains on bed spread    To make matters even better the door didnt lock unless you pushed it from the outside  We felt very unsafe so we slept with a bar stool in front of the door  Only thing that would have done is heard if someone came in   We stayed in one of their other places a few days prior and it was one of the nicest Airbnbs I have stayed in so I hope they make this right  Disgusting place would love a refund or I will be sending pictures and videos of the place to Airbnb  I recommend getting a new cleaning person and finding someone to fix the door that is unable to lock from the inside  Very dirty Other peoples hair everywhere  stains on bed spread  and the door didnt lock unless you pushed it from the outside 
409711601,What started out as a decent stay  ended in a terrible stay  In the unit that I stayed in  the window broke  and would not latch and stay closed  Thus  in temperature that dropped to    degrees  I was expected to sleep in said room  When I complained during the   oclock hour  the questioning I received  inferred that I was at fault for breaking the window  Seeing that I dont smoke and it was freezing outside  I had no reason even to think about the window  yet alone opening the window  When I requested maintenance  I was told that they were gone for the day  and would have to bundle up and wait until the morning  Again  it was    degrees outside  When I complained more  I was told to turn the heat up  in the midst of    degree weather coming in  To make matters worse  the radiator worked when it wanted to  barely emitting any heat  After asking for a refund  they said theyd only be willing to offer a refund on half a night stay  When I said that was unacceptable  Zencity ceased communicating with me  Needless to say  I will never stay in this property again  because they dont consider the health and safety of their guests  After staying in your property in March of      and referring to classmates to your property this past week  I was extremely disappointed and offended by the way you handled the situation with the broken window last night  Unfortunately  I would no longer use your properties when I come to Chicago or refer people to your properties  To expect someone to sleep in a room  with a window open  allowing    degree air in is not only ridiculous but dangerous  Im appalled at your lack of customer service  A lot of hair left on the floor in the bathroom and hair left on the pillows and linen in the bed  When I called the host with an issue on two separate occasions  they never returned my call  after saying they would  When communicating through text  the responses were extremely slow  There is no value in sleeping in a room with a broken window in below freezing temperatures and an insensitive host 
481884024,Misleading listing  Its a mistake to deal with a host like Zencity because its a property owner  not a home owner  and they take no pride or care  What they offer is not worth the price and the standards of the accommodation make you think you wouldve been better off in a motel  Your satisfaction is not their priority  out smarting you to keep your money is  Dont trust these people with your stay  Have no pride in what they do and do not care about customer satisfaction  they do a disservice to the reputation of Airbnb

350894465,No comment No wifi for   days till you put an extension  No water during a shower  because the building is too old and it can not support all the people using the shower  Police at midnight in the next door apartment as guests were fighting        had to leave the apartment at midnight and move to my sons apartment  The suggestion is  THIS APARTMENT  THIS BUILDING IS NOT PROPER TO BE OFFERED FOR SHORT RENT  I WILL NEVER EVER TRUST AIRBNB AGAIN  And I am sorry for that because we as family have rented via airbnb in snowmass colorado  rio de janeiro brazil  filadelfia  atlanta etc     I am very sorry  Best regards Building hall  corridor  elevator  smell horribly and are dirty Hairs in the bathroom corners  dust and spots in the kitchen cupboards  Black spots on the bedroom walls The location is fantastic because it is close to the restaurants and shops  The problem is the building too old  dirty and UNSAFE

712867405,generic  they all are the sa h e  so if something seems a little off  it is likely a LOT is wrong  perhaps give a heads up if tradesmen are coming to fix things  dont forget about a problem when notified  the kitchen had been thrown together  missing basic stuff  and the cleaning supplies fell out at us upon opening a cabinet  the bedroom had a window open that couldnt shut and what looked like a swiffer pad attempting to cover an opening while the AC unit barely hung in the window  it also smelled of smoke when we entered  the place was freezing with no heat 
432093794,Could not check in  Called the host multiple times  no response until   AM the following day stating they would look into it  At  pm  the day after check in  I received a text saying that they would not be refunding me and that they were able to open the lock box 
431265127,Poor management  Would not recommend  Learn to effectively communicate
405176623,fumes were coming through the vents from the unit below  me and my bf could barely breath through the toxic varnish fumes  host refused to move us to another unit  terrible customer service  fumes were coming through the vents from the unit below  me and my bf could barely breath through the toxic varnish fumes  host refused to move us to another unit  terrible customer service 
721540559,The key fob did not work  I was told the security was supposed to fix the key fob but security told me that the company is supposed to take care of that  The door to get into the apartment was hard to unlock you have to unlock it then lock it back and keep turning it to you here click  Had to stand outside in the cold until the security guard came to let us in because the key fob wouldnt work every time we left  No parking  The view was great The apartment was clean Key fob did not work  Kept getting the runaround about who is supposed to fix it  Hard to unlock the front door to get into the apartment  Had to stand outside and wait for the guard to let us in
362609274,This host will assume criminal activity if youre black  DONT DO IT I checked in early because i didnt have to meet the host  When i called to see if i can check in i got an approval and someone else was already there 
308020656,The pictures definitely look better than the reality of this place  The building is quite old and out dated  The shower head is old and ineffective  needs to be replaced    The worst thing about this place is the A C unit they have in the space  Its an old window air conditioner  it blows out cool air but doesnt cool the room at all  youll just be sitting there for hours waiting for the room to get cool and it wont happen    I couldnt sleep and had to check out the next day and pay extra for a hotel for the rest of my trip   I definitely recommend not staying here  theres definitely much better options closer to the city  and Zencity charges a     cleaning fee  but for what  You should invest in a proper A C unit and a better shower head  you shouldnt accept guests until you have resolved these issues  You cant run an airbnb like this and I feel cheated  
712475189,double check that apartment has been cleaned thoroughly before you book  this place smelled heavily of cigarettes and was dirty all around  had to leave and book a whole place smelled if cigarette smoke  walls were browned and chairs had grease spots   had to leave because it was not worth the money told me they would refund me and then went ghost great price   great building but not as depicted
332560086,It was really bad experience  I dont recommend this apartment or host at all   While Im sleeping someone tried to open the door by the code and the end she entered right and she told me that she wants the other floor but my concern that how other people can open and know the code of this apartment  Also  the host isnt responsible at all  I cant reach her  so at the midnight I left the apartment and she called me on the morning shell send someone to change the code thats what she offers after all bad experience happened  I really advise everyone to not book this apartment if you care about your safety and have family  They dont have any responsibility 
524341490,The place is very cramped  The building had a nasty smell  The place looked very unsafe and the deadlock for the door was not working  There is lot of bleach and clorox smell in the room  I decided to vacate earlier than my stay due to these reasons and didnt receive refund  Dont stay here  The place is very cramped  The building had a nasty smell  The place looked very unsafe and the deadlock for the door was not working  There is lot of bleach and clorox smell in the room  I decided to vacate earlier than my stay due to these reasons and didnt receive refund  Dont stay here 
466879620,No electricity  hot water  or gas  We checked in around    pm  exhausted from a long day of traveling  The check in instructions were incorrect  so we were led to the wrong door to enter the building  When we finally heard back from the host  after waiting outside in the dark for almost a half hour  they told us that even though the instructions say  the door to the left of the lock box   and there is a door directly left to the lock box  you are supposed to go to the second door  which is further down the building and not at all referenced in the instructions  When we finally got in  there was no power in the entire unit  Again  it is    pm  we are very tired  and already irritated because we couldnt get in to the place  Again  I have to message and call the host and wait for someone to get back to me  They tell me they have to call the electric provider so we just need to wait  We waited almost an hour in the dark until the electricity was reset   After that  we are all so exhausted we get ready for bed  We try the hot water and its not working and we figure  maybe it just needs to heat up and we will try again in the morning  We were wrong  There was no hot water all weekend  We had to take ice cold showers  Again  the host told us it was a provider issue and we just needed to wait  There was also no gas   so we were unable to cook   I am not a high maintenance person  and I realize this was a relatively inexpensive spot for a Chicago stay  but electricity  gas  and hot water are basic living needs  They wouldnt put us in a new place and they would only refund us half of what we paid  after I went back and forth with Airbnb all day   Instructions for check in were wrong   It led us to the wrong door  and then we had to wait    minutes to hear back from the host who finally responded to tell us  Oh yeah  the instructions say the door to the left of the lock box but really its the second door further down   This was all at    pm when we were exhausted from traveling and just standing outside in the dark trying to get in  Because its a company  you have to wait to get through to people and give them all your information just to talk to someone  Electricity  hot water  and gas 
716876108,I would have had a better experience at the motel    This was the absolute worst experience Ive ever had  We couldnt get into the apartment for over   hrs  When we did the apartment had no heat and was beyond freezing  We were told to turn on the radiators and the noise would stop after a few minutes  We turned them on and went to dinner to escape the cold and noise only to return to a freezing cold apartment and raging radiator  We were told nothing they could do and other guests complained before but it would stop  It never stopped and the heat never cut on  Not to mention the dirty dishes  Best part  host was unapologetic and seemed irritated with our request for a warm place to sleep  Unable to open the door with because they provided the wrong code  Then i was unable to contact anyone Unwashed dishes in the sink and dishwasher Host answered our messages several hours later No heat in the apartment  We slept in full clothes
508944801,Skip this nightmare  The building is dark and dank  the elevators out of service  None of that is Zencitys fault  but their slow responses when something goes wrong  in my case  a very active cockroach in the bathroom  make this an unpleasant stay  and simply not the small savings  I am still waiting for a reply to my most recent message regarding my refund  In the meantime  I hope youve done a thorough cleaning and extermination in the studio  Information about how to find the lock box was a little confusing  but the lack of information about which floor a room was located on  and how to get there  meant I wandered around a bit trying to find my way  Stained sheets in the bedroom were the prelude to a cockroach in the bathroom 
572099457,I would not recommend staying with Zencity at all  Upon arrival we found the whole apartment dirty and without towels in any of the bathrooms  The towels that we did find look like they were thrown in the back of the closet  The host was unresponsive when we tried to contact them with the issues  We had to stay in apartment for over an hour until we found other accommodations  It was a very inconvenient situation for us and we will not stay with this host ever again  Did not get back to us when we had issues about cleanliness 
714103435,False advertising  No W D in room  Late responses from host with lack of information about units This host is using false advertising Parking
545136455,Terrible host service 
229631547,The host canceled this reservation    days before arrival  This is an automated posting 
594073876,Nice location and very home like feeling inside the apartment  However communication was NOT good   often took multiple messages and a couple of days  to get a response  Interacting with the workers was not pleasant but as a whole  Id give this place a       Will never be staying in this location or with you guys again  So beyond disappointed  You guys use to be great  Cleaning lady was halfway through cleaning when we walked in after check in  Asked for a key because we were having troubles with ours and it took    hours and a triple text to get a text back and over    hours till we actually got one 
230036678,The host canceled this reservation     days before arrival  This is an automated posting 
479862725,Zencity is the third party handling this location and frankly I would stay away    If you have any travel issue  I e  cannot access the building  they dont have a number to contact anyone to get it resolved immediately    I had reserved this particular location with two teenage girls because of a concert that was going on    Check in is only after  p and the event was open at   p  so we only were able to get to the Airbnb by after midnight    Support cant help you  You dont get direct contact to the host  You also dont get any compromise for the experience you have    We were locked out and we felt unsafe  It was frustrating and scary  Luckily the email support answered us  but it was not timely    We spent almost   hours sitting by the door  unsure of what to do  I almost had to book a room elsewhere    Place was nice  once we were able to get in  but at the expense of dealing with Zencity and being denied something in return  its not worth it    I would much rather book at a hotel  because I know Im GUARANTEED access to my room  I think its ridiculous that I cannot speak directly with the host whether through Zencity or even through Airbnb    Its clear Chris has no concern for safety  has no sympathy  or even cares for what happened  I wont be staying at an Airbnb ever again    At least a hotel will GUARANTEE an accessible room     Chris should have courtesy towards his clients    Its simple business practice to take responsibility for a bad procedure  and in return  do something to make up for it    I feel betrayed because I was not taken care of and Im sure I will continue to be ignored    Clients concerns should not be ignored  I hope this company can learn from this  Its unfair how this has turned out to me when I had two teenage girls to look after    Were very lucky that nothing bad happened to us  There wasnt a second lockbox code provided just in case the first key was missing  Theres no way to contact anyone on the phone and receive immediate support during an emergency  Customer support could give no advice in what to do  An email was provided but it was not timely 
356579353,It was one of the worst experiences I have had with Airbnb zencity is a unprofessional company I had medical supplements maild and everything arrived fine I picked them up from the mailroom BUT THE LAS   pakeges that were diliverd I was told by the mail room employee that it was in the mailbox so I contained Chris from zencity he said he would go on Monday to get it from the mailbox this was a Friday I said ok Monday come around he never replied until I contacted hem then he said that there was nothing in the mailbox I had tracking the tracking information said the pakege was diliverd whe theres a diliverd the delivery company scans it therefore I knew that it had been delivered then Chris sent me a message saying that he is not liable for anything I basically believe that they kept my pakeges he was rude and disrespectful  You are unprofessional company
343502935,Host number on listing does not take calls for AirBNB reservations  Gave me another number which just slowed down response time  Keys left did not fit lockset  so I was unable to check into apartment  Ended up paying twice as much for a hotel        a few blocks away  The number listed on your page does not answer Airbnb calls  This delayed a prompt resolution  Your instruction said one key should open both locks for the apartment door and it only fits one key  The second key  the one that broke  does fit the lock but broke before unlocking  N A
336806566,This place was a lot smaller than expected and not worth the price 
463114818,dont stay here lost email with instructions host never responded to a long time to in dirt on bed said there was street parking   good luck with that
576895601,I checked ahead of time to make sure a later arrival would be ok  I was told there would be no problem  I got into rental property place at roughly  AM and was told by the staff I was not on the list of guests by Zencity to be staying in the apartment for the night  I showed them my airbnb reservation along with my receipt of payment  The rental property staff tried contacting Zencity where they said they were being answered and then told they would get back into contact with them before getting hung up  It took until  AM for them to get back into contact to let the rental property know that I was approved  I had a meeting this morning in Chicago that I only got   hours of sleep for  I leave Chicago Saturday morning and now my trip is ruined because I am exhausted from last night  I had paid for a service that was not met  I had planned and notified them of a late arrival and was told it would be ok  I would have otherwise made arrangements to get into town earlier had I been notified it would not be ok  It was frustrating being told by the rental property that we would most likely not be allowed to stay the night and having to figure out other arrangements  Asked for a refund that they said they would grant over the phone  however didnt hold up to their word  Escalated to airbnb  Carpeting was poorly vacuumed
608045316,Thanks Beds dirty with hair and debris  Hall way up to unit smelled extremely terrible and was filthy  Unit smelled bad  Had to leave property and get an alternative room due to unsanitary property  Requested a refund and took days to get a response which was ultimately denied  Near alot of bars and restaurants  Over a run down cleaners  Property is owned by zencity and they really dropped the ball on this one  I would advise against staying at any of their properties  A refund in my option was fair since I left the property and never returned  Their communication was slow and poor customer service  Airbnb was no help  They have no standards for customer service in these instances so dont waste your time and money with this pair 
720515582,TERRIBLE customer support   Its a shame that this place was so cute  I just wasnt able to get into the building  The access code they gave me was wrong  the key fob to get into the building and use the elevators was not working and on top of that Zencity did NOTHING to help  Residents had to keep letting me into the building  when contacting the host they saw that as a resolution  It was New Years Eve with Covid and not a lot of foot traffic  My boyfriend and I were stuck at the entrance for over    minutes waiting for a resident to come home  I had book this place for one night  and had way to much trouble to pay       This was a complete rip off and Im VERY disappointed on how the host has handled my situation and lack of communication  Pick wick place apartments should no longer do business with this company because they have such a nice apartment building  that I would have loved to stay there again  but most definitely WILL NOT  I am VERY displeased with the way your company handled my situation  We were locked out of the building and was told that nothing was wrong  The access code to get into the building was wrong  and our key fob was not working  When trying to get in touch with support  it was difficult  Then when trying to resolve the situation  it was even more difficult  No one actually resolved my error with the access code  or my non working fob  Residents had to keep letting me in and Zencity kept seeing that as a resolution  Couldnt get in contact when I was locked out of the building 
722550803,This was the worst AirBnB experiences Ive had  I drove    hours and arrived at the AirBnB at    pm  It was self check in  and the code to get the key didnt work  I contacted the host who then self released the key box  No key inside  We try   other boxes and the key was not there  She said the cleaner did not return the key to the box and to go up to the unit to see if it was unlocked  When I went in the tv was on  furniture moved around and the bed un made w make up on the sheets  She had me drive to another unit in town   which had unclear instructions on how to arrive  I ended up not inside until      am  It was not the ladys fault who helped me  I asked for    extra minutes for check out and another person told me it was impossible for them to allow that and I needed to leave by the time they said  They ignored my message when I asked why no one had rectified or even attempted to rectify any of these issues  Strongly would not recommend any bookings w ZenCity no one rectified all my issues and were rude about check out
459619503,Brian let his place to us after mentioning that the previous group had damaged the place  He then proceeded to try and charge us       for the damages by the previous group  He also provided no brooms  mops  paper towels or cleaning supplies and then chastised us for not leaving the place spotless  Either leave supplies or use the       you charged us for the place to clean it yourself  Ruined what was a nice weekend with odd behavior after
