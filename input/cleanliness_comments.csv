616427415,The unit was not cleaned after the previous guest left  The linens were not changed and the bathroom was full of hairs from the previous guest  We had to buy our own toilet paper
624952307,Cabinet
441243680,Thanks for being a great host and being so accommodating  Bathroom was great  But there was an issue with the toilet and the fact that maintenance wasn t available was the only down side
617317015,Bathtub wasnt clean  Inside of microwave wasnt clean  The refrigerator wasnt clean neither was the bed sheets blanket or the hangers  So much more besides an unclean room has made this the trip from hell 
615861615,The towels had a pungent smell of cigarettes  The place itself was clean 
438842802,Zencity    I think you property was in a great area and the check in was flawless  We felt very safe and we thank you for keeping up communication with us and responding to our needs  We ended up finding parking and working it out with you all and Airbnb  but I really feel that free parking should not be included as an amenity option  The rooms and kitchen were really clean  but the common areas just missed the mark for us     Thank you for letting us stay  it was a pleasure  The furniture and the rug in the common area was not completely clean  there were small hairs  and residue on the window area and table  not wiped down   In the bathroom  the shower lining curtain was a little dirty  Couch could have been vacuumed and touched up a little more as well 
611314369,Need to improve your internal communications between the host and the cleaning service  Dishwasher was still running when I checked in
626688366,The bathroom smelled like sewage and we had to close the door to the bathroom or else the whole apartment stank  Kitchen had some half used food supplies from previous occupants 
435834050,Little bit of hair in the shower 
606791298,The location was convenient and the building seemed safe  For      a night it would have been nice to have a sparkling clean place  parking as listed  and extra towels  The floors didn t looks like they were swept very well  There was drywall dust still on floor in several places 
672418662,Floor was very dirty when I came in and bathroom had bugs
77160655,""
613224745,Please pay attention to cleanliness  add a coffee maker  and two sets of keys should be standard for a   bedroom place  The floors were dirty as well as the bathrooms
598695634,Just lots of marks in surfaces   dust and dirt on floor from construction 
637453214,Sofa was very dirty  hair  candy wrapper  stained  Kitchen was not cleaned  fridge smells  microwave splatters all over inside  oven handle and front is sticky  Tons of dead bugs in window sills 
146736842,Thank you again for hosting us  Spare linens had hair in it 
604567368,Dirty floors
595098726,Floors looked like they needed swept mopped 
424006464,There was just a lot of holes and cracks in the walls in the bedroom but everything else was fine
589152967,You were quick to respond to any initial issues but once you were asked for a partial refund you went silent and no longer were so helpful  Bathroom floors were dirty urine residue on bottom near toilets and tile floors were dirty with residue not mopped  Kitchen stainless appliances were smeared all over 
710988449,Thank you for working with me on the pipe leak  Paint splatters  resin drips  and something I hope was pizza sauce smeared on the walls 
419171325,Fantastic place to stay  Amazing location and spot on directions to check in  Towels weren t all clean  Some had spots  others hard hair in it
709619727,The shower curtain had bits of hard soap clinging to it and the bathroom in general was not clean  The kitchen had dirty countertops and the kitchen floor was quite dirty 
709154835,Crumbs on the counter  Weird smell coming from bathroom 
584018425,We hope to stay with you all in the future hopefully during a less busy time  Our room wasn t clean upon arrival due to a mixup with the cleaning service  Zencity accommodated by extending our checkout by the amount of time the cleaning staff was there upon arrival    We didn t have enough towels for our stay but laundry soap was provided  Basic soaps for dishes and bath were provided 
627461356,you were a great host and I appreciate the stay  there was broken glass cup in the kitchen  the sink became stopped up and had the entire floor wet 
413506403,The layers of people involved in the check in process  from the front desk staff to the customer support reps  didn t know how to help us  I couldn t fault them  but I d suggest setting them up with the right info for them to be successful in helping guests  sheets did not appear to be clean
412440224,If I were to judge all rentals from Zencity by this apartment  I d be willing to rent every single time as long as it s clean and dust free  It was EXTREMELY dusty at this location  Looked like it hadn t been dusted or cleaned in months  Everything was neat and tidy  but the dust was really bad  Gladly there was a mop  broom and a vacuum cleaner  Thankfully I carry tools on me as well because the vacuum cleaner was literally jam packed with dust  Once I cleaned out all the dust I was able to clean up even more dust that was embedded into the carpets  Place looks clean now though  Pretty sure the new visitors will enjoy a clean and comfortable space       
643668067,There was an open bottle of water that was     empty with no lid  sitting on the counter 
643035881,Awesome location guys  Was hoping you would have shown me your best foot forward after the leaking ground floor mess last month  Gave me a unit that smelled of dirty diaper  Mound on the base board in the bathroom and when I emailed the issues  no one responded  I don t get it  Paul Unit had a  wet straw  barn like smell  Mold on bathroom base boards  Sent email to Zencity manager  did not respond during stay 
700614644,There were handprints all over the walls in the bedroom  and the furniture in the living dining room was very worn and looked dirty  It also smelled like chemicals  and not in the clean way   The host did not acknowledge any of this when I reached out  I even sent pictures of the handprints  they were that obvious  
580502375,Other than a few issues like no remote for the TV  no key fob for the parking garage  and no coffee maker or working gym like mentioned in your listing as an amenity  our stay was nice  Construction dust everywhere  Shower stall had hair in it  freezer had some old food dripped in there and wasnt clean  One of the kitchen chairs had food or something rubbed on the leather part where u sit 
625245065,I really appreciate staying at your place  Although I have a few things that I was a little bit uncomfortable with  I still stayed because I didnt want to hassle you or myself  Thank you for being a prompt host  The common area couch had all kind of left food particles and the bathroom had was not swept  We just found food under the air condition 
428631482,Check in was very easy  And location was great for us  However  every night as we tried to fall asleep there was constitution sounds like hammering all throughout the night  There was food left over in the dirty refrigerator  The bathtub was covered in hair  The floors had not been swept and the rug had not been vacuumed 
580439912,The location was amazing we were able to walk to a very popular area of town    The apartment decor was very nice and the beds were extremely comfortable  Kitchen was beautiful  One of the bathrooms were super clean but the other had hair all over the floor  The rest of the space was quite clean 
709497704,Thank you  Hair  dust and dirt
619710114,None of dishes were appliances were clean and had actual dirt in bowls and cups 
618579983,Thank you for a great stay  Corners of walls had noticeable dust and dirt  Strange sewage type smell lingered from closet area    perhaps from water mains  
572981534,Please next time try to be more accurate with your description and if doing renovations make sure you have disclosed that to the person reserving space  This was hugely disruptive for my business trip  The apartment had just finished renovation  There was a little dust and it looks like someone used the toilet and forgot to flush 
592164656,Did not feel welcoming as signs listed reminders of being quiet and no smoking   Please note that on Saturday night the marijuana smell from next door was very  intense and wafted into the master bedroom   There was no soap in the soap dispensers anywhere downstairs   No instructions on how to operate the television   It would have been nice to have your suggestions of favorite diners and how where to pick up public transportation   Most of all was the price being listed so much lower than actual  Some mold around shower 
572368951,I listed earlier the accuracy of the listings details  and I also wanted to mention privately that I did notice some dusty surfaces and even some spots that just didnt look fresh   clean  I only tell you because it appears that you are not a personal owner and may not actually see the place all too often  I certainly did not have a problem  AT ALL  and loved everything about it  Dust on countertops and stains in sink  Very minimal  but not as clean as a hotel 
571849973,I truly hope that you read and understand the comments that I submitted  I can tell that the furnishings are nice and that once the building is done this will be something that I am sure a lot of people will enjoy  I understood when I agreed to stay that the  common areas  were under construction but perhaps a quality check run should have been made to the apartment to ensure that the issues I mentioned were resolved  Particularly the lock  Best of luck in your future endeavors  When I arrived to the apartment there was a water bottle full of paint water in the sink  While I understand that the entire building is under construction this was disappointing  Furthermore  when someone came to inspect the lock and why it was not working  there were no batteries   they took away the trash can that had been in the apartment   so I had to place all trash in the tiny bathroom trash can 
580901909,We made due with the space  but it was pretty filthy when we got there  Most disturbing was the hair all over the bedding and towels  I am not sure whether it was an issue of where laundry is done or if the maid is not keeping an eye on her own hair while cleans  but it was very upsetting  The smell of the shower curtains was also incredibly unappealing and it was difficult to feel clean at any point during our stay  You were very responsive in your communication and we appreciated the convenience at check in  Thank you  There weren t dust bunnies all over the floor in the living and bedrooms  the closets were dusty  there was hair all over the bedding and towels  and the rug in the loving room was filthy  The shower curtain smelled bad  We ended up vacuuming  bought new shower curtains  Swiffer sweepers  and Clorox wipes  and cleaned ourselves 
401061333,Love the space  Only complaint other than the mold in the shower was that the coffee was expired and there were just a few lonely little beans in the bag  The unit was also so uncomfortably hot we ended up opening all the windows for the evening  Shower
580393993,Please fix the radiator in the bedrooms they hissed ALLLLLLLLL Night making it impossible to sleep other than that dishwasher was broke but we didn t need it Was something on the bathroom floor
616042470,I never received a key fob  Crumbs on counter  Had to wash dry the towels to get a wash cloth which there was only   of  Received checkout instructions after I was already gone  I came for a funeral there was so much going on i wanted to not have to think about the place im staying  I was embarrassed that i told my family to stay there   for my moms first airbnb experience to be like that Crumbs all over counter i had to wash to get a clean face cloth
618602674,Overall happy with the space but very unhappy with the lack of communication on the part of your company  I am owed       for having only   people in the apartment and I will be reaching out to Airbnb about this and how the maintenance issue was handled  Kitchen pots and pans were not clean  One pan in particular had been left in the oven and was covered in grime 
597125185,Thank you  Bed had some hair on it
594447134,We loved the location  We loved the building  The sheets were clean and soft  Natural light was beautiful  Attend to the issues that I mentioned and you will have happy guests Hi there the space we stayed in had a few small issues  One was the couch looked like it had never been vacuumed under or behind any cushions  One of the guests was told he could sleep on the couch but it was very dirty  We tried vacuuming but the vacuum is old and weak  I recommend a new better vacuum for the space and maybe a couch upgrade 
591609228,Biggest issue was the sink in the bathroom  which really didn t seem like it had been cleaned at all  The seats in the common area were also stained  which was a little off putting 
590470777,The bed had some hair on it as well as the pillows  There was also a yellow stain that was on the bed spread  We had to wash the blanket with our own money  We also had to travel to another building just to buy a    card to do the laundry  On top of that        to wash the actual blanket in our own building 
590092549,Hi  I really enjoyed my stay  thank you    Although there were a few issues   I wasn t sent the access code  the toilet was not cleaned properly and I wasn t informed of the works happening upstairs  It was really quite noisy and disruptive    One suggestion would be to add continental breakfast and small pantry items for making tea or coffee    Overall I had a pleasant stay  Toilet not cleaned properly
586273846,Your business model seems to be to fail to disclose crucial details about your listing  noise  and then deny there is a problem when guests complain  The reason I didn t respond to requests for further clarification about the other stuff  smoke detector  gross menstrual blood stains on a comforter  is that it was relatively nbd  but together with being awakened by truck beeping and dumpster rolling     days of our vacation  it made for a pretty shitty experience  Rest assured I will be escalating this to Airbnb and letting my many local friends  I m a native Hyde Parker  know never to rent from ZenCity  Tub was clogged  Comforters had bloodstains and dirt on them 
571983578,The location is great and five bedrooms with Q beds are terrific   allows a large group like ours to stay together  The beds are comfortable and rooms are pleasant  Thank you  That was all great  However  as I mentioned in the review  the kitchen really needs work   there are only four coffee cups and we were nine people  We had to take turns drinking coffee  and one day my husband drank his out of a bowl just so he could join us  There was no kitchen sink dish scrubber and no dish drying rack or pad  so we had to dry dishes in the dishwasher  also no soap in the shower so we bought that  Also  under the kitchen sink is pretty dirty  so you dont really want to use supplies from there  It feels like guests would really not want to spend time eating at the apartment  Also  the outside front door lock seems like it is breaking or something    it is very difficult to work  only a couple of us could get the key to work in it  While the apartment itself was very clean  there were no supplies with which to wash and dry dishes 
563978116,Old and scratchy place   Greasy black layer on the middle window frame next to the oven   With the first look  looks like dead flys all over on that frame  but happen to be old black pieces from falling apart sponge   Greasy ventilation outlets  some of them broken   Unpleasant smell coming from old and broken coach   Heavy and stale air  unhealthy and damaging my lungs  Second bedroom is with a penetrated hole  look from inside of the room  unpainted  scratches etc 
561429598,Some stray hairs in the bathroom  a pretty unpleasant smell in the building and the room  building was shabby and felt unsafe 
555353754,The bathroom shower curtain liner was caked with pink mold along the bottom  There was no actual shower curtain  just the liner   The bedroom was dusty under the bed  heater  and in the corners  including a layer of dust on the fan  There was no tea kettle  so I tried to heat water in the coffee maker  only to discover the bottom of the pot was cracked and unusable 
554599567,We had some problems with the heating  It didn t work in the morning late evening  but only during the day  when we were typically not in the apt    The bedrooms could use a paint job   a proper cupboard  Hair on pillows   floor
554079618,carpet was so dirty left dust on clothing when sitting on the floor  both beds had stains and hair on linens  the shower hasn t been cleaned in months at least and had several used bars of soap inside which is nasty
548402981,                                                      
546579271,Location is amazing  view is too  but some of the details need work  Used to work in quality control for vacation condos in Hawaii   details is what I do  Needs a good deep cleaning  Walls need scrubbing and so does the vent  Also seemed like the cleaners didnt bother to get underneath the bed  which is super visible since the bed frame is high off the floor
544234880,Dust under the bed  crumpled bedsheets with hair on them  living room carpet and sofa are seriously dirty 
669171326,It was hair left on the shower wall
569155597,Thank you for hosting us  Some suggestions would be to clean the carpet  when we walked in that was the first thing we noticed  It kinda made us feel like the whole place was not clean  The bed was very hard and we did not get a good nights sleep  Those were the only reasons why we gave your place a   star  Thanks again  Carpet was very dirty
536412666,Because of unfortunate circumstances  I would expect Zencity to be more accommodating and reasonable with resolving issues such as the one I had the day of check in  But  since I wasn t able to stay at all and had to leave bc of a member having a health emergency  I can t agree that Zencity is best at being understanding  A refund for a cleaning fee isn t enough  I expected a full refund since it wasn t my fault that this happened  But  since I got something in return  I can t say it s all bad and deserves   stars  I can t say because I wasn t there 
536360294,Bathroom floor was dirty  shower was not cleaned and the bed sheets had foot prints and hair on them   
530419563,Clean your bathtub  that s unacceptable  The bathtub had water in it and dirt in it  The tub drain was clogged  It was disgusting 
523025555,We couldnt find the place because the address you sent was inaccurate  It is not located at    N Kingshighway Blvd  North side of town is   minutes away by car  Baseboards were dusty  Human hair found on floor and walls of bathroom upon arrival 
522761898,Provide knives  additional silverware  and cutting boards in the kitchen  Provide detergent for the laundry room  Change the outdoor furniture to lower maintenance ones without fabric cushions  Patio area in the back had furniture cushions that had mold due to rain 
505615834,Although there were some nice things about your place  there were a few big issues we found disappointing  We liked having a washer and dryer  the beds were comfortable  bedrooms nice size and kitchen was okay  We also liked having our own bathrooms   I m glad there were only   of us  There were only   barstools  and a very small table to eat at   The kitchen had dirty dishes in the cabinet I had to wash before using  No forks  and the hands free soap dispenser in kitchen never did work  even with new batteries  What bothered me the most is the fact that the water had been turned off while we were gone one day  We came home about       pm  wanting to take showers and get cleaned up before going to bed  No water in our bathrooms  and only cold water in the kitchen   I had to email the host about it  I just gave up and went to bed  She sent me a response after I went to sleep  which woke me up  telling me there had been a leak somewhere and they had shut off the water  She told me to notify her in the morning if it wasn t back on   I had to turn the water on for awhile in AM  but it finally sputtered and eventually was hot  It was brown and disgusting coming out of the faucets  We had to run a complete washing cycle without clothes before we could run a load of laundry    This may not seem like much  but we really got a late start the next day because of all this  The sofa was dirty  Looked worn  He throw blanket draped over the sofa corner was very musty smelling   Dead flies and other insects in window well in kitchen 
503780622,There was all sorts of hair and dust on the top half of the bathroom door  It was disgusting  There was hair in the bathroom sink  There was an old  used band aid stuck to the bathroom shelf  The bathtub did not drain  The kitchen stove was splattered with food  The glasses in the cupboard were wet and dirty  The ceiling fan did not work  The kitchen and the bathroom walls were filthy and desperately needed to be cleaned or painted  The paint was peeling off the ceilings  Etc 
497470868,Leftover trash was not completely cleared out from the previous guest  One of the cabinets was filled with alcoholic beverage containers  Everything else in the house was extremely clean 
572682151,The location was great  The cleanliness was below sub par  I would recommend a cleaning crew between guests to make sure no used stuff is lying around from previous guests    On a smaller note   the record player was one of the reasons we chose this place  would have loved a response when I reported it broken or anytime other than an hour prior to check out  The place had not been cleaned in between guests  There was a used wash cloth hanging in the bathroom with someone else s soap  food smashed into the carpet in the living room and the kitchen appliances  microwave with food splatter everywhere and leaked food in the bottom of the fridge  were disgusting  The smell required us to keep the windows open the entire time we were there 
495791380,The apartment was great  Thank you so much for such a nice stay  The shower curtain has some mold growing on it 
494575697,Sofa in living room is pretty dirty  Didnt even want to sit on it    Also lingering odor  possibly because its an old building 
491787180,Thanks for being a great host  It was a great experience and I would definitely stay again if in the Chicago area  I would like to recommend you add a full length mirror to the outside or inside door of the closet beside the bathroom  It was pretty clean  The shower head had what looked like calcium deposits on it 
490442458,The bathroom needs mantainance and they need a new couch is super uncomfortable even for sitting there and even more for sleeping there  Besides it smells bad
488825132,Ive already addressed my issues with my experience at this location so I will not write them again  but the parking was insane      Bathroom sink had not been properly cleaned  There were brown spots under the items on sink  This was a clear indication that thorough cleaning hadnt been done inside the bathroom  However there was PLENTY cleaning supplies and I was able to clean myself  I actually left the dirty rag I used so you could see how many crevices had been overlooked 
484378238,Thanks for being super responsive to my requests  Check in and mgmt responses were the best Ive seen in any Airbnb host  Food in the microwave from previous guests  which wasnt a big deal but also suggested that it hadnt been cleaned out between stays 
480878800,Sheets needed cleaning  Found a few hairs that weren t mine in the bed 
479339807,There was a giant hole in the ceiling in the kitchen  Every single drawer in the entire place was peeling grossly   to the point where we wouldnt put anything in them  There were bugs in the whole apartment 
423633241,I feel that due to the condition of the house and the lack of cleanliness of the apartment  we should have the cleaning fee returned  as we did much of the cleaning ourselves  There were dirty washcloths in the bathtubs  stains and hair on the sheets and towels in the bedroom  the overall smell of the apartment was unsavory  the amount of crumbs and human nails that were found was appalling  and it seemed that the apartment hadn t been cleaned in quite a while  The sheets in the bedroom were stained and appeared unclean  There were used wash clothes in the bathroom  There were stains inside the cupboards and there was expired meat in the freezer  The living room was filthy with crumbs and dirt everywhere  Inside of the fouton there were crumbs and fingernails within the cracks as if it hadn t been cleaned for quite a while  My friend and I bought many cleaning supplies and had to clean in order to feel comfortable staying in the place 
470048099,Thank you for being quick to respond  and for offering to take care of the cleaning issue  It looked like everything was cleaned on the surface  but we had to give the shower and toilet a good scrub  There were crumbs on the sofa  and we had to wash all the plates and cutlery 
464023993,Facts     Found a dead cockroach in bedroom     Found little black hairs all over bathtub  which was eroding  and black hair in freezer     Floors wore filthy  do not walk barefoot in there     The fridge was disgusting with leftover food and what looked like fresh spilled kool aid stains everywhere    We complained  they came into the apartment while we were away WITHOUT OUR COSENT to  re clean   We returned to the same exact cockroach and kool aid stains  The only difference was now the place had a horrible smell of chemical cleaners  we couldnt breathe and had to open all windows and leave for quite a while     The water was BROWN coming out of the pipes when we initially turned on the bath water   awesome 
463105552,During my time in this space  it worked well with my busy schedule  but my overall satisfaction would increase if the space was thoroughly cleaned upon my arrival  I was very disappointed with the cleanliness of this space  Hair everywhere  Dishes in cabinets were dirty  Shower was dirty and clogged with hair and it turned into bath  Hair in the bed as if the sheets weren t clean  I immediately contacted the company after my upsetting observations and they offered to have someone come and clean  but I refused due to my short stay and not being comfortable with my belongings unattended because I was gone for the day  Very dissatisfied for the amount I paid for a dirty space and would like to be waved the cleaning fee because I came into a space that wasn t clean at all  Hair was on my clothes and in luggage when I returned home from travels 
460238714,The location was really nice and I loved hearing all the birds sing and seeing the leaves through the windows  There was lots of light and many amenities nearby  A new sofa and rug is definitely in order  The bed linens were really nice and fresh and so were the towels  The extra blanket was stained unfortunately  Thank you for responding so politely and quickly to all messages  Rug stained and had food and fingernail clippings  sofa completely worn out  dirty coffee maker and stove top  hair in bathroom  extra linens stained
566246496,Please process refund grievance  No idea   The lobby was fine 
366898165,Overall  I enjoy the Zencity experience  I think that this listing was poorly prepared for  but with some more attention in the cleaning department  this could have been a great experience  The dishwasher was still loaded with dirty dishes  which gave the impression that there were not enough dishes in the unit   There was broken glassware in the cabinets  and dried spills in the bathroom that tracked throughout the apartment 
347130369,Hair all over the bathroom floor  in the tub  Had not been cleaned recently   Hair of all kinds in bed and bugs on the floor 
335990209,Having multiple keys that access any unit is a safety hazard  We were mortified to have arriving tenants able to open our unit waking us up at  am  That s really unacceptable  Light fixtures are really dusty  And there are few outlets so tangled of extension cords wrap around the old steam radiator which gets very hot thus creating a potential safety hazard as those cords make contact with the hot radiator 
332195580,there was a lot of dust almost in the whole building 
330406480,Thank you for letting us experience Hyde Park  Overall  for the price  basically fees and taxes  we feel we could have gotten more from a hotel downtown  The shower curtain needs to be shortened in and out of the shower  that was a real hazard and we obviously werent the first to experience this  as one loop had been previously torn  The window ledge needs to be trimmed by      as well  There was nearly no hot water  ever  and the toilet needed finessing just to flush a few squares of tp  Im not sure how someone is supposed to safely hang towels above that radiator when it is in use  There was no hair dryer that I saw yet there was a flat iron  I brought my own regardless  because I didnt see it listed  The cleanliness was the ultimate for us as we were charged for the cleaning fee and Im sure the person before us was as well  yet the kitchen wasnt clean  It looked very pretty in pictures but to more accurately represent the place and avoid disappointment  Id suggest a message regarding the finicky ways of an old building and for the love of Pete  grease the hinges on the main doors  Creaky floors are one thing  but those doors made so much noise  The work throughout the studio was a little sloppy when you see it in person  and seems to have been done hastily to make it rent able  Id also close off the   storage closet to make it less janitorial and more comfortable throughout the joining spaces  There was a leak or some sticky substance by the trash can which was still wet and food left in the fridge 
323453574,The apartment was great  overall  The kitchen and bathroom were thoughtfully stocked  and I appreciated the smaller touches like the phone charging station on the nightstand  I think there are a few things that could improve it even more for future guests  As I mentioned in earlier feedback  I did see     cockroaches during the night on several occasions  I dont think this reflects on your management of the apartment  nor was there any food dishes left out to attract them  but this is definitely something to address  One other important thing is that there were blinds in the closet that looked like they were meant to be put on the bedroom windows  but had not been hung up  This meant I had to choose between privacy with the curtains and using the air conditioner fan unit  since the curtains cover the unit  which was a mild inconvenience  A couple amenities that would have made the place more comfortable are an actual chair for the desk instead of the stool and a full length mirror somewhere in the apartment  I think this is a building issue that is not your fault and should be brought up with your landlord  but I saw cockroaches on all occasions that I was awake past   AM 
309110351,You need to have a thorough audit of the property to do the needed repairs  And also improve cleanliness  Also I suggest when there are problems you should call back rather than continuing to communicate via email   Dirty dishes in the dishwasher   The stairs are full of stains and there were dead insects in the stairs and living room 
305088132,Kitchen and bathroom both were a bit dirty  
295976164,Hi Chris  Thanks again for letting us stay in your apartment  Overall  it was a good place to come back to after pair long days walking and seeing the great city of Chicago  A couple things we d recommend to spruce up the place for future occupants would be to fix the shower as the pipes were backing up from the first shower we took to the last even after using Drain O  A mesh would help this in the future to catch all the hair and crud  We would also recommend adding a more comfortable couch  The low back makes it difficult to lay back and relax  We ended up using our pillows to create a higher back  Besides that  the place was comfortable  and the amenities were great  The small office area was perfect for me to get the little work in I needed to get to on my laptop while watching tv    Further  we were a bit disappointed the washer and dryer were not functional  Part of our decision to book this place was to have that amenity  since we were coming from another destination and in need of washing out clothes  We had to take other measures to make sure we had enough clean clothes  We would have chosen another place if we would have known this was not available    Lastly  we did enjoy the kitchen  the tv  the closet  and the overall spaciousness of the apartment  We never felt cramped  which made us feel at home  We also really liked the balcony set up  although we weren t able to use it due to the weather   The neighborhood is wonderful and the location of the apartment was perfect for food and public transportation options  Overall  we appreciate the time we spent in Chicago  Cheers  The bathtub was backing up from the day we got there  The final day was terrible as I had to use the plunger to drain the tub  When plunging  a bit of dirt was coming up  I used the Drain O I found under the kitchen sink  but it was not effective  May need to use a snake to clean out the pipes  Recommendation is to put a mesh to catch all the hair and crud that could plug up the tub in the future  
286202203,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs  towels and linens  Additional comments   The extra blanket in the closet was dirty and had stains on it   
276369295,That futon has to go    It is so uncomfortable  In addition  the AC wasn t on when we arrive and it was very warm  Took hours to cool down   Lastly  glassware was put in cabinets dirty     Other than those few things  great location and good place   Apartment was clean  but when we went to use the glassware they all had figure print and lip marks   
269680133,Hi Chris  A couple of suggestions      It would be helpful to guests to tell them the apartment unit is all the way at the end of the building  The units do not go in numerical order and that was a bit confusing     The shower needs a little love  I think a new shower curtain without stains and a good scrubbing of the tile  There were some mold spots as well  Also  the shower pressure wasnt good  I dont know if it is the shower head or just an older apartment building  but it wasnt great     The air conditioner didnt get very cold  Not sure if its old or what     I couldnt find a scissors in the apartment  That would be a good gadget to have in the kitchen  I used a knife  which worked  but a scissors would have been better     Some other places weve stayed had a listing of sights or places to go see  maybe a book or something would be helpful  Also  directions for the Metra or map or something like that  We used our phones  but something physical might be helpful   Just some suggestions  overall it was  nice place to stay  thanks   Bathroom shower needed a new shower curtain and had some mold spots on the walls ceiling that could of been cleaned better 
252433934,Great place  simple and easy to get to  Concierges were very helpful  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
248453663,This really was the best Airbnb Ive stayed in as far as amenities  All those little touches really made a difference such as the vases w silk flowers  bath mat  hair dryer  umbrella  laundry detergent  body lotion  air freshener  I would suggest having a fan as well that guess could plug in and moved from room to room as needed  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  towels and linens  odors  Additional comments   You may want to check with the building as the entryway from the lobby to the elevator and the hallways smell terrible this may be a deterrent to future guests   
239192448,Chris  I dont want to give you the wrong impression from comments above   We did enjoy staying at your place   it was mostly good  and you communicated clearly and on time   Wishing you continued success   Shower wasnt as clean as I would have liked    
231955368,Hi Chris  again a great stay in Chicago   The place was clean and ready for us when we arrived   The front desk staff were awesome     A couple of notes that would make the stay even better   Two keys available   When possible  get a new couch   The sofa is uniquely horrible to sit on   Just my two cents   Thanks again   Donna 
231772416,Great location  Excellent host   
231339693,Thanks Chris  it was a very nice place to stay  Kate 
230923967,Everything was great  
229038202,I had a wonderful experience and will definitely come back to stay here again  Thanks for hosting me  
229001364,Thanks for letting me crash at your pad  I loved the space and will use it again   
228228514,Thank you  
224592178,Chris  so enjoyed my time at your place  and appreciate your quick and helpful communication   Your place was perfect for what I needed   I might recommend a   pager guide to the amazing building your place is in   the front desk staff was really helpful but there are so many great amenities in the building that people might not know about or know how to find if they dont think to or dont feel comfortable enough to ask   Thanks again  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  common areas  Additional comments   A little dusty   no big deal   
218416067,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom 
192928879,Hi Chris  Really appreciate the flat had netflix etc but the place was a little grimy  Lots of cob webs dust and the bathroom had a bit of a moldy smell  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  shower  floors and carpet  Additional comments   Unforutnaly the whole place was a little grimy  even saw a couple of bugs in the bathroom   Lots of cobwebs and dust on the floor   
173691007,Thanks for the stay Chris  Great location   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  shower  dust  bathroom  kitchen 
164288123,Thanks Chris   Overall the location was fantastic as i used to live in wicker park so it was easy for me to get around   Internet was good   Check in and check out was superb   Plenty of toilet tissue  paper towels   Cons are there was a bad odor in the bathroom   Shower was pretty basic too  where the shower head can be replaced   The noise upstairs was pretty bad too  can basically hear everything they do upstairs  even the dogs footsteps  And of course it was whining a lot   Other than those  i think the place is neat and the bed was comfortable  Thanks for being a good host  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  odors  shower 
159769196,Unfortunately  we won t be able to provide you with a five star review due to multiple issues we had with our stay in your residence  as well as the service with you as a host     The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price  The building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that it s in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator and freezer  as well as faulty hardware in the bathroom  We also noticed that the dishware was not properly cleaned and had yellow caked on residue from previous usage    We mentioned this to you during our stay  but the unprofessionalism of constantly needing to visit the residence during our stay really made us feel uncomfortable  and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays  let alone hotel stays for comparable price points  The need for you to schedule a showing of the space during our stay is completely unacceptable  And the need to retrieve a garment for a  supposedly  previous guest while we were staying there makes no sense to us  Why couldn t these things be handled after our stay was finished     Furthermore  the fact that you were unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at your other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didn t settle well with us  Frankly  it pissed us off  and we would have much rather have canceled the second reservation if we knew we wouldn t incur this ridiculous fee again  Especially since we had booked a longer stay at your other listing  You have every opportunity to refund this charge  AirBnB doesn t hold you to this  We ve already sent a refund request  yet we see that you are much more interested in taking advantage of funds from potential guests     All in all  we are completely unsatisfied with you as a host  and even though your Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area  we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing    Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  towels and linens  dust  odors  bathroom  kitchen  Additional comments   The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator  
155112720,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  shower  towels and linens  Additional comments   There were no washclothes in the bathrooms  also only one dish towel in the kitchen  made it difficult to do the sishes  
153995454,I dont think expecting us to be out of a place we are paying for so that the property can be shown is poor business   We felt like we had to be out of the property on Saturday Bc of the showing  and your email regarding it made it feel that way too  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  towels and linens  Additional comments   Towels thrown on floor of closet    
150256451,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  bathroom 
590797203,There was an issue with the internet and keeping Netflix going  Other than that the place was a delight to stay  There was hair in the tub around the fixtures 
96588694,I sent you a list of these issues  Hair in the bathroom  hair on the bed sheets  pee stains on the bedsheets  dirty walls and doors  
94139776,The bathroom is not as clean as it should be  The bathtub in particular is in bad need of Comet and elbow work   The shower curtain is stained with mold  There were only two towels  albeit clean  but not to the standards I would expect for an Airbnb   The rooms carpet is old and needs better care   The kitchen and living room space are ok 
91424776,Apartment was dirty  Cleaning team did not come until hours after our  pm check in  Even after the cleaning team came  the sheets and towels were dirty  Bathroom and floors did not seem clean either 
80979974,There was long black hair all over the floors and in the shower  Neither my wife or I have black hair  so I am assuming the space was not cleaned before we arrived  Floor in kitchen near sink was sticky 
62123258,""
709601454,Thank you   This is a magnificent space      You all were very helpful  Stains on bed covering 
618137059,I think our experience warrants a discount and refund of partial funds for our stay  It was terrible  Dirty towels and refrigerator 
710264371,Bathroom still had trash from last guest an shower had dust an hair in it an toilet still had poo an paper in it  Wouldnt blame zencity as a whole  But they need new housekeeping for sure 
700423059,Was disappointed that the bed sheets were not clean  especially in COVID era  and especially after the apartment is advertised as obsessively clean  I took pictures of the stains as well  Also  parking was a challenge   Generally  beautiful and spacious  and stylish decor  Easy check in  Dirty sheets on the bed  Flat sheet had crumbs of food  Top comforter had different sauces crusted on it  Faint cigarette smell on the sheets and pillows 
669386267,Great location  bright and sunny  We would return  The overall unit was very clean  A few items could be improved to make the unit top notch  Comforter cover is soiled  Shower curtain has mold along the bottom edge  Some sections of Living room curtains are hanging off the railings 
569779036,Thanks for sharing your space  It was a great location and just a short train ride to the heart of the city   My only thought is that the cleaning fee did not match my expectation of how clean I would find it   The amount implied it would be clean plus   If it s hired out  I would check the work of whoever is doing it before the next guest arrives  especially since you charge so much for the cleaning fee   Also  I would set out towels for two at least   We found an extra towel with hair on it in the closet but none of us wanted to use it   Just sharing details so you can be informed but we really loved the space in general   Thanks again Dirty plates left in cabinet and hairs left in the bathroom
668706993,Outdoor furniture
626692727,Super cute place  I d stay again just please clean better There were stains on the bed sheets and carpet  and there was clearly stuff on the floors and couch pillows that hadn t been cleaned 
627576287,there was a lot of dust especially around the windows and blinds
614909576,Great stay  Parking at library was very convenient   Didnt know about Game room until we checked out  Had fun  Only negatives I would mention are the top of the fridge and baseboard by the couch lamp  Overlooked by cleaning staff  Top of fridge looked like hadnt been clean in months  A piece of  something   was on the baseboard by the couch lamp  Other than that  impeccable 
669413008,The place is awesome  I would recommend to my friends   I would provide salt and pepper packets   I understand you have to be safe   I would also have maintenance come before the last day of visit  or dont bother    Major irritation both in Monday and Tuesday  Thank you again  Sink kept backing up and did not get fixed until an hour before i was leaving 
569188125,Hi there   I enjoyed staying at your Airbnb  It s centrally located to a lot of local shops and restaurants  Check in was simple and easy and your communication was prompt  However the cleanliness for parts of the apartment was sub par  I was rather disgusted by the various stray hairs in the shower wall and base of the tub  Some were straight  some were curly  There was a noticeable amount  There was some construction debris upon entering the apartment  it appears the washer and dryer were installed and no one gave the floors a good sweep or vacuum  I felt like I couldn t walk around with bare feet due to the dirt and dust  Besides those points I did enjoy my stay  I hope you forward this feedback to your cleaning crew so that future visitors won t have the same experience   Kind regards  Gordon There were quite a few various stray hairs in the wall of the shower and base of the tub  There was construction debris in the entrance hallway  I believe the washer and dryer were installed they failed to clean up the dust left behind 
613215318,Thank you for being understanding of the late checkout  I really appreciate your service     Kenyana It appeared that the cleaning service skipped over the bathrooms  Also  the refrigerator was leaking   Although there were some cleaning issues  management compensated for this by allowing a very late checkout  Overall we worked with each other to find a happy medium 
613359193,Not sure if I want to stay in any units by Zencity  bc of the ignorance  Floor looks not cleaned for long long time  liquid spill markings in number of places over the laminated floor areas  white chalk like powder by the basebords  totally dirty all over the appartment  carpet in bedrooms not vaccumed  old spilled liquid residues in the fridge  glass or coffee cup rings on the countertop  old toothpaste markings on the bathroom sink area  dirty kitchen sink area  dirty utensils 
647413507,Never received a response to my message asking for the thermostat code  It was way too cold in the unit and you never had the decency to even respond to my message  Hopefully enough negative reviews put you in your place  Toilet seat is filthy and needs to be replaced 
643410720,Thank you  We enjoyed our stay  There was a little garbage left on the floor when we entered  I m sure it was just dropped from the cleaning service otherwise good 
628282353,Attention to detail 
627998246,The walls need a cleaning  there was gunk in the bathroom and the carpet needs a cleaning around the floor boards  The balcony was extremely sticky  As well as in the kitchen there was food in the freezer and the trash can had gunk around the lid  Lastly  there were stains on the comforters  Not to say the stay was awful due to this  I just wanted to bring it to your attention  because although it didn t totally bother me  it could someone else  And I assume it is someone else taking care of cleaning the stay other than the hosts 
633348077,Thank you for being responsive and allowing me the space for the weekend  Great value  Very comfortable Refrigerator was not clean 
647381113,Some towels didn t smell clean   smelt like cigarettes 
566534978,Hair in the bathtub  Otherwise very clean 
592695957,I appreciate you hosting our stay but I m very disappointed that with your communication on addressing my concerns  There was hair everywhere  Food on the floors  in different area of the home    cereal  pizza crusts  crackers   Streaks in the toilet  urine and toilet paper in the other unclean bath   Comforters were filthy   Spider webs hanging in very visible places  The was old food and drinks left in the refrigerator  Floors hadn t been swept or mopped 
619220055,N A I don t know where to start  I walked in the door  eyes heavy  legs stiff  with hopes of going straight to bed  However I choose my room  put down my bags  walk over to the bed  and I saw the most despicable thing on what was supposed to be a freshly made bed    A HAIR  I begin to inspect the rest of the room  long story short there were chips crumbs in the carpet  Also hair all over the rest of the bed  and might I add all the hair was a different color and texture  There was piss all over the bathroom floor  so I guess you could say this pissed me off  I made my boyfriend clean it up  he then got pissed off with me  While he cleaned the forsaken piss  I proceeded to inspect the rest of the apartment  I walk in the living room and you ll never guess what I discovered   A HAIR  I also found more of what I presumed to be Doritos from the bed and dust bunnies  Luckily I found a candle under the sink to take away the OVERPOWERING miasma of what I believe to be marijuana  Needless to say the cleanliness of your establishment is why I declare this apartment highly inadequate 
571923733,We purchased cleaning supplies and cleaned due to guests who had considerable mold allergies 
360471410,The place was better than expected  It s was an very strong sewage smell that came about every so often 
572007068,Slawik  I suggest adding curtains before your next guess  Bare windows work well in suburban areas but not on a busy street like Truman road  I felt a lack of privacy and warmth  However the place is great and your response to my need is very much appreciated  Beautiful tub in the masters suite  however the window over the tub could use cleaning   paint and an upgrade 
628262784,the rooms are very nice and clean that was wonderful   other people staying there was very loud and obnoxious in behavior that is unacceptable in my book hallways dirty someone had gotten sick all over the hallway floor
628325212,Thank you for providing the place  It was a stylish spot  just bothered by the insects  Really the only major issue were the flies and gnats  Unfortunately there were several throughout kitchen and bedroom 
647368223,Beautifully decorated  Very comfortable and great location  Tub in bathroom needs to be scrubbed and bleached
623266665,This has been the worst and most dishonest experience on Airbnb ever  I booked nd they repsonded  will let you know within    hours   Since I needed the place that same night I cancelled  They charged my card for the whole   day stay which included cleaning  I did contact airbnb to resolve but Zencity said they had a very strict refund policy  I got nothing for my       They simply took all of my money for the whole   day stay  Cleaning fees and airbnb fees  Taxs etc   A reputable company would never behave like this  BE VERY CAREFUL when handing over your credit card to this dishonest company  They charged me for a cleaning fee and I never used the place
648358224,shower curtain smelled musty  needs replacing  Need vacuuming under the couch   strewn with various pieces of garbage  kid toys  etc  Building in general has a slightly unpleasant odor to it
618603052,kitchen sink had dried food particles fingernail clipping on floor general unclean floor lint on furniture hair in bathroom on floor  toilet  sink  and shower common areas of the hotel were very dirty   in need of vacuuming  painting  cleaning
628678894,Dirty utensils  hair in the drawers
649028024,There was a little bit of mold in both the shower window  and when I opened the dishwasher I saw a large amount of mold growing on the dishwasher door 
644760863,I was gonna give you a low score on cleanliness but I love your space and rather let you know privately as your space is beautiful   You were also very hospitable and allowed me a late check out  Thank you   Notes  Trash under the bed of bedroom across the hall from bathroom  Trash under Couch in living room  Please take care  Thank you  Trash under the bed of bedroom across the hall from bathroom  Trash under Couch in living room 
673440870,Thanks the location was great  Place needs a deep cleaning on comforters and drapery and tile  The WiFi never worked or us  Couldn t log into the zen city account  Staining on the bed comforters  Not sure the sheets were changed in one room  They smelled like men s aftershave 
627116132,You may want to use a paint with some sheen ink it  if you ever repaint  That would keep the walls from staining   Which in my eyes was the only real drawback besides the mouse  Needing head what appears to be a makeup stain on it  Which made me more uncomfortable than not being clean 
627670802,Everything was ok  besides having to deal with the ceiling leaking in the bathroom are whole stay The ceiling around the vent area leaked the whole entire time
704901243,The bottom fitted sheet needs to be a bigger size  as it pops off at the corners all the time  There were dust bunnies in the corner and long black curly hairs in the bed and on the floor 
616005143,Normally I would not leave a note here but the bathroom cleanliness left quite a bit to be desired   I hope your cleaner was just having an off day and that this was not the norm  The floor looked as though it had not been swept  I swept it with the provided broom not long after arriving and there was quite a bit of dirt hair TP bits etc    the shower walls tub had clearly not been wiped down  I wiped it down with provided cleaner and rag   and the toilet rim had very obviously not been wiped down  dust  urine drips  etc  were clearly present   The rest of the apartment appeared to be clean  but if you are charging guests a cleaning fee  it seems like you would make the restroom a priority as every single guest uses the restroom and that is where the most germs are present   Also   you may want to be more detailed in the individual building amenities  I had no idea that the building had a hot tub or coffee machines  and wasnt positive that they were available to me as a temporary guest  Knowing both of those things wouldve been an even bigger selling point in addition to the stylish space    Overall it was an excellent stay and I will definitely be back  Bathroom cleanliness left quite a bit to be desired  The floor looked as though it had not been swept  I swept it with the provided broom not long after arriving and there was quite a bit of dirt hair TP bits etc    the shower walls tub had clearly not been wiped down  I wiped it down with provided cleaner and rag   and the toilet rim had very obviously not been wiped down  dust  urine drips  etc  were clearly present   The rest of the apartment appeared to be very clean 
621358562,Thank you so much for being so accommodating last minute  The place worked out great  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  odors  Additional comments   Mainly in the hallway to the apartment   
640107683,Wonderful place overall loved the things I would maybe suggest are adding a note that the sliding glass door automatically locks to help avoid the situation my mother and grandmother went through and maybe a glance over after cleaning just to make sure all surfaces and underneath furniture was not forgotten about  Thank you so much for the stay and wonderful communication  There looked to be some sort of peanut and other debris under the couch and overall debris in the living room and kitchen they seem to have not been cleaned it quite a while
710766159,Thanks so much for the stay  We enjoyed the space  The fans and trim were really dusty  and there were hairs on the shower and sink
616998993,There was a couch left right outside the door    looked a little run down  Not what I expected 
190586362,Awesome place  Chris  Very smooth  and well directed  I will be inquiring next time Im in Chicago  Thank you for the pleasant stay  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  floors and carpet 
664440253,Floors were not mopped  Big stain on rug  Soap on shower wall  Sheets STINKED  I know those sheets and comforter were not changed 
646422186,Thanks again for letting us stay in your home  Mold in the ceiling in one of the bedrooms  and dust on the blinds around the home 
623939793,The shower handle needs to be replaced it has been noted in many reviews the dirty couch as well  Thank you for sending someone to clean the second day that did make a big difference for me  Over all wasn t a bad stay  I feel the only way to have the adjustments made is through the review as you guys didn t fix the issues reported so many times before  Thank you for hosting  The home was not freshly cleaned upon arrival  It felt eeeky   The bathroom smelled like a sewer  The carpet was dirty  The place felt dusty  The couch was awful  Full of stains  I didn t stay my first night  So I lost my money  I told zencity about these things  They did not refund my first night  However they did send someone to clean the unit the second day and it was much better after that  Except the couch just needs to be replaced 
616467131,Maybe you should try hiring a new house maid or having someone inspect the properties personally bcuz both my units were not clean  I had  dust the hangers off along with cleaning out the microwaves  the refrigerators  the tubs and sweep the floors  Not   mention the bed sheets and pillow cases were filled with different types of hair so I didnt even sleep on the beds at either   of the units  The doorman even had to take the trash out bcuz it was left in the room  I also purposely placed seeds underthe chair in one unit and behind the table in the other and it wasnt cleaned  Its probably still there if you wana go and see for yourself bcuz I doubt she cleaned the rooms properly  Theres so much more than an unclean room that I endured   I will just say that I will not be renting anymore Zencity properties   also  I do not appreciate the way the man by the name of Marty didnt handle the situation I was in but I am sure you let everybody know  I have photos   video footage of how the place was when I checked in  I had   clean up myself   I still didnt sleep in the bed  The doorman that checked me in even had   take the trash out when I checked in bcuz It was full  I even purposely poured sunflower seeds on the floor under the chair that was there and I went back in the unit the night after I checked out due   my wallet missing and after the cleaning lady left   guess what was still there   Sunflower seeds  under the chair    Besides these units being unclean bcuz I had   different units    I will NEVER rent from them again  my wallet seemed to magically disappear when I was the only   in the unit besides the cleaning lady   Thats not even the half of it     Way   much   write but I will say I spoke to  of the owners of Zencity by the name of Marty and he didnt help the situation at all  He didnt even care  Told me hell call me back and a week later I still hadnt gotta call back so I called him and he didnt even care  remember who I was    And the Way he was talking  me really pissed me off  I have also told my family   friends to stay away from Zencity properties as well 
645256351,We appreciate the effort you all made  but the units lack of cleaning was extremely off putting  especially given coronavirus  The bathroom contained the biggest issues  The drawers were full of hair  the shower still had hair both in it and on the wall  and there was a used towel hanging on the shower curtain rod  The comforter on the bed had hair on it as well  Upon mentioning our concern to the host  the host offered to send someone to clean  However  no one ever came 
669905030,Thank you again for a wonderful stay  Still had a great time and would love to come back 
627862021,Id take a look at the cleaning company and general maintenance   They could have been much better  especially related to the dirty bathroom and chirping fire alarms   I do appreciate the communication and the accommodation of a different room when the fire alarm sounded in the space   There does seem to be a couple of roof leaks that created the problem with the fire alarm in the living room   I love the apartment space  view and location   Top notch  Some towels left in the hamper  trash was not taken out and there was a slow drain in the sink
619857115,Thanks for getting me such a modern and inexpensive stay  The atmosphere is wonderfully private  but this definitely felt more like a robotic business transaction  Im completely fine with this  but I think others would be offended lol  Many blessings to you  Curly hairs on the bathroom floor  sheets had an old stain on them  Other than that  everything was sparkling clean 
703760845,bugs noticed to crawl behind crevices behind bathroom walls and kitchen counters  bathroom and closet wafted of marijuana at specific times of the day  and unfortunately my Louis Vuitton Keepall brought this aroma home with it
514116931,Overall a positive experience  Your location is fantastic  Your recommendations and speedy communication were greatly appreciated  Check in and check out were a breeze  The only downside was the cleaning issue  But overall we enjoyed our stay  There were several very long hairs throughout the bathroom  in the shower  sink  and around the toilet  My partner and I both have short hair so it must have been left by someone else  Also  I found broken glass next to the bed 
650177993,The water tasted off 
621537820,Thanks for the quick responses  especially to Marty and Ava for helping when I felt uncomfortable with the construction and electronic lock  The place was clean upon arrival  however  due to roof construction for the first   days  small debris and dust regularly fell from the walls and ceiling onto the floor  becoming a daily chore that I had to clean up 
348035318,The apartment had not been cleaned thoroughly  Laundry behind the drapes  a panful of food in fridge and old bread in cabinet 
626826592,Your company needs to be more responsive to customers when there is a problem   Your customer service was very disappointing   You can read the chain of emails between me and your representatives  The entire apartment smelled like cigarette and or marijuana smoke when we checked in   We notified the manager   Zencity   who basically shrugged their shoulders and did nothing   Their first response was to look for cleaning supplies under the kitchen sink  and there were not any there that might have helped    We found the packaging for an air filter and  smoke trapping ashtray  in a kitchen cabinet  so putting   and   together a smoker had been staying there   Zencity appartently did nothing to get rid of the smell before we arrived  in spite of the prominent notice in the apartment that no smoking is allowed and there is a      extra cleaning fee for smoking   We left the windows open day and night and it did reduce the odor but did not get rid of it   That led to other problems because the weather was rainy and variable and it was hard to keep the apartment at a livable temperature   And for   nights there were people partying on the building roof above us very late  so we could not keep the windows open because of the loud noise   By the way  there are big signs on both rooftop entrances saying that area is closed  but that apparently did not stop groups of heavy drinkers on   nights   We sent an email to  Zencity asking them to consider refunding     of our total charges  and the their answer has been   silence 
669413907,Hair in toilet and on the toilet seat  Hairs in bed  dirty marks on tables and spots on couch  The stove also had big dirt spots and dishes in the cabinet that were supposed to be clean were wet and dripping with water 
630079416,Thank you for your hospitality  Please check your dishwasher  I think it needs repair   You know we had an issue with the Wi Fi    and we were not able to watch TV   Also  It could be better in this pandemic time to provide some paper towels and sanitizer  Thank you for your quick responses  The refrigerator has some residue of dried liquid 
627349137,Have blinds for the sake of peoples privacy  security needs to be updated anybody can just get in  have real cleaning personal that cares and takes there job seriously clean your units communicate with those that you are hosting  Mice are in the buildings walls  bathroom was disgusting with thick dirt on toilet  and shower mate was cloth and smelled of mildew  dishes where dirty
626809238,Overall my stay was great with the exception of things being a bit dirty and no rooftop access  Great finishings in the unit  great neighborhood  good value  Roach at check in  live mouse day    dead mouse on floor end of day    water leak from wall  fridge had stains on surfaces  bar stools covered with crumbs  floor sticky in spots 
621669099,Floor had food crumbs and hair all over  especially the rug 
630121342,What I told you about the bedroom but I loved it Your blinds are messed up I just don t want you to think I did that but other then that I loved it
624934962,While there were some cleanliness and communication issues  overall our stay at the apartment was very pleasant and we would come back again  When we arrived  it was obvious that countertops had not been wiped down thoroughly as there were multiple watermark rings evident  Some glasses and plates were stuck to cabinet shelves  or hadnt been cleaned fully in the dishwasher  so they had to be ran in the dishwasher again  There were hairs in one of the bathroom sinks  and the trash had not been emptied in the other bathroom  There was also a large sticky spot right at the apartment entry kitchen area that we had to mop down    Given the obvious lack of attention given to cleaning and the current pandemic situation  we had to wipe the whole place down with disinfecting wipes when we arrived  as we werent sure which other areas  light switches  door handles  etc  could have possibly been missed 
625264935,The rug needed to be vacuumed as there was hair everywhere  The dishes in the cabinets were not clean 
652851634,Thank you for being great host but some people may want front wall painted over if their really picky  stayers   Really nice home and I appreciations the  hr extension Just minor details of mopping and dishes
512754967,Hallway floors were sticky  I tried to vacuum but the vacuum that was there just spouted more stuff out than in 
341715111,Great place except for the shower curtain  Also  it would be great to have a little coffee for the in the morning  since theres a coffee press in the apartment  The place could use a new shower curtain  but otherwise all the rest was clean
627810088,Great place  beautiful pool thank you The kitchen trash dispenser had trash from a previous renter  Also we found a piece of cloth in one of the bedrooms 
672710113,If you are going to count on the doorperson to check in guests you need to have a way for the guest to contact the doorperson so they dont have to stand outside the building    You need to hire another cleaning company because this one is not doing a good job   I was very disappointed in the cleanliness   I can forgive a lot at places I am staying but not cleanliness    You should let your guests know before booking or at least at booking if the water to the unit is going to be shut off   At the very least a discount should be given for the time the water is shut off      It is really too bad because the location is perfect   The building is right next door to my daughters building and if my experience had been better I would be rebooking every couple of months  The whole place felt a bit grimy  all the dishes has a grease film on them and had to be washed before using  the table was dirty and it was not well dusted    You could tell it wasnt cleaned well   Most Airbnbs are clean because the owners take pride in them   This felt more like a budget motel in terms of cleanliness 
621054093,Thank you for the hospitality  It was a nice place  The only thing I really have a complaint about is that walking in  you can tell the tenants were smokers  You can still smell the cigarettes  Other than that  it was a great stay  Also  someone wrote on the chalkboard a number for a blow job  Which I thought was odd  Dishes weren t washed properly  Some were still dirty and placed in the cabinets
420774671,Everything was good except for the smell and slow responses  It seems a lot of thought went into making the apartment feel like home  very convenient courtesies   Perhaps add a micro USB charger  Samsung  other non Apple devices   There was an odd smell emanating from the bathroom  but to be fair  it may have been and issue in multiple floors of the building not owned by Zencity 
564354456,Thank you very much I really appreciated the stay and the accommodation of your place  Sofa in the living area hat some serious stains on it 
621072318,The space was nice until I found a mouse   I think you all should consider plugging up the holes around the space  laundry room area  bathroom  and put a door guard under the doors  There was a mouse in the kitchen  and we didnt leave food out 
621669753,Dishwasher leaks 
531889080,Votre emplacement est vraiment bien   par contre on repenserais la disposition de la pi ce parceque la lumi re du soleil refl te dans la t l vision  peut  tre des stores plus opaques   Aussi il manque de d coration  a pourrais  tre plus chaleureux  et un mirroir plein pied serais vraiment le bienvenu  Aussi il manque une p le   serviette dans la salle de bain et le tapis de douche est vraiment petit et inefficace   D tail de comfort  une commande   distance pour l air climatis     Nous avons vraiment appr cier le super emplacement de votre appartement  pr s de Boystown et     minute du m tro   Merci aussi pour votre  coute et votre rapidit    r pondre  La seule raison que je ne donne pas cinq  toile c est que le balcon  tait tr s sale et pour cette raison nous n avons pas profiter de s assoir dehors   
618022259,I actually almost did not choose this because of the unknown with the parking  However I was very pleasantly surprised  They only charges    per day in their parking ramp if I paid in cash to the security guard  The security guards were very cordial and did not act like we were a burden to them  The bathroom witthe window had a toilet that probably cant get cleaned   possibly due to age  The first impression was that it was dirty but I dont think that was the case  Also   with the wood blind in the shower there was paint peeling and there was a smell of wet wood  However  overall we loved the place  We are mentioning this to help improve it 
664080907,Thanks for your great communication and clear check in and check out instructions  The neighbors were friendly and the location was great  General updating would make this stay even better  fresh coat of paint and some deep cleaning would go a long way  My previous comments were picky but some things that would significantly improve the environment of the apartment  The furniture was very nice and in good condition with the minor exception of a stain on the chair in the smaller bedroom  Thanks so much for your help in making our St  Louis trip a success  The towels and sheets were very crisp and clean  Overall we had a great experience but these are some areas that need to be addressed especially for the price of the stay  The floor was dirty  Base boards were dirty and had water damage  the shower had mildew along the base  the garbage can was dirty as was the wall behind the garbage can there was old garbage on the wall  The blinds were broken and the toilet paper rack fell off the wall during regular usage 
622864247,After I left host asked me to pay for a Pillow that was drawn on which was not for me for a payment of     which I accepted and paid  which I should not have  after that then they requested another    for the same issue 
622515831,Loft is nice however kitchen faucet hot water drips out and the shower hot water last every bit annoy   minutes Condom wrapper behind night stand
623025147,Just work on cleanliness before arriving other than that it was very good As you know the bed wasn t changed and floors were not clean  sink was dirty and no laundry soap
708727173,Living room carpet could ve been cleaner 
249762883,Loved the location and the view  I wish I could have adjusted the temperature  but I didnt see a way to do that  I would definitely return  I know Im being a bit picky  but thought you would like to know these things  Overall  its very comfy  And again  great location   Mostly great but vent in bathroom needs dusting  Light by the bed  near the window  is not working  
706575540,I really enjoyed the stay here  I would just like to suggest a more thorough cleaning  it wasn t super dirty  but could use more attention to detail  and to add a wine bottle opener  We noticed the decanter  aerator and wine stoppers and assumed there would be a bottle opener  but after returning from the store with our bottle of wine we realized there was no way to open it  Not a big deal  but was not swept   dust dirt on floors and a lot under bed  and stove top not wiped off from last guest  Bar accessories were dusty and had to be washed before use 
705466021,This rental was pretty much what was expected knowing that it is in an older building  Besides the items weve already listed there are a few other safety things to list  There is exposed electrical connections in the under sink area in the kitchen  wires with wire nuts possibly being exposed to water   Some of the ceiling fan lights remained  on or flickering  when either turning off or on  or shutting just the lights off on the fans in both the living room and front bedroom  Thermostat is loose in the wall  Most smoke detectors missing   just the brackets remain   only one working detector noticed   rd floor apt   Hollow core door is used as the main door into the apartment  easy to be broken down through    Even with the mentioned issues  this is a very appealing apartment  It has alot of character and with a little TLC and elbow grease as far as refreshing wood work  paint  nail holes in walls  bathroom vanities  it would be a shining star    Also  not knowing who owns the building the main entrance into the building needs cleaned  Trash  wood planks  bucket  etc is behind the door when it is opened to go inside and the area including the carpeted stairs is very dirty and dusty  Dusty in many places   heat and return air vents need cleaning  Dirty greasy broiler pan in oven  Dirty sticky eating utensils in silverware drawer  Gnats in the bathroom  Plastic over the windows for heat cold air control needs re adhered to the frames   Dirty blades on ceiling fans 
452675186,Please make sure things are vacuumed before hand  it was just a little off putting to find quite large food crumbs on the area rug  Also  two pillows had very questionable stains on them sans pillow cases The rug in the living room had food crumbs and debris and that wasn t very savory to find when put our bare feet on the rug
621476520,The stay was awesome and I will definitely choose to stay with Zencity when I come back to KC  Shower curtain was dirty and there was a wash cloth with what looked like feces  I m not sure but it was sitting in the drawer under the sink
621937629,I appreciate you letting me rent your space however im incredibly disappointed with how the ROACH  situation was handled  No one ever came to address the issue  I did Mohr sleep the next two nights after seeing bugs in the bathroom and bedroom  Very upset  The carpet head crumbs on it  There was a lime of dirt and crumbs and atop off these air conditioner  The walls of the shower were not clean 
451392075,floor in bathroom
622907426,Patch up mouse holes communicate with people at your property provided more sheets and towels and blankets Mouse holes in walls and broken knobs
649509822,Great place and location Dusty on AC unit  Slight dirt on floor  looks like left by broom  Maybe a swifer mop can help pickup left behind dirt
715615432,Thank you for having us  The info you sent out beforehand made our arrival and check in process stress free  Found food on the floor by the bed when we arrived and a dustball in the kitchen 
622023222,Thank you for the stay  Although I could tell the the apartment was picked up by someone  when I arrived  there was hair everywhere   on the carpet  in the shower  all over the floors  on the couch and chairs  and even in the bed when I pulled back the cover  There were stains all over the bathroom and the laundry room had a foul smell  I would just like to recommend hiring a cleaning service that can notice these details  and also provide a mop or swiffer so the bathroom and laundry room floor can be mopped  There should also be a vacuum suitable for carpets  as the one provided had a hard time picking up things on the carpet  When cleaning   a hair net would be great so random hairs aren t seen everywhere  Stars for the kitchen  however  which was very clean compared to the rest of the apartment 
622809734,The roku remote was missing  Main bathroom toilet was clogged up after never was able to flush 
621973953,Please make sure to respond to messages during the stay  and if not available through the airbnb portal  provide a way of quickly communicating any concerns or questions  Carpet was dirty and the vacuum provided did not do a good job of cleaning it  No response when asked for new vacuum 
648348727,We were very thankful for our sleep space  but didn t feel safe or sanitary in the space until we cleaned it ourselves  We were so excited to stay here since it s a great location and beautifully curated space  but it just seemed like the maintenance and or cleaning staff didn t put much thought or effort into maintaining the space or cleaning the space  At almost      per night with a certified  enhanced clean  we expected far better  Was not spotless as we would expect with  enhanced clean  in the middle of a pandemic  The provided travel sized toiletries had their seals broken  dusty surfaces  loose change along the floorboards  and     of a roll of toilet paper left from the previous tenant  The loose change  minor dust  and toilet paper would normally not be an issue  but in the midst of a pandemic with  enhanced clean  it made us feel the space wasn t properly cleaned or sanitary 
643368492,This unit has great potential  but needs serious attention first  Fix the hardwood floorings loose slats  Get more comfortable  less firm  mattresses  Fix the couch leg  Clean the AC units deeply  Clean everything deeply  Replace old kitchenware  Add more silverware  Repair the bathroom where fixtures used to be  Clean better between guests  Replace the shower curtain  Leave enough keys for each guest  or at least for each bedroom     Red mold on the shower curtain     Hairpin and soap bits left in the shower tray from previous guest s     Old fixture removed from bathroom wall not repaired closed     Bedroom a c unit very dirty  old filter  mold inside  both bedroom units      Accumulated dirt grime mess on bedroom curtains as a result of dirty a c unit     Broken couch leg  so that end slants     Some kitchen equipment is unusable  what is usable is few  need more silverware       Most dishes were visibly dirty upon arrival  and had to be run thru the dishwasher before use
664902188,Having the matinace man come in while I was asleep is horrible  If I had been a girl I would sue you for sexual harassment  Having a locked door open at      am out of your sleep in your underwear is not a good experience  All that after non cleaning  The bed was unmade  dirty dishes in the sink  the trash was not taken out  they literally did not clean it after the last person had been there  they apologized but only gave me    dollars off for the whole ordeal I had to get a different place  which they did pay for   but was very unprofessional and I had to fight for my    instead of them making the wrong right  Also the iron does not work  and there customer service is horrible  The matinace man walked in on me while I was sleeping  Clearly he thought the place was vacant so they have communication issues as well   It s also in a rental place were it s probably illegal to have air bnbs 
562426522,Some dishes had residue of food and or soap on them
671099284,Thanks for being a great host Had to buy toilet paper  faucet ran weird  no bathroom trash can
450953310,Dirty dishes in dishwasher  few clothes left behind from previous renter  broken shower tile 
628654423,I look forward to staying in the future if your interested I love to partner with you guys in the future for some marketing and sponsored content Dust and debris from settled furniture blinds table tops etc  towels with dust also
622919875,Everything in the place was extremely clean  but the bedroom had a bit of a weird stench 
700405368,Floors needed some cleaning
624760808,There where a couple of stains on the sheets 
621551599,Dirty dishes shoved in the drawers
624543261,Had left over trash
624542722,Dead mouse in hallway 
621536670,We enjoyed our stay for the most part  It met our needs  We replaced the air filter in the ac unit ourselves because the one in it when we checked in was so filthy  There was some dirt on the floors when we checked in also  This is probably out of your control but throughout our stay there was the smell of weed coming from another apartment  This was not enjoyable    but wanted to make you aware though  I would also recommend some type of black out shade for the bedroom with a window  Floor s didn t seem very clean
623307502,All my food for that stay spoiled since I was in a hotel without a kitchen  No handsoap  no disinfectants anywhere  floor was sticky upon entry 
667821001,Hey guys  I really appreciate your great communication and the fact that someone came to get me off the balcony  although  someone probably should have double checked to make sure that the door didn t lock before they put a chair out there   Once you get the kinks worked out  it ll be great  I really like all the furniture  Also  you should know that someone in the building  not the bar  was bumping bass music literally all night  it was on when I went to bed at midnight and then still when I woke up at  am and  am  It was the loudest in the back bedroom  so maybe ask whoever lives on the other side of that wall  The place had a stale smoke smell  despite the little air fresheners all over the place  it seemed the worse from the back room  I assume some previous tenant had been smoking  the windows were open in the front bedroom when I checked in    I d recommend all the linens textiles be washed bc those little air things aren t cutting it  Plus  there was some dirt on the floor around the toilet and in the track for the sliding door 
471515432,Thanks for the use of your place  Brian  Overall we enjoyed our stay  but as my private feedback indicates  I think the place needs a bit more attention  Nothing we experienced was worth the trouble of contacting you during our short trip  but I figured youd want to know  Thanks again  and best of luck in the future  Bathtub had visible grime and dirt  dust and dirt in many corners  I think a more thorough cleaning would really do wonders for the place 
531069605,Thank you very much for your hospitality and for a great stay  The location was amazing and the room very cozy  Check in was seamless and the front desk staff was very nice and helpful  The reason I gave Zenicity   stars was because of the following     The bath tub was really gross  it had thick dark hair throughout the tub and a big hair ball in the drain catch  There was noticeable grime along the grout joints of the tub  it was clear it had not been cleaned     Zencity directly requested a   star review without asking how the stay was  To the best of your knowledge it could have not been good but youre still requesting a five star review  Best to just remind your guests to review you and not directly ask for   stars     Zencity requested     from me through the app because you suspected there were some stains on a wash cloth that would not come out  It seems as though that request was made before an attempt to actually wash the rag was made because it came only a few hours after check out  It was a wash rag my wife used to wash her makeup off  which she does at home with white rags so we know it would come out     it should really be noted that this is a  nd story room that over looks a parking lot and garage  the privacy is not so great because anyone standing in the parking lot or on the second story of the garage can look right in your windows  Otherwise it was a really great location and the accommodations were nice  we loved the decor and the fact you had things like blow dryer  iron  and lots of power outlets  Thank you  The bath tub was dirty enough to where we did not want to take a bath in it  It still had lots of hair in the drain catch and along the sides and base of the tub 
264269819,Thank you again for the stay Chris your place was right in the middle of everything  Definitely will recommend Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  Additional comments   Aside from some beans and plant like stuff on the floor a quick sweep and everything was great   
263306442,Hi Chris  thanks again for having us in your apartment   I left you   Stars    The only thing that could have been better is the floor  It was somehow sticky  dirty when we first got there  So we had to clean it    Besides that we had a wonderful stay in the apartment  Thank you  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
644808605,  Crazy smell coming from garbage disposal and dishwasher    Other people s hair all over the floors    Broken couch with holes ripped through fabric    No window in the apartment that can be opened so you re stuck with smell    Broken thermostat    Unsecure building the front door opens for any code    Apartment is not whats in the photo
589689207,Need pot holders or kitchen towels Cleaning crew needs a stern talking to  sheets were changed but I cant say anything else was actually cleaned Jet dry for the dishwasher to help dry the dishes The bathroom  specifically the shower  had all sorts of hair in it  pubes or leg hairs or both  plus head hair    The floors had foot prints all over them  which I was able to wipe up in the bathroom    The bathroom counter wasnt clean   Dishes were put up in the cabinet wet   There was pink glittery tinsel all over the place  mostly in the bedroom  Carpet clearly not vacuumed   Earrings on the floor right by the bed  vacuum should have caught them and all the glittery tinsel stuff  
656417236,The microwave wasn t clean  The bedding didn t feel clean and the shower tiles need to be re caulked or cleaned throughly 
625632830,I tried to be as diplomatic and as honest as I could be  Since this is private  I will reiterate that I was actually pretty frustrated with the experience   I appreciate that you responded to my e mails and trust that maintenance was  indeed   contacted  That said  if I were the host and my unit needed to be repaired  I would make sure it got repaired  I would do whatever was necessary to make the situation right  for the my guest  As I see it  that is the responsibility that I would have taken on  when I became a host   I am certainly not criticizing you   Just sharing my opinion and disappointment with this experience  I do appreciate that you rented to me  at all  I know you didnt have to  I am appreciative that I had a roof over my head and recognize that roof was provided by Zencity  So  thank you for that    I hope that you have a great day     Jamie Nothing Major
587896716,Overall stay was okay  Apartment was beautiful and just as described pictured  Still had some construction dust in the unit  When we arrived we accidentally transposed numbers of apartments and went to the wrong one  Entered code and were granted access to someone else s apartment  Both they and we were freaked out when we walked in on them  Definitely a concern that our code worked for both units  Construction workers woke us up at      AM wanting to install lights under cabinets  Aren t we supposed to be made aware of people entering our apartment  There is no peep hole to see into the hallway and as two women staying alone in a new city  this is a major security issue  The superintendent of the building was extremely rude and said it needed to be done before the New Year even though we were not comfortable with two strange men entering our apartment  Fire alarm went off at      one morning and didn t turn off for    minutes  I understand the building is in the final stages of renovation  but the security issues are very disconcerting  Clean for the most part  Some construction mess still in the unit 
625980313,There definitely should be communication with the guests about other people being able to just walk in when they feel like it There were food shavings as well as hair in the refrigerator  hairs in the bathroom  the toilet paper holder was broken  the tiles were chipping in the shower area  walking up the stairs to get to the apartment there were pieces of plaster all over the steps which I have pictures of  as well as when it would rain the ceiling would leak in the kitchen 
650523880,Hi Zencity   can somebody please get back to me regarding my stay and refund for checking out  Thanks  Reeked of cigarettes  Made our clothes and hair smell like cigarettes  The fridge leaked water  The bathroom plumbing was awful 
650244876,Dusty and there were spiders and silverfish everywhere
625115121,Thank you   Cute and stylish space  Love the big windows    We noticed things here and there that were not cleaned  a major one was the rug needing vacuumed 
624859937,Trash hadnt been emptied
668825644,No airflow in the back bedroom  Bathroom sink drain fills rather quickly   not too pleasant while brushing your teeth
669622015,Find a way to not have coin laundry because coins are now very hard to find Hoard of mosquitoes on patio  some big problems throughout
665157609,The building itself was very run down and had a weird smell that was so strong it gave me a migraine  The apartment building overall felt haunted and old with the creaky floors  dim lighting  elevator that jolted at every floor  etc  The bathroom was extremely tiny and we could hardly move in it  Bathroom corners and floorboards were piled with dirt and grime  We found bugs in the kitchen area while we were trying to prepare food  The bed is extremely firm and uncomfortable  DISGUSTING piss mold smell when you turn on the heater  Dirt and grime on floorboards and corners of bathroom  Feeling of uncleanliness throughout entire bathroom 
624530655,There was hair in the sink in the bathroom  It took a while for the hot water to kick in the shower  the shower itself needs a new head and faucet  You might also consider putting in a better quality shower curtain 
706730116,Really love your locations but the lack of response was disappointing  Especiallywith how to get in  There were bags of trash on the balcony 
521168271,Just clean the place  The entire place was not perfectly cleaned but a few issues stood out  I found food from previous guests in the cupboards  and fridge  A used qtip in the sofa pillows  The toilet would regurgitate  lots of  water at night 
651069277,Thank you for being an excellent host and for responding so fast to all of our questions  Would      stay at your property again  The shower floor was not cleaned at all prior to our check in  Everything else was sparkling clean though  so it stuck out 
628802053,There were several small bugs flying around  Tub needs to be re calked due to mold starting to appear  No trash bags in trash cans 
711932454,Shower curtain smelled like pee  popsicle stick in shower and bedroom ceiling fan covered in dust 
517657602,I got in late on the first night and was hoping to have essentials to shower  since I was unable to bring my own  and it said they would be provided  There was no soap  only conditioner and hand lotion  So in the future  it d be nice to know what is actually provided in toiletries  The black mold growing in the ac unit put off a horrible smell throughout 
508379459,hair in the bathtub
626558061,Only   body towels
536440365,stair entry smelled pretty bad
625254886,Floor had crumbs all over  which was a little annoying when walking around without shoes  There was also a large stain under the fridge door once you opened the door 
279798564,Thanks for letting us stay there  It was a great stay and it was so nice being close to the Blue Line  I would recommend getting paper towels for the condominium though  Some more food recommendations would ve been nice  Hair on the ground
649538556,I went ahead and cleaned washed the towels and bedding before I left  but I would highly suggest having an exterminator come around soon  It might be the curse of a high floor because I see this in high rises often  but I killed on average    spiders a day  Also  I would recommend cleaning or removing the carpets   I took pictures of the stains upon arrival and when I left  but it was pretty unsightly  But a vinyl floor might be a great investment in the future  Easier to clean and better for guests especially if the space is left uninhibited for so long  The bathroom soap dispenser was also full of mold  I attempted to clean it with vinegar  but I guess someone tried to stretch the soap with water  and the one in the kitchen might be cracked because it was leaking dish soap upon my arrival  Otherwise it was a wonderful place  great location  wonderful amenities  a great amount of space  and the front desk staff is incredibly nice  Thank you all so much for allowing me into your space  Thankfully there was a vacuum  but the carpets werent vacuumed and there were a few carpet stains  Also  spiders galore  Oh my gosh  so many spiders    other than that everything was perfect  Clean sheets  clean towels 
652894783,It was not difficult to contact host  Mini blinds very dusty  Hardwood floors in bedrooms not swept  With the supposed strict cleaning protocols with COVID     I was concerned about just how well the apartment really had been cleaned  Also  the air conditioning wasn t functioning properly when we arrived  There was a sign on the front door left by repairman that the unit was frozen and to not change the settings on the thermostat from the fan only mode  The wifi login and password listed did not work  Host did provide another when contacted 
624442734,I ve stayed in a zen city air bnb before and this was nothing like my previous experience  The apartment wasn t clean at all  The floor was sticky  The walls had so many smears  prints and scuffs on them as if it were adult kids putting their hands on the wall  There was no hand soap in the bathroom nor paper towels in the entire unit 
653510831,Smelled of smoke despite the signs that say no smoking allowed 
671085659,Overall the apartment was not as clean as the post lead us to believe   I found a loaf of bread in the kitchen cabinet and my wife found some on the floor in the bathroom 
700435530,Please get rid of that awful smoke smell and do a deep cleaning  Update the check in instructions as well as the first key fob that was given since it doesn t give access to the parking lot or the rooftop  Change the stained comforter and clean repaint the stains on the walls  Give better access to the thermostat     degrees is horrible to sleep in  The worst out of a few things on this list was the horrible cigarette smoke smell  Despite being a non smoking unit the smoke smell was obnoxious and undeniably coming from the room  The building and halls didn t smell like this until you went into the apartment unit  Had to go to the store and buy odor eliminator and air freshener  The rug in the living room had physical crumbs trash on it  The couch was just simply dirty when we had to remove the cushion due to the remote falling in the crevice  The whole floors felt like there was a layer of grime on them  The shower floor was brown in the area where one would stand to shower  I had to get on my hands and knees and try to scrub out as much as I could so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out  The white comforter had a yellow stain on it  The walls in the bedroom and bathroom had stains that appeared to be bodily fluids when using a black light  The laminated card on the little chalk board that says  cleaned by  didn t have a personnel name or a date  For all I know the place wasn t cleaned before my stay 
624668351,Enjoyed my stay  only critique I have would be to put a sign on the window behind the couch for people not to bang   knock on your window disturbing guest when they cant get in the front door or the box code is malfunctioning  Thanks again  The bed had been made  but not washed   I had to pull the top sheet wash it then sleep on top of it  The fitted sheets had shoe prints on them when I pulled the comforter back  Comforter had hairs   light stains as well  Black leather chairs in kitchen were dirty with food particles  Im easy going I hardly care about stuff like this  but im mentioning it so that the owner can make sure his staff is truly cleaning things in the era of Covid      Walls were a bit dirty with what looked like liquid stains   lots damage to the paint in some areas  I called   Zencity took note for the record  Right under the stairs   by the front door  so it can get very loud at times  Everything else was good to go 
712296376,Thank you for letting us stay  Didnot find it clean as expected  Air filters and rooms were a bit dirty   Filter needs to be changed 
623542453,You may want to ensure that all towels  linens and bathrooms are truly clean prior to a new guest arriving especially with COVID    going around  There were animal hairs on all of the towels  wash clothes  washer  bed sheets and pillows   There was hair in the shower  There was urine on the toilet seat   I let Zincity know this immediately and sent them pictures of the hairs   They did drop off new towels the next day and let me know that there were other sheets and pillows in the closet  However  they did not provide me with a new comforter  I had to re wash the comforter  sheets and towels as I did not have anything the day of check in 
631283236,Thanks for a great stay  We enjoyed our stay and will definitely look to stay with you again in the future when we are back in town    One possible maintenance item we noticed was the washing machine  We couldnt get it to run through a full wash cycle  It would only fill with water for a little bit and then stop  We did notice that the kitchen floor was a little dirty  and and that there was some dirt on the window sills  Nothing terrible  just didnt look like the cleaning was quite thorough enough  Everything else was good 
672699661,Smell of cigarette smoke at first
656444126,Thanks for being a great host  Not necessarily cleanliness issues  just needs some paint touch ups  doors fixed  etc  It was really pretty clean though 
627090495,They need more up to date pics because I booked that Airbnb looking forward to having a balcony to sit out on and enjoy the nice weather The refrigerator was dirty like it hadn t been wiped down in a while it had crumbs
644793370,The place was somewhat dusty   The bathroom was stained 
646749862,My suggestion would be to remove the Alexa  any listen  recording devices from the home   hirer a true house keeper  Floors had visible debris  Bedding had hair all over it  Head board had hand prints  Washer smelt of mildew    Couch had hair 
625103791,Hair all over the shower and bathroom floow 
625762163,Thanks for letting us stay in your space  Great location   There were several small pieces lying around   plastic piece on the balcony  plastic near the bedroom window  random piece under TV  Not a big deal but maybe they belong with something  Some hairs in bathroom but otherwise clean 
627690827,There are screws on the bed that poke out on the right side  I really scraped my knee and the bed and sofa are very hard and firm  Covers and throws
416966565,There was condoms under the couch cushions and  in the kitchen cabinets   empty wrappers found under the bed Certain trash left behind for previous people
709231812,There Were Random Hairs In The Sleeping Area   On The Couch  Other Than That It Was Good 
576177558,Overall good stay  but theres an issue with the WiFi  the door code not working right away  the seemingly included parking spot that isnt actually included  and the not fully functional shower head made for a not as ideal stay  Location and price are perfect though  Overall it was clean  but it seemed like a lack of recent sweeping or mopping wasnt present  Not the worst but just didnt live up to the photos
710609375,It definitely was not what I expected as far as cleanliness  During COVID time there shouldn t have been anything on the floors  It led me to believe they didn t clean from last guest There was lint  hair and lint balls on the floor and rugs  The sheets didn t look clean either
668120375,All the dishes in the cabinets were dirty  Every single one
473945780,Thanks for answering everything so promptly    we had a great time    If you are paying someone         to clean  I think you should see what kind of job they do    Thanks again for everything     Rona The whole apartment needs a good cleaning  baseboards in bathroom    grout between tiles   also you need something on the floor of the tub as it is very slippery   also a safety bar would be good    An extra towel or two might also be good as a backup   
702550015,Need better parking The bottom sheet had hair on it from previous guests
614870202,The apartment is beautiful and very conveniently located  I enjoyed my stay there and have the following comments   There is a bit of an ant problem in the bathroom and living room   The bed is wrapped in plastic that makes it very hard for the body to regulate temperature while sleeping  I messaged the hosts about this but received no reply  I ended up sleeping on top of the bed because it was too uncomfortable within the sheets  The bathroom needs a bath plug  there is an ant problem in the apartment  especially the bathroom  otherwise it is very nice 
629714701,When the fans were switched on there was dust balls flying everywhere  The closets were dusty   I hung my shirt on the rod in the closet and I literally had to wash it it got so dusty 
629631383,Although we had some issues explained on the previous page  we still had an overall great experience  It was nice to have more space to spread out for approximately the same price as a hotel room  and we felt at home after the initial frustrations  Also  having access to the roof was amazing  This should be something advertised on the listing as it was a huge perk of staying there  In the kitchen  there were dirty dishes in the dishwasher  such as a cookie sheet with multiple  caked on burns  There were also dirty dishes elsewhere  such as a spatula in the crock pot that had dried egg caked on it  Based on these findings  we had to assume everything was dirty  so we washed all the dishes in the dishwasher before we were able to use them  Regarding the bathroom  there was a sample body wash left behind in the shower  We know these usually are thrown away when rooms are cleaned  so it made us wonder if the shower had actually been clean  Also  there was a cup on the sink that was filthy  people had used it for there toothbrushes  so there was dried toothpaste on it  and there was mold caked around the edges  as well 
629613866,Go out of business Owner called me a fucken bitch and hung up on me when I called because the box was broken and I couldn t access unit
653182904,There needs to be an extensive cleaning before anyone is allowed to stay there  Covid isnt a joke  The cleaniness and condition was pathetic and dangerous with an  ongoing pandemic  At first glance the apartment appears clean  but as soon as your shoes came off  you could feel the grittiness on the wooden floor  Many areas had not been swept  especially underneath the bed  In the kitchen hair was found INSIDE the refrigerator  Yuck  In the freezer  ice trays had a sticky coating on the edges  Two drawers had a pile of open and unopen candy in them  The horror continued as you reached for plates  silverware  or literally ANYTHING  Many of them had food particles on them   To make matters worse  you could see finger prints on many of surfaces  Moving towards the bedroom area  we found stains on the comforter as well as the mattress  We found hair in every single drawer in the bathroom along with a dirty sponge  There was not a surface  towel  or sheet that was not cleaned within the first    minutes of our stay  We are extremely disappointed considering there were plently of other options that offer extensive cleaning with covid  We should not have spent the first    minutes deep cleaning 
634036427,Luckily  the place was equipped with some cleaning tools because we swept and vacuumed the floors of all of the rooms  accumulating dust piles everywhere  Surfaces in living room and kitchen were sticky  Pillowcases had an odd smell 
633661474,Coffee was a delightful treat   but creamers were all spoiled  I mentioned it in a message but you may want to let whoever does the cleaning now to not put them out any longer Had to shake out bedding b c of long black hairs and all over bathroom too 
632064699,Thanks the place was great I hated to leave it  The couch had hair from previous guest 
627483199,I m disappointed that no one came to clean while I was there  Nor is the cleaning fee being refunded as I had to clean myself    The space is stunning and worth the price  if it was clean  There was urine and fecal matter on both of the toilets  The counters in the kitchen weren t clean  there was hair all over the bathroom floors and shower  The sheets and comforters were dirty  The couch had stains  we were given dirty towels 
630828152,If it was easier to communicate with Zencity and if they were more on top of the overall customer experience   which they claim on their website   these properties would be great  This one in particular needs a deep cleaning  I was stunned at how dirty the apt was  Food stuck to counter tops  dirt hair in floor corners  shower needed a good cleaning  I had to really scrub the bathroom and kitchen  I really wanted to like this place 
634290043,Found red fake finger nails on floor but we dont wear red finger nails  Other then that it was good 
659090502,You need to send a worker in to fix things up  replace light bulbs  and do regular maintenance floors were dirty
634034966,It was hair all on the pillows and sheets  The floor had not been swept or vacuumed throughout  the loft the fridge was pretty dirty as well as the balcony with cigarette butts
629902673,The place  while having a very cool vibe  it has not been kept up very well   There are lots of burnt out light bulbs and cracked mirrors in bedroom closet doors and a broken chair   Just needs some attention and it would be fine   Dishwasher also was not attached in place very well and needs a few screws to fasten it to the countertop so it does not tip out when you load it 
656084140,The room itself was clean  but the apartment complex was dirty 
624619388,Over all it was great just irritated about having to stand outside for    mins trying to figure out how to get in  And the smell was weird It smelled like stale cigarette or stale weed smoke in there
658523246,You need to get your stuff together  One problem after another  that you did not address  You made promises that were not kept  Im very disappointed  We found a used condom wrapper on the floor of one of the bedrooms  Because the AC didnt work  we slept on the floor in the living room and when I picked up the comforter  it was filthy on the bottom which means it hadnt been vacuumed in some time  This of course  is a concern during the time of covid  We found   blood stains on the carpet in the living room  the towel rack in the bathroom fell off when we put a towel on it 
633593435,Trash left in garbage can 
707150695,Great place and location   A good place to relax and destress  Great amenities  Thanks for answering quickly when locked out of the room  It was mostly clean just a little more cleaning in the refrigerator needed
655524558,Zencity i sent emails to you regarding the cleaning please see photos and havev these areas clean so thers eont have to deal with these issues please Place was extra nasty i email about the spit on the bedroom door and other places
645906629,Shower curtain was dirty 
632270790,Hi  This was my third stay at this same apartment in the last month and it s been a little worse every time  Less clean  fewer amenities    not sure if your cleaner needs to review practices  but in the covid era cleaning should be the top priority  Under couch was not vacuumed  Lots of food crumbs
665744580,I really enjoyed my time staying here  and if I could one day I d love to live in this exact building  The place was for the most part clean but there was a lot of  what appeared to be dog hair that got all over my clothes  I m not sure if it was because of the carpet or the throw blanket but it definitely was a little annoying 
633054399,Thank you   sofa
653501835,Dear Zencity Team  as per my text messages  you should fix the apartment first  paint the walls  fix the oven  change the carpet to finish the strong smell of cigarette  and really deep clean it  The location is great and you guys have a great customer service  The apartment as is now  is damaging your business  I shared pictures with Zencity Team to show that the place was not clean to the standards necessary during the times that we live in  COVID      The worst place was the bathroom  However  the entire apartment needed a deep cleaning 
633864777,Thank you for being a great host  Ps  It was really cold during the stay but the thermostat had a   digit pin to it so maybe next time  that pin could be nearby  Other than that absolutely Gorgeous apartment home and decor  Leaks in the roof 
631841518,The entire apartment looked like it hadnt been vacuumed in weeks  The bathroom was particularly dirty  but the floors throughout were covered in dirt dust hairs and it was pretty gross  I had to bust out the vacuum that was stashed away in the closet the night we got there just to feel OK walking around  One of the blankets provided also smelled so bad we couldnt use it when sitting on the sofa 
634022505,If you could add an all purpose cleaner  something for the kitchen countertop  it would make cleaning up a lot easier for your guests  Only thing to note is there was an enema left on the kitchen counter when I arrived 
306355579,Thanks again for having us  I appreciate you letting us check in early  I also appreciate you being up front with us and letting us know about all of the issues that the group before us left  Overall we had a great time  I hope we didnt leave to much of a mess  We all woke up really late and didnt have time to clean as much as we would have liked to   Overall very clean place  
636240461,carpet was not too clean
633015624,You guys suck  You ruined me and my friends first visit to St  Louis  I will never be back  I hope you all are happy with my hard earned money  Businesses like yours will never prosper because all you care about is money and not the actual person  I saved up for months for this trip just to have it ruined  I hope you can sleep well at night knowing how you operate your business  There was dried up hard poop in the toilet that must have been there a while  The tub was dirty as well  We actually had to go out and buy tissue paper as well as extra towels 
669133710,Thank you all so much for your hospitality and for being so helpful  We really appreciate it  There were spots on the sheets and pillowcases  Luckily we brought our own  Everything else seemed to be clean 
712890974,The dishes in the kitchen were dirty  I had to wash most of the dishes before i started cooking because i found food on several dishes 
647032832,Place is great could but could use a fresh coat of paint and a new couch cover  Place overall was showing signs of wear  Bathrooms are great and exceptionally clean  Living room and other common spaces were a bit tired and needed a new coat of paint  Couch also has some staining and screens were full dead spiders 
586216367,On        the fire alarm went off in the building around   AM  A man who identified himself as a janitor said that it was set off by accident  Unfortunately  the fire alarm in the room was blaring loudly for almost    minutes  Between this and the significant renovation activity in the building  our stay wasn t as frictionless as we had hoped  I hope you ll give future guests a clear heads up that this building is being actively renovated so they can decide whether it s a good fit for their needs  Other than those issues  this is a beautiful apt  Hope this feedback is useful  thanks for hosting us  The building is undergoing renovations so the hallways were full of debris  nails  and construction materials 
618071503,The parking spot provided needs to be seriously re evaluated  There is a pole on one side and usually a very large car is packed  often outside of bounds  on the other side  This made the parking experience very difficulty and resulted in scratches on my car  It would also be helpful to have a much smaller code to enter the apartment since it needs to be entered every single time  Providing more dishes  like plates and glasses  would be very useful to people staying for a longer period of time  Decorating the place a bit more would be an additional nice touch  Beyond that  the apartment was nice   plenty of space  nice amenities  and good location  There was a bit of a smell in the entire apartment  especially in the kitchen area  It would have definitely been useful to add room freshners 
634334623,Wow  Pet hair and other hair all over the apartment including the bathroom and bed sheets  Microwave had red sauce splatter all over it 
625750853,Thank you so much for your hospitality  I really enjoyed my time in Chicago at your apartment  If I may suggest an idea for improvement  the vanilla scent all over the place was quite importunate and I wasn t able to recall the source  Maybe it is something that the cleaning lady is useing and could be replaced by a somewhat fresher scent     The windows could need some cleaning as well as the mixer and the shower shelf  And the Couch is really stained and could be replaced in near future 
637821651,A few areas needed sweeping but overall the place was sanitized and clean 
653550309,There were several items of trash left behind from previous guests and a few dishes that were left unwashed  usually wouldnt be that big of a deal but I would expect proper sanitation during a global pandemic 
670210965,We had a man break into the house using the same key code that you gave us  He came into the house and closed the door before we got over to the stairs and he let us know he was in the wrong house  While this seemed to be an innocent mistake  there have been people who use this approach to check to see if a house is a good place to come back to and burglarize  My sister and I did not feel safe in this house after that and it s very concerning that someone else would have the same key code that we did to this place  I messaged you immediately and never heard a response which is also very disappointing   The next morning we also found cockroaches in the kitchen drawers  the brown banded ones  I m not sure why we would be paying an     cleaning fee  which I m sure each customer is paying and still find cockroaches in a house   Both of these were very disappointing because both of us were very excited to stay and were ready to book again until these two incidents occurred  Had cockroaches in multiple drawers in the kitchen 
636871164,Floors were extremely sticky  lots of dust and dirt
717634637,I did slip in the bathroom from the rug not being stable and now have a bruise on my head but overall clean place 
673883908,Thank you for the great stay  Broken drawer and cracked  dirty glassware in the cabinet  Had to put away dishwasher dishes from previous guests 
649878592,There were ants everywhere and I seen a huge roach 
653224481,Wire covers had come off the walls in nearly every room  Not a big deal  but a little unsightly  And there appeared to be dry wall on the floor beneath the living room AC unit
629927564,My boyfriend and I loved the apartment just wish it was a bit cleaner  The bathtub was dirty and took a long time for water to drain The bathroom tub was stopped up and dirty and some of the dishes had food on them
704664912,Almost all the dishes glasses in the cabinet were dirty or still have food on them and there was hair all on the towels in the bedroom and sheets    but other than that the place was pretty clean 
650182512,You are the worst place I have ever engaged  Your lies and your deception will catch up with you  Taking money from peoples accounts and lying to them is unacceptable and it will come back to you  They lied about everything they advertised
703927121,Update your listing photos as they are not transparent of the home s current conditions  change your cleaning team so they don t poison anyone with bleach  and replace the broken art above the bed and patch the holes in the walls The dishes that were put away were full of water  and the others hardly looked washed  Food stuck to the forks  The stovetop had sauce all over the burners  The apartment smelled so strongly of bleach that we had to open the only two windows  turn on the kitchen fan  and the bathroom fan  and leave for a few hours while it aired out so we didn t feel sick
635183487,I enjoyed my stay overall with my infant  For the most part it was a peaceful stay  One morning  I was playing music at half volume for most of the morning  When I switched genres  I received a call from the host about a noise complaint  I called the host about the lack of rooftop access and never received a call back   Though I brought my own supplies  the cleaning and sanitizing supplies in the apartment as well as  the french press and coffee table books were an added bonus    Outside of some stray hairs and the neighbors dogs running into the apartment   they apologized repeatedly  during check out  I found this to be a relaxing stay  There were several long stray hairs on the carpet and couch 
651009021,No comment Was in a wrong listing
704224333,We enjoyed our stay  thank you   Large stains on carpet in bedroom
718890036,The pots and pans had grease and grime from the last occupants and the glass stove top was a mess 
703834503,it was amazing there was a doorman who was a little rude everytime we would come in but besides that we loved it it was a great place but the bathroom had some spots you could tell hadn t been cleaned
634282975,The shower curtain in the bathroom was white but very dirty and brown at the bottom  There were a few times I saw ants crawling in my carpet in the bedroom  No major cleanliness issues but just small things to note 
636201868,I have identified a couple of issues but on the whole would not hesitate to return  The location is fantastic and the staff and building residents were very friendly  It looked like there was black dog hair on the white rug in the living room  Also saw an ant or two in the kitchen 
635100713,The kitchen stove was not clean and gnats we re flying out of the eye  There are a lot of scuff marks all over the walls which made it feel unclean  Didn t want to lean on the window seal to look out the amazing windows because they were dirty as well 
604858757,Hair all over the bathrooms  Dirty all over   I ve waited an hour for the cleaning person to finish cleaning the place and after the person left it was still very dirty 
716286205,The walls could use some new paint really bad 
636931679,Dirty dishes stain on sheet on arrival  stinky bathroom
635154905,The smell in the hallway was a huge deterrent  We will not be staying here again  The hallway to our room smelled disgusting  
633414782,Colored spots were on the bathroom towels  and the bathtub didn t look like it had been cleaned  especially the floor crevices in the shower
641163310,This was the worst experience I have ever encountered on Airbnb   To add to my frustration I saw that multiple other guests had posted similar issues regarding cleanliness  Dirty dishes in dishwasher and in cupboard   Stains on walls  doors  cabinets   Food debris and trash on floor around and under couch   Hairballs on the floor by the bed   Pubic hair on walls of shower 
633862646,When we arrived there was hair still in the shower drains and no trash bags in the bathroom trash cans  The kitchen had a broken drawer that we were made unaware of  The host tried to request      in damages which they stated was from a stain on the carpet  given the state that the apartment was in  the cleaners did not do a thorough job and attempted to fine us 
495867665,Hi   We enjoyed our stay  but a couple things would have improved it  oven dishes to cook in the oven   better curtains to block the light and  stronger AC since unit gets a lot of sun     Bed was wonderful and decor was pleasant except the old fridge and kitchen in general   Good location and easy check in   Maybe emphasize the parking challenge a bit more     Thanks  Cupboards under the sink has debris dust as well as fan 
712677977,Some cups were still wet and not looked to be cleaned properly  toilet paper left in the toilet  and hair left on bathroom floor 
636508822,This isn t meant to be a critical review but  honest  These are details that would have made this rental more attractive  Thank you I should preface that this is my first ever Air B B experience  Shower surround and curtain had something splashed on it  I was able to wipe it and it was removable  Indicates to me that it wasn t thoroughly cleaned before my arrival  No bar soap or hand soap in the bath area  The kitchen floor had been mopped before my arrival and appeared wet  Although  it could have been that the trash can was washed and never dried because when I came back from the market there was a two foot trail of liquid seeping from below  Which forced me to use the one and only hand towel that was provided  That seemed odd for a five night stay  I brought this to mgt  attention  Two days later there were new bath towels and a dish towel provided 
641811922,Tub dirty  floor dirty
710617819,Hello   thank you for allowing me to stay in your apartment    I would suggest cleaning the bathroom tile in the shower as it was dirty and had hairs on it from other guests   The plastic shower curtain liner was pretty moldy and dirty too  and should be changed out      leaving some coffee out on the kitchen counter would also be a nice touch   shower tiles and shower curtain dirty
626808395,There werent any forks in the silverware cabinet   just a heads up  Carpet hadnt been vacuumed in a while    lots of wrapper plastic and plant debris
654364242,The window farthest from the tag won t close and the couch area was quite dirty with stains  My recommendation would be to put some kind of sheet over the couch  And also one of the rugs was coming unattached from the ground so it needs to be taped down again  And the couch s back leg was slightly broken I believe  I didn t have much time to use the living area it the whole unit was absolutely beautiful   Couch area was slightly gross and one of the windows wouldn t close but for the most part it was really clean and amazing  
245085221,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
642893433,I left a decent rating but it was essentially a huge party building  There were young kids loud outside our door  Loud on the street  Left food in the hallways  It was abit uncomfortable going in and out of the building  Black scuff marks on the walls down low 
641443356,There was a rat in my unit   The unit is in a basement and it rained heavily so I believe this was due more to weather conditions than cleanliness 
638727430,The cleanliness issues weren t dealbreakers  I know a lot must go into cleaning an entire apt  Overall it is a beautiful place and I would stay there again  When i arrived  i was looking for a fork  but only found one  I found the rest of them  along with a few other dirty dishes  in the dishwasher w the soap pellet untouched  The machine had not been run    On the rug in front of the couch were some crumbs  so I vacuumed    The front left leg on the couch is broken  The comforter in our room had makeup on it  and it had been turned over  The top sheet also had a smudge of make up  I took pics of this  The linens were white  so it s tough to hide any stains    No iron was there  but they brought me one the next day    There was a stain on the couch  The fabric could use a cleaning     On the bright side  the apartment had beautiful colors  design and furniture    The kitchen was well stocked  we loved that there was olive oil there  which we had forgotten     Super comfy mattress  Extra linens   Easy checkin  Great smell
662686895,Wonderful style and location  The shower glass was not clean 
642990159,Thank you the place was awesome  Floors were a bit dirty so I just did a quick clean on my own
672716299,if you had a Brita water pitcher for filtered water in the fridge that would be amazing  Coffee maker was dusty 
703901240,Maintenance guy said that he suspects the cleaners are flushing things down the toilet they aren t suppose to  as this toilet problem is common   Considering the cleaners also didn t clean out the refrigerator or dishwasher  I d suggest you retrain or rehire your cleaners Refrigerator had some leftover food in it
639070316,Spider webs on the apartment and spiders all over the apartment
635978393,The place itself was so stylish and the furniture was minimal and perfect for me  Having full control of the air conditioner was a plus too  I will say that the check out process left me a bit uneasey  It says to leave the key inside the room  which means I could not lock the door on my way out to check out  It just made me wary about leaving it open   Also  I am so sorry about breaking a cup  I was trying to navigate the dark and was unsuccessful  On AirBNB website  this place was marked as doing more cleaning due to COVID     However  when I came in  I found food crumbs on the stove  left over creamer packets in the fridge  a string bean in the freezer  and hairs on the clean sheets and pillowcases that were stored in the closet  The extra comforter was also on the floor of the closet  The bathroom tub was clogged and drained so slowly for my entire trip 
231309932,The check in incident and the shabby hallway  interior were bugging already  On top of that  despite a great deal for you with my two weeks  stay  you want to charge additional for I missing the check out time  I will just return a straight frank host with frank honest comments    Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  shower  dust  odors  bathroom  kitchen 
607424877,Thank you so much for opening your place to us  The bed was extremely comfortable and the place was tidy and well laid out  The bathroom could have been a little cleaner  mainly the shower curtain  It was pretty dirty and built up on the bottom 
637498555,I am fairly clean person and would have expected a lot cleaner of the place  The walls had dirt markings and my feet were horribly dirty the minute I took off my socks  I would take time to clean the place thoroughly    You all had great communication  I couldnt get into the building due to the code not working and as soon s I messaged called you got back to me so quick and I greatly appreciate that  I am very clean person and I wasnt impressed with the level of cleanliness  The floor left my feet black and their are foot prints and other markings all along the wall  The place its self was picked up but you could tell it haddent been deep cleaned in months 
603857370,Thank you so much everything was great and very convenient  Will definitely stay here when we come back to Chicago  There was a couple of dirty pieces of tissue on the floor behind the door 
651644106,Thank you  We really enjoyed our stay  The only thing we would have liked to see would be more dishes glasses in the kitchen and hand soap in the bathrooms  Otherwise everything was amazing  Looked like someone had thrown up in the toilet and it hadn t been cleaned up
651020401,Thank you for hosting my stay   Parking was easier than I thought it would be  and it was walkable to the grocery stores  which was handy  There were gnats in the room  and all throughout the building   I arrived on Monday  and they didnt spray for them until Friday 
602359847,Thanks for hosting us  Overall  it was a solid stay  I d recommend having someone change the shower curtains out and replacing the living room couch  Also  it was a bit of a challenge coordinating more than one person being able to enter exit due to there only being one key fob and one door key to enter the elevator  Mold on the shower curtain and living room couch was dirty  worn  old 
623663082,The place was nice I enjoyed my stay The shower was not very clean
659131953,Other than WiFi and dishwasher issues  the place was amazing and next time I m in St Louis I will try to book this place again  The dishwasher had dirty water sitting inside of it and the dishes weren t completely clean 
599022528,This was a great experience for me and my guests  Thanks for hosting us in an efficient and enjoyable manner  Floors were dusty throughout  It was very clean  but the bags and clothes that were on the ground ended up with dust on them 
596391750,We enjoyed our stay at this place  The master bath is fantastic  beds are very comfortable  That said  I do think someone should have dropped by to take out the bags of garbage that were left sitting in the living room  Also  there is a front porch security light but it was unclear how to turn it on  I did ask about this when we arrived  The front steps and porch were icy  not to mention that its a front entry in an urban setting   it should be well lit  Bags of garbage sitting in the living room during our stay 
663373353,Glass coffee table was not wiped down and there was plastic wrap in the living room
604204076,Thanks  Place was great   Curtain remote in living room is missing  Remote in middle room battery is dead  Floors need work  Dust  hair  dander  Vacuum then wet mop 
656423302,The smell was very off putting and a bad start to my trip but the hosts false promises really turned my mood off  I would expect a lot more professionalism for something like zencity  I would have been much more accommodating if the host just said that he couldnt provide anything and acknowledged the smell in the place As I walked into the bnb the entire place smelled like dirty water  which made it very hard to believe if it was disinfected or cleaned at all  I had to turn all exhaust fans and open the windows to air out the smell
622465106,There was hair everywhere  And not just one specific type  I looked under the bed as I was plugging in my charger and there were a pair of socks sitting there   They weren t mine  so that lets me know they differently did not clean 
654315457,I seen a mouse running in the kitchen
449798583,Thank you  I check for bedbugs so I inspect the bed and around it with a flashlight  First  the comforter had pronounced stains and there was long hairs all over the bedding  It looked like there were possibly bedbugs under the mattress  The floor around the bed had food crumbs and looked like it hadnt been vacuumed in years 
340082235,Brian  we really were happy with the space   This is the first time renting off of AirBnB and I will definitely Italy do it again   Thank you for all of your help during our stay  We checked under the beds before leaving  to make sure we did not forget anything  and in the front bedroom found a piece of dirty clothes  a lighter  and a can of hairspray 
720501267,Thank you so much for letting us stay  The place was really nice and we were glad to bring in      there  Some of the cookware and drinkware had some minor gunk on them  It wasnt too big of a deal but threw us off a bit due to COVID concerns  We were just glad that there were cleaning supplies so we can take care of it ourselves 
655606388,Over all a very nice place  There was so parts that were dirty  I did want you to know the couch had a cigarette burn in it  the coffee grinder was broken  the air was out  and the dryer didn t work  There was also a large amount of light bulbs out  Definitely a cool place and I don t regret staying there  I just suggest those fixes  It was clean for the most part  the bathroom toilet could ve been a bit more clean  The windows in the living room were very dirty  I ended up cleaning them just so my girlfriend wouldn t see it before she arrived 
446928741,There was stuff on the sheets and hair 
705408654,I paid for the missing fob  yet I can still return the fob if you need it  I dont care  The entire place smelt like stale cigarettes  We used an entire fabreeze odor eliminator canister over the course of a few days and that eventually got the smell out  The carpet flooring is not helping with this issue  im sure  Other than that  everything was neat and tidy for us upon check in 
664890363,Enjoyed my stay as I was able to get a lot of work done as well as relax   Thank you for letting me stay at your apartment  There was quite a lot of hair in the bathroom  especially in the shower  as well as the bed   It wasnt a huge issue for me to simply wipe it up in the bathroom and wipe it off the bed    Otherwise  I had no issues 
627373633,Areas were filled with dust 
719414002,Lovely place  It was a pleasure staying with you all  The rug in the living room had some crushed chips and some things left by previous guest 
701877239,This appeared to be a newly listed apartment   Parking and cleanliness issues are a deal breaker  Empty water bottles were under the sofa and there were huge  Dust Bunnies  under the bed   Makes you wonder what cleaning and disinfection procedures were really completed 
671877024,A prior guest had clogged the toilet and the toilet backed up and overflowed  after notifying the owner in the afternoon  a plumber didnt arrive until later that night  leaving us without a toilet and the smell of sewage filling the apartment while the contents of the toilet overflowed onto the ground  After that  a cleaner did not arrive for another hour  leaving the apartment smelling like sewage for the majority of our day at the house  The hallway outside of the apartment smelled like weed 
409763249,It was a very nice place  Easy check in and lots of communication  Only problem was food was left behind from other people before my stay and had some issues with closing locking the door when I was exiting the place  Chips and food left behind from other people
638503350,Hair on the floor
592312261,Thank you so much for hosting us  The place was styled nicely and it was in a great location  We found free parking near by  Your rapid communication was greatly appreciated  Having the option to assess Netflix was great as we were able to watch a comida special before heading out for dinner last night  My suggestion to making this place a   star Airbnb is to fix the bottom boards under the mattress on the bed frame in all the rooms and to do a better job of cleaning  The bed sheets had stains and the bed frames were failing apart  The floors were not vacuumed swept either  as I found a piece of wine cork in the kitchen  The shower curtain was old and dirty 
664062163,The bed and sofa were extremely uncomfortable to us and you may want to think about replacing them  Floors were dirty  shower was dirty  Found female hair on pillows
365619540,Thanks for being a great and responsive host  Some things I noticed were the bathtub shower knob is loose  Also the oven knob is not in alignment with the actual temperature of the oven  Difficult to turn off when done cooking  Other than that the building and unit were awesome  I d definitely come back and stay again    Comforter had a small stain  Nothing major but noticeable as soon as I walked in  Are under kitchen sink smelled of mold  Perhaps hanging pots instead of housing them next to cleaning supplies
362533944,Thanks for a great stay  We really enjoyed the our stay  We cant wait to stay again  There was a lot of fuzz on the floor  Bathroom showers had a bit of hair from previous occupants 
702533437,Light bulb needed replaced above vanity   Only one roll of toilet paper was available for   nights 
719748447,Looked clean overall  Smelled less clean  couch and shower slight BO smell 
637890297,Couch had stains  not sure what they were   Also some cups and pans had irremovable stains
660645400,Honestly this was the first truly disappointing experience I have ever had  I understand youre a corporate  airbnb renter and as such I would expect at least the attention to detail of a moderate hotel chain  I would think twice before staying with zencity again which is a shame Dust bunnies under the bed  Dirty AC vents intake and exhaust  Stained carpets  Ddidnt feel it lived up to the expectation and cleaning seemed rushed 
658679459,Thank you for letting us stay in the apartment   Great location and I loved the it had gated parking  The floors needed to be swept   For the most part seemed clean   We did see mice in the basement hallway going to the elevator  never in the apartment 
610609883,thank you for having us  we had a good overall experience  I suggest hiring cleaners to deep clean the place  it would ve been nice to have extra towels or detergent to be able to wash them  The floors were scratched up throughout the place  which is not a major issue but the bathrooms and bedrooms were messy  the shower did not look clean  We found socks and an inhaler underneath one bed  not ours 
661779196,Towels had stains
662639849,The place should be actually cleaned by a cleaning service if you want to charge  times the nights stay  Trash was full  Marks inside the toilet bowl 
667309886,Thank you for the last minute accommodation and accessibility  And safety and security  Scrapes and scratches along the walls throughout  Kitchen sink needs scoured for cleanliness 
494572641,Hairs in the shower and floor
610579660,Bathrooms sinks were dirty and splashes were on the mirrors  so who knows about the rest of the bathroom  Lots of hair on bedsheets that made bed appear very unclean  Leftover food from previous guests left in refrigerator and freezer  Cups in cabinet had sticky fingerprints all over them 
598703711,Common areas and apartment had an extremely strong air freshener smell
492908429,Everything was great  just the little detail about the towel which I really didnt mind but is good for you guys to know because others might be unpleased  That said  thanks for everything     One of the towels was kind of stained 
661871506,Minor details but the dishwasher had dishes in it and the bathroom needed to be swept and the garbage had a little bit of garbage in it
703005296,Amazing view  I would skip the soft furniture  Could be cleaner 
702364497,We really enjoyed our stay  The place was perfect for me and my daughter  We both sort of got our own space  Location was amazing  We enjoyed local restaurants and shops the only thing I would say is to pay attention to cleaning  Especially floors and walls  Dog next door barked and whined almost constantly on our last day  Couldn t sleep walls very thin  Overall nice place and we d love to stay there again The floors and walls weren t as clean as expected  Smudges of bathroom wall   etc  but overall the please was clean and beautiful
635997055,I would just suggest responding to request would have made the stay more satisfying  Other than that I was fine  Walked into the bathroom to find the toilet filled with hair and other particles  It was on and around the toilet which made me feel like the whole apartment wasnt cleaned properly  It was nasty and Especially during a global pandemic
660334756,Please take the time to go to place and look around  Would you want your family Coming from out of town to stay here or experience  bad communication or for place to not be ready at time stated on booking  I suggest serious upgrade s including entry and inform people to be careful in this area  Cleaning is so important especially during this COVID   times and I m disappointed that this is Not top priority with your company  I have photos of sofa  with stains carpet  stains   walls need painting  Windows dirty  There is a wire going across the floor that is so dangerous  We we re getting bit by bugs  Rust around shower in bathroom  In need of upgrade and  TLC 
310634719,The place smelled like paint when we arrived   We found that our feet turned black if we walked on the floor barefooted  
491065157,The condo was great   The beds were comfortable  the size and amenities were fantastic and it was a perfect location with great views from the room and the rooftop   Thanks for hosting  The lobby and the elevator had constant odors that were really unpleasant 
670582553,The ceiling was peeling also was dirty in the mist random spots
670538933,Terrible plumbing  Very disgusting   embarrassing  I need a discount on my stay  I ve had the worst experience The toilet was clogged for almost   days before maintenance came
717288295,Unsanitary bathroom and bedroom  Small and large hairs all over the shower  clearly not cleaned   Small and large hairs all over the linen  Not cleaned properly   Cleaning supplies found in the place were  fresheners   No laundry soap for the washer  Likely does not have proper cleaning supplies  ex laundry detergent  to clean between stays 
717152522,you need to update your unit  sofa is broken and not practical  bedroom pillows are old saggy and grows  missing blinds at guest bedroom  no hangers for clothes  cleaningness of unit is bad especially the floor was with guie spots and unit smell funky  had to buy refresher to unit and open windows  floor was steaky  dryer was full with lint and unclean area  sofa is broken and dirty   seems like cleaning service did cleaning surface from the top 
667792481,Clean  but not super Covid surcharge clean   Many neighbors seem to smoke pot all the time  Given the surcharge for CoVid cleaning  this place was clean but did not feel like it got special attention  Table and window areas were dusty
664884339,I would highly recommend adjusting the pin on the map for the location of this listing   As well as taking extra care on cleaning during the COVID    situation   Communicating known damage of the facilities would have been preferred as well because adding a walk through to assess the apartment when we got there added additional stress to our stay  The rug in the common space seemed to have a decent amount of debris  the fan in the bathroom was full of dust  and the bathroom toilet seat had a hair crusted onto the seat   Very disappointing  especially during COVID 
704887242,I am happy with my  st Airbnb experience I would book this place again  Hopefully l meme will be more attended to  I just can t believe I packed up all of my things except for my toiletries I forgot which is disappointing  I didn t realize until later I didn t think there is anyway for me to get them back but if there is please let me know  Thank you  The place was at a quick glance clean my biggest issue was a lingering musty smell in the air  the place was stuffy  When you sit on the couch it smells musty in which I mean a body odor musty  The couch fabrics need to be cleaned  Then to make it worse some of the bed pillow cases were musty  I checked out the back up linen in the closet like sheets and an extra blanket and it all smelt musty  So pretty much seems the linen had not been cleaned since after previous occupants  The place was clean but linen is important we have to sleep and sit on these things it s gross thinking your sleeping in someone s sweaty bed 
669624626,love staying at the Montcliff  close to hospital great value  Will stay again            hair on the bathroom ledge by window
668823118,The beds are super comfortable  thank you  There were a number of marks on the walls in the bathrooms 
670518270,I had to sweep the floors upon arrival  some of the blinds needed to be replaced and the place needed a fresh coat of paint  Those weren t deal breakers though  it was super cute and comfy
484310182,Thanks for hosting us  We enjoyed our stay but as a fellow Airbnb host I always appreciate any private feedback that I get so I wanted to share mine with you   I know you have no control over what happens outside the apartment itself but I would talk to management about the fact that the hallways reek of cigarette smoke   Also  I would change the type of floor cleaner that is used as the smells is extremely strong and lingers for a very long time   Lastly  I would talk to the cleaning person as there where hairs in the tub shower and the baseboards are covered in dust   Again  just minor feedback and we enjoyed our stay  Hairs in the shower
664059334,I already messaged him privately Food in fridge was moldy and coffee grounds in coffee maker old and nasty
711892237,Thanks place was great with the exception of the two bathroom things I mentioned  The bathroom was really clean with the exception of the inside of the medcine cabinet there is a   way mirror when you open the cabinet which i used to shave and cut my hair but the inside had streaks and clearly hadnt been cleaned like the outside mirrors  Also the shower did not drain properly  fills like a tub  Must need Draino or a snaking device 
701831562,They neighbors were really friendly and helpful when we had issues unlocking the door of the unit and the neighborhood is great  The floors throughout the building are incredibly loud  you can hear every movement in the upstairs unit   Perhaps this is already priced into the unit  but it certainly wasnt obvious when we were booking  Also  the light fixture in the main  living  room would not full illuminate on our last day   it could be the lightbulbs  as they would glow slightly but never fully light up    Thanks for letting us stay at your place   The apartment smelled of stale cigarette smoke which was apparent when first entering  Upon returning to our own home  all of our clothes and belongings also smelled of stale cigarette smoke  There are several holes in the floor  mostly in the living tv room  and we saw a mouse in the kitchen 
705945239,We arrived and the apartment had not been cleaned  everything was left on the floors and the apartment hadnt even been vacuumed   We didnt straight up leave because we didnt have anywhere else to go and were tired because one of us just arrived from a    hour flight  I understand that if a person has an emergency they need to leave but I dont understand how you can say a place is ready when it isnt 
672163291,Inaccurate description of the cleanliness of the apartment  Bed sheets were full of hair  Sofa had multiple stains and hairs  Bathrooms were not wiped clean  The tubs had multiple stains from the previous occupants  The window sills were full of dead bugs  The walls and baseboards were dirty and full of dust  The entire apartment had an awful stench  Spider webs in numerous corners of the apartment 
713466442,Apartment was great  loved the furnishing  Window sills
569820860,Thanks for being a great host  I enjoyed my stay  Mirror was dirty and streaked when we arrived
700419721,Re evaluate the units door  It s broken and anyone could have gotten into that elevator and up to the room levels and kicked it in  Scuffed walls  broken door
631530867,The elevator had dog pee in it for a couple days  and the hallways were not clean
669678988,The unit was really nicely apportioned and we loved the location  It did get really humid  So much so that we opted to order a mini dehumidifier  It seemed to be fine if the air was cranked to arctic  but anything above    meant that the place was lingeringly swampy  Our unit was very clean upon move in   Its a functioning apartment building  and urban hipsters  living their normal lives can be slobs  We saw maintenance folks on the reg doing a good job keeping up with any issues  There was cigarette odor coming through on a couple of occasions  but overall  nothing worrisome 
671118756,Thank you for always being quick to respond and so accommodating  I appreciated the space that you provided and will definitely keep Zencity in mind when booking future trips  I appreciated all of the kitchen amenities that were made available  There were some dishes that weren t clean so I ended up running everything through the dishwasher when I got there 
656452072,Living room  there were trash and left over food compartment under couch
701168281,More dishes would be nice I had to do laundry to have clean towels
653885905,The first place never got cleaned before I arrived 
547627084,The communication with the host was very quick and good   We appreciated the photo showing the key box and the front door   very helpful   Thanks especially for that  Not that the place wasnt clean  but EVERY TIME we entered it  even on the last day  it smelled VERY strongly of cleaning products   We always needed to open the window and door to air it out 
547282069,Recommend switching out the white sheets with darker sheets   I understand that hair happens    But might as well make it a little harder to spot  The place was relatively clean   But the amount of hair we found  especially the short and curly variety    all over the floor and bathroom and in the bed sheets  kind of made us feel slightly suspicious about the cleanliness of everything in the apartment     But id say these things happen and i there were extra sheets in the closet which we switched out 
721595008,dirty dishes
437443289,Hi  The apartment location is really good  The challenges we had were a lot of the light switches didnt work and there were cleanliness issues in the main bathroom and kitchen  Also  when taking a bath there seemed to be a slight leak which we couldnt work out where it was coming from  With respect to the shower   because there was only   shower curtain  water tended to get everywhere   would be easy to buy a second shower curtain and also maybe replace the shower head  Bathroom floor seemed to be dirty as did the bath and window area  Kitchen was also slightly dirty  ALso   the entrance hall to the building and stairs to the apartment were dirty
437331940,Zencity was responsive and made our stay amazing  With its close proximity to amazing coffee bards  shops and restaurants    it was literally a perfect location for everything we needed for this quick getaway  Appreciate the team that hosted us  and would definitely stay again  A bit worn and needed of a bit more cleaning around the bathroom window and baseboards 
565705908,Brian  I appreciate your hospitality and quick responses  I would suggest offering a few more cleaning supplies like a broom or a swiffer for your guests to keep the floors clean  The trash can was broken when we arrived but I chose not to make a fuss because it was not that big of a deal to us  We brought most of our own cleaning supplies after reading your previous reviews  Other than that  the place was great for our needs  Thanks so much  Kitchen trash can was damaged as well as dryer unit in space  We saw a few centipedes  floors were a bit dusty  showers weren t sparkly clean 
707139081,There was a strong and weird smell in the apartment  Otherwise  great space   There was a wierd smell in the apartment
635472492,Dog feces outside door
659676040,Dog hair on the floor and coffee table
706611990,Couch is very stiff  other than that the apt was great  Central location  Thanks Carpet could need a deep clean
546537587,There was a problem with water coming in and flooding the floor of the bedroom and kitchen  I was not able to use the closet or walk on much of the carpet in the bedroom nor was I able to cook in the kitchen  Someone was apparently sent during the day while we were gone without letting us know  When we came back  it was worse than before and not cleaned up at all  I was not provided with anything to clean up the mess 
707157251,Rug had alot of crumbs on it
719460988,Dishwasher had a lot of caked on food in its   the couch and chair in living room were soiled 
546371550,Thanks for great communication  See what you are trying to do with the place  needs a lot of work  Would suggest having a discussion with the neighbors regarding hallway areas  There was a marijuana smell from the moment we walked in  Sheets had a wet feel to them 
640538956,All the other areas were clean but the couch smelled bad  We had to sit on the rug because of the couch s smell 
673448864,I know it is out of your control  but the lobby was very dirty  Like it had not been cleaned in weeks  We enjoyed and felt comfortable in the condo and found it to be clean except for underneath the bed  Being a condo  the lobby and other common areas where very dirty and noisy 
638176094,The ceiling had a lot of dirt build up and alot of paint needed to be touched up
574801448,Dust along skirting boards in bathroom  windows all had heaps of dust  there was a loose screwdriver in the carpet which I stepped on whilst barefoot  Walls and mirror in bedroom had fingerprints 
653551484,i arrived and had to take out   bags of trash  there were bits of broken window treatment all over the floor  both beds had been slept in  the kitchen was a mess  and some of the furniture was broken 
661870535,No hot water at all No hot water all weekend

649870892,Thanks for allowing me to stay  The location is fantastic and I appreciate the modern feel inside  Not a huge deal  but behind the sink there was dust and grime that wasn t cleaned  Also around the edges of the main room there was some dust that maybe missed on cleaning  Again  not a huge deal  and I still have a   star overall review 
706919262,There were a couple blinds in the unit that were broken  No big deal but just mentioning what I noticed  Place wasn t dirty but bathrooms need deep cleaning  In fact the entire unit needs a deep cleaning

594473572,Walls had smudges  bathroom needed to be swept vacuumed
704647080,The large couch had white stains on it
541680853,The place was great  Super stylish  super affordable  great location  Thank you  There were some kitchen knives that were completely covered in what appeared to be dry  crusty pumpkin 
573615052,I was very unsatisfied but I had no choice but to stay  Thank God it wasn t for my entire trip  Never again   The bathrooms needs to be upgraded   The shower peeling is unacceptable  The entire apartment had a funky odor     Consider plug ins  This place wasn t the best  The pictures doesn t add up 
350605891,The place was overall really nice  Its unfortunate that previous guest had damaged the place and furniture  Some of the chairs were a bit wobbly so we put them in a closet to prevent them from getting broken  which we could tell were probably damaged from previous guests  The place was perfect for our group  especially the pool table and ping pong tables  I would recommend maybe adding a few more kitchen items  such as baking sheets and a pan to bake in  We really did enjoy the place and would recommend it to other people using AirBnb     The floors were a bit messy in the back apartment  not a huge issue  We had just found what may have been mouse droppings and some glitter on the floor 
432693929,Try significantly upgrading LR furniture and accurately represent the property in the listing  Location is great  The floor in the last bing room had ants
431185533,Thanks for everything  Just wanted to let you know one of the dining chairs legs was broken when we got there  We actually sat in it and it crumbled  I just wanted to let you know so you didnt think we broke it  Vacuuming  We are totally floor people 
568558645,A few holes or patches on walls  some towels were rather dirty
571955222,We enjoyed our stay  And we did appreciate attentive responses to requests about wifi TV not working  and access to second set of keys  But we did feel inconvenienced with no TV wifi entire stay  Hallways were quite worn and carpet dirty 
559164118,Dishes left in dishwasher  dishes had  milk residue
557299015,The comforter under the duvet was heavily stained
551683574,Needs a deep cleaning and new paint  Bathroom ceiling is bad  corners of shower dirty  wall by light switch dirty 
623922540,The dishes were filthy with dried food on them   I would also suggest not keeping flowers  As they die they smell terrible  The dishes weren t clean 
420787645,I dont like the shower  fix on the wall  It will be great if can take down to work         
228228425,Hey Chris   The two suggestions Id have are    the toilet has a slow leak and the flapper probably needs to be replaced     I couldnt get the heat to turn down   I followed the instructions on the thermostat  but  it always reverted to    degrees   Neither issues was worth discussing while I was there   Thanks  Brian  
228054089,Thank you for a great stay   We loved the location of your place  
583325465,Overall this truly is a really beautiful place to stay  But there were a handful of things that didn t work properly that we really  really wish had  I m just dropping by privately to leave some constructive criticism  I feel like this place has potential to be an even higher value with the following   Ensure kitchenware is truly clean before allowing a new tenant to come in  Oil on cookware is unappealing  Also you should look into putting oven mitts in the space   Bathroom  just invest in some bathroom spray for after poops and a full size shampoo  conditioner   body wash  It won t be much more expensive than buying all the tiny single use ones and makes it feel much homier and less like a cold hotel  Also  the toilet was installed improperly on the spring and therefore lurches every time you sit down  Id get that checked out  Also recommend two ply toilet paper and paper towels  The rest of the place is so plush and nice  don t cut corners on these simple and easy amenities   Not sure if it s just because it s a basement unit but the WiFi does NOT consistently work  Cuts out and boots you off consistently  This is something I had asked about before so it really shouldn t have been a problem  but it was  If the basement has a hard time holding onto WiFi  invest in an extender  Nothing worse than needing to get work done and not being able to do it from your Airbnb    Black out curtains were great in the bedroom  I suggest them for living room as well  Had someone stop and look in  crouch  while we were inside and not clothed    The door connected to the lot took   ish days to actually lock  Did not make us feel safe as one night when we left  we noticed a man in the lot checking cars for valuables to steal    Safety is a huge priority  This is why we weren t keen on soulard when I originally messaged   Should really make an effort to make it transparent in the listing that there s currently construction    especially since this affects doors being left unlocked  noise during the day  and the place being generally littered with flecks  dust  construction bits  etc  Also dog poop all over the front entrance carpet the first two days    it s so important to keep the place clean  And dust free or at least be transparent that there will be dust for asthmatics    The water in the shower does not stay cold for long  I would try to find a way to fix this  Impossible for two people to take subsequent showers  We showered together to keep the water hot long enough but that s not everyone s situation   Washer does not drain water  This can be a real stick in the mud if you re trying to wash your clothes and get somewhere   issue wasn t resolved during our stay sadly    Vent is exceptionally loud and the apartment for some reason will not change temperature quickly  Our thermostat was at    most the time and no matter how much we tinkered with the settings  we couldn t get it down to a more comfortable temperature   Finally  it s an underground unit and there must be access somewhere as there are ants around in the kitchen      Overall it is literally a beautiful space  The kitchen is gorgeous  The bed is SO comfortable  It s aesthetically so pleasing  But if you want to make it a true value  please address those issues    Dishes with oil on them still minor cleanliness issues with stove top and countertops
454129186,Hey zencity   Overall had a good stay but as I mentioned in my note  the bathroom floor was really dirty    And less important but the pillows and bed are pretty uncomfortable    Might also be helpful to leave notes on how to make the apt cooler    Thanks Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom 
413518084,Some hair in the shower  and around the toilet base 
412854566,Thanks again  Fan in bedroom covered in dust  Floors also needed to be swept 
412844225,Your place was awesome   other than the cleanliness we were very pleased  I understand most hosts don t clean there own places and hire outside of themselves but man it was bad it was like someone made the bed and left  We also noticed we didn t get hot water at night time Kitchen was filthy and there was oily residue left over on the bathroom counters from who knows what
409759483,rotten food smell upon first entering  but it went away and didnt come back 
191233672,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  Additional comments   Cobwebs and trash near the door  
500751993,      cause de la salle de bain
408821481,Thanks for having me  It was a good stay  There was a slight odor when I walked in the door  a bit of mold on the bathroom windowsill  and the mop and cleaning products outside the bathroom took away from the ambience  It would be great if those were stowed away in the closed storage space  Also it got warm but I was able to climb up on a chair to reach the fan Interior of microwave oven had food stains
408149321,I would DEFINITELY  stay again  Might just have to check behind housekeeping though  Counter was dirty  The comforter from the closet had foodstains 
622529890,Refrigerator had food in it and stunk  Bed sheets had stains  Cigarette butts and suppose to be non smoking apartment 
162615592,Hey Chris  I really appreciated how quickly you responded to my question and the ease of check in check out  Also  the bed was very comfortable   I gave   stars instead of   because the space is really cool but has SO much more potential  Ive spent lots of time in warehouses   artist spaces and there a few things that could make the place more inviting  touching up the holes in the walls   repaint  if the walls were a neutral color they wouldnt be noticeable   could even look cool  The extension cords running across the floor were a bummer   I ended up rerouting some chords to not trip  Also  the outlet that the ball shaped light was plugged into was out   The noise pollution was mentioned in in the listing but since the bed is directly underneath your neighbors living area there was cigarette smoke all night  too  This can be helped if you moved the bed to another wall or down the wall  This would help solve some of the lack of outlets near the bed too  Dust   slight odor in the bathroom was unfortunate   I took a broom and knocked down a bunch of cobwebs   Your space really is awesome  just not as inviting as I had hoped  Wish you the best of luck in the future  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust 
151599276,Thanks Chris  I enjoyed my stay at your place and the helpful instructions  I think you may want to check the bathroom mirror light fixtures  as I got a electric schock  nothing serious  from the light switch  The bathtub and shower would also need some renovation  But overall the stay was good  Thanks and cheers  Jan Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower 
625344121,I enjoyed the space  there was a slight bug issue I had to take care of when I first arrived but check in was very smooth and thank you for adjusting the thermostat  It seems someone adjusted it even before I got a response so thank you  Kitchen   bedroom were very clean  Bathroom was decent  The trash was more than half full when I arrived  I felt it should ve been taken out prior to my stay  I had to take time to escort   bull flys out the window as they flew around for quite some time   I had to take care of a spider shortly after getting settled in 
400313894,the place just felt like it was falling apart a bit  none of the doors closed properly  soap dispenser didnt work  notified Zencity upon arrival 
299241896,Over all the place was great  the only thing that could have been better is the noise from the party above us   This could have been a private unit or another Airbnb   The sound transfer between the unit and the unit above was not great  while the party was going on we could hear squeaky foot steps and loud talking   We were tired so falling asleep was not a problem  thought the owner should know   The shared common area with other unit s  were not well kept 
368296100,In addition to my other comments  This property appeared not to be owned by an individual  When I got to the residence not only did I struggle to find parking  the keys were not in the lockbox  I sent a message via the app but then I also called to get a call center who didnt really show any empathy that there were no keys in the lock box  The agent said that she would make it an urgent message but couldnt say when someone would call me back  In the meantime  Chris responded and asked me to try the backup lockbox which was also empty  He then asked me to try the cleaners box which had multiple sets of keys  I am guessing that they own multiple apartments in this building   One set of keys allowed me to get into my designated apartment  Please note that ALL   lockbox combinations were set to just one number difference than the actual combination  This did NOT give me a very safe feeling  I realize that the owner of this listing may not have control over the initial area when entering the building and the staircase but it was disgusting and left a bad impression  When you are paying a cleaning fee you expect the areas to be clean  The floor in the kitchen didnt seem to be thoroughly washed  Along baseboard wasnt clean and only found this when I bent down to pick up something  Behind bathtub was also a little dirty  I realize that the owner of this listing may not have control over the initial area when entering the building and the staircase but it was disgusting and left a bad impression  When you are paying a cleaning fee you expect the areas to be clean

350881460,Hey Chris   Thank you for allowing me to stay in another one of your properties   However I was a bit let down with this last property   I would highly recommend checking out the area prior to listing and ensure that they re actually as clean as listed because I found the bathroom and linen as well as the couch were not that clean   For example   The linen was not very clean as I am use too seeing or dealing with Zencity   I noticed stains on the couch in the living room and stains and hair on the linen in the bedroom plus the bathroom was not that clean as well   The tub had blonde hair in it as well as  I had to basically disinfect and clean everything before I used it because I was surprised that the property was not as clean as I was used to seeing from past and previous experiences   Although it was a bit surprising considering that I have had such great experiences in the past   Nonetheless there were some negatives involved   All in all I did enjoy that there were more positives that outweighed the bad things which is why I wish I could give a     star rating   At any rate I would still highly recommend  Zencity  despite the circumstances I experienced at this one location   Thank you  Shae The linen was not very clean as I am use too seeing or dealing with Zencity   I noticed stains on the couch and linen in the bedroom and the bathroom was not that clean as well   The tub had blonde hair in it as well as the bedding and I had to basically disinfect and clean everything before I used it because I was surprised that the property was not as clean as I was used to seeing from past and previous experiences   I was a bit disappointed however I wasn t completely let down because there were other positives that out weight some of the negatives   I wish I could give a     instead but I only have the options of     stars 
586213324,Different bathroom than that pictured in listing   old and dingy
434804845,hair on the floor and in the bath shower
548037532,This was a great space and perfect for what I needed   Thanks for putting forward the  extra effort to assist me with getting in and the internet issue  There were   used washcloths in the tray of the shower caddie   They were from previous tenant 
718886963,Thanks for hosting us  Maybe include instructions in the check in process for how to lock the door  hold down unlock button on keypad  and our key fob was broken  Other than that it was a nice stay  It wasn t unclean  just a little grungy  low quality  For example  bathroom toilet paper holder was broken  or stains on the walls and such but it wasn t unclean 
580442055,Overall the place was really nice and clean  However it smelled awful or weed  which didn t go away  and there was black hair on the shower wall  Also  poop in the toilet  The kitchen smelled like weed  There was poop in the toilet  And black hair on the shower wall 
640854602,Some lighting was out flickering
579864338,Bathroom still showed signs of construction  Grout stains on the tile and grout stuck on shower floor
645306829,please just take care of your cleaning people so they take better care of your business  invest in candles  always keep the air blowing even if no one is there  the floor was dirty and had t been swept before they ran the duster mop across the floor  the sheets were dirty  the extra sheets were dirty  i smelled terribly  i was overall just very disgusted  used my t shirts as pillow cases 
669935197,The apartment was not cleaned to my satisfaction  The window seals were dirty and the blinds were so dirty that they were gray instead of white  When I brought this up to Zencity  they did not see it as a concern and advised me that this was the apartment that I booked

646349974,You need a new cleaning company  Nothing looked like it had been cleaned  Like moldings had dirt on them  floor didnt look swept  and there what looked like to be black mold on the ceiling where the shower was  I could be wrong  but it looked like it was 
714300203,The place was really nice minus the floors not mopped and the pillows on the sofa had a few stains that were a little questionable  Floor was very dirty  Not visibly but when I stepped in the shower I noticed my feet were black from the floors not being mopped 
628942484,First place was amazing  The second was going well and then the lady ruined it  Kitchen and bathroom disarray
348058781,Hi Chris     Thanks for a great stay  I honestly might have just missed this  but having an extra blanket in both bedrooms would be great for future guests  Other than that we really enjoyed the place   Alex Common areas could have been vacuumed a little better  mostly couches 
628928296,Replace those pillow cases and begging  Stained bedding is tacky  The bedding is stained really bad and it s sickening  The pillows to be exact  I m not sure what stained it  new pillows are needed 
610611487,The day when we arrived I heard the furnace working fine but the following day after going site seeing we came back to a very cold apartment   I checked the thermostat and the furnace was off  It seemed if someone had came into the apartment and turned off the furnace  Some areas seemed dusty such as the window in the upstairs bathroom  There were long hairs left behind in the upstairs shower also

569091554,Overall  we really enjoyed our stay  the place was nice and in a great location  However  the bathroom needs some work and the photos in your listing should be replaced with accurate photos    Thanks for the hospitality   Amanda Overall  the apartment was nice and clean but the window in the bathtub was covered in mould and it needs a fresh shower curtain 
347006947,Great space  Smooth check in process  Thanks for the stay  Shower curtain should be cleaned up changed
672412619,There was a drainage issue in the bathroom that caused a lot of flies to appear 
342447167,While we sincerely appreciated the overall cleanliness of the apartment and ease of check in  we feel negatively towards our experience because of the wrongful request of         post check out  Resolution was swift  but we will not be back  Very clean  but had a strange smell  Turns out that the smell was a wet  mildewed rug someone had balled up and left in the closet prior to our arrival  Host attempted to charge us almost      for rug replacement  However  after contacting the host the issue was quickly resolved 
231760827,Hi Chris   Thanks again for hosting us in your house  Overall the house and the area was super nice and we appreciated how well organized you were  I just want to tell you that the bathtub was clogged so the water wasnt draining   Thanks again  Konstantina    Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower or tub

629084056,Would recommend more toilet paper and paper towels for future guests  The beds were awesome  I wish I knew where you got the mattresses because they were extremely comfortable  The whole place could really use a deep cleaning  Could definitely tell that housekeeping did a quick once over 
622802305,Was great deal and had no other issues other than it could have been cleaned better  Cleaning wasnt taken care of before we arrived  Had dirty toilets and dirty dishes in the cabinets 
628922820,CockRoach
622640715,The directions stated to take the elevator to the  th floor upon arrival   This was not possible without a key fob   A resident had to scan us to the  th floor  Rug was very dirty   Looked like it had never been vacuumed   Threads and debris all over it 
308032596,electricity very funky  that ac kitchen light and bedside light issue should have been fixed before u rented   kitchen cabinets outside and in need cleaning  no shades on windows means u wake up as soon as sun rises  no stores nearby so a nice touch would have been coffee available  water pressure terrible in bathroom and no hooks to hang clothes  bathtub narrow and curved  I fell the first time I used it  u need to put something down  I almost broke a bone  bathroom floor rug  could be cleaner  hallways smell awful   cabinets and refrigerator
304465243,hair left in bathtub  food  hair clips  and nail clippings in common areas 
640602010,Kitchen dishwasher was already full of dirty dishes so just had to run it  Not a huge deal  but reason I gave   stars

341303850,Thanks for the great stay  There was some spillage in the fridge   Not a lot  but a bit offputting 
339453438,The last air bnb I sated in had new toiletries and she stocked the fridge with some waters and juice  It would have been nice to have a note and a little more amenities especially for the price  Also was disappointed with the size of the place and the cleanliness  The kitchen had crumbs on the counter and the bathroom toilet needed to be wiped
576157422,bathroom trash was not emptied  bedroom comforter had pee stains on it
369170300,Thanks very much for your quick responses  The sink was blocked and had some spoons in it  but thanks for getting the maintenance people to fix it

608455626,Floors were not very clean  everything else was good 
275243643,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
331432337,We enjoyed the stay overall  but the lack of kitchen amenities was frustrating  Nevertheless  the excellent location and beautiful nighttime view made up for these negative points  The windows were really dirty  which defies the purpose of having a beautiful view 
331030009,Thanks for getting back to me so quickly  Great communication  All in all  this was a clean space  but there were places in the house  next to beds  on top of counters  etc   that needed a little extra dusting  One of the sheet sets also had a pink stain of some sort   Not a big deal  but still   There was also a lot of flies in the apartment  which were in the back bedroom 
266197131,Overall a great experience  Thanks for having me  The apartment was generally clean  but there was quite a bit of dust under the bed and the coffee table was covered in a layer of sticky residue 
650210048,The bathroom was not as clean as expected  The plates were still wet in the kitchen cabinets   Could have used kitchen towels or paper towel 
404583884,thank you very much  I enjoyed the stay a lot  incredible view  nice apartment  it was a little smaller than I expected  and the cleaning fee seemed a little much  especially for how the flat was    hairs on the floor  but otherwise it was really great  thanks again  wasnt bad at all  just not as clean as you might like
643719016,Thank you guys  team and absolutely amazing amazing team and company its fine  just ashes and left the trash no big deal
629294312,This was a getaway for me and a staycation for a friend   It was a cute little loft in a trendy neighborhood   I am more of a hotel guy  but loved the chance to make breakfast and lunches before going out  A couple hair balls under kitchen chair and bench 
629115223,There were bugs everywhere in the bathroom 
444246742,Shower curtain was moldy  as was the window area 
708541466,I wanted to say thank for your quick response and customer service  but this apartment really needs some upkeep and deep cleaning performed before it is rented out again  I am also upset that I lost one night on my refund  But I was pleased with the quick responses from Marty  The tables  toilets  walls and floors were disgusting  The whole place smelled like dead fish because the dishwasher was full of water and dishes 
321139102,We enjoyed our stay and the place was great  Really nothing serious   just a bit dusty around the floor and walls 
722206578,I tried to communicate my issue with you all before leaving a review that might hurt your business  but I had no reply  I dont think this apartment was cleaned at all  Pillow cases were incredibly wrinkled and smooth where a head would have laid  Found two hairs on the back side of the pillow cases  Carpet was not vacuumed  Dirty broken cup in bathroom  and coffee maker was super dirty 
604792490,There was a wet mop smell from the closet   but took some clean supplies and washed it out and let it dry properly and it was fine after that 
284462054,Hi  We loved your place but the floors were extremely dirty like they hadn t been mopped for quite sometime   It didn t affect our trip but wanted you to know because I know you have a cleaning lady   We appreciate your quick responses and would stay again  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  dust 
640129277,The only thing I would say is that the place overall was very clean but there should be a new coat of  non flat  paint for the whole apartment because people apparently don t know how to treat an Airbnb like their own and the walls were very scuffed and dirty with water spots 
719767361,Bathtub was dirty upon arrival  I called them and they cleaned it the next day

715291419,Thank you so much  Shower wall needed to be wiped down
626523620,Overall  we had a good experience  and would consider staying at the apartment again the next time we go to KC  The duvet in one of the bedrooms reeked of sweat 
578378379,It would be REALLY helpful to have   sets of keys for a   bedroom  Shower liner was a bit orange and grungy  never remembered to reach out after out of bathroom 
506402720,Please do not use existing cleaning product  It reeks of cheap chemicals  forced me to vacate room for long stretches  and never went away over the course of entire visit  and Im not particularly sensitive to smell     Also note that fridge  even when unused and seemingly on a low setting  roars idly  both unpleasantly noisy and energy inefficient    Last  pillows are about the cheapest you can find  Lumpy  synthetic  insubstantial   Sorry to sound negative  I travel a ton  and use Airbnb constantly  but this is my first non five star review  Dingy halls   strong and persistent smell of cleaning product in room
430000054,Shower curtain was moldy on the bottom   otherwise it was spotless and included all cleaning supplies 
503591948,after having stayed in a property in the same facility that you manage I was looking forward to staying here again  Your communication and technical facilities are lacking  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me 
503259970,Great location  decent space  but compares poorly to a hotel room in terms of amenities for the price   We didnt reach out while there because we were simply too busy  Vents were filthy  Fridge needed work  Shower curtain was stained and needs to be replaced 
497501758,W really enjoyed the location and the size of the unit  The tv did not have instructions to operate basic tv  It could have been cleaner  Floors and vents where dusty  Kitchen stools had crumbs in them  Master Bathroom had mold and mildew  The backdoor was unlocked when we arrived  Difficult to lock this door  Otherwise we would not have a problem spending this amount on the unit The entire apartment was dusty  The vents showed a lot of dust on them in the master bedroom  The master bathroom shower had mold and mildew  The shampoo and soap dispenser  which is old and not working should be removed  Only collecting more mildew 
609259613,Found a giant toenail on the living room carpet  along with some  hopefully  food scraps  And a brown smear on the bathroom floor
566159172,Tub was dirty and water did not flow well  Bathroom was very small 
566146991,see earlier private note but also  one good kitchen knife would be a great addition  as noted privately  incense was too much
193752163,Thanks again Chris   I enjoyed my stay  Your place was fine for my occasion in Chicago  The only thing that bothered me was the water leaking from the toilet and the good sized bug crawling on the bathroom floor  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs  bathroom  Additional comments   Toilet issue  Leaking water coming from toilet upon flush   Brown beetle of some kind crawling round sink in bathroom

700908689,Thank you  Wonderful stay  I would recommend cleaning the ceiling fan and vent in the bathroom  Other than that  it was a wonderful room and great building to stay in  I would recommend cleaning the ceiling fan and vent in the bathroom 
613087902,You really should take this place off the market until you do a very deep cleaning and touching up of the unit  The place has a dingy feel  the furniture is atrocious and dirty and in general I would not stay there again  The entire place needs deep cleaning  It has a dingy appearance  theres lots of dust bunnies and hair behind the bed headboards  there is lint and hair from previous guests on the small carpeted areas 
548009971,I loved the place and the location   It is very tastefully decorated  a great location  and quiet    dirt and other peoples things under the bathroom sink
623184531,It was some black sticky stuff on the kitchen floor it needed mopped but I would book again   Thank you Enjoyed my stay and I definitely recommend
601450953,Overall a good stay  Without the key it was pretty inconvenient for parking and entering the apartment  I chose the location over others based on having the gated parking area so was disappointed that we then had to find street parking when we returned each evening  The whole weekend we were there a spilling of tomatoes dressing was directly outside our door and people had garbage bags in the hallways  It did not smell pleasant 
468981471,I thought your apartment was really nice  smelled and looked clean  and you had very fast response times  Thanks for hosting us There were spiders in my shower
555441561,The entire condo was dirty   There is black mold on baseboards and heating registers   There was hair throughout the bathroom and bedding 
599015957,It was a great time  Thank you very much  the system to get into the building made me feel super safe  I guess my only comment would be possible sound proofing since I felt like I could hear every room from the corridor  But in general I had a great time  Its an apartment so a few places will be slightly dirty but in general it was clean
576886134,Happy Holidays   Do you guys have discounts for  nd stay  I hope this is private  It s very beautiful  I just had to do a lot of cleaning when I got there  The master bathroom toilet seat should be replaced  The shower dispenser is really disgusting  the shower caddy was really dirty  I always come prepared  even though I pay a cleaning fee  The carpet had all type of hair on it  Like I said it very nice  I just know you might just pay a cleaning company and not aware  I would have taken the garbage out  There was no way to trash The outside heater didn t work  I would definitely recommend your place and I have  Thank you

472941077,Hi Chris   We had a great stay and we really liked your apartment  Good communication and good directions to find the key  We were positively surprised to find that the apartment had a washing machine since this was not in the description  Cheers  Niklas The apartment was very clean  To give a good first expression  the stairs outside the apartment could do with a cleaning and to make it extra nice  the stairs down to the basement could be painted 
622085774,We really enjoyed the space  The unit had everything we needed to feel right at home  Very convenient location  also  There was hair in the shower and the shower drains really slow 
200794643,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  toilet  Additional comments   Some mildew inside the toilet    not a lot  but noticeable   
599028160,The parking situation and neighborhood are the downsides to this otherwise great space  It would be great if there was secured parking someplace the building or in a gated spot nearby  The sketchy people on the street at all hours of day night  usually pan handling for money or making inappropriate comments about my wife  were not only annoying but a legitimate safety concern  Numerous times  police arrived at the gas station nearby  On one occasion in particular  the officer pulled up to us as we left for dinner asking if we had heard  two shots  in the past few minutes  Not sure what could be done  but it would be a deterrent for me to rent the space again  The trash cans were full when we arrived  Otherwise  the apartment was clean 
262406714,Chris  this was a good place  We may use it again  I hope you take this in the spirit of continuous improvement    nothing more  The fact that the kitchen light  overhead light  must be on at the same time the TV is on is very annoying from the angle one watches while sitting on the bed  Oh  and a couple things that would be over the top       Provide coffee for that french press in the cupboard         Provide a drain plug for a long hot bath    and maybe a rubber bath mat too since the service that refinished the iron tub left some grit in surface finish at the bottom  Well done  I say  Good spot  Easy to find  Very Clean   gnats hanging around the drain 
595204450,Loved that there was parking within the lot  The overall security of the facility was top notch  The only household item I would suggest to have available are oven mitts  Overall  Loved staying here  Great location and loved that there was a gym on site  Was the perfect stay  It had looked like the entire building was newly renovated but not fully cleaned yet

587885468,Hi Zencity There are a few things that lead me to believe the apartment wasn t quite user ready      the address was not correct   I arrived very late after dark so this gave me a bit of anxiety when checking in      it was very very cold in the apartment and it took quite a while for the temperature to rise   the hot water runs out VERY QUICKLY   My boyfriend took a very quick shower and i was not able to finish my shower afterwards before the hot water ran out      I arrived very late and so went to bed with intentions of sleeping in   Please note this trip was for personal vacation holiday travel   Because of the construction in the building  the fire alarm in the complex went off around      am   It was VERY cold outside and I had to sit in the car until about      when the fire department was able to turn off the alarms    very loud construction noise continued the first morning until around   am   For a business trip this would have been fine but I was very unhappy about the noise because my plan was to have a relaxed vacation with lots of sleep    some how water is escaping the shower stall and runs all over the bathroom floor   I have a photo of where the water seems to be coming from   Thursday morning there were construction workers doing electrical work in a closet just across the hall from the apartment door   The actual work did not create much noise at all BUT They had a boombox radio on very loud   That is very inconsiderate     constantly finding hair on the floors and couch was very unpleasant      I kept my gym clothes on the floor in the closet   When retreating them I found layers of saw dust all over my clothes because the baseboards had never been wiped off from the renovations     I really didn t like that the apartment unit door does not meet the floor   There is a pretty wide space at least an inch between the floor and the door for cold air  noise  and if any pests or rodents are in the building they now have easy access to your apartment     Lastly   I would have liked to know in advance that this until was in the basement of the complex and also a corner garden until where all the windows are facing high foot traffic areas  It could be a nice   star rental but these details prevented me from having a seamless  relaxing stay   More than happy to discuss if you have any other questions  Building hallways were very dirty  building materials were sitting in the halls  Lots of hair on the floors  carpet  and area rug inside the unit   There were layers of saw dust along baseboards inside the unit 
704479555,The stay at your location was wonderful  Definitely will book again on the next visit  Most of the areas in the house was very clean  However  there was food stains on the comforter  We had to wash the sheets and comforter 
246882693,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  very dusty 
246890119,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  strong odor 
709898431,There was hair in the tub which leads me to believe that the bathroom wasn t thoroughly cleaned  I went ahead and did my own cleaning 
576883427,With the building still be under construction  the ventilation system had yet to be cleaned  When we turned on the heat  you could see the white construction dust coating accumulate on the furniture and floor   Not healthy stuff to breath in  And one of the bathrooms had not been vacuumed 
626530179,I always enjoy my stay  there was a few things that arent usually an issue  The bed linen was full of hair and makeup  the toilet rim could have been cleaned better as well  and there was a comforter outside the front door from my arrival until I left  It just seems as it was a rush cleaning job  Thanks This was unusual its normally always very clean
522170953,Apartment overall was clean and tidy  but the bathroom was not cleaned  particularly the shower  There were long black hairs all over the shower walls and the tub floor  Also  the tub did not drain while taking a shower  so I was standing in   inches of water during my shower  When I brought this to Zencitys attention  they stated  thanks for the feedback  we will let our cleaning service know  and didnt seem very apologetic 
433015660,Thank you for letting me check in early  The floor was a little dusty  it made me wish I had slippers 
700000505,The areas were clean  However the front of kitchen and bathroom cabinets had not been wiped down  You could see the remnants of food lotion on them  I wiped them down myself  Also  the walls are white and I could see that the walls were dirty  not filthy  but enough where you notice  Overall  it was a good experience and I would certainly stay in another one of your properties 
512836952,The floor was so dirty that it turned my feet black with just a small amount of walking around  The dishes were dirty   one of the  clean  glasses even had lipstick on it  The bathroom had mold and mildew  and it had clearly not been cleaned for some time  Besides these things  the were minor stains spots on the sofa and the walls throughout the apartment were dirty 
508959172,We were not thrilled with things being broken and extremely dirty   especially bedroom fan  You are overcharging and misrepresenting your rental for what it is  Would not stay at or recommend your properties  Biggest cockroaches I have ever seen  disintegrating window ledge in bathroom  inch thick of dust on bedroom fan   could not turn it on  general grime seen under bathtub  baseboards  etc  Surface level it looked OK but felt very grimey  Bedroom door also broken off hinges  unable to close  Couch was broken  caving in  very uncomfortable 
230225206,The apartment worked out nicely  Great value  Kitchen was just enough  Only thing I wished for was a small table to sit at  maybe in a corner of the living room  with two chairs  Thanks for the week  
230028730,Place was awesome   Ill be coming back to your places again  
228205588,""
494663501,You all were very responsive and helpful with my questions  We enjoyed staying in your place and would use Zencity again   Since you can cook there and you have pots and baking pans  it would be helpful to have a pot holder for removing things from oven and hot pad to protect surfaces from hot pots or pans  Bathroom floor could have been a little cleaner  My husband had to use a towel to dry floor because we got it a little wet  Towel was a little too dirty after wiping floor

417545199,Thanks for sharing your space with us during our visit to Chicago  This was our first experience not staying in a traditional hotel   We ll definitely use an Air BNB in the future  Next time we ll know exactly what questions to ask and what to look for on a listing that will better accommodate our specific needs  In the Fridge  there was an opened alcoholic beverage left  The bottom bins also needed some cleaning as they both were soiled  I took photos just in case these areas were an issue once we checked out  I didn t want to be blamed for the uncleanliness  The stove oven could also use some attention   When turned on to pre heat  it smelled as if something was burning 
622756826,I have stayed in this apartment twice now and lived it both times  Love the location and it is the perfect amount of space  The microwave was dirty on the inside and had fingerprint smudges in the outside  I personally dont care but thought you should know especially with the current covid situation and the fact that you charge a cleaning fee 
415797730,Your place was great  Loved the location and such a great deal  Seriously the only issue was the hair In the shower     There was hair in the bathtub and on the shower wall 
408163971,Thanks for the wonderful place to stay  I was a bit concerned about the water leak I mentioned  but otherwise it was perfect and a great place to be when visiting UChicago  The heater in the bedroom was leaking water  which was causing some mold in the floor  I turned it off  but it definitely should be looked at 
429040485,This building was beautiful but cleanness was that to be desired  Sending photos and saying how paying extra for the cleaning charge when it was not is not right  I just got automated responses from you as well as one that said you cant do anything because youre not management of the building     Not even trying to make things right for us  Our light in the apartment also didnt work and we didnt even bother mentioning it to you because you didnt care about our other concern  I really think its funny you ask for a   star rating when you definately  did not even give any courtesy of a   star treatment  Mostly door knobs and handles there was grime  Also caked on something in the kitchen sink and stucked toilet paper on the radiator  The ceiling light fan didnt work for light  even tried changing bulbs 
338150619,The living room rug and floor were kind of dusty and dirty  but kitchen and bathroom were fine 
721091014,I would suggest really focusing on cleanliness and accuracy of your check in instructions  Also  ZC support representatives could be better versed in dealing with these types of issues because the support was not beneficial at all  Also make sure you re providing what s listed in your listings   I e  a key fob Stray hairs left on towels and bed sheets  Bathroom walls have not been cleaned in who knows how long as various contributors of hair are plastered and line the wall 
356234984,Thank you for your hospitality and quick responses  My stay at the Del Prado Luxury studio was well worth it  The toilet was unflushed when we arrived 
599597725,Id give guests a heads up that youre still under construction until work is completed  From new Construction
342351539,Thank you so much for opening your home to me   the location was great and with the exception of a few bathroom issues   shower cleanliness  tub sink shower lining would definitely consider staying there again  You may also want to consider having the carpets cleaned    Thanks again and wish you a great week  The bathroom is really in need of work   the tub had stains  the shower curtain lining was dirty  I didn t use the shower  The sink is also in need of upgrading along with the carpet in the bedroom  The house is very nice but in need of a few renovations 
334674906,This has burned me off to Airbnb  not sure if I would use this service again  sticky surfaces in kitchen  rotten food in refrigerator  stove top   counters smeary  drain in tub not working properly  floors not vacuumed properly
467564282,Thanks for the use of your property we really enjoy our stay and will recommend this unit to friends Everything was great at this unit we did report to you that the hot water knob in the shower is faulty
464417067,schon erledigt Schr nke
464415211,Thank you for the stay  It was exactly as advertised   easy check in  The shower closet to the bedroom had hairs in it  It made me question how thoroughly it was cleaned 
464391781,Thanks for allowing our stay at your place space was clean
442122365,Please clean the bathroom tile  The crevices in the tile are black  They need a deep cleaning 
456455146,I did have a great time in Chicago and luckily was able to spend time outside of the apartment    There were just a lot of little things that caused me to not enjoy it        The place was a cute little apartment but for the price  I think it could use a few minor upgrades  The from lobby and elevator areas did not smell good at all   The apartment itself was fine 
456469210,Floors were gritty
713131467,The entire place was filthy when we arrived  Dirty in every way  Honestly the worst Airbnb experience I ve had as far as cleanliness and attention to detail goes  Very disappointed in the lack of cleanliness especially since this listed indicated it was an  enhanced clean  unit  Dirty laundry under the bed  Terribly dirty floors  Every high touch surface like light switches and faucet handles and such was filthy  I know because I could see smudges and then cleaned them all with anti bacterial wipes  I was expecting extremely clean  as this unit was certified on AirBnb as  enhanced clean   It wasnt even clean  much less  enhanced  clean    
623298754,Our stay was very enjoyable  we loved the place and will definitely come back again  Thank you  Carpet and floors were a little bit dirty  but other than that everything else was perfect
164307513,Thanks again for the stay Chris  I previously mentioned the coffeepot and construction noise issues  Beyond that    It would have been nice to have some outdoor furniture  a larger bed with more pillows and perhaps a few more home good items like art  rugs  chairs  etc   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  floors and carpet 
428684836,Thank you for opening up your home to us  It was our first airbnb experience and unfortunately it wasnt the best  My suggestion would be to make sure the apartment is truly cleaned before allowing new guest to stay  When entering into the apartment there was dust balls on the floor and on the walls  I could tell the apartment had not been recently cleaned  There were multiple stains on our white comforter
710283398,The floors were not clean and sticky in some areas   The mattress cover had a burn hole in it   The tv in the main room wasnt level   And it seemed like the leather chair in the main room was bent and hanging on for dear life 
137480814,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower  bathroom 
620675807,Ive stayed in a few of your places and I like them  I know things happen sometimes so not being able to checkin on time wasnt a deal breaker Tub and inside the oven needed some extra attention
638722796,We appreciate you letting us stay  we d look forward to booking with you again     there was hair on the wall
538434735,Smelled like leftover cooking smell  main carpet area where bed is did not seem vacuumed
538414983,DARK CURLY HAIR EVERYWHERE  On the sheets blankets  On the towels  All over the shower and sink 
613664290,The place appeared to be generally clean upon arrival  Once I was there for a bit  I noticed the floors were very dirty  as though they hadnt been properly swept and mopped  the coffee table was covered in a layer of dust and the bathroom showed dirt not he dark gray tile 
598707105,The apartment was lovely  We didnt like the super long code needed everytime going into door  Light out in bathroom so it was a problem getting ready  Otherwise great location   building was nice  We really enjoyed our stay   would definitely come back It wasnt an issue of cleanliness  more maintenance  Light out on bathroom
585345392,Make sure to have apartments fully ready before future guests come   We will not be staying with Zencity again  There had been some construction inside the apartment and no one cleaned up afterwards   Also crumbs and a condom wrapper under the sofa cushions   When I complained Zencity offered to come clean but I think this should have been done before we arrived 
638500601,I m sorry about the sheets  My period came unexpectedly and I didn t know what to do  Otherwise cleaning walls needs done swept and mopped properly and the kitchen cabinets needed washed bad  The walls in the bedroom were dirty  The bathroom looked clean but the tub was gross and was stopped up so when you shower your standing in water  The floors need scrubbed and the cabinets were absolutely nasty on the outside  There were no pot holders there weren t any knives to properly cut things 
598187099,The carpet was dirty throughout the apartment 
603655044,Thank you for hosting us  Overall it was a really cool space  I did the dishes and loaded them in the washer to dry  And put our used towels in the washer  Didn t know what you d prefer  Floors were dirty  Not just fuzz but crumbs and dirt And such 
625986401,Very bad experience you could of at least got back to me about the mouse and WiFi my son was scared to come out of the bedroom There was spiders everywhere and most importantly there was mouses running around    the bathroom were filthy and let s just say with everything going on these days everything should of been much cleaner   I rented the places for    days and  I felt like I was stuck in a hell hole worst experience in my life 
626654821,Generally the cleaning could have been better   very strong smoking odor  I had to have the door open  hair in the shower drain  vacuuming hadn t been done well 
413978739,Only one set of keys provided   Would have been nice to have   sets  More hangers for clothes   Better hot water pressure   New shower head     Spare light bulbs so we could change when burned out    Dish drying rack for when we washed dishes  We corresponded about this   The unit had not been cleaned and reeked of marijuana   You did arrange for a prompt cleaning  but the smell persisted for days  it faded over the course of our stay  but each time we entered the unit we had a fresh  hit   
623176654,There should be a higher standard of cleanliness  Dishes in the dishwasher  trash in the corner by the bed  and stain on the comforter 
336682758,Super cute spot but again I think it s a bit overpriced  I did appreciate the French press and coffee  though  The alley with keys was a bit sketchy  there were two girls having a fight the first time I walked by  There were long hairs in the towels and in the carpet  Clearly someone with long hair had stayed there recently  It wasn t terrible but it was not ideal 
669634973,Thanks for the stay  Place could use paint touch up and cabinets some degreasing  Could use a paint job throughout  Kitchen cabinets are sticky and could use a good degreasing 
607799263,The shower floor was a bit dirty 
607360383,Thanks for your thorough check in instructions  responsiveness during our stay  and for allowing us to checkout a bit later than   am  it was much appreciated    You may want to replace the lighter in your apartment because it no longer works  Also  providing a candle may be useful for future guests as well  Thanks again  The apartment smelled a bit smokey for the duration of our stay but was otherwise very clean 
649127735,Thanks  We had a great stay  Your WiFi seems to be not working  just FYI Tub drain backed up during shower  Sink also backed up immediately 
632022279,Floor wasn t clean  but everything else was
623834577,I would double check on the cleaning a bit more but otherwise the place was fairly clean and nicely styled There was potatoes left in the oven and some kind of sauce splattered on the wall
617326360,Thanks for the opportunity to stay in the apartment  We will do it again once the COVID    goes away  Food on drawer
631269866,the carpet had spots
601481898,I would like a complete refund please  The bed sheets were not clean  They had multiple strands of long hair and were all wrinkled as if somebody had just slept in them  Somebody pooped in the toilet and didnt flush it so the bathroom smelled  The couch had multiple white stains and the kitchen sink was not clean either 
619857114,Thanks so much for hosting us  We had a great time Shower looked like it hadn t been cleaned
492841741,No toilet paper on roll when we arrived and dirty cup of sunflower seeds found on windowsill   Towels still in dryer  Also the fans dont work in the entire place  if they are on you cant turn them off and if they are off cant turn them on 
592213464,My only issues were the excessive crumbs etc in living room   kitchen and then no response on the heat  Either the heat was broken or doesn t work   if it doesn t work it would be nice to know that before staying there in the winter   it was snowing during my stay and very cold  Making the inside temperature of the apartment very uncomfortable at      There were a lot of crumbs on the rug in the living room  as well as the kitchen floor   the rest of the air b b was clean
606670582,Unfortunately we cannot say we enjoyed our stay and will not be able to recommend your services to friends  Upon arrival we quickly notices the whole place had not been cleaned 
706971909,I love the apartment  the floor plan is great  it is spacious and confortable  the location is fantastic so I will be back  Just to help  not in a negative way  the place needs maintenance  new stove pans  blinds  fix closet door and fuse box door  tighten hook  replace vanity in bathroom and shower bar  Thank you  Stove needs new pans  the are so dirty they cannot be cleaned anymore  Bathroom vanity is rusted and dirty inside  I would not put anything in it and shower curtain bar is rusted  Bedroom closet was dusty 
722383215,I asked for a small refund because of the issue in the master bedroom bathroom  The repair to the toilet was an extremely easy one and it didn t happen  The fact that I ended up having to use the bathroom in the other room was an inconvenience and a disappointment to me as a new visitor to St  Louis  And the couch in the living room was unstable and not the one pictured  The bathroom in the master bedroom had a toilet that did not work and maintenance did not come to fix it  Even though it was an extremely easy and low cost to repair 
620941313,There were a lot of hairs in the bathroom that weren t mine
610612690,The place was great  But I would for sure add some curtains or something for the bedroom you can see into from the kitchen  Thanks  A towel hook had fallen off and was lying on the floor with paint and drywall  before we got there  there were large scuffs on the walls 
620554058,Thank you for hosting us in this time of unknown  Apartment was mostly clean except oven was smoking  I believe there is caked on grease that causes the oven to smoke when it s turned on  Bath tub also was coming apartment 
619426862,Just had a musty smell
721937215,Rug was not vacuumed and had hair clumps all over it 
720122761,This place wasnt immaculately clean or upto the airbnb essential cleaning standards which is why we bring our own cleaning supplies everywhere 
718073042,Not sure if the apartment had a chance to get cleaned between guests as we had to clean the bathroom and bedroom before we used it 
720076330,Hair and stains on the sheets
605939814,I absolutely LOVED everything about this space  location and building    I will be back soon    Finding it was rough at night dark and then to have door code wrong was frustrating but the place was amazing and great value   Thank u    No biggie but a lot of small hairs in the bathroom sink  must have been caught around rim of the sink cause when water ran they appeared  Hair and fuzz on the floor by the trash can in BR  Counters could have been wiped better   A note to your cleaning people 
711636635,Thanks for allowing us to stay in the apartment   Here are a few issues we had    Apartment       I opened the  kitchen cabinet door and the door hit the light fixture and the plastic covering fell      Dirty sock under bed      Bathroom door won t stay closed   The rail bracket is uneven       No extra towels available      Toilet paper is  like sand paper     Small dresser in bathroom or closet would have been nice      Needs a full length mirror      Only one coffee mug available     Dirty dishes in the dishwasher      Kitchen has very minimal supplies       No kitchen towels       Small roll of paper towels on counter but no extra rolls       Pillows are flat and very misshaped   They seem to be very old or extremely cheap       No assigned parking  Very disappointing      Hair in the shower when we arrived        No personal touch to the room at all        The shower needs a ledge to put my shower gel shampoo on it         No replacement trash bags       Comforter in closet is dirty   Covered in lint and hair       No laundry soap       There is an iron but no ironing board       Dental floss hanging from the bathroom door       Bathroom trash can had existing trash        Couch has visible stains on it  I also emailed my suggestions to the inbox and in a private message 
222406570,The place could become really nice with smoother checkin  fixing the lack of amenities  kitchen items  chairs  towels  bed covers to mention some   In the current condition though we didnt feel it was worth the money  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens  Additional comments   Bed linens were dirty and the floors had visible dust and other items lying around   
711266095,Overall I really enjoyed staying here  but I want to note a couple things for you   The WiFi is really spotty The furniture is pretty uncomfortable and one of the kitchen stools is extremely squeaky Dishes not clean  as discussed in pms
623667787,I m so bummed what had happened   Couldn t get in  Slept in car for a bit then drove elsewhere  I hope I get the refunded I requested  Next time I would like to hear back from you guys more Did not know
623655166,There was a lot of dog hair on the floor  We had to swiffer a few times but other than that everything was clean and neat 
721988090,In my opinion there needs to be some major restructuring of how zen city manages properties  it was unacceptable to be notified   minutes before check in that I wouldn t be able to stay there and was left scrambling to find somewhere to say  The air bnb I was offered was significantly less than the one i booked meaning I would lose money then they tried to offer me half of a refund when I never even stepped foot on the property  I refused to cancel my reservation because this was in no way my fault nor did I have anything to do with why I couldn t stay there  Whoever is in charge of making sure check in will go smoothly needs to be notifying guests at least    hours in advance so they can make other arrangements  This whole situation was just absolutely unacceptable and I felt like I got scammed  I wouldn t know I was informed   minutes before check in that I wouldn t be able to stay there 
713892047,Overall the value matched the price and we enjoyed our stay  but i would double check your bedding  We found stains when we got there  They were minor  and didnt bother us much  but i would try to get it out or invest in new bedding  Stains on furniture  bedding  and rug
710303834,Overall  we enjoyed our stay  It felt nice to be somewhere homey rather then a hotel room  Living room  Couch pillow had stains  Bathroom  Towel for shower was stained  hair dryer had grime  floor was dirty  Kitchen  Dishes were dirty 
623651061,Smoke smell in one of the bedrooms from previous guest
351358144,There is some stains on bed 
425187857,parking was easy to find Sheets  comforter  towels were  stained  had hair in them  had crumbs  lint  The bathroom floor and bathtub still had hair on them  The rug in the living room was stained and overall just looked dirty  The kitchen sink had leftover food in it 
722837985,It is understandable that they might be closed due to restrictions but don t advertise amenities that are not available pool gym  The unit was not  obsessively clean   As well as the key fob situation being a major inconvenience  Parking was fine during the week but I image it would be hard to find during the weekends  I would suggest buying a spot in the garage if possible because people like the safety aspect as well as just convince  The bedding themselves weren t necessarily dirty  However  we found several strands of hair on the bedding  And in the bathroom shower floors  The common area was mostly clean  We did notice a few stains and  crust   most likely from food  On a few pillows and towels and in one of the recipe books that were left  The kitchen was cleaned to expectation 
494125006,I m extremely disappointed by lack of cleaning  The amount of dirt   debris is unacceptable  At first glance everything was fine there needs to be more attention to detail  Floors were not swept or vacuumed adequately  there were Plastic beads all over the common space from a previous guest  We swept the space ourselves it was so gross feeling       cleaning fee is a joke 
515855539,Thank you for the hospitality  It was very nice that the place was mostly clean  provided amenities such as tissues  clean dishes  and shampoo  and that the bed was made when I got there  One issue with the shower  it works just fine  but the temperature valve does the opposite of what it says it does   you turn it to cold to make the water hot  and turn it to hot to make the water cold   There were a lot of insects  flies  centipedes  tiny creatures   and the floor between the front hall and the living room was slightly sticky  it left residue on my socks and feet 
514119285,Always a wonderful stay in the Hyde Park area My only suggestion would be to use darker colored towels stains tend to stick with white and are visible even after washing  Hair in the tub and stains on the white towels  Thats the bad thing about having white towels  if they arent immaculate it will be noticed  Just use a darker color 
711933791,You have a really special place and we liked it a lot    We like nice places and was a little surprise to find the place with unfinished wall patches and so many missing lightbulbs  Sending over multiple people  with wrong and oversized lightbulbs and leaving all the bathroom lamp covers off made it look like an unfinished project  Carpets are grungy and shredding at the seams   The bathroom and kitchen were clean   The walls in one of the bedrooms had five large unpainted Sheetrock patches 
330573054,Multiple hairs found on bathroom floor from people that stayed before us  Floors had dirt and dust throughout the space 
551956934,The space was not cleaned well before our arrival at all  There were crumbs on the floor  dirt in the shower and our feet were black after walking on the floor for a few minutes 
217984273,Did not respond on day of check in when called on both phone numbers  Better instructions on how to unlock and lock main door Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  Additional comments   Dishes were left in the sink  
459672454,Thanks for your hospitality   We appreciate you addressing our concerns in a very timely fashion   I am sorry to be so  high maintenance     One other thought to consider would be to hose off the front porch from time to time   I have a front porch at my home and I have to do this several times a summer to keep it clean    Oh  and the front door seems like it should be replaced or refinished at some point   Just a suggestion    not a big issue for us that affected our stay     Thanks for sharing the walking   running route with us   very helpful   My wife and I enjoyed our walks together and I enjoyed my run   Maybe consider sharing a map in your unit for others in the future    I can see why you are a top rated host   Keep up the good work  Rating it a bit less than   due to ant issue   Thanks for addressing in timely fashion 
630619389,I loved the place but I did do some cleaning and disinfecting of my own because the cleaning staff did not do a great job  The floor was not vacuumed and there was a used bandaid at the top of the shower door  No paper towel 
592724122,Thanks for the stay  You made it very easy   but you definitely should look into your cleaning crew    I think they partly forgot our unit  Thanks  The first bathroom was completely disgusting  The quantity of dry pee on the toilet and boots stains on the floor would suggest that it hadnt been washed in a while    We had to do what we can to clean most of it ourselves with the limited products in the unit before using it 
713103476,This place was disgusting  have better business practices  It was clear the place hadnt been cleaned before I go there  The sheets were stained  the floor was dirty  and I even found chewed  dried gum on a chair in the bedroom 
708176193,Fix the shower head and do something with the second room there s no ventilation it was very suffocating sleeping inside there  and fix the windows because it almost slammed twice or didn t even pull up at all  The place was really dusty  the mirror was dirty and so were the windows 
618664140,Hand towel loop above bathroom sink broken  Not attached to wall  Bed linen had scattered hairs throughout  That being said  towels  bathroom and entire unit was super clean 
713123626,The entire place was covered in dust  the appliances in the drawers had crusted food still all over them  Upon entering the establishment there was a strong smoke odor that filled the entire loft 
700260978,We were pretty disappointed with the cleanliness  when you walk in and right away feel the need to clean it doesn t make your stay as enjoyable  We wanted to stay in the whole time we were there but had a hard time really being comfortable  Everything in the whole place was dirty in one way or Another  Sheets had hair on them  bedding didn t smell clean  all of the tables were dusty  the floors were so dirty we swept and mopped the second we got it  The dishes had a bad smell to them so Before we could even use them we had to wash them  It was just very hard to enjoy with all of that  It is a gorgeous place and the view is amazing to wake up to  it was just really disappointing that it was so dirty  Especially during a pandemic  It wasn t cleaned well at all  we had to Go through and sweep  mop  dust and lint roller everything to feel comfortable  When we got there I sent just a few pictures of the many problems and didn t get any response 
626686714,Cleanliness was off  everything else was alright  The showers had footprints in them  there was throw up in the master bathroom sink  the floors were dirty  the water alarm went off  there was food in the kitchen sink  urine on the toilets  ash on the master bedroom bathroom floor   
594393498,Great safe property  but this unit may need more care and upkeep with the age of the building  Better heating  and possibly cooling  units would probably help the overall stay    In addition  I would have maintenance for Zencity check the door lock  The door was very hard to open and close on this unit  The door appeared more older and worn  The central west end is a beautiful area in St  Louis  but units and property can be older and in need of updating    Overall good stay besides these things  Apartment dusty and needed to be cleaned a little better  Probably due to hardwood floors throughout  My allergies started acting up due to the amount of dust  This was an older building so that may have contributed to the difference between the newer unit in Soulard that wasn t as dusty 
579458516,Other than the slight tidiness and and thermostat mishap I think this could be a great rental unit  Maybe keep it set at    or something a little more reasonable than     Fantastic location  stylish apartment and building  I did definitely notice the neighbors above walking around came through the ceiling so I understand the concern for noise in the listing  I also noticed there were ice trays in the fridge too late into my trip to fill any  maybe you could leave one of those filled for the guests  Either way I enjoyed my stay and it gave me a good chance to explore the city  I d definitely like to return  Happy holidays Crumbs of trail mix on couch  out of hand soap in bathroom
617285750,This was a quick trip for us and we are so appreciative for your swift replies  and the thoroughness of communication  We especially appreciate the detailed information for accessing entry and parking  etc  It made the process of check in so much smoother  Thank you  Bathroom  The toilet was not clean and had evidence of remnants  Also  a bathmat towel was left in the floor  Unsure if it was clean or used    Kitchen  The sink had food scraps tucked in the corners of the sink and stuck on the sides 
671163717,Fix up the unit a bit  It is pretty tired  Cookware was dirty and there was not hand soap at each faucet  Bathroom tub had rust stains and the finish was missing in areas 
611670597,Had enough clean towels for one person   rest of the towels were dirty in the washing machine 
598994260,The space is beautiful  conveniently located  and youre almost out of coffee  May I suggest a pour over situation  French press sucks when you only need   cup of coffee  Also  the bright white light bulbs in the place arent great  A warmer tone would make the space more comfortable and seem less like a fake apartment  Apartment was clean with the exception of the inexplicable amount of long  thick black hair scattered around the apartment  As someone with very long hair I understand how it can be left behind seemingly everywhere without noticing but the amount in this apartment was almost disturbing  In every room there was a clump of hair  on the couch  on the bed  wrapped in the bamboo mat on the floor in the bathroom   everywhere  It didnt bother me much it was just disturbing and Im slightly concerned for the health of the person to which it belonged  Other than that  the duvet smelled like sex  I know its a weird thing to say  but you know it when you smell it and especially when its not yours  lol  
598652125,Turntable does not work  What are records there for   Bathroom on main floor does not flush  Base molding on floor missing on left side of fridge  Wifi signal weak  Movies on netflix on tv were blotchy because of this and would interrupt now and then  Toilet seat in main bath is very worn out and flaking  Bedroom area rug has an oil stain towards balcony  Bathroom has many grout areas with mold  jacuzzi had filthy stained water in the jets  Kitchen cabinet doors were very greasy  Remotes for tv very greasy 
598225829,A peculiar bad smell from the carpet as soon as you enter the apartment
401035584,My stay was great  I enjoyed the apt and appreciate the cleanliness and prompt responses to my questions  I will be booking again in the future  The place was pretty clean  the only thing I would really day is there were small white fibers everywhere in the apartment  I think its from the wool rug   And the bathroom and bedroom did not have trash bags in the trash bins  and we couldnt find any in the w d closet 
210291071,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
369160474,Other than the bathroom the stay was great thanks  The bathroom leaked when we took a shower so water was all over the floor  We thought maybe it was the curtain and that the water goes out and around from the other side too
595662830,Chipped floor in bathtub  hair in every towel and washcloth
590762586,It was really disappointing to pay a     cleaning fee and find the place so dirty  The dishes in the cupboards weren t clean  The kitchen counters were sticky  The bathtub had hairs in it  short  curly hairs  and a ring around it  The internet also did not work after our first day there  Getting locked out for an hour was really unfortunate too  I could not be more unhappy with the service you provided and I will tell my friends and family never to book anything with you The bathtub had a ring around it and short curly black hairs in it  The dishes that were put away in the cupboards were not clean  The counters were sticky in the kitchen  Having to pay a     cleaning fee and finding the place in such an awful state was extremely upsetting
588448936,I feel I should have been refunded my cleaning fee Blood on the sheets and bathroom was filthy it was never cleaned before me and my   yr old got there  Just nasty I paid a cleaning fee just to have to clean up soon as I got in the door and buy blankets 
571840387,The accommodation had the most comfortable bed and pillows I have slept in for a very long time   amazing    Great location but the entrance really let it down   it looks very shabby and dirty  Although the pictures of the apartment are very accurate the place does need a freshen up and the sofa needs replaced  Even though there were a lot of amenities I would have appreciated some basics in the cupboard such as coffee  On the whole I would definitely stay again  While we managed to get the key out of the the key box we did try to get into the wrong street door so maybe directions could be clearer as to which was the entrance door  Few hairs found in bathroom
563346369,Hello  I would like to say thank you for your hospitality and reactivity  I would suggest to add some more decoration  so the appartement be warmer  You can add pillows on the sofas because the sides are a bit rough and it will be more confortable and maybe plants which dont need lot of attention  The doors of the rooms closet were broken  the oven was dirty  Some recommandation could be given also on where to buy food  restaurants we can reach walking  Unfortunately no washing machine which motivate people to stay longer  Otherwise I had a good experience   the oven wasnt clean
552409860,Thanks Again  place was great  The tub had some build up in the spa jets but place overall was clean  Great location  We didn t spend much time in the place as we were out experiencing the neighborhood  Good touches to have may be have a booklet or binder of your favorite local places and things visitors should check out  Tub had a few build up spots in the spa jets
551859665,The comforter was covered in stains  one was about     of the whole comforter  Some of the stains looked like marker  while others appeared to be soiled marks  After removing the comforter we found the overall sheets were covered in body hair  not all of which appeared to be from the head    Overall the apartment was clean  The fridge had a few items that apparently were not cleaned by the cleaning service  But mostly the bed was disgusting  Thankful the spare sheets were clean and we could sleep  The rest of the apartment was great 
550909088,Can I just say first off that the bed was super comfortable  The down comforter and the all cotton sheets were amazing  The sleep would have been better if it wasn t so dang hot in there  It felt like in the    s  The radiators were in the off position and the heat just kept coming  We had windows open but it only cooled off so much  Tried to turn on the a c  But it was fighting with the heat that was coming out  Finally just put extra sheets over the radiators to kind of trap the heat  Don t know if that was safe but it did help  Very frustrating  An actual coffee maker would have helped make the morning better  They are not that expensive  A Mr  Coffee is like    dollars  I don t think the rug in bedroom was vacuumed  Seemed pretty dirty 
548072033,The floor is oily 
540531301,We had a nice stay  Really have very little criticism to give  Parking would have helped  but other than that  it was nice  Might want to double check the shower thoroughly before guests arrive  could have been better  Tub
538473696,The shower bathtub doesnt drain well  so when you take a shower  youre standing in several inches of dirty water and the slow draining leaves dirt all on the tub 
532884461,The condo was clean for the most part  but there was hair in the shower from a previous guests  As soon as I turned the shower on  it was clear why  the water in the tub did not drain  More specifically  the tub would be completely full with standing water by the time I finished my fastest shower possible  and still would not have drained completely by the next day  It was disgusting 
532389391,The apartment was spacious but definitely would have felt more homey if it had been a tad cleaner  The dishes not being clean and the bed having hair on it were off putting for sure  Most frustrating was the amount of time necessary to fix the beeping smoke alarm in the hallway  This combined with the  very  loud A C that knocks loudly when turning both on and off made it difficult to get a good nights rest  I would also recommend different rugs as the ones in the bedroom   living room leave fibers everywhere and get all over socks  etc  Comforter in the bedroom appeared to have hair and fuzz on it  pet hair   but the sheets were nice and clean  Almost all of the dishes in the cupboards were not clean and had to be rewashed before using 
528765152,Thank you  I had a great stay   I would definitely stay here again next time Im in town  There were no major issues  and everything was very clean overall  The only thing that did not seem as clean were the sheets  I found a bunch of hair on the sheets  and wrinkles that made it seem like the sheets had not been changed since last use 
505069811,As I already let you know  the blinds at the front window were very dirty  it was good you let them cleaned the next day  But overall the apartment was not very clean  There was a lot of dust under the beds and on the bedside tables  There were toothpaste stains behind the sink in the bathroom  I cleaned them myself  And in the sheets of our bed were a lot of long black hairs  we all are blonde  We were very happy with the apartment  the size  the style  the big kitchen and the location  But you really need to do something about the cleaning 
489416305,Please check the kitchen equipments inside when going through all the items  The water heater inside was not cleaned for a long time and I cleaned it up several times and was not satisfied   Other thing is the extra linens for the bed was not clean  I saw yellow patches on it and they smelled  Had to stay in the same linens the entire time   All in all your please is an excellent place  Very clean and all  But please pay attention to the length of the visit  I had to stay in for a half a month  lad to use the same bed linens for that period  I asked the management about it and told me there is a extra linens in the wardrobe  There was but they were used and had a bad odor 
489376697,The apartment was ok  Clean was ok only bathroom should be more taken care off  Shower curtain was a bit used and had mold 
489343789,When we had a problem you abandoned us  Peeling paint on ceiling rusty light fixtures in bathroom  Floors not fully clean  oily substance on floor 
483503910,I really wanted to love this space  but we just didn t  Decor is awesome  but it wasn t clean and I can t give stars for that  The parking is also awful  A suggestion would be get a permit space so your guests can park in the lot  I d even pay more for that  There was trash and scum on the night stands  brown gross spots on the comforter  black marks on the sheets  hair EVERYWHERE on the sheets and pillows  the floor had clearly not been vacuumed or picked up  there was a stretchy band from a new item in plain sight and crumbs all over the rug   I gave   stars for communication  though  because the host was very apologetic and sent cleaners to clean 
482633216,Thank you  the apartment suited our needs perfectly for our visit to family  So vastly superior to an air bed on the office floor  Everything was very clean except the bathroom floor and shower 
480832069,Complete sewage smell going through the apartment that wasn t in the hallway outside in the place 
479093692,Thanks for hosting me this was my first Airbnb experience  My feedback it to have more detailed instructions on how to use the lockbox and door code and maybe not all white sheets as they look kinda dirty  Maybe a couple pictures on the wall and some drinks in the fridge would make someone feel more at home Thankfully brought my own sheets
476678832,We were disappointed in the broken coffee maker and felt like maybe the kitchen wasnt properly cleaned or that would have been noticed   Also  I would suggest a measuring cup  hot pads and a smaller size pot with a lid as somethings that would be helpful in the kitchen   As far as the air conditioner  that could be an oversight of mine   as I dont recall whether or not the listing described it as a window unit or not  We really loved the neighbor hood and had positive interactions with the locals as we walked to  the  nearby park and stores  There was a bag of open coffee in the cupboard and sugar spilled in there as well   There was also a dirty pizza cutter in the drawer   The soap dispenser didnt work either and the water pressure was so low in the kitchen it was very difficult to clean anything 
476591037,bed sheets were clearly not clean  there was dirt   hair all over  bed sheets in the closet were also not clean so i had to go to Target and buy my own bedding because i didnt trust they would bring clean sheets    overall  the apartment is in desperate need for a deep clean  its obvious its been quickly cleaned over and over again but with zero effort    when running the water in the bathroom  it came out brown at first   the garbage was full in the bathroom with toilet paper and paper towels   view was really nice
470894124,Thanks for making my stay so easy  Found some hair in the sheets and on side table  Carpet also looked like it hadn t been vacuumed recently 
470042872,A spacious  nicely appointed apartment with great location  appreciate the travel toiletries  particularly shower gel  Parking in nearby garage was easy  Wireless access was seamless and reliable  A couple of suggestions    Fridge was making a very loud hum for extended lengths of time during the visit  The noise would stop when opened  then restart when closed  Made it challenging to be on conference call   to sit and talk at kitchen table  May want to look at repair     A tea kettle or Keurig  something to quickly get hot water   make coffee  would be helpful  as would a digital clock  that is visible at night  in the bedroom    Thanks for making our stay so easy and smooth  Overall the apartment was very clean  but there was some dark hair in the bathroom on the floor and around the door   wall when we arrived 
468067264,Upon arrival  the kitchen sink had a really strong  foul smell  My brother in law  who is a general contractor  checked out the sink and there seemed to be some type of clog that was causing the smell    Also  please fix the intercom  The receptionist on the other line could not here us when we were trying to check in  which cause a long and annoying check in process  There was a strong  foul smell coming from the kitchen sink upon arrival 
467580755,Overall  even with the minor problems we had  our stay was great  It was a beautiful little neighborhood and we were able to walk to most places we wanted to go to  We re not really sure what happened with the door when we were trying to check in  but we don t blame that on you  we just would ve liked better communication and more urgency to help us with the problem  A big thing I d suggest is to keep those linens and pillows clean  stain free and hair free  Also  I apologize if we didn t leave the place in great shape  I did my best to clean it up  My boyfriend didn t believe that it was our duty to do that and waited to the last second to get up and get his things together  and then dragged me out the door around        I hope I did alright and please consider my suggestions  Take care  We found hair and stains on the bed and the shower liner in the bath tub was a little moldy  The knob on the shower was also kind of messed 
465420290,I appreciated your quick responses to my text messages  The place looks great and would have been perfect if not for the shower clog     Bathroom was clean but tub shower was clogged  I was standing in inches of water while I took a shower   Ick 
457205561,Great host  we appreciate you lending your home to us  Few stains on the comforter
457202967,There was hair on the bedspread
452067322,Only downfall that I found was the parking  The building has spaces  yes I realize they are probably rented spaces  but was told I had to park in pay per hour parking  I would think that for the price  although it was very well priced  that at least one spot would be offered or offer a discount to parking  Was not expecting to have to pay     more for parking  There were dishes that had been put away dirty 
367835287,The idea of renting an air bnb is to rent a fully furnished apartment that is currently occupied by people that leave you access to all amenities that anyone living in a nice apartment would actually have to share  not a bare bone unit furnished only to the extent of a hotel that strongly smells of cleaning product and  somehow  cigarettes  Entire second floor smelled of cigarettes  Seriously  Not ok 
367409875,Thank you for the hospitality   In the future I would suggest leaving a note or notification regarding that a maintenance personnel will be stopping by   Also overall the house had the appearance of being clean however I noticed some crumbs and small paper on the kitchen floor along the cabinet s floor   As well as some spots in the tub that could have been scrubbed harder or with a cleansing material that would have whiten it more      Other than that I had a pleasure stay   Thank you  Shae Overall the house had the appearance of being clean however I noticed some crumbs and small paper on the kitchen floor along the cabinet s floor   As well as some spots in the tub that could have been scrubbed harder or with cleansing material that would have whiten it more 
563059410,I loved how easy it was to communicate with you all and get in and out  The location was great and the people we encountered were lovely  I think something needs to get sorted out with that smell quickly because it is very noticeable  There was hair in the shower and the floor made our feet dirty  Would help to have a rug somewhere in the common area because the hardwood was dirty very quickly  Also you all should figure out where the foul odor in the kitchen is coming from because it was very prominent for many hours of the day  Probably the only thing that will keep us from using that space again 
562389164,I thought that you adding the iPhone stands and chargers was a great option as I had forgot my iPhone charger back at home  Thank you  Place had an awesome view  I definitely would stay here again for my next visit  Pretty clean  the kitchen stove had a little of left over burnt grind stuck to the burner covers  The floors could ve been a little cleaner but other than that the rest of the place was spotless   
310639960,Thank you  Had a good time will stay again if the minor issues are fixed   Floor could have been swept properly 
367321332,Thank you for a great stay  I will leave a glowing public report because this is definitely a place we would rent again  The doorknob issue will be resolved Im sure  But it would be helpful if there were at least two key fobs  especially since the place is able to be rented up to five people  For our own personal taste too we would have preferred a coffeemaker instead of a French press  but thats our own preference  not an issue with the unit  Thanks again for getting us back into the unit and for providing such a lovely place for a very affordable price  We look forward to staying with Zencity again  The bathroom could have been more thoroughly cleaned  It wasnt really dirty  just a few spots on the tub and toilet that could have been a little cleaner  Definitely not a deal breaker and on the whole the unit was very clean 
364849723,Thanks for being a great host  Refrigerator wasn t clean  There was food left in from previous guest 
364483903,Overall I enjoyed my stay  I just wish that it would have been thoroughly cleaned before my arrival especially since there is specifically a cleaning fee  The floors in the kitchen had clearly not been cleaned and there had clearly been something spilled  The bathroom floors were covered with hair  The bed linens were covered with hair and when I was told they were definitely clean but that there were extras in the closet in case I pulled them out only to find there were a bunch of big yellow stains on them and again  more hair 
554075643,We enjoyed our stay  but noticed a few things that might improve the experience for others      Clear instructions that when checking out and leaving the key on the table  it is okay to be leaving the unit unlocked    More silverware would be very helpful especially if staying for  couple days with     people    Non slip mat for bottom of tub Shower mat had curly black hairs on it when we arrived and the floor in kitchen by fridge was sticky  Carpet in living room was a bit dirty and fuzz balls could be seen on the floors in other rooms  Shower floor tub bottom was very slick and made it feel like you could easily slip 
362546015,The bedsheet looks quite old and a little bit wore out
310513895,thanks for the quick responses and attending to things that came up the space is obviously intended to and is clean  Perhaps a bit nitpicky but the place has not apparently been subject to a deep clean with dust bunnies abundantly  observed in corners  on window sills  under the curtains  to be clear the place is clean just not perfect   stars
535544411,Ive stayed in many places that were not corporately owned and received better  how to  manuals and guidance to the area  There is only   spoon in the apartment  No extra light bulbs or towels  We were very disappointed with the cleanliness and the lack of concern for actually helping us have a good experience while we were there  The floor wasnt swept or mopped  There was food stuck to the floor in the kitchen  There was dried fresh blood on a pillow case  The countertop in the kitchen wasnt wiped either 
668105669,Chunks of Hair in bedroom on the floor and stuck to the nightstand  Dishes left in dishwasher  only sponge provided in kitchen had been used  had hair on it 
350855295,Thanks  Just needed a quick vacuum
353775179,Should let guest know not to turn on bedroom radiator  I it gives up toxic chemicals  I think many guest would also appreciate not using febreeze    or any cleaner with fragrance  makes air too smelly and unhealthy to breathe in  Thanks for quick responds  Bathtub
350156382,Thank you for the stay  we enjoyed the shops and restaurants so close  Loved being so close to downtown as well  I think a fan would a good idea in the bedroom  it gets very hot with the comforter you have  Maybe another sheet for the bed as well  But bed very comfortable and a very stylish apt  Thanks again for the stay we had a nice time   The tub was clogged after one use  Something was dripping in the fridge on the ground  not sure what it was because we didn t use the fridge   Not your fault but the hallway and stairs were so dirty and it smelled 
349497523,please adjust heat or leave instructions as to how to do it  I tried to turn the knob on a couple of the heaters but they were stuck and very hot  Also the black light fixture did not work  and a small power strip in the bedroom would help as I could not have the light on and charge devices  Other than that the location  space and ease of check in was great  but was so uncomfortable with the heat I would hesitate to book again  the second blanket that my daughter would have used for the couch bed was wadded up  dirty and on the floor in the closet  The rest of the apt was very clean 
347005473,I provided all of this information to you in a private message  One of the reasons I like Airbnb is for the personal touch  I felt zero personal touch in this whole interaction  Overall the house was very clean  However we kept finding little things that hadn t been checked  Extra duvet had food crusted on it  Microwave hadn t been cleaned 
345924356,It was really clean but I did notice hair on the floor  specifically behind the door 
344481386,Had a great time  The location is  perfect  thank you for  quick response to my questions   The only thing missing  were instructions  for the tv  Needed vacuuming  but otherwise  very clean 
343180093,Thanks for a nice place to stay  We had a good time at the conference  and I appreciated the easy check in   check out process and frequent communication    Switch for Fan in bathroom   Switch for Garbage disposal in kitchen  seemed to have something in it upon our arrival as it smelled a little   could not figure out how to turn it on   run it to clear it up  Otherwise everything was clean   
334935399,Thanks for the fast communication and detailed instructions  That made everything much less stressful The bottom sheet on the bed was a size too small  like someone tried to stretch a full size onto a queen  It kept coming off  And the top sheet had a reddish stain which was kind of gross  I would definitely try and get that stain out or buy new sheets  When I tried to find other sheets in the closet  they had a funny smell and were not folded very well so I wasn t sure if those were clean so we stuck with the stained ones  That was our main issue with cleanliness 
334319456,Sin duda est  la mejor zona de Chicago  El apartamento es mucho m s grande de lo que parece  con todos los servicios que te puedas imaginar  champu  condimentos para cocinar      Las vistas son espectaculares  piso      Muy c ntrico y cerca de todo lo que necesitas  supermercado  buenos restaurantes    No hemos conocido a Chris pero ha sido super atento y muy r pido en sus respuestas  Muy recomendable  todo un lujo      Ventanas
330594952,There was hair all over the door that was there as soon as we walked in  The kitchen had a foul odor  The hallway to our room smelt like fish 
330575315,Thanks for getting the shower leak fixed  But really        a month in Regents Park   smh   as the kids say  Mirror was spattered  also the building is on the beat up side  particularly in the elevators  which are filthy and erratic
328581629,We had a good time in the apartment  It would be nice to have a comfortable coach to sit on and relax after a big day discovering the city  In addition  the apartment is really warm and humid  The air conditioning is nice but really loud during the night  Dust under the bed
321912890,All the beddings including the extra one in the closet had either stains or hair on them  We had to sleep on top of the comforter with the towels covered  I really think you should tell the cleaners to pay attention to those  Also  I caught small roaches three days in a row  two coming from the stove and one coming from the bathroom   Food particles in the sink were there and we definitely didn t want to see that  Unwashed  beddings and uncleaned sink
316123877,Beyond the WiFi issues   which you managed well  a comfy place   With more rain after my first communication  it appears you have a couple roof leaks   Id fix before more damage     Front door privacy issue   Anyone can look right in  absolutely needs privacy measure   Wife said light over stove n g  maybe just a bulb    We entered from the stairwell right by the door  and it is both filthy and dangerous   I slipped on paper trash  not hurt but very bad first impression for guests entering from that direction   Beyond these  a comfy space    Thanks  Hair around bathroom    floor and tub   Mold around tub water knob and jets   Lots of spiders   Though not unit specific  the stairwell and street entrances very dirty 
314276604,Our stay was great with you all  Very very stylish and the place was calm and quiet   It was great to come to a place that felt like our own apartment after working late    also appreciate the roku    thanks again   A few things that might help out are   a cutting board   an actual butcher cerated knife  Or  did we just not look hard enough     Thanks again  the next time I come into town for work I would love to stay again if available      Edd The rugs in the bedroom create white look alike dust bunnies when you walk around on them  We swept them up and put them in the trash  
310497284,Great location and wonderful views of the lake  Bed was comfortable   Good and prompt responses to our questions from our host  We wished there as a little more comfortable place to sit in the living area  Couch wasnt very comfortable and cushions were coming a part a bit  some trash under the bed  one of the towels in the bathroom had brown spots on it   wasnt sure if they were stains or if it was used
307070936,Hi  The apartment is in an outstanding location  However our overall experience was affected by the overwhelming amount of dust on the floors  the couch  and the either old or very dirty carpet  Also  you are missing basic amenities like coffee filters  Definitely would improve the experience with a grater focus on the guest and its user experience  El edificio est  descuidado y se ve que no lo limpian habitualmente  La alfombra del pasillo est  muy sucia e incluso dentro del departamento llega olor a Tabaco  El departamento no estaba bien barrido  con montones de polvo alrededor de los muebles 
659410225,There were some missed spots on the counter  and the walls were a little dirty
298777247,I checked in for my weekend stay around   pm so after a long day at work we are ready to shower and chill  The water didn t drain that night or throughout my stay  I notified my host he responded right away but nothing was ever done about this huge inconvenience  Not being able to use the shower or tub from Friday till Sunday  On the day of my check in I was notified that the washer and dryer would be unavailable  I responded with that s ok  Still waiting for the host to rectify this inconvenience  
297881275,There was A LOT of hair on the floor which I had to vacuum  myself 
297362029,A box of Kleenex or two would be helpful  as would some more kitchen towels and a small knife set for the kitchen    cutting board  Otherwise  loved the location  easy check in  great walkability and overall great space to relax after a long day out and about  The rug in the living room needed a vacuum   if you needed to do anything on the floor  eg yoga or in my case  stretch out my pulled back    
295535102,Thanks for a very nice place  I suggest purchasing a bbq lighter for the stove  A Keurig coffee maker would be nice  We wish the TV had been in the bedroom as the couch wasn t very comfortable to watch TV   I would remove the area rug and bath mat
289589847,Thanks again  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  floors and carpet  Additional comments   Dishes cuttlery werent clean in the cabineT  There might have also been sawdust or just a large accumulation of dust near the washroom entrance   outside of door   
288748506,Your place was wonderful and fully stocked on anything we needed during our stay  Parking was difficult but thank you for your recommendation on the spot hero app  it definitely made things easier  My only complaint would be that we had to wash the dishes before we used them  as there seemed to be some food residue on some of the bowls and glasses but it wasn t much of a big deal  Thank you again  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen 
288396660,Thank you  Pot holders in the kitchen and grill tools to use on the rooftop would really round out the amenities  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower  dust  floors and carpet 
285788764,Hey Chris   We loved staying at your place so much so that we didn t want to leave    I left a   star review but just wanted to let you know that I think the tub forgot to be cleaned before our stay  There was some hair at the bottom of it  It didn t bother us that much to wash out ourselves but could be a problem for others in the future  Just a friendly heads up  This was really the only comment I have about our stay  It s a great building and I loved the courtyard in the middle  Could be a selling point to add to your pictures    Thanks again  Gabrielle  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower  Additional comments   There was some hair in the tub that I think just forgot to get cleaned  This wasn t a huge issue for us but could be for others   
280215427,My feedback is summarized in the cleanliness box  but overall the apartment afforded us a great visit  The location is great  we loved that the area is full of restaurants and bars  and close to the subway station  My husband and brother felt allergic in the bedrooms  the closets smelled like they had been closed for a long time  and the headboard of the bed in the bedroom in the back seemed to have accumulated dust  so probably one of the sources for the allergies   Also  there was a subtle smell of smoke in the apartment  maybe because the neighbors smoke      that might be an issue for future guests  And we thought the stairs leading to the apartment were very dirty too 
272988302,Hi Chris  please for the bedroom  consider blackout curtains  this was the main reason why I couldn t give   stars  sleeping past  am was an issue   One of the kitchen sinks looked  really rusty 
266787117,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen 
255195247,Thanks for letting us stay in your place  If you could sort out the ants and maybe make the place look a little homely it would go a long way  Im probably just used to staying in places that people actually live in  because the flat is a bit barren and cold looking  Best Liz Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs  shower  Additional comments   There are ants everywhere  You really need to put something in the drains to kill the ants as every morning there would be loads crawling in all the sinks and showers  We didnt leave any food lying around and found them when we arrived     
252923082,Chris  thanks so much for letting us stay at your place  I think that if we come back to stay in that area we will definitely be contacting you  I hope you will tell me where the mattress came from  it was awesome to sleep on after a long day  In fact  we are staying in a really fancy hotel in Madison Wisconsin right now and their bed has nothing on yours  Thanks again   Kelly Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  Additional comments   Only mentioning because I noticed  dust on the wallside edges of bedside tables  and underside of bathroom sink needs cleaning    
251303215,Thank you very much for letting us stay at your place  It was very nice and the location is great  The only issue we noticed was that there was a slight sewage odor in the apartment  That can be normal in older buildings  but maybe adding an air freshner  Also  there was absolutely no hot water available from the shower this morning  Not sure if this is a regular issue  but maybe worth noting to future guests  I wouldn t have tried to use the shower if I knew how cold it was going to be  Overall  everything was great  Just a few small notes   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  odors  shower or tub 
243950769,Chris  thanks for being such a great host and paying attention to our needs during our extended time in the apartment  We appreciate how you brought the extra set of keys  coat hooks  kitchen towels  knives and pillows during the first week of our stay and how you were willing to grant the complimentary cleanings to make it right   Suggestions for making it a top notch property   providing a table or stand for belongings at the front door   providing a more comfortable couch  and repairing the right side arm of the current one   providing a different bed frame that doesnt squeak every time the occupant moves an inch  Thanks  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  Additional comments   As you know  cleanliness was a problem from the beginning  with dirty bathroom floors and drawers when we arrived   The subsequent cleaning was actually worse  with no attempt to clean the floors or vacuum the carpet   The  rd cleaning was much improved a  
241085510,Thanks for being a nice host  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower 
238321245,Loved your cool apartment  Would definitely stay again  Ill make a few friendly suggestions here below easily found at Ikea  a sharp knife for cutting and a cutting board  a few hooks to hang wet bath towels to dry  a small desk  Ikea has a super narrow desk   a small chest of drawers in the bedroom next to the bed with a night light  and maybe a blanket  the one in the photo was no where to be found   That said  these are super friendly suggestions  not at all critisism  Your place is close to perfect  Just for your own info  one day the heat was not working even with valve fully open  walls are thin and some neighbors forget that others are trying to sleep  and the toilet doesnt flush easily  I suggest single layer paper for old plumbing  but thats me   None of this bothered me  Loved my stay  I will recommend it to other UChi parents visiting the school  And hope to rent from you again  Maybe soon  Five stars definitely       stars  cleaning service forgot to clean stovetop  some dishes in cupboard were not clean  but no big deal  
229281229,Thanks for having me  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens 
175794090,Chris  I really enjoyed my stay at your place  It is in a great location  but for the condition of the place  you might want to think about lowering the price  The bed is very comfortable  and the linens were all clean and smelled fresh  I also appreciated the snacks upon arrival nI felt like the cleanliness overall was acceptable  except for the notes above and below  The blinds missing in the kitchen was a bit uncomfortable as people in the building did use the fire escape stairs  There was more than once when I found myself standing face to face with someone while I was in the kitchen and they were going down the stairs  People could also see in the window to the couch chair in the living room so privacy did become an issue  I also thought the dishwasher was gross on the inside  I dont know if it is not working or what  but I ended up just had washing all the dishes  Whoever does the cleaning may want to take a look at it  Those are details  and I would definitely stay at your place again and recommend it  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  Additional comments   The dishwasher was dirty  and the blinds I the kitchen window were not installed  The windows in bothe the kitchen and the bedroom were dirty    
165358816,Hey Chris  I just wanted to note that there was a spot on our comforter  Even if it was a stain  its a little discomforting to see something like that in an unknown environment  Just for future reference  Also  we were pretty frustrated with the fact that the Netflix was logged out despite the fact that it was a promised amenity  It would be fine  but when we asked for you to fix it  you stopped responding    Spot on comforter 
163126096,Chris  you are a great communicator and I appreciate your accurate and timely correspondences  Your place is in a great location   could not ask for a better location at your prices  Thanks so much for being a great host   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust 
579369605,Halfway through my stay  I came back to the apartment and someone had been in the apartment and installed lights under the kitchen cabinets  They left the lights on and all of the dust  glue used to secure the lights  and screws on the counter tops and floor 
133594949,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  Additional comments   Light broke  but host had stocked lightbulbs    
109451806,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  bugs  towels and linens  Additional comments   Dust bunnies floating in corners of the apt  BIG cockroaches dead in the apt and in the hallways every day  several of the towels had stains on them   
625136906,just clean better especially during a pandemic  nobody wants to walk in to a place that is supposed to be covid free and see hand prints and stains from previous guest  had hand prints all on the walls  stains on every sheet they had and so of the curtains  Would ve been a nice stay if it wasn t so dirty
673480983,Floors in kitchen and in common areas were dirty not mopped good as you could see grime and spilled liquids all on kitchen floors   Ceiling appeared to have spilled soda splattered and wasnt cleaned   There was old
640207128,Thank you for hosting us  We enjoyed our time  The spout for the shower was hanging out if the wall  and the sink was gritty  The sheets had small orange stains on them  and the carpet wasn t cleaned 
709644960,Thanks for hosting  over all I was very satisfied  Around beds there was trash
613725066,Hopefully you take my review and make improvements  It s a great little place and most of the issues I had were with the service I received  A lot of the pots and pans had oil and were dirty  And also  little things like the bathroom not having soap in the soap dispenser or a trash can made this an inconvenient stay  Also  another little but irritating thing  Why would you have a coffee machine  creamer  and sugar for your guest but no filters  I ran to the store to buy coffee and got back to realize there was no filters  This is just my opinion  but if you have literally everything else I need to make coffee  why would you not have filters 
618669605,Thanks  The place worked out just right for us  Only constructive criticism would be to maybe get a bigger  better constructed  softer couch and arm chair and possibly add some other cosy elements  Great place though  D Overall clean  but looked like the bedroom carpeting needed vacuum  Couch had some light stains on it too  more noticeable because of lighter color   Cabinets and furniture starting to show signs of wear 
618646190,Thanks for having us  Great stay  Smell  sewage 
493549655,Thanks for letting us stay  Left you public   stars but wanted to point out a few things that may help future guests    shower closest to the doorway was clogged   toilet paper paper towels only lasted us a day  we had to buy our own   AC was set to    all weekend but the apartment was hot all weekend   table had a crack prior to our arrival which might have caused it to eventually collapse   remote batteries were missing  not sure if it was the design  but bed frames bar stools dining room chairs look like they are in bad shape and will eventually break as well  A couple of the pool sticks will probably need to be replaced soon   overall would recommend to others  it served our purpose of the trip  Seems like the clean was not as thorough as should be  not sure if it was because we requested an early check in or not
623779335,We loved this Airbnb and it s amazing location  Only note was from my fianc  who couldn t believe there wasn t a coffee maker  Haha but otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed our stay  Most everything was Sparkling clean  We just noticed dirt and hair in the shower as if it hadn t been properly clean  Not massive deal to us 
628675162,thank you    beautiful apartment bugs on wall but other than that very enjoyable
626137343,Upon arriving we walked in to sticky floors  super greasy  counters and kitchen sink  a water logged French press   spilling into the kitchen cabinet and down on the counters  There was also make up in the sheets  and poop in the toilet     We mopped the floors  cleaned the counter changed the sheets  cleaned the toilet   As we were getting ready to leave  we went to load the dishwasher and when we opened  it there was a piece of watermelon and a blob of soggy bread  We have pictures of everything  We won t write this  in the public section  We don t want to trash your rep and want your business to succeed  Hopefully there is motivation to get it right for the next client  Oh and spatulas and wine opener in the drawer had some kind of tomato sauce on it   The place is real cute  quiet  safe feeling and has great value  if clean 
644018750,Thank you for being so accommodating  Ava  Bamboo bathroom mat had a urine smell 
628506469,Glasses in cabinet wasn t clean
628556403,Washer still water in there
643368208,Thank you for being willing to let us stay with such short notice  However the kitchen sink needed cleaning and there was decomposing bits of food left  There was also a cup in the cabinet that had evidently not been washed as there was lipstick on it  Otherwise are stay was mostly what we had expected for a quick stay in city  Thank you  There was lipstick left on the cup  and there was thick pieces of food left in the sink  which had obviously not been cleaned out 
626829198,I was really excited to go to this place  considering they boasted meticulous cleaning standards  especially with current events such as COVID     However  I was really upset that many areas had cleanliness issues  The rug in the living room had what appeared to be hair balls  dusty curtains  and an overall surface level grime  It was particularly egregious in the bedrooms  where the A C units were covered in dust  and when we turned them on it triggered our allergies 
709220551,Overall a great stay  Great views and great location  Had a bit of trouble getting in the room as I was given the wrong code  but customer service was quick to resolve the issue  Also  some blankets had some stains  and the kitchen and bathroom sinks would clog up a bit  Not a huge deal for me but I would fix for future guests  The dishwasher was really dirty and smelled horrible because of sitting water at the bottom  and looked like it hadn t been used in a while  Also some of the blankets had some permanent stains that seem like wouldn t come off just by washing it 
668716248,Stain on curtains and in the bathtub
640083008,You treated me completely terrible and with total disregard  i am literally traumatized by my experience   Literally zero compassion or care for your guests health or well being   From the two hour late checkin  to the completely disgusting room  and then you promised me to clean room and lied and never sent anyone to fix  Then act like you doing me a favor by giving me    dollars  The absolute worst host ive ever seen  Im not done with this    Dirty furniture  dirty pillows  smelled of smoke and alcohol  cigerette burns  carpet stains  dirty hand prints and gross muck over all the handles and doorknobs  Dirty mop water left in toliet  All this topped by  a red fluid smeared all over the place  on furniture and drapes   absoluely disgusting  They did not care when i called  asked for a different room  they said they were booked but would send out a cleaning crew to fix the room  They never sent anyone and would answer my calls  They do not care about their guests health
661158798,I was put in a dangerous situation due to negligence and I am very upset  Dishes were dirty in cabinets  Drawers in bathroom were dirty  Fridge was dirty  Appliances had film 
615306523,Hello   Let me just say that we lived our stay at you beautiful place   It was exactly what we wanted as far as location goes  We felt safe in the neighborhood and as first time visitors to the area  we found it extremely convenient that it was so close to transportation and such     Not a complaint  as much as a heads up   the handle in the toilet does need fixing as you have to work with it to get it to flush  Another thing was that we noticed that the toilet was not quite clean  it was what looked like yellow per stains behind the seat cover  Third thing is that as I was looking for my keys that had fallen  I found some garments that I assumed where left by previous stays under the couch  I know a lot of times its a third party doing the cleaning  so just giving you a heads up for future stays    All in all  the loft was beautiful and we would definitely stay again on future visits   Thank you for having us  The only details I could point out as needing improvement was the toilet  The handle needs fixing as you kind of have to work with it for it to work properly  Also  the seat cover was up and when I put it down so my belongings would not fall in it  I noticed it was a bit yellow back there  I also found a shirt under the couch that must have belong to previous  stays when I was trying to find my keys that had fallen around there 
715773558,Thank you so much  After having my rental canceled on me I didn t know what else could happen but your place gave me a sense of peace while I worked  And it was so beautiful I was able to shoot one of my photoshoots in the apartment  Great space   I would definitely rent whenever I come back to Stl  Bathroom was still dirty  stains all over  But still great experience
648999479,Get a new cleaning crew It was so mine fly in there the beds was broken the border was dirty I m    the stairs almost killed me the stove was dirty the towel rack broken  No I would not stay there again 
620677498,Ava   Marty were terrific  Zencitys policies or procedures were really problematic   we were very disappointed that the sink situation had not been noticed  before we checked in and was not quickly fixed  Or another solution would have been to immediately offer us an equivalent place to move to with no additional fee  Instead we had to spend   nights in a very problematic situation and do a lot of negotiating  We did finally get moved to another place at no extra charge but only after a lot of back and forth  And really Zencity should have refunded us some of our overall charge   Thanks again to Marty   Ava  Dishes were dirty and sink was clogged
639077331,The space was lovely and my favorite aspect was the security guard but I guess they have been let go  The guests in      were quite loud    seems like it was just children  I called security when a fight broke out  At   a m  when I still could not get to sleep for the noise level I politely asked them to calm it down  Thankfully they did   My one real complaint which I wont do publicly was the slow to no response and the lack of checkout details   Im used to a bit more interaction  In one way it was fine but also I was a little lost on if I needed to strip the bed or wash dishes  I leave a tidy place anyway  so not an issue    just something to note     Overall I was pleased  Disappointed a little by the ick I reported and the slow response but I would recommend the location to others happily  Just a few places but the host offered to send someone to spruce it up if needed 
626665733,The walls  are very thin and i didn t understand why i was told to turn the music down then i learned it was a group down the hall  I loved the place and area  Thank you for the amazing stay The floors were dirty and sticky
701165421,The dark wall color choices allow for a lot of hand prints and water spots to show  The bathroom walls has old water spots all over from the shower condensation  as well as hand prints from people touching the walls  These prints were through due to the paint choices  Definitely made the space feel a lot less clean  There were also old towels left in the towel hampers from previous guests 
620105114,There were a couple of strange stains on the bedspread
621604336,Thank you so much for an accommodating spot for us to stay  However  we would like to request our cleaning fee be refunded  as the apartment was far from clean when we arrived  During this coronavirus climate  this was very unsettling for us  Cleanliness description is in review  Broken glass on the living room rug  stains on the ceiling above bed  etc  Also  the bathroom door was falling off it s hinge  making it nearly impossible to close  The French press coffee maker also fell apart in my hands  I am not usually one to leave a bad review  but the conditions of this apartment were unacceptable  especially when such a high cleaning fee is charged  Rug had remnants of crumbs of some sort  as well as a piece of broken glass we discovered  Very glad we didn t cut our feet  Spots on floor  as well as mysterious spot above my bed on ceiling that looked like a sticky white clear substance  Very repulsive to sleep under 
722199816,Hair all over couches living room chairs  hair in sinks and showers  bed comforter stained  sheets and pillows also did not look washed 
630230780,The rug had hair and crumbs on it 
617040426,Note the email sent about very loud activity in the alley between    a    am   It looked like a food truck   They proceeded to take apart pieces of the truck   weld them in the middle of the night   It looked like they regularly parked there  Not ok to not disclose a business lile this  Black hair in tub  floor   sink 
665497134,The dishes and silverware were dirty  With concerns of Covid  this really bothers me 
627988415,Smelled foul very foul
626322680,Overall I enjoyed the unit  Not having the fob wasnt so much of an inconvenience  however during the Covid issues  it was bothersome to have to keep using the touch keypad to enter the building  Melissa is who I believed cleaned the unit before my stay but it was subpar for the fee that is  being charged to the guest  I can suggest a better cleaning person who cleaned my rental units in the Chicagoland area  But for the extremely discounted nightly rate it was tolerable  The cabinets need to be wiped out to remove caked up substance in bathroom and debris in kitchen  Also the shower curtain needs to be washed or changed  cloth was dirty at base and is tucked inside the tub to prevent water leaking out  so it posed a sanitary issue   Wipe down light switches to remove dirt thats very visible  Shower caddy needs to be wiped off to remove soap scum  For it to be a     cleaning fee  I expected a cleaner space  Please note that I wasnt uncomfortable in the unit but I would have appreciated paper towel on the installed paper towel holder  And the stove should be wiped down without leaving water marks and grease streaks 
620529635,Thank you for creating a memorable experience  I wish our communication had been better so that I could have extended my stay  Also  I thought you might want to know that the coffee grinder is on the fritz  The apartment was VERY clean  however  the common spaces  stairwell and hallways  were in much need of a vacuum  seriously bad 
619055091,An entire disappointment  We had to wait an hour after check in as the apartment was not yet cleaned by     
298744104,Shower slightly dirty and clogged  Otherwise  very clean
408165651,Draining issues with the water tub
622026465,Thank you for hosting me  Bed sheets had white solid stains  bathrooms floor was slightly dirty
616428552,With the exception of the iron not working  I really enjoyed my stay  There is a heavy walker that lives above  I do mean HEAVY  The  concierge  Ian is amazing  Very friendly and eager to help in any way   The place was tidy  but there was alot of hair left on the white tile  You could tell it was whiped down  just not dried  The dishes could afford a good washing  due to dust   Perhaps some packets of  condiments for the fridge  A nice little bistro table would do wonderful for the balcony  A more complete kitchen would do wonders as it is the heart if the flat  Perhaps some expanded outlets for the bedroom  You can tell is had been cleaned  just alot of hair left from the wet rag 
630403255,Loved it  Will come back again  Excellent location  Huge space  Everything was super clean  but Smelled of smoke when you enter the door 
706262267,See comments in Value criteria feedback Noted that this place is huge and thus it didn t bother me too much  Most areas are clean
627088226,Customer service was great and I would book with your company again  Please paint the walls and fix the tub  The bathtub is painted and is peeling and ended up on my foot  There are other areas in the apartment where paint is peeling as well   Also  there were spots on some of the walls  I think the apartment needs a fresh coat of paint 
653529196,The floors were not clean
622515880,Burn marks on table that they accused me of
622918758,Thanks again  Clump of hair on the carpet  Construction dust all over laundry room area 
622312330,Kitchen counter top was sticky   Toilet was not clean  visible urine stains    Drain disposal was clogged  causing foul smelling dirty water to drain into dishwasher   Carpet has clearly not been vacuumed recently  crumbs etc   Shower had opened  partially used individual sized shampoo container sitting in it from previous user    If this place were clean  it would have been a   to   star experience 
711278415,Thank you  shower curtains were stained
623078717,I had a mouse in my room and a large bug that I killed  I let them know however no one came to do anything about it
631151109,Hi  i enjoyed my stay but i never got a response about the beeping noise that woke me up a couple times  Also  the place had a strange smell when i entered and when I used the dishwasher that took several hours to air out  There were some bad smells when i got in  and when I used the dishwasher 
622376002,It was clear that the apartment was not clean as soon as we arrived  My husband pulled out the vacuum to start cleaning only to find it clogged with dog hair  The couch had hair on it as well  The shower curtains were filled with mildew 
324675476,There was a slight smell in the couch coffee table area  Not sure if its the brown chair or the rug  Wasnt a big deal for me but you might want to check it out 
646022414,better directions for the check in process regarding parking  provide the actual name of the apartment building would make locating the building easier especially at night    other than that I really enjoyed staying and would book with Zencity again Ants were in the bathroom and bedroom  I did not want to sit anything  on the floor because of the ants and with the bed essentially being on the floor I was worried the ants would get in the bed as well  some of the blankets sheets smelled
669641424,The space wasnt not cleaned before arrival so I had to wash the sheets and towels as well as clean the kitchen and empty garbages myself as soon as I got in
624042034,Refrigerator had food in it
667095123,The unit really needs a deep cleaning   Especially with the current COVID standard  The water spot in the bedroom ceiling should be taken care of  The unit needs a deep cleaning   There were strands of hair every where  on the shower walls  I walked on the carpet several times and ended up with hair between my toes  The shower door railing is very dirty  There is a water spot in the bedroom ceiling above the bed that has mold in it 
631305704,The white comforter had a huge stain on it and it looked like the rugs hadnt been vacuumed in awhile  I was stretching on the ground and could just see filth in the rugs  There was dust and hair all along the baseboards as well 
673678395,The mirror in the room had hand smudges on it  which means it wasnt cleaned   The baseboards in the unit had dust build up on them  which means they havent been cleaned in quite some time   The bathroom had soapy residue on the sink  dirt in the corners  and the toilet had residue and stains on the outside of the bowl as well as around the inside rim 
623942929,I appreciate all the help i received from Marty  The trash hasn t been taken out upon arrival 
626785733,Thank you for the awesome customer support and communication  Even with the place being unclean  based upon the place and your support  I would definitely rent from you again  Hey there  Surfaces were dirty  Floor was dirty  Shower was dirty  Greasy dirty cookie sheet left in the oven  The housekeepers rags left in the washer  Yikes 
628497897,During the pandemic  One would think improper cleaning should result in an internal investigation  I honestly do not understand how this place was so dirty  Hair left everywhere  crumbs  dirty smelling bedding nobody vacuumed the carpets  You cannot control AC Unit    Corona Virus Central
642886216,We are sorry about the noise complaint  Did not know that the tv sound would carry so far  The living rooms and one bedroom had duct bunnies hair clumps and seemed to not have been thoroughly vacuumed 
622740153,Make sure whomever is cleaning does dusting as well  Get clean pillows  Staying here was an alright experience  The first night was rough because it was a domestic violence issue that occurred  Very sad to see  Next was the amount of dust in the place  So dusty that it got into my boyfriends and I  throat  Very disturbing  On top of that  the water was disgustingly filthy  Communication was iffy  Relayed some of the issues and it took  what it seemed  forever for the hosts to respond  Also  the pillows were yellow underneath the pillow covers  If we disregard all those major factors  it was a decent enough stay 
642833657,The dishes hadn t been washed  in the dishwasher  The shower had long hair all over the walls  Pretty gross  Everything else was good  There was long hair all over the shower wall
627139573,Tub was a little dirty
654351635,Most of the issues we had were out of your control overall it wasnt a bad stay we were grateful for the gated parking and the quick response to any needs we had thank you for being a great host  The dishes left in the cabinets were dirty we had to rewash them 
649036929,Thank you for all of he communication  My only complaint about my stay was that there were some hairs in various places  bathtub  floor  sheet  
646382823,Carpet in living and bedroom hadnt been vacuumed 
654377494,There were a few smudges on the pillows and the couch and a few items of garbage underneath the couch from previous guests
650234526,I think there should be a more thorough cleaning of the apartment  There was hair in the shower and trash under the bed  There was a lot of hair in the shower and trash under the bed 
623262240,Minus the series of unfortunate events  I would recommend  Carpet and hardwood was gritty with a layer of pet hair 
625778068,Como sugerencia la puerta del ba o hace un ruido cada que la abres  Excepto por lo del sof  y las cobijas lo dem s estuvo genial  Gracias de igual manera si lo recomiendo Las cobijas no ol an a limpio  lo mismo con el sofa
625616429,Thank you for having me I look forward to returning  Manager adjusted cleaning fee very responsive
624616469,I asked for a refund and have not got a response  The bedroom was infested with bugs  The place was infested with bugs  I reached out to the company three times  They finally responded and said someone would be out but they never came out  Imagine bugs all over the bedroom night stand and bed  It was horrific  It seemed like the more we killed the more they came 
654833389,Thank you  Please ensure the bedding is thoroughly cleaned  There were many hairs from other guests in the bed Lots of hairs in the bed
701190548,Great place to stay  but it was cold and it took a while to figure out how to get it to warm up  No paper towels  either  although there was a holder for it  Looked like mold by the bathtub and some cobwebs
624937094,Thanks for quick replies  When we walked into the apartment  it was a bit dirtier than expected and the trash can was broken  but overall a wonderful place that was great to stay as a healthcare professional working in the hospitals during Covid to quarantine from family  There was dirt  hair  and areas that looked dirty throughout the kitchen  bathroom and common area 
624037737,The apartment was not as pictured  different furniture  different layout  it is probably another unit in the building but I was confused why they wouldnt put up exact pictures of the unit   There was also a strong marijuana odor likely coming from other units and both elevators were not working the  nd half of our stay   The stairwell was completely disgusting  as we had to hold our breath to go up from floor   to   as floors     smelled of strong human urine   We left at   oclock on our  nd day there and did not stay the night of       Overall a     stay     It was clean  not sparkling clean  however  as there was old hair on the baseboards and in the corners of bathroom and shower 
655654047,Kitchen was not clean  counter top was sticky when I got there  Sheets in the bedroom had spots on them and the bed felt unstable at night  Front room couch has stains and looks like it needs to be clean 
672951111,Two lights in BR do not work  Rugs need cleaning 
626152441,Thanks for being a great host  Couches had lots of crumbs and food inside them  And the whole place smelled of weed upon my arrival 
626143437,I honestly am very offended that we were accused of stains on sheets when we didn t even sleep under them  We never even spotted a stain in the beds because we slept with blankets on top   but the fact that we were told there was a stain we didn t cause definitely shows that the place was unclean  We don t appreciate being blamed for such a thing at all  We got accused for stains on sheets that we never slept under 
630612352,DUST which lead me to believe there wasnt any covid safe cleaning 
622749860,Its a great building and thank you for hosting  There was dried dirt on the floors when we first arrived   Its almost as though someone that was cleaning had some stuck in their shoes   Had to sweep the entire unit and vac   Also the shade in the master bath needs to be replaced   It had paint that had fallen off and then left on the tile around the bathtub   Not sure your cleaners are doing a through job 
625506710,Hair on bedroom pillows
702374446,Thank you   nice place Old building that is redone and the exposed brick around the unit is so awesome  Beds were all clean and there was extra bedding which was nice  Ceiling fans all needed to be dusted  refused to cut them on for the build up of dust  Hardwood throughout however there were   areas that had area rug that could have used some vacuuming  otherwise everything else was fine 
672399959,The place was okay  The floors looked like they hadn t been swept very well and we found a pair of children s underwear behind one of the beds  The washer dryer was broken too  Glasses weren t clean  floors hadn t been swept  and found a pair of underwear behind a bed 
717218010,Thanks so much for the stay  We had a lovely time and the price was wonderful    Thank you  Few hairs on the floor and in the toilet when we got there
625239904,This is my second time staying with Zencity  it seemed like things might be better  and I must say I am equally as displeased as the first time  The apartment was just barely clean  There were no supplies such as paper towels or extra rags to do dishes  There was hair all over the carpeted area and a giant bug in the bed our second night  I dont understand why were paying a cleaning fee if the space wont actually be clean upon out arrival  I am disappointed at the lack of response to any of my messages during my stay and wont be staying wjth Zencity again  There was hair all over the carpet as well as a dirty rag in the couch  The description says it is stocked up with extra supplies   but there was nothing there 
647349275,Please make sure to clean between the bath tub and the sink  it s infested with mold  Black mold between bath tub and sink
656741221,Not sure if you know but looks like a smoke detector may be missing   The pool
653928700,It started kind of like a disaster but glad you moved me to the other apartment which made up for all the bad experiences  You should however try to respond quicker Smell not good
633639598,The place was great   I would just add air conditioners in the bedrooms also   Other than that  it was a good place to stay and I love the area  The refrigerator could of been cleaner 
633584383,The place was nice  but the shower curtain needs to be replaced and the chair in the living room was bent broken when we arrived  Besides these small things  the place was wonderful  Very comfortable and great location  Would come back  Place was relatively clean  There were some spider webs in the kitchen and the shower curtain in the bathroom needs to be replaced  It had mold on it  Otherwise it was very clean 
622643185,Great customer service  Love the style  Needs attention in the cleaning department  Floor was not mopped  socks under the couch  opened water bottles in the bedroom closet  crumbs on countertop  dirty kitchen trash can  bottom of toilet bowl dirty  stain on couch  dirty ceiling in bedroom  carpet not vacuumed  stainless steel not clean
667800819,Hair everywhere like it was never swept  Random crumbs found on the carpet and throughout the apartment  It was never properly cleaned 
652305052,You should definitely have the issue with the leak bedroom carpet smell checked out before allowing other guests to spend money for possible hazardous conditions   That carpet simply needs to come up  Period  The smell was worse every night   another night spent and it would have been quite unbearable  And also hire someone who is going to thoroughly clean ALLLLL areas of your apartment   not just the kitchen common area   Whoever cleans  simply does the bare minimum  And thats unfortunate and unacceptable   Ive stayed in much better AirBnB residences over the course of time   and this has been the absolute worst stay  Master bedroom had a terrible smell which is believed to come from a leak  Theres a noticeable leak outside of the apartment  to the point it looks like it may buckle any time soon  Once you walked in the master bedroom  the carpet was damp as you can see the wording under the bottom of your shoes on the tile in the bathroom  Theres another review that indicated a possible leak  and we thought it would have been taken care of by our stay  Not the case  The leak is settling into the carpet which is causing the smell to get worse  Whoever cleans the apartment should be able to tell   but it doesnt seem to be a priority  Also  top sheet of the bed was dirty and crumbs from the previous visit in the bedroom were not cleaned up  The bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned  and the ceiling fan in the master bedroom was quite dusty  hard not to see the mounds of dust  and you could see spiderwebs forming on the ceiling fan as if it hadnt been dusted in months  Hand grease prints were also on the wall     Could have been cleaned better    The focus of cleanliness is obviously in the kitchen common areas  That was somehow spotless as compared to the rest of the place 
648400124,Thank you so much  Even though we had the cleaning issue we loved our stay  My boyfriend and I were worried about COVID  so when I saw Zencity uses specific cleaning guidelines to clean in between guests I felt better  However  when we got there we had to use the cleaning products and clean down in the bathroom in particular  there was still hair on the walls and drain and some dirt on the floor   At the same time  everything else was really great 
716960319,Overall I enjoyed my stay there were just small things that could have been better  I would refer this and would stay here again  Oh and it was kinda boring since I couldn t really watch TV  But I just watch it on my ipad  There were used wash clothes hanging in the shower  My pillows were incredibly sweating and musty smelling 
628548596,Hello    This place was beautiful and we really enjoyed it  It would have been   stars if it weren t for the bathroom issues  The toilet made a super loud sound after every flush and the shower had issues  The host did get maintenance up there right away to fix everything which I really appreciated  I just wish we didn t have to deal with it the first night  Besides those minor issues   it was an amazing stay and I would love to stay again in the future   Thanks   D Zhari Dust
630473008,n a
705915234,This is a very modern unit  it felt like I was staying in a show unit   There were no decorations  or hints of being in Chicago   I wish you would have included instructions as to how to use the TV and the remotes   While I appreciate the free cable Netflix and so on  I could not access local TV   I also wish you would have included a list of nearby restaurants with phone numbers to aide in ordering food   I was surprised you did not include Wifi  or instructions as to how to access your Wifi   Other Airbnbs I have stayed in gave access codes   Saturday night and Sunday morning  the building door  to get to the elevator  did not shut all the way no matter how much we tugged on it   That was a little unnerving  especially since it was Halloween   Other than those little things  the unit was perfect for what I needed   Thank you  While this unit is new  there is mold on the bathroom ceiling 
702335887,Dirty dishes left in dish washer with no soap to clean ourselves  Dirty carpets in bedroom and dirty wood floors elsewhere  White linens stained yellow 
700413722,The place could have been better  Especially the check in process  not having a key to the building was stressful and a bit unprofessional  The woman that checked me in poorly communicated to me about getting into the building as well  The bath tub was covered in pubic hair and there was some on the towels as well  I really recommend checking your bathroom for mold as it was all under the grout on the tub  We were definitely disappointed by your listing  Pubic hair all in the bath tub and mold lining the bath tub
657031597,This experience was incredibly disappointing and considering my last stay I do not know if I ll be staying with Zencity again  The audacity to display signage boasting about the cleanliness of the room when it was nothing but    This room did not meet the standards of cleanliness in the midst of Covid    and you all should be ashamed  If I could ve cancelled this booking and received a full refund I would have  Extremely disappointed  Upon my arrival I quickly reached out to the host  the apartment had not been cleaned  The toilet was full of urine and there was hair EVERYWHERE as if someone was shedding
654834111,The bathroom and bedrooms werent that clean  There was only one garbage bag for the kitchen trash can 
659439541,Not so much cleanliness issues as it was just needing repairs in the bathroom  The fan in the living space looked like it hadnt been dusted in months 
658564966,Lots of dust  other minor issues 
712858257,Towels weren t entirely clean
652246708,Thank you for hosting us  We believe its rather easy to better the cleanliness issue  We noticed another reviewer has also said the exact same things  The smell in the place was very disturbing but we tried to stay there as little as possible and open the windows  We think that while your property is smoke free  the whole building is not  Thanks again for hosting us  The floor was sticky and the space smelled of cigarette smoke  As no smoking is allowed  we assumed that it came in from vents or ac of the building  It did not feel like the house was not cleaned  just that the carpet was very well used and the floors  well    Just maybe very well used as well  However  the sheets and towels seemed very clean and inviting 
632039542,This may be the buildings  issue  and a combination of the space being a studio  but it very much felt like a hotel room  I found myself refer to  my room  when talking to my friends    It felt more like a hotel stay than a home  but without the luxury of a hotel   Also  there were no paper towels  There was a holder but it just seemed weird  Again  not that big a deal   A few more towels and bath mat wouldve made a noticeable difference   I was in town looking for an apartment for my upcoming move  I was considering the Del Prado  but after this stay  I am not  Perhaps that is not within your purview and thats fine  The space and my stay met my needs  but it was not a selling point for living in the building  The floor  without socks  feet were dirty  not that a big a deal 
589226691,Thank you for being a great host The cleaning lady left the dirty towel and didn t clean the dishes properly 
629083790,As this is a new place  heres a list of things you might want to fix     Cleanliness   Overall  it was fine  but the debris on the floor when I arrived was definitely annoying     The shower   It is designed in such a way that you cant close the door  thus  when you shower  water splashes on the floor   This is a weird   people will definitely not like it     There is no cord for the electric kettle  There was hair and construction debris on the floor   The first thing I had to do was sweep 
632066727,I would have stayed even longer  Love that loft There was a half eaten pizza in the oven 
634986880,The space is very nice but upon further inspection many of the cups had sticky rims as if they were used and put back on the shelf without being watshed  A pair of tongs and pan had residue on them and I walked around the non carpeted area and had dirt accumulated on my feet 
710079012,Overall  I had a great stay  However  as noted  the cleanliness of the bedroom and kitchen was disappointing  The fact that an earring was on the floor next to the bed and food residue was readily felt on the cabinet and fridge handles is concerning  There was an earring on the floor next to the bed as well as food residue on the cabinet fridge handles  which made me question the thoroughness of the cleaning between guests  Especially now during the pandemic  when cleanliness and disinfection is paramount  it was disappointing 
632039570,Trash from previous tenant wasn t taken out
669369243,Upstairs shower was dirty  Could not step into the shower because there was so much    grime and grit on the floor  Did not seem to be cleaned
634989366,I left that apartment cleaner than when we arrived  I was afraid to even use the kitchen based on the filth  I should have the cleaning fee refunded as there was no cleaning done besides by me   All surfaces were dirty  cup marks  sticky  etc  Little black hairs all over the floors and bed as well  super gross to be completely honest   It s a shame because the space could have been great  Really disappointed upon arrival after traveling all day and during Covid    you d think cleanliness would be top priority 
654387670,There was a note saying cleaned by Haley  however the space wasn t too clean  The blinds were also broken and wouldn t close  Some of the pillow cases on the bed weren t clean looking  The bathroom wall looked like there were some traces of feces on it next to the toilet 
700634174,One of the bedroom blind sets hasn t been wiped down in a while it looks like
634334379,Thanks for the stay Leftovers from previous guest left in fridge upon my arrival
647403683,Lacked basic cleaning supplies for longer stay guests  like paper towels  tea towels  trash bags  dishwasher soap  mop  Extra light bulbs for bathroom   I would have liked to been able to spot clean over the week 
659909294,The host was great   Housekeeping is herrible it is important due to COVID    to make sure that unit are professionally cleaned before and after check in It was dirty linens in the hamper in one of the bedrooms  bathroom floor was dirty  kitchen cabinets had fingerprints on them other than that it was ok    It s all housekeeping issues
652893918,The bathroom had an old bar of soap  and the kitchen had someone elses food in it   It seems the only thing they cleaned was the trash can as it didnt have a bag in it when we arrived 
659962618,I enjoyed my stay but I think you really need to make sure the apartment is being properly cleaned between guests  It was a disaster when we got there and it made us tense wondering if anything had actually been disinfected including the bedding that had some visible stains    also there were only   bowls and no measuring cups  The master bathroom was missing a toilet paper holder and a drawer front was broken off in the kitchen and just left leaning against the cabinets when we arrived  Not super great first impressions  It didn t hinder our enjoyment of the apartment but might be offputting to some guests The countertops in the kitchen hen and bathroom were disgusting  The rugs had tons of long hair in then and didn t look like they had been vacuumed in a long time  I probably spent    mins cleaning the apartment when we checked in because I didn t feel good about it actually being disinfected 
634600654,Thank you soo much hospitality There was a broken chair in the living room space  I attempted to fix it so we wouldnt be charged with any potential damages 
671224681,I would really like my money back  This is not a clean  safe environment  There was a poop stain on the sheets  It is obvious that they do not clean or change the sheets 
633666438,Thanks  Place just seemed a bit dirty  Great location though and hip atmosphere  Found a condom wrapper under the bed  water stains in bathroom wall  no dishes all in dishwasher with no note of clean or dirty 
635109673,Needs one deep clean to last for awhile  There was a lot of hair and dirt 
634299154,Thank you for the stay  There were some issues  but I appreciate the communication and responsiveness of your team  The apartment was a great home base for our trip to St  Louis Kitchen floor had leftover shards of glass that were not cleaned up 
571799055,Thanks for taking my earlier suggestions seriously    V nice apartment   Would def book again Used and dirty towel and washcloth left hanging in bathroom
559202796,The toilet and shower weren t clean  I d suggest getting a new shower curtain  it was very stained in addition to the dirt I cleaned off of it prior to use  Other than the washroom  very clean space 
630841654,Marty you were great  Id get that toilet seat fixed and clean the floors     Any recommend a regular coffee maker  I didnt have the time or desire to fuss with a french press so I spent a lot of time and money getting coffee every morning  Thats the only thing that bothered me but the apartment is great and super location  Ill be back   The floors were dirty   it was clear no one had been there a while and no one went in before I arrived to check it  All spaces were clean as were the bedding and towels   no complaints there at all  Just the dust hair on the floors throughout  The building entry and carpeted stairs to the unit are very dirty 
712843666,Thanks for allowing us to stay in your place  we really enjoyed it  As a suggestion  we would recommend providing a small coffee machine and fixing the window in the living room that does not stay open  kitchen   oven was dirty bathroom   shelf in shower had standing water  a little mildew y 
635150438,The faucet in the bathroom is mounted poorly  too far back   causing you to splash water all over the sink every time you wash your hands    Maintenance is a problem worth addressing   I couldn t sleep in the unit for several day s because of a smoke alarm   Given its height and the fact that it had to be reset after the battery is changed  it required building maintenance to address it  This took several days  when it should have taken hours   Further  there are piles of wood trim in the hallway on the way to the unit that are unsightly and a potential hazard  The kitchen smelled of used cooking oil for several days during my stay initially   I had to re clean the kitchen to get rid of the odor 
631879426,Thanks for the stay  The only issue we had was the roof was available for use but our key fob wouldn t give us access to it There unfortunately was hair in the shower that wasn t cleaned
630818562,I assume the lobby staff is more of Mac Propertys responsibility than Zencitys  but regardless  they deserve a standing ovation  Every single one of the wonderful women who staff the front desk was extremely friendly and cheered up our days  As I said in my email  it really seems like the apartment was not cleaned at all after the last guest left  The floor was very dirty throughout  the beds looked barely made and all the sheets had hair on them  the trash can had food and empty cans at the bottom underneath the trash bag  etc  Its really a shame  because the apartment is beautiful and comfortable  but the first thing we saw when we came in was the very dirty floor  It really ruined the first impression completely and left us apprehensive of touching any surfaces for the entire stay 
634084444,Thank you so much for hosting me  The space is beautiful  However  I would have appreciated if the space was cleaner since I found hair in the shower upon my arrival  and I would have appreciated if the Zencity staff member who entered the Airbnb during my stay  to pick up an internet cable  had worn a mask  Additionally  I noticed that there were many folks who worked in the building not wearing masks  Im not sure if theyre with your team or not  but its disrespectful not to wear a mask at work during a pandemic  It demonstrates that your company is not concerned with potentially exposing your guests and your staff members to COVID  I hope that mask wearing will become a company policy moving forward for the duration of the pandemic to protect all parties involved  Its stressful enough to travel right now  please make it easier on your guests by cleaning your units thoroughly and having team members wear masks  I found a couple long hairs in the shower and a bug in the shower upon my arrival 
229034481,Muchas gracias por tu atenci n  por estar siempre al pendiente y respondernos de forma inmediata  por permitirnos hacer  late check out     Las opciones adicionales como ofrecer t s y caf  est n muy bien  El departamento en general es muy lindo   Los  nicos detalles que encontramos fueron    La limpieza no est  muy bien hecha  principalmente en pisos   No hay suficiente n mero de tazas y vajilla   La reja que est  junto con la puerta de madera para entrar al departamento no funciona Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  towels and linens  bathroom  floors and carpet  shower  Additional comments   Hab a cabellos en el piso del ba o  en las s banas y en toallas  yo creo que la persona que hace la limpieza no la hace bien  
639085052,When moving the TV to check audio issues on the TV found a huge buildup of dust bunnies  Aside from the that the place was pretty clean  
637357103,There was a mop that smelled like mildewing since it was such a tiny space the smell was very strong  
658590192,Thank you for a wonderful stay  There were a couple of hand prints on the wall  some we wondering how they got there  I figured it must have been from the cleaning crew   I traveled with a female companion and there was a reptile of some sort that was crawling on the wall  It didnt bother me knowing the  type of building that we were staying in  but it scared the living day lights out of her  Other than that the place was exceptionally clean 
660626477,Thanks for being a great host  Sticky floor
640172989,Outlet cover by bed was broken  Exposed electrical   Bathtub could use new grout  missing in several areas  My husband found a ball of hair on windowsill of bathroom  right after we arrived  This made us question how thoroughly the studio was cleaned    Baseboards throughout not cleaned   Looked as if only center of room cleaned   Under the bed and under desk still dirty  Windowsills dusty  Quarter size splatters on floor around stove  Flimsy plastic toilet seat had loose screws   Kitchen trashcan lid broken  white tape to hold lid to hinge did nothing 
671114187,We greatly enjoyed the location and ease of using the rental  Suggest a more thorough cleaning and improvements to the entry door It seems the vacuum used isn t working well   there was hair and dirt  lint clumps on the rug in the living room  There was also a ball of hair in the corner of the bathroom  white soap gunk on the hanging rack in the shower  and food crusties in the fridge  The tub drain for the shower wasn t draining well so when I checked it  the entire drain pulled out and I found a huge hair ball all matted inside the drain stop 
718829128,Duvet on the bed already had hair   fibers on it when I checked in 
711477951,The room was nice  Could ve been a little cleaner  The bathroom towel hanging on the rack for show was dirty
633852201,Hi  I was very disappointed in the cleanliness of the unit   I was charged a very substantial COVID    cleaning fee  which I totally support in theory and was happy to pay  but the place with really dirty  My feet or socks were blackened by dirt as I walked around  Surfaces were visibly dirty  and there was chipping and apparent water damage in the bedroom  This place had a very low base price  so I wasnt expecting to be in the lap of luxury  but the cleanliness was perhaps the worst Ive ever experienced in dozens of airbnb stays  The floors were extremely dirty throughout the apartment  There were broken window blinds  water damage and peeling drywall in the bedroom  and hair dirt on baseboards and in corners  The kitchen appeared to be well cleaned  though 
640239912,Thanks for letting us stay  The tub and floor had hair all over 
631475383,Things were not super restocked  no paper towels  not a lot of TP  And it seemed like they dont replace the little hotel sized shampoo soap bottles  There was one that had the shampoo seeping out and crusted on the outside and one that had a tiny hair in it  Which during COVID  wasnt super comforting  Just made me question how thorough they were in the rest of the cleaning  Everything was put together nicely though 
657430857,Thanks for all the support and information  It was a great place to stay  but a bit more concentration on cleaning kitchen tops  carpet and wooden floor  Overall it was a nice place to stay Kitchen tops can be cleaned a bit better
706418282,Although they were minor issues Id still like the place Im sure things will be better knowing that you had new people and I understand hopefully I will be able to book this place again in December The sheets were dirty with hair
661888841,Walls
640617683,There was a dirty wash cloth left on the top of the shower
719435899,There should be a warning that the bed is essentially on the floor and the bathroom REALLY needs a deep cleaning and fixing up Mold in bathroom  plus smelled like smoke   tub didn t drain while showering     overall really unpleasant bathroom experience
701711254,Comforter in bedroom had brown stains
425191804,Outside patio
634262585,kept finding multiple hairs almost as is they didnt change comforter or something  the place also had an unpleasant smell 
717656930,Thank you for a wonderful stay  I thought your detailed check in was very useful  the rugs seemed to not have been vacuumed  the bathroom toilets and showers were not as clean as I would have thought  the fridge was also pretty dirty  all of the glass windows were dirty as well 
661288418,Overall a great stay  loved the room other than the minor wall ceiling damage  Also just from someone thats worked hotel maintenance  someones going to steal that router that sits next to the bed sooner or later  Id mount that on the wall somewhere  There was a dirty mug left in the sink but other than that it was clean 
640248782,Under the living room couch cushions was very gross  There were liquid splash marks on the walls
657439748,Fantastic place  The three legged chairs are a bit of a hazard as you can easily fall over  I would replace those  Also let the renters know if there is a routine pest control for the apartment  After a few days following routine pest control  there were roaches appearing  I dont believe this was a  direct cleanliness issue but renters should be aware 
652913746,The apartment needs to be cleaned better  Theres a   inch space at the door  which needs a door spacer a th the bottom to prevent rodents from running into the apartment  When it rains there are leaks under the floor board in the bedroom and living room   Make sure theres enough bedding  towels in the apartment  Also laundry detergent  trash bags  paper towels and toilet paper  According to the occupants stay  The floors needed to be swept  The rug and carpet needed to be vacuuming  Had to clean spider webs out of the windows 
656397328,When we first arrived and I used the bathroom  there was a ponytail with hair wrapped around it on the floor  The trashcan in the bathroom was full of qtips and a feminine product  Later on in the evening  we discovered the the kitchen trash had not been taken out either and was half full  During COVID     I did not expect to pick up and have to clean the place before feeling comfortable enough to stay there    Just makes me wonder what the cleaning fee is going towards 
700455037,Thanks for the stay   The apartment overall was nice   The communication from the host was more than lacking   My boyfriend had to fix the ac then I had to wash blankets   Messages were not responded to for over    hours   In my opinion that s unacceptable The Main bedroom had what looked like dried bloody snot on the comforter and blood stains   There was an extra comforter to use   but to say I was a little grossed out when I went to go to bed is an understatement
636502895,Found different types of hairs in the bathroom tub  Couch had unidentified stains 
501312617,Liebe Bettina  lieber Slawik  wir haben zwei sehr sch ne Wochen im Boddenblick verbracht und w ren sehr gerne noch l nger geblieben  Wir m chten sehr gerne wiederkommen und beim weiteren Aufbau helfen   Ganz liebe Gr  e von Samira  Viola  Marcel  Samuel und Mats Das haben wir schon alles ganz offen besprochen 
635468570,Thank you Zencity for hosting me  Overall I loved the place  the location   especially since this was my first time visiting Chicago  It was great and special   Thank you for your assistance and space     When I first arrived  the house smelt really bad like a dead mouse in the walls  I did message the company and they responded fast which Was great but issue was not fixed  I had to get air freshener during my stay  
708200472,Thank you for a chic place to stay   Loved the location and amenities  The private parking spot was a big deal and much appreciated   The value was amazing        A few here and there from hairs to a very strange smell when I first arrived  
658519746,I had a great stay overall   One of the elevators did get stuck on me twice for     seconds  it stopped on the  th floor and then partially opened and stopped  the first time was scary and then the second time I knew it would likely open eventually  But probably something for the building to look at   It would also be a nice convenient if laundry detergent were left in the closet I bought some and left it behind  The bathroom lacks ventilation and had a bit of a musty smell  They were also on a tight schedule and still cleaning the apartment when I attempted to check in       hours after check in time  It also would be awesome if they stocked detergent for the in unit laundry machine  I did buy some and leave it behind for others  
662423193,This is my second visit at this facility  I love the modern apartments and I love the location  I also enjoyed the balcony  I truly appreciate how affordable these units are   Well done   Kitchen sink around drain needed scouring  The walls are visibly soiled with scrapes and handprints 
639135171,The space was lovely  and great check in  But there was some concerns about the previous cleaning before we entered the space  Broken lamp next to the dining area  as well as some type of liquid in cups in the pantry
642277952,Had an amazing time at this location  Only thing I can say negative was there was no elevator and it was a lot of stairs back and fourth 
643371956,this place is so dated and shows  the pillows did not have protective covers on them and several were ripped  The iron had a black coating that could not be used on clothing bathroom mat did not seem clean I have stayed in this unit before
636247287,My Fianc  car was broken into on the property that you all had us park in  This parking lot was suppose to be a gated parking lot where you need a key to access  When I called you all to report the issue the first thing you all said to me was  what do you want us to do   No one is being responsive to us to resolve this issue  You all have cameras through the building and our car was parked right by the camera but no one is looking into the video footage to resolve this  Customer service should be your top priority and to accommodate your guest  My safety was put at risk someone invaded my property  They stole my car keys and my house keys which means I don t have any other way to gain access to my vehicle or home  No one expects to go on a vacation where they are suppose to be safe and have their space invaded and while trip ruined because we literally spent the rest of our time worrying  The place was clean however under the bed there was trash  In the bathroom the towels had hair on them
662438412,Will stay with you guys again  thank you  I felt the linens made me sneeze quite a bit and needed a little better washing but most other things were clean  There was also no coffee but a coffee maker  I wish I had brought some along 
643425426,Communication was great  And the apartment was beautiful  The walls were dirty throughout the entire apt and there were pieces of hair stuck to the walls in the bedroom in multiple places  Also it appeared as if the floors hadnt been swept or mopped 
643007976,Thes is a mouse living in the unit you need to take care of this immediately i was very upset that I had to pay to live with a rodent  My girlfriend couldnt even sleep she was so scared  VERY disappointed There was a mouse running around the living room and kitchen area
642330644,Better cleanliness  If you are going to say you are doing extra cleaning for Covid    i expect it to be a very clean place  I had to sweep up the floors and vacuum the carpet because you could see dirt debris on the floors  Dirty kitchen cabinets walls  Dirty floors
658709793,I previously stayed at this unit a few months back then no major issues thought it was a great place to stay  Now on my recent visit was different  Upon arriving inside unit I went to bathroom and notice shower was not cleaned and had old used bar of soap on soap holder inside shower  I was very disappointed I refuse to shower in a unclean shower  So I bought cleaning supplies to clean myself  The other issue was the front room couch it was finger nails clippings on couch seat cushions and a  lighter stuck inbetween pillows  I knew this place was not properly cleaned  Its a beautiful place but wish the unit was cleaned properly  The kitchen floor needed a good sweep and mopping also  Other than that I would recommend if unit is cleaned 
711623269,I I just want to thank you for your hospitality during our stay at your facility Im not trying to give you a bad rating I put High stars on everything except for cleanliness because as I stated in the previous message there was a used Q tip and semende represent the kitchen floor and the common areas for the living room and there was food stuck to the counter and a lot of food stuck to the sink and stove anyway thank you very much for your hospitality and we will be staying again We totally enjoyed our stay at your facility but when we went in there was Band Aid reference in the floor use Q tips and lots of dirty nasty food stuck to this counter and sink Im not complaining I just thought you should know
637520734,We love this place and will come again  Weve already suggested it to friends and family  We hope you keep up with cleaning things well so when we come back it will still feel new  There was quite a bit of water sitting in the bottom of the oven  The bathroom sink is probably close to being completely clogged  Finger sticky finger prints no the inside of the windows  The stairway needed to be cleaned from things people dropped 
639091775,I don t believe that the towels or sheets were washed which is obviously a huge concern right now so I went out in the evening just in time and bought new sheets and towels and sprayed down all the surfaces  Other than that it was a good stay  Thank you The towels didn t look washed  full of hair  and the sheets didn t appear cleaned so I went and bought some 
638488093,Your room was amazing  We really enjoyed the space  We were hopeful for a little more communication Some of the plates had crusty edges
705869764,Marty was fantastic  Highly recommend this location and his customer service  Was kind of weirded out when a worker showed up to fix something I thought was a Bluetooth speaker oops and with the mask and being a single female it caught me off guard  It happens though  Thank you for everything  I had to clean the toilet and tub but everything else was perfect 
704499224,The bathroom was covered in tiny black hairs  namely on the floors and walls  The rug was still wet so it seems like the cleaning job may have been rushed  Otherwise  everything else was pretty spotless 
662987177,Please get rid of the mold and update the couch  Its a great place  Extensive mold issues in the bathroom ceiling   The ceiling required an application of Kilz and new paint which should fix it 
629705404,overall nice  the provision of towels was nice  Just would get the place professionally cleaned and sanitized especially during these times  oh and pool cue chalk would be nice as well  washer was dirty   and chairs on island were a bit dirty  sham pillows were a little dusty 
653877363,Sweet unit but it would be really helpful to clean the windows  Its a corner unit but you couldnt see out because of the dirty windows    Our building code didnt work on our last night  We were about to check out early the next morning but what the heck  Too much hassle to contact you to let you know  but we shouldnt have to since we were paid for that night    Your note  Nice and Clean  by Clariza only works if its true  Otherwise  it seems its better not to put up a sign if you cant keep the promise      sink had mold  cobwebs in living room  baseboards were not clean  windows were so dirty you couldnt see out of them 
661662584,I dont know what to say just feel disappoint  First when we got there   we like this place  good area  and security but when we get in to the room C  the floor was very dirty with a lot of blond hair on the floor and on the rug  we have to find the vacuum and clean them   I am Asian and I have black hair    we are couples but they provide only   big towel   in the bath tub when I start to take  a shower by run hot water and I felt soap scum on the  tub slick and slide when hot water hit the tub  I cleaned your room really good before we check out and I got email about I split something on the rug  and want to charge me    dollars to clean that   the photo of the rug the you showed to us  was not accurate   it was crisscross weave in the room but the picture that you claimed that we split something its different  we did not split anything and I do not mind to drive     miles back to your room to confirm that   I am very disappoint    
655577623,The rugs are girly and need to be deep cleaned  There are stains all over 
669124424,A little extra attention to the bedroom ceiling fan and a few cleaning  nacks   Such as  there was a wad of hair  like from a brush or comb  on the living room floor and a used popsicle stick in the shower   Overall the space was a step away from being absolute perfect  We enjoyed the stay  It was conveniently located  peaceful and we felt very safe at this location  Thank you  A couple of minor overlooked cleaning points that we easily took care of ourselves  Outside of these things the space was clean and far from being  nasty  
474887578,Overall a little junky 
452105296,Thank you so much for hosting my friends and I  Also  happy early birthday     Lots of dust everywhere  Especially on the floors
332186324,There were makeup and blood stains on the comforter  and black hairs in the shower 
656455101,Make sure bills are payed up     I had to deal with electric company and disconnect issues There is a layer of dust on the base boards and on top of ledge in shower  Ashes in window ledges  You can tell the floor was mopped with a dirty mop 
710766207,If you are promoting your property as  can accommodate     people   then provide enough furniture to do so  My daughter and her friend came to visit and each brought their own outdoor folding chairs so they had a place to sit in the living area   Also  how about a small table in the living area for people to play cards  games  etc    No closet hangers provided  No  real  coffee maker provided  like a Keurig or Mr  Coffee    Very limited kitchen supplies provided  plates  spoons  knifes  cook ware   These  little things  make a big difference in ones choice to use your properties again  Master bedroom shower door  caulk was loose   Sides of stove top were dirty
720137267,Space had lingering smell of cigarettes  perhaps marijuana  Walls are in need of touchup paint  Perhaps a more durable sofa would be appropriate  What is there has clearly seen brighter days 
662115704,It was hair all over the bathroom and shower   and there was glass on the floor     and the Tv came off the wall when i turned it away from sun
718860812,I found a burnt towel In the closet the common area wasnt all that clean 
717674699,Bathroom drawers
661840266,Please remove the automated thermostat to give guests an opportunity to set the temperature of the room to what is comfortable for them   I was able to adjust it  but it only would stay the adjusted temperature for   hours      is far too cold for me  There was a couple of dust balls around as id someone swept and left a small pile 
705873573,Thank you for letting us stay there  Though we had a few issues  you were responsive and helpful  There was some food left in the microwave from the previous guest 
664919713,It may not be a big deal  but maybe add dish soap     I personally would ve liked to wash the dishes before I left and not leave the kitchen a complete mess  The floors were not too clean  lots of long hair everywhere   our hair is low cut   neither was the tub  No problem with the kitchen  but there was no dish soap or dishwasher soap to clean dishes 
664866286,Thank you all so much location was absolutely beautiful will be booking with Zencity listings more often    Shower curtain very dirty and some discoloration at the bottom
661634741,I know this is not a zencity concern but the parking in the immediate area of the apartment was extremely expensive  I paid a total of      for       days  The refrigerator has food leftover inside of it from a prior occupants 
665432543,Mattress and couch cushions smelled very bad  Carpet had black mold
702552340,Counter tops in kitchen were dirty  floor in bathroom dirty 
718435194,I left the key back in the box because I could not find the hook to hang it on Just different little things  I have a baby so I was close to the ground a lot  You can tell who ever cleans just does a what makes the place look clean clean job as opposed to actually cleaning the place like it should be 
665746865,Wonderful location and spacious stay  We had a great time  Having all of the apps on the TV was an unexpected plus  Our tips to improve the experience would be a bit cleaner  higher quality toilet paper and more reliable internet  No major issues but our socks were black after walking on the floors and many long hairs throughout the apartment 
659706694,We were told that there was other zen city rooms in the building  If that s the case and people show up and their room that is costing them      for three nights isn t ready  maybe instead of making them just wait  Get them taken care of so you don t have to tired  possibly very irritated    year olds bothering the nice door girl in the building  Or offer a discount for their experience  This was my first Airbnb stay in Chicago  We usually get a hotel and I have to say I prefer the Airbnb but not      that when we come back up in October we will be staying in one  Balcony needs love  windows were very dirty and t there was at least   good size spiders that have webs all over above your head 
663313973,The place it self was beautiful however  it has a rodent problem  I saw a few large rats and they were running up and down the hallway late at night  Also  they were eating my bread and fruits  I would never stay there nor would I recommend it to anyone else  But there was a big RAT in my unit
666840224,The location was great for my visit  The stairs are pretty steep and somewhat narrow so maybe want to let people know that in advance  It all worked out  Thank you   Just a few dusty spots around the tub  I was worried about water splashing out of the shower 
711276735,I had a great stay  thank you  On the second day I did wake up at  am to the smell of marijuana in the room  I blocked the crack under the door and opened the windows and the smell disappeared quickly  but it was a little annoying  Some dirty dishes pans in the cabinet and the electrical kettle had old tea in it in the cabinet 
701679637,The space was stylish but I do wish it could have been a bit cleaner  I would also consider leaving more cleaning products for guest in case they have any spills or just  want to do their own cleaning after check in or before check out  Loved the washer and dryer  very convenient  Check in and check out instructions were clear and the place was easy to find  The drawers in the bathroom had a lot of hairs and dried spills from previous guest   Stain on bathroom ceiling     The trash can lid was broken and the body of the trash can had some spills on it  I wiped down all the areas I thought were kinda messy  This may not bother other guest but I m an anal clean freak unfortunately 
661614235,Need to provide more towels   One hand towel for   people for a week is not sufficient   Also  no dishcloth or potholders provided in kitchen   No dishwasher detergent was provided  Grout needs to be cleaned in the shower  rug in the bedroom had visible stains 
667566050,Thank you for being a great host  The location was perfect and the space was nice  The carpet needed swept
671648242,Hey zencity it was overall a decent stay  It was just a little dirty in certain areas like the bedroom    living room  However we enjoyed our stay  Thank you for everything The night stands in the bedroom were a bit dirty   so was the bed itself along with the couch in the living room 
666384105,Place smelt of mildew
584017973,Thank you so much   We had a wonderful time   Great place  Just a little touch up in bath and laundry areas   Minor 
673596159,All of us enjoyed our stay so much  The location  Of the property was perfect  It is close to everything and the neighborhood seemed very safe  There were only   concerns I had with our stay  The master bedroom closet was covered with mold  You can t smell it unless you open the closet  We didn t use the closet at all due to some health risks  The Airbnb seemed clean overall  Most areas were covered in light dust and the carpets were not vacuumed recently  Other than these two issues  everything was as expected  I would definitely recommend this place The carpets seemed not vacuumed recently  The bed headboards were covered with dust
666519802,Please be sure that your house cleaners keep check the bathroom window is securely closed after leaving  The window was left open in the bathroom so there were a lot of gnats mosquito types initially  but that was cleared up once it was closed  I look forward to visiting again 
710615348,Thank you for sharing your space with us for the weekend  There was a lot of debris under the bed and around the couch  The ceiling fan wouldn t work  They either took the remote or it doesn t work at all  There was   light switch that didn t turn anything on  so that could be why the fan wouldn t work 
669933110,There were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been cleaned for some time  Corners of the room  baseboards  cracks in the stove had food in them etc  These things made me question how well cleaned the rest of the space was  In addition  the tub   shower backed up after about   mins of running the water  meaning you had to stand with your feet in disgusting back flow while you showered  The bedroom also had no top sheet   Only a duvet  Since most of the time the duvet doesnt get washed every guest  this was an additional gross factor 
669913774,Thanks for the ease of booking  access and checkout   Much appreciated   A Great View of sunrise over the lake     Shower curtain should be replaced
716085187,There was holes in the sheets like cigarettes holes   We didn t have heat at all for   days stay on our extended stay the  th day they decided to let   men we didn t know in our bnb he gave them our code without telling us as we are returning back to the air bnb the men are coming out of the apartment  Unprofessional as hell  The boiler room was leaking all the way to the bedroom floors and now they are trying to charge me for damages what damages 
703318549,Yeah I got something to say to mr DM the cleaner  The sheets were not washed before we got there and had stains and smelled like a cheap ladys perfume     Sheets had stains and perfume smells as if they hadnt been washed between guests
587203310,Thanks for hosting us  There were smallish brown stains on a face towel and the white duvet on the bed   All other areas were super clean and organized 
702994538,Apartment was comfortable and located in a great spot  Would absolutely rent again but shower curtain smelled really bad and dirty dishes were unsettling  Made me wonder what else in the apartment was not clean  Front burners on stove do not light for some reason  Apartment was still nice and building was very quiet  Bathroom shower curtain was so musty that it could be smelled into the living room area and made showering very unpleasant  Every dish I used in the kitchen was visibly very dirty  bits of food and greasy residue  and needed to be washed well before use 
713310066,I enjoyed the stay  Thanks  Countertops had sauce on them  Dining room table had streaks and rings 
719199265,The cleanliness of the apartment was not good at all  Free coffee would be nice to set out for guests  There were hairs in the bed and shower  the ceiling fan in the bedroom didn t work  the lighting in the bathroom is horrible  the dishwasher had an awful smell and could smelt while sitting on the couch  there were fake finger nails broken on the side of the bed on the floor and crumbs in the bed  The lock on door was broken and we had to stick it back onto the door to make it work properly  It took us    minutes to figure out that was the problem  The location is great though 
706967840,Floor was sticky and dirty
584204094,Dusty
559751411,Thanks for being a good host and checking in when you thought something was wrong  You were very respectful and courteous and we appreciate that  Mouse droppings in kitchen
630117867,Bathroom with hair in the drain and musty curtain smell   ants
673955924,In COVID    times there is a CDC  protocol on how to handle the cleaning   It wasn t followed when I arrived to the apartment  At the moment I let them know and they apologize for it 
701771886,It was a really lovely place  We were a bit disappointed  especially in these times that the room had not been vacuumed and there was still dirt in the shower from the person before us  Unfortunately it looked as though it had not been cleaned since the last person  There were sequins all of over the floor and dirt in the shower 
669381771,In the second guess bathroom there were flys coming out the drain
547104856,Truthfully we were disappointed with the state of the Airbnb from cleanliness to creaking floors and confusing light switches  You ve got a lot of great potential with the place  Bathroom especially had little hairs like from shaving all over the floor and baseboards  shower floor was gross and in need of a deep clean 
446095954,Thanks for great communication Second stay with Zen city and they re always a bit dusty
604550827,Thick dust noted on vent in hallway  Small stain on a couple of sheets and duvets 
561481440,This listing was beautiful  and an amazing view   location  Would absolutely stay again  The only thing I would say is to ensure that the bedding is clean for guests  Had it been a hotel I would have requested clean bedding  Other than that  amazing stay  The comforters and duvet and shower curtain all had very noticeable multiple brown and yellow stains on them 
561053221,The sink hadnt been properly cleaned and there were little hairs  as if someone had been shaving  left around 
601142297,THANK you for a wonderful stay Clogged shower
122598929,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  bathroom 
116455160,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  Additional comments   The bath tub is not draining well  and the overhead light is out   The overhead in the closet is also not working   
116338782,Thanks for the stay  the location was great  Only suggestion if you have a cleaner  the bathroom could use a once over  There was hair all over the shower and floor  Thanks again   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower  towels and linens  bathroom 
308017888,Thanks  It was great  The fridge wasnt a huge deal  however  we thought you may want to know   The inside of the fridge was dirty  There was a small hair on our sheets 
707880872, Very  minor spills on the kitchen floor that we wiped up 
721627586,food was left in oven from the people before  hangers on the ground and dishes were in the dishwasher still
103631939,""
544268452,Great location and exactly what it was advertised to be on the site  Some mold on bathroom window 
82806476,""
443704036,This review is in reference to the original booking at      S Blackstone  It was clean on the surface but not when you looked closely  Ex  There were food wrappers crumbs under the bed  The kitchen table had not been moved when the floor was mopped  there was sticky pink juice under the table base  The issue with cockroaches is clearly a problem with the building  but you could do a better job of sealing up the spaces within the unit so they cant come in  After the cockroach issue  I really appreciate you being accommodating and providing an alternative building for the remainder of our stay 
594418100,I loved your space and will most likely be back  Just some dust around corners and what not  nothing atrosious 
442501196,Overall great stay  Good location  comfortable space  quick response times and easy check in out  My only note is that I wish the place would have felt cleaner upon arrival  The sheets and bathroom did not look like they had been fully cleaned after the guest prior to our stay  I was able to get in touch with the host and they ensured me it had been cleaned  so may have been an issue with the cleaning service they used 
532947225,Carpet is needs to be replaced  Everything else was spotless 
440355864,Internet did not work     of time  Elevator did not work all the time  Kitchen was not clean   Rest was ok  But I can give only   stars because of that  Kitchen was not the cleanest but it was ok for cooking 
556521459,The bathroom smelled a bit like sewage the entire stay  Other than that  it was a very clean apartment with a great kitchen and living space  A dresser or another nightstand would be nice in the bedroom 
433483709,Floors carpet
280558885,Thanks for getting back to us quickly when we encountered the dishwasher mess upon checking in   Note  toilet  paper holder is not secured  fell off the wall so I stuck it back on    LOVED the location and the pied a terre size of the unit and may book with you again  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  odors  towels and linens  Additional comments   A sour smell  perhaps from the dishwasher problem   We had to have the a c on or the slider open to dissipate it   We needed linens for the sofa but there were no spare sheets so we made do with spare comforter and pillows   Bed was hard as a rock but I a  
589301511,Thank for the apartment it was very relaxing and joyful  The vibe was calm and no major issues were at play  Beds weren t too clean but neat just a few dust 
707911689,Messy kitchen with dishes and food in the sink and dirty dishes in the dish washer
434359194,All of the extra towels smelled like smoke but the towels laid out were clean 
190576480,Thank you so much for getting me in last minute and allowing me to check in so early  You have a great place  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust 
702760724,Merci pour votre r activit    r pondre et toute votre gentillesse en ayant accept  toutes nos demandes  Canap  tach   peinture du plafond qui se d tache du plafond    nettoyage assez sommaire  La vue est magnifique mais les vitres sont si sales   
434233420,there was some mold in the shower
576874896,Everything was exceptional and I appreciated the quick response time  I would      rent this space again  There were some food scraps on the stove and in the dishwasher  And some leftover food in the refrigerator  No big deal 
433450663,Thanks for the clear communication  Not sure the sheets were cleaned since the last visit
556850377,There were sticky marks from cups on the kitchen counter and bedside table  Not the end of the world  I cleaned them up 
569484184,The kitchen needs some attention  I guess most guests dont cook but for those that do  it is lacking several items  The stove is nasty  You cant cook there  The kitchen is missing important items like a set of knives and a basic strainer  The french press was dirty and needed to be fixed 
566528374,Remind your guests to bring their TV provider info if they wish to watch live TV The place is clean  just not sparkling clean 
702119492,I provided an opportunity to rectify the situation prior to writing this review  but you failed to take steps on repeated occasions  Bathroom and kitchen sink did not drain  sewage pipe water bubbles up from the kitchen sink  giving the unit a foul sewage smell  Toilet did not drain  so we were not able to go to the bathroom in the unit  a basic expectation for habitable unit  We were told a plumber would arrive  but never did 
543841246,Pillow smells bad     need to change that Other than that  this place is awesome
613316015,Everything was fine there except the pictures on Airbnb show a pool and lounge but there was no instrucinstructions on were to find that  When we arrived the two guys were there to fix the cable one of them told us theres pool and restaurant in the building across the street and thats what our key was for  They were really nice and helped alot  Also I figured the backstory In the closet was for dirty laundry so In put the used towel in there  The dishes were kinda dirty but its ok 
428699501,Girlfriend had a real issue with the cleanliness  Other than that  it was a solid place for great value  Thanks  The only drawback to this place was the cleanliness  Chucks of food left in the kitchen sinks  Random scraps of something or another in the bathtub  Items from previous guests that were simply left on shelves 
246575688,Hi Chris  Thanks again for hosting us  we enjoyed Chicago a lot and staying in your apartment in such a great location really made the trip special  There were a few issues however  When I booked I advised that my daughter would use the sofa bed  Whilst there were sheets and pillows there was no duvet or blanket to be found  Lizzie ended up sleeping under our coats which really was far from ideal  In the kitchen there was a sticker on the dishwasher which said Clean dishes drying  Please do not run  We looked inside and the machine was empty but given the very firm instruction and as there were no dishwasher tabs to be seen we didnt use it during the whole stay  We cooked a lot and so had to hand wash dishes and cooking equipment twice a day  Not much fun on a vacation when you are used to having the use of a dishwasher on a daily basis  Some help with information on the situation about leaving bags after check out would have been appreciated  We had heavy bags and wanted to make the most of our time on our last day in Chicago before our flights home late evening  Just an indication or suggestion on what to do in a strange city would have helped  Thanks  Martin  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  Additional comments   Refrigerator interior could have been cleaner   
428063771,We definitely enjoyed our stay in Chicago and the great location of your place  Check in process was very easy   Thank you again  Holly The carpet in bedroom and closet as well at the rug in the living room did not appear recently vacuumed and the bathroom floor was not very clean  especially in the corners 
245038180,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  Additional comments   Overall very clean  Shag rug needed to be vacuumed    
243371037,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  floors and carpet 
426262879,Everything about this stay was great  except it was a bit too short  Additionally  while I do appreciate the communication being very clear and timely  we did feel rushed to leave the apartment  The cleaner even came ten minutes early while we were still packing  which made things a bit frustrating    Aside from that  great apartment  great location and generally very pleased  The first bedroom sharing a ceiling space with the living room had little hairs all over the floor which were noticeable on our socks  I m by no means a perfectionist  but my friend who happens to be allergic to pet hair  started developing a runny nose and an itch 
425642895,Amazing space and proximity to McCormick  I d change the bathroom liner in the first bath  It seems to have collected mildew or dirt from frequent showering  The dishes in the dishwasher are clean  While minor  there were a few stains spills on the floor that hadn t been addressed before check in  No biggie  Surrounding neighbors smoke marijuana  the smell easily carries to the unit itself  This is beyond your control 
589713153,Thank you for hosting us  Have stayed with you couple of times  Looking forward to future stays with you guys The dishes had lips and hand prints
554124458,See messages and emails
721528184,Thanks for the stay  I appreciated the communication  Dishes weren t clean  clear lip marks on wine glasses  which is concerning due to COVID 
592732947,There was trash in the couch
589112781,Thanks for your quick communication and detailed information about the property  I hope my notices help you all to make the property perfect for the next visitors  Confetti all over the ceiling fan and light  clogged sink in the kitchen
236183129, Overall very clean  but the dishwasher was full of dirty dishes  and some gross sludge  when we arrived so we had to run it before we could use some of the dishes   
530933958,A lot of spider webs and spiders   The space between the windows and the screens needs a lot of cleaning  Some towels were dirty and some dust in the floors and closets 
235135401,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  towels and linens 
202953008,Hey Chris   your hospitality  communication and location were fantastic  I just think there are a few things that need some attention  if we re paying for a cleaning fee  and others too  there really shouldn t be cobwebs on the windows  The shower needs some attention too   mold on the bottom corner of the shower curtain was a little off putting  There were some areas where the wood was separating from the foundation which didn t look great either  Some of your cups dishes that were put away weren t clean and some were even cracked  It also wasn t a big deal  but if you re going to advertise things like Sling TV  you should probably make sure guests have the credentials to log into them  I noticed you reached out and requested a   star review  but if these things were taken care of you probably wouldn t have to do that  Outside of that we really enjoyed our stay  Thanks again  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  mold  shower or tub  Additional comments   Cobwebs on windows  shower curtain mold  some areas of house were cracked  
202745426,Thank you  I forgot that I need the keys to get through the front gate and left them locked in the apartment  I guess the only solution is to go down and open the gate then go back upstairs and leave them in the room then come back down  Fortunately someone else came in just as I was leaving at   am or I would have been stuck  Maybe there is a reminder in your note  A message on the kitchen counter how to handle this would have been a welcome reminder  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  Additional comments   Shower curtain needs cleaned or replaced  
527313435,nice clean space
712364327,Thank you for accommodating my stay  The view was beautiful and it was sooooo amazing  Only feedback would be to check with your cleaning service as it didn t appear they swept the floors prior to our arrival  The floors and main area rug were both very dirty  The floor and main carpet are really dirty  Didn t appear to be cleaned before we arrived 
523007539,Fix slow drains and check that sofa for possible bedbugs  I was bitten while sitting there  This was a beautiful suite  However  I found hairs all over the bathroom floor and a few strands in the bed  The bathroom drain was so clogged that it acquired standing water up to my ankles  I was also bitten a few times by something on the sofa  I know this sounds like a terrible review but there were some pros  Like I said  it was beautiful  The rooms had a simple and elegant decor  It was pin drop quiet and the views were stunning  Check in was swift and easy too  I really hope they improveon the cleanliness becauseI would love to give zencityanother shot 
521276731,Female hair in bed
418650301,The living room became extremely dusty due to the rug 
417914182,A bit dirty windows inside and out  I ve clean them a little for us from the inside   but it would be pleasant for guests to have them clean for every visit
722014033,There was strands of hair in between the sheets on the bed and on the gray vent in the bathroom  The floors were pretty dusty 
519504254,Appreciate the space and location   Price point was on target   Thanks  Bathtub jets weren t clean  but probably because they aren t typically used 
714095468,There was some wet
517528075,thank you very much  dishes not clean
516629577,Pubic hair in the shower and the  clean  towels
415022484,Hey  the place was great overall  You could get a slightly more comfortable couch loveseat in there  the one you ve got is close to useless  Other than that  my only issue is that there were some short  curly hairs on the towels provided  o  Just mentioning it privately so you guys can shore up these minor issues  I d stay with zencity again in a heartbeat  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens 
583304132,Great location  beds were comfy    would stay again Dust under the bed
672145240,Having a washer dryer in the apartment came in handy   Having a real coffee maker was good  Finding a parking space was challenging  especially in the evening   Overall we liked the place very much and would stay there again  Some hair on bathroom floor  kitchen countertop gritty  clothes dryer lint trap overstuffed packed with lint   a fire hazard  there was the same clump of dog hair in front of the   th floor elevator for about   days and visible dust inside the elevator doors and panels
508873974,All the place was clean except because there was a cockroach in the kitchen  I saw it the last day before leaving  Not really an issue because I did not cook but definitely it can be annoying for other people
453730649,consider another shower curtain such that the wood in the bathroom doesnt get so wet
505676459,Thanks for the speedy response and for being a great host  The kitchen and bathroom floors both felt oily  and because there is no dishwasher in the space  the cleanliness of the dishes was a bit touch and go  The water damage to the wall and window in the bathroom was pretty severe  The giant stain on the couch was off putting 
504988081,The steps up to the place were pretty filthy  but once inside all fine 
452665964,Thanks again  it wad overall a great stay  Small amount of hair left in tub 
412479951,As soon as you walk into the unit it smells unpleasant  The couch in the living room as well as the rug need to go  They re dirty and disgusting  The fridge looked like you had never cleaned it out ever  The kitchen sink was dirty  ALL of the linens  towels  blankets  had random fuzz  lint  hairs on and in them 
495884348,Another nice stay at Zencity place  Thanks again Just dusty
495763935,We enjoyed the nights in the apartement  but it is not possible to sleep on that Sofa  The dishes were not clean  I suppose the former guest are responsible  but we had to clean everything before we could use it 
409711601,After staying in your property in March of      and referring to classmates to your property this past week  I was extremely disappointed and offended by the way you handled the situation with the broken window last night  Unfortunately  I would no longer use your properties when I come to Chicago or refer people to your properties  To expect someone to sleep in a room  with a window open  allowing    degree air in is not only ridiculous but dangerous  Im appalled at your lack of customer service  A lot of hair left on the floor in the bathroom and hair left on the pillows and linen in the bed 
495175128,A bath mat would be great and the option to open a window   Kitchen towels would be nice too   Thank you  Behind furniture and pendants were not dusted  Everything else was great 
409353641,Thank you for hosting me  Leak in one of the bath tubs that led to standing water  However  there were two bathrooms 
168021603, Empty water bottle in lamp and the shower curtain on the inside has some sort of black mildew stains nearly covering it   
494131132,All was clean but floors made my bare feet dirty 
493529633,Great location and A C works great  Window sill is rotting due to moisture 
492917388,Carpet was dusty
165408076,Hey Chris  thanks for everything  Your place is amazing  We enjoyed our stay a lot   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  dust 
492880523,Thanks for an absolutely great place to stay  Just a wee bit of dirt and hair on the floor  in the washroom and kitchen area  and the dishwasher had dirty dishes  but otherwise  it was great 
492774262,The patio door didn t close all the way  Besides that it was excellent There was a dirty pan in the oven
492706470,Thanks for being a good host  It was strange to see that the bedsheet did not fit the mattress 
407625709,upon checkin the kitchen and bathroom were dirty as if they had not been cleaned at all  I cleaned the place before my stay 
488187929,Place was expensive  I feel like the cleanliness should have been perfect  A few of the towels were dirty and the floors weren t clean 
486487059,The  pillow cases had stains on them 
404869826,We really enjoyed our stay  The little  dirt  issues didnt bother us at all  Thanks for being so responsive and helpful  We would definitely stay here again  The floor was a little dirty and there was some food stuck in the drain in the kitchen sink 
404559751,the towels and bedding had several stains on them  the sheets had BLOOD on them  just too many stains and dirt  the place is phenomenal however the lines bedding  and towels made the stay incredibly uncomfortable the towels were stained  the bedding had a huge stain on it  the new towels they left on the second day were stained  everything was just stained
714275332,Very nice building and decor  Significant amount of mildew on the bottom of shower and carpet is very soiled
148348368,Please do not provide units to guests unless theyre maintenance issues are resolved and the cleanliness is kept up with   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens  dust  bathroom  kitchen  Additional comments   Broken toilet  trash on floors   
142905234,I think the place is great overall  It was very well situated  My only suggestions would be to include description of staircase  its a bit arduous  I took a tumble at the bottom my first day  and that since the location is the city    its a bit city noise until late evening   and maybe have a second comforter for who ever is on the couch  Thats it  Nothing that really would make me not totally recommend or visit again  Thanks     a bit of my pet peeve but the blinds in the living room were  bit dusty  
479945349,Disappointed the entire place needed a good vacuum and dusting 
477629075,Thanks again for everything  The carpet could use a bit of vacuum   
714101701,The entire place had a really musty smell like body odor had to buy a bunch of candles and air fresheners
534277598,Thanks for a great stay  We loved the location  ease of checking in  outdoor spaces   all great  The house was great  My suggestion to you is to update and fix that ceiling in the kitchen   it is where most people hang out and it did impact the comfort 
701757868,We loved your space  and really enjoyed our stay  Clogged drain from hair
477657327,The entire apartment was very clean but the products that were used left a strong chemically smell  Perhaps switch to a natural based cleaning product 
452143077,Check in was a breeze  beautiful space  great location and views  Thank you  The floors weren t very clean  and the bathroom had some maintenance issues  towel holder fell apart right as you pulled a towel off and the shower didn t drain well  
476148446,Spiders
475711126,Thank you so much for an awesome stay  We loved the location and would love to stay again  The towels smelled like smoke  I am sure this is due to the cleaning service  but it was a bit shocking 
475621732,I feel I shouldn t have to pay a cleaning fee the apartment was not clean  These areas were not clean
367367495,The sheets seemed like they weren t clean  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens  Additional comments   It didn t seem like the bed had new sheets on it  Lots and lots of little black hairs all over and they didn t seem too clean    
471999367,There should be a note added about the neighbors cigarette smoke coming through the vents  especially if a guest is allergic  Other than that  great stay  There was a bathroom towel underneath my bed when I arrived 
470962956,Zencity has always been responsive  But this stay was terrible especially given the amount we paid  I understand that you gouged us because of UC graduation weekend demand  Past experiences with Zencity have always been positive  Thus i assumed that for the money i paid I would get a nice place  Very disappointing  Half a shower curtain  paint peeling  bathroom door did not  close
469475452,Shower could be more clean 
190188775,Chris  it was pleasure to stay in your flat  Thank you for arrival guidance and help with resolving the issue with internet   router  For me everything was perfect  but there are some things that could potentially bother other guests  so I hope my comments will help you   I noticed some cocroach babies in the bathroom  Not sure if it is possible to get rid of insect in this type of loft old building  so just FYI   Kitchen knife is missing  but maybe it was there and I just did not see it  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs 
360737097,Apart from the concerns mentioned  everything was great  The value  the location  the stylish touch in decorations  the fast replies etc I loved it all  Also  it would be really cool if the problems with the shower drain could be fixed   I ll definitely be back  The whole space was clean which was great apart from the bathroom which could ve been cleaned better  A lot of hairs from a previous stay especially on the doors but also the window in the bathroom  when I tried to open it to get rid of humidity  had a dirt like black substance on the handle  This did not highly bother me but just a tip for future hosts  stay 
460163652,Location was great  parking super easy and communication was very quick  It was a good choice   Couch cushions need a bit of help though  smooshed down back cushion  and I would suggest a longer pull chain on the light in the fan so you didn t have to stand on a cushion to turn light off  Stay was much like being at a hotel with good amenities and location  Open food items were left in fridge  Bathroom floor could have used a sweep
189092647,Clogged bathtub Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom 
613253708,The only suggestions I have is cleaning all the towels prior to guests staying there   in the kitchen having measuring utensils  I m not sure how many guests even use the kitchen  but that s something I love to do  But overall  it was a great place to stay   I would definitely come again  There was only   clean towel but it was really no problem to throw the rest in the wash 
357557697,There was an old sweet potato left in the oven and trash already in the trash bin 
450501793,Thanks again for sending out the cleaners  So thankful you sent cleaners out  they did an amazing job  Everything was clean  smelled fresh and the chemical cleaning odor was gone  Sweet ladies 
357168546,Youre space was great and we enjoyed our stay  Would say just to double check those areas that I previously mentioned to make sure theyre extra clean  Thank you for hosting us  kitchen floor was sticky  had to mop  Sheets had hair on it and there was a pink stain looked like candy  on the fitted sheet near the pillows  so we changed them
714957740,The bedside lamp is broken  There were atleast   insects  The water pressure in the shower is poor  The   recognition system does not work well to let people into the building   There are no available power outlets for the lamp by the desk so it is unplugged  also no outlet ofc for any laptop the guest may use at the desk  There was an insect in my bed that I had to kill 
357139721,Thank you  There was some soot in the bathtub  otherwise  it was very clean 
452166447,Found a little hair in the bedroom near the bed on the floor
722022075,Thanks for hosting  It was all that we expected it to be and more Food was in the fridge from the people before us  and a decent amount of hair on bathroom floor
450912862,Thanks for letting me stay  The bathtub felt grimy and water would dont drain quickly enough so water would back up when showering 
568643254,Tub wasnt clean but it wasnt a big issue
448955958,Thank you for the great location to campus  but cleanliness is lacking  I love that there was a French press  The hot water was nearly non existent  thank you  The bedroom had hair on the floor and on the toilet from a previous tenant  A cockroach crawled out from behind the shelving in the closet area next to the bathroom   The plates were dirty with egg residue on them 
351666722,Someone left food  pasta sauces x   eggs  cheese etc  in the fridge from the previous visit  We left unopened Fiji water bottles sorry for the inconvenience  Sheets were dirty
717408781,I would suggest to have more face and bath towels  the sensor on the front door lock was hanging off like it is barely making it  I would suggest a blender for the kitchen as well  Overall it was a nice stay for     people  There was hair all over the inside of sheets and pillows   Dirty pots and pans  food left in microwave 
446952735,Towels and sheets
350894465,No wifi for   days till you put an extension  No water during a shower  because the building is too old and it can not support all the people using the shower  Police at midnight in the next door apartment as guests were fighting        had to leave the apartment at midnight and move to my son s apartment  The suggestion is  THIS APARTMENT  THIS BUILDING IS NOT PROPER TO BE OFFERED FOR SHORT RENT  I WILL NEVER EVER TRUST AIRBNB AGAIN  And I am sorry for that because we as family have rented via airbnb in snowmass colorado  rio de janeiro brazil  filadelfia  atlanta etc     I am very sorry  Best regards Building hall  corridor  elevator  smell horribly and are dirty Hairs in the bathroom corners  dust and spots in the kitchen cupboards  Black spots on the bedroom walls
442489620,Couch smelt bad
566195588,Thanks for hosting us in St  Louis   Not sure why the building was so warm  but the window ACs were pretty straightforward to use   If you could please be a little clearer in your email instructions about which table to leave the keys at for check out  that would be lovely   I assumed it was the front desk but they had no idea what to do with the keys and eventually I just tried to put them back in the lockbox  I m not sure if y all regularly wash the mattress cover  but it smelled slightly sweaty   It also doesn t breathe at all and the building was rather warm even with the window AC running  so we were waking up several times a night trying to cool off   The sheets and comforter were definitely clean  and all of the spaces were clean  it was just the mattress cover that smelled off 
443276853,Thank you for accommodating me  The kitchen was pretty dirty  It may hav been because I got into the space a little early 
443242867,Hi  I have written a text with recommendations that you probably received The sink was dirty
442031358,Please make sure you fix the check in Key issue  Also  please follow up with the cleaning people to make sure they clean up the apartment before new guest arrive  The bed was not made when I arrived  I had  to change the sheets  Also  the trash can was full of trash  The place wasn t cleaned at all 
596747417,Great little apartment  Apart from the check in issues  which I will say were resolved quickly  the difficult parking options  and the disruptive neighbors it s a cute little place  There was still hair and soap scum in the shower and in the bathroom sink  I assume this attributed to the rushed cleaning job 
350200027,Hey Chris  I had a couple things that I wanted to bring to your attention that we had issues with during our stay  I spoke to you before about the WiFi and soap dispenser that were not working  after trying to trouble shoot those issues  we ended up having to connect to a different network and use soap outside of the apartment  The apartment was clean but we noticed someone else s leftovers in the fridge that left a foul smell for the rest of the stay  Overall the place was nice and clean  but I hoped those things would have been addressed before we came in  Someone else s leftovers before our stay were in the fridge that left a foul smell for the rest of the stay 
438054594,Great stay  would definitely go back if we visit Chicago again  Thanks for the responses and tips  Was surprised with Bagbnb which made it easy to drop off our luggage   BTW  the top door lock doesnt lock with the key  wont turn counter clockwise    Thanks  Steve The utensil platter needs a good scrub
437457398,Musty smell
436650277,There is a really awful smell in the bathroom closet area
712867405,perhaps give a heads up if tradesmen are coming to fix things  dont forget about a problem when notified  the kitchen had been thrown together  missing basic stuff  and the cleaning supplies fell out at us upon opening a cabinet  the bedroom had a window open that couldnt shut and what looked like a swiffer pad attempting to cover an opening while the AC unit barely hung in the window  it also smelled of smoke when we entered 
712388294,Thank you for the quick response when we got locked out  Just make sure to have a number listed that will answer anytime  It was all clean except it smelled like cigarette smoke when we went in 
432695691,Stains on sheets  floors covered in debris that would easily be cleaned with a vacuum  shower sticky
429649561,Floors werent as clean as it should be
599294734,Lots of hairs all over bathroom  shower  rugs
595751820,The spill wasnt mine  For you to say it was a stain and try to make me pay      is ridiculous   Anybody could have cleaned that up  You should probably reconsider your cleaners  Frozen beers exploded in freezer and carpets hadnt been vacuumed and floors hadnt been swept 
428729374,Just a little dusty but understand if no one is in it for a week or so  
414088674,Bathroom fixtures were clean  however  the floor had not been swept mopped  There were numerous long black hairs all over the floor  It was probably an over site and I would never mention this in a public review 
410731946,The place needed a good sweep   There were dust bunnies around the bedroom   The bathroom also had a clump of hair in the bathtub upon arrival
408202848,thanks so much for the place to stay  wish I had spent more time at the location  but mayb next time  the hallway of the location smelled like garbage and there was garbage in the hallways
573223894,Place was clean
407282186,Overall  our stay at      S  Dorchester was pleasant   Thanks  I had to actually go out and buy a shower curtain liner for the bathroom   It had mold and mildew on it   And there was a lot of hair and dirt at the back of the tub that had to be cleaned   The two stars reflect my having to leave the unit to purchase something for the unit   It was too late at night to call anyone  and we both wanted to shower   The toilet bowl was dirty as well and there is a strange dirty glue like substance on the floor that reappears after you wipe it away 
406997303,Seemed like the place was falling apart kinda Door busted and bathroom door wouldn t close  Dirty plates and bowls  Dust around corners
722016387,Thank you for your hospitality  My wife and I loved our time at your apartment and felt like we were right at home Nothing terrible but it looked like the place hadn t been vacuumed in a little while
404605400,A few clumps of hair in the shower and on the bed  as well as a minor stain on the comforter  Additionally  the electronic soap dispenser did not work so I ended up using a bottle of bath soap from the shower instead 
405175248,When I arrived found all of the Glassware  multiple plates and  some silverware in the drawers had been used and replaced without being cleaned    Arrival was after   am the day after check in so had to run a load   Aside from that  the place was clean 
405166734,A dirty kleenex on the floor 
573571085,This place was a much nicer stay then the previous location  The place was clean  There was some smell in the bathroom  Probably due to a drain issue because I could see bubble coming out of the sink drain periodically throughout my stay 
708066603,I would suggest better cleaning especially with covid  Just seems like whoever the last person was to clean rushed did  a half job  The appliances had not wiped cleaned  the floor was dusty and the walls in the bathroom need to be cleaned  stainless steel appliances had not been wiped  Walls need to be wiped as well  The floor could have used a mopping as well  The toiletries were helpful but not as clean as expected 
367848426,Looked like some mold on the shower curtain
603708256,Some crumbs on floor and counter
363368689,Overall it was a very good apartment but there was a very disgusting smell of rotting meat throughout the apartment  We had to spray our own body spray in order to just sit in the common area  The apartment was clean but throughout the place had a rotting meat smell to it both in the hallway leading to the place and inside the place 
362521929,It wasn t that the house was filthy but a little more attention to detail would go a long way  Like wiping out the fridge from previous guest or making sure there isn t crumbs on the stove or counter tops  The kitchen trash  could be cleaned out  the throw blanket in the common area should be washed between guest  it smelled like smoke  The bed linens was so wrinkled as if it wasn t previously changed  although it was 
361547175,Amazing experience and great location  Would definitely stay here again  Tub would clog from time to time 
345184068,None  All was great None
184425259,Chris  it was great to stay at your place  Thank you  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  floors and carpet 
184389684,Chris   place was goodnfor what I was looking for  However  the mold in the bathroom  ceiling above shower  gave off a terrible odor  Not sure if thats safe for future guests  In all  I would book again as the location was perfect and the pricing was fair  Thanks again for a great stay  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  Additional comments   Whole apartment was perfect  However  there were issues with the bathroom ceiling  Significant mold residue gave out a bad odor in the bathroom    
359923773,Nice place  Will rent again  Just need to tell cleaner to scrub bottom of oven  Very Smokey  Smoke detector went off  Oven had spillage left in it that made it smoke when I baked something 
359678889,Thanks for the great room  Location  cite  decoration  service  all   stars  Just if you could be a bit more careful with your bedding ware cleanliness  it would be great  I wish my carelessness about the glass doesnt make too much of the inconvenience  Sorry again  bedding wares cleanliness could be improved  found some small stains on the bed sheet 
359712836,All I can say is know the app better where U can tell the guest how to send pictures The roof was falling in and the tub wasnt clean other then that I actually enjoyed the place and fabianas was a    
181930505,The place is was great but we realised that out feet got dirty after bare foot walking inside  We noticed that when we were showering and our feet made the tub dirty and we couldn t clear the mark     Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
181414174,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
356523853,I did really enjoy my stay  the one downside were a few of the cleanliness issues that I noted  The bins in the bathroom were only partially emptied   There were some nuts under the bench in the living room and tomatoes on the balcony   The bottle opener still had an old cork stuck in it 
355745862,Floors needing Vacuuming
357533674,bed sheets were not changed or cleaned
354376063,It s a nice place but the quality of the furniture is extremely cheap  The towels in the bathroom had hair on them  the silverware still had caked on food  and bathroom sink drains slow 
178111625,Thanks for helping me get into your place early   I really appreciate it   A better A C unit would have made a big difference   the window unit was noisy and didnt cool the room enough to be comfortable   It wasnt horribly hot   but it was never comfortable  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  Additional comments   Floors were vacuumed but could use a mopping   Some of the dishes that I pulled out of the cabinet werent fully clean   Extra furniture piled in the closet   
351399365,Just a few webs in the corner of rooms with lot of lil bugs
580469287,Glassware in kitchen was dirty  Shower caddy a little rusted 
551782972,Bug
346997495,Overall it was good  There were small things like nails on the floor  and I almost stepped on them barefoot  I moved the nails to the coffee table   Also  Friday and Saturday morning  the living room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke  I opened the windows  and it took a couple of hours for the smell to go away  In the meantime  i just stayed in the bedroom 
345942213,Floor 
345138235,Chris  thanks for all your help   Over all it was a very good and easy stay   you have really nice neighbors  I dropped the top of the soap and reached behind the sink to get and picked up a bunch of hairs   Sorry to be nit picky 
344407039,I would suggest a shower curtain that goes all the way around  A lot of water got on the floor 
582172033,Brian  please see my notes for why the value was just not there for this rental  Just take one weekends profits  do a little cleanup and some minimal decorating and tour place would be sooo much nicer and worth the rate  We were surprised bu several aspects of cleanliness  First  even though it was not necessarily dirt  all of the main windows still had half scraped construction labels on them and none of the exterior glass had been cleaned in quite a while  The floors which the owner made a point to ask us to take our shoes off for  had not been cleaned very well at all  Visible dust and dirt along the walls  The most unacceptable though was food debris on the dining room table  I have pics of all of this if you would like 
343179108,The place is lovely and suited me perfectly for location   the issues I had were completely fixable and I would trust to stay in a zencity place in the future  the floors werent that clean and the dishes were put away wet  water was puddled in glasses and bowls 
342863506,Building lobby  elevator and hallway was really dirty  gross smelling and shabby  In apartment   counter and stovetop and fridge not wiped down  and floor had not been swept or vacuumed 
340335221,The tub seemed to be clogged so unfortunately I had to shower with water that would not drain
339578889,The bathtub is not so clean  most probably because it drains a little bit slowly
335596291,Smelly
595081744,During a rainstorm there was an issue where the roof leaked 
337574236,The only reason I didnt give this a   star rating is due to the counter tops and stove top not being clean prior to our arrival   The location was ideal for our stay and I loved the layout of the space   The only other suggestion I would make is to add additional coffee cups  there were only   and we had   guests  and wine glasses  Unfortunately  the counter tops and top of the stove were not cleaned prior to our arrival 
336827495,Thanks  Too bad bed and sofa were mega soft too my taste  Bit smelly corridor found some hairs in the place  Overall not bad but not excellent  What also didnt help was that the couch and bed are mega soft  actually slept on the floor for a bit
334310463,dark smudges most likely fingerprints
334268589,The bathroom still had hair on the floor  sink  and bathtub from the previous guest  Also  there was a used  still wet  towel hanging in the bathroom 
333005633, 
331413323,Thanks for the great trip to Chicago  We loved this neighborhood   Common room ceiling looked like it may have a water stain  The jets in the tub looked old and dirty 
593651224,Thanks for hosting me  I did request a small refund for uncleanliness and no response back for the internet issues  The comforter had yellow stains and hairs  I also found a bug in the bed that was dead 
329795246,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
329364005,Only suggestion I have is to do one deep cleaning to get rid of pesky bugs on the shower curtains  the rest of the bathroom and the room  Other than that it was an absolutely amazing space    Thank you so much for a great place  There were bugs in every room both dead or alive  In the bed under the sheets I found a living spider  that I got rid of  then I cleaned the apartment myself before going to sleep
329381241,much thanks for the stay  definitely will visit you again the bathtubs in both places needed a good scrub before we got there  we wanted to use the Jets in No   but stuff came out so we decided not to
329366258,Thanks for hosting me Chris  I had a great stay  Left one suggestion about the bathtub drain and needing a new shower curtain  Otherwise everything was excellent  All best  Kate Over all it was clean there were just two issues  The bathtub needs a drain filter and to be cleaned with Draino  It backs up because hair and what not goes down the drain  there is nothing to stop stuff from clogging the drain   The shower curtain was moldy also 
322612992,There is no window covering on the main door to the unit  with it being glass  I d recommend placing a curtain or blinds over the door  Soap scum on shower caddy  Hair and dust balls on sheets pillows 
324272141,Thanks for making my first AirbNb stay a success  Hairs in shower  some chemical smell in kitchen
323451056,Just the entrance of the building
321066221,You could really use a bigger trash can for the place or let guest know where they can take out trash  And also a can of air freshener or plug ins would be great and a mat in the tub The tub wasn t clean and should have a shower mate or something if the stains are permanent
606855131,Thanks so much for accommodating our early check in  We enjoyed our stay here  bath tub was chipping  and the hanging shelf under the shower was not clean  Had orange colored soap residuals on it 
317701940,The wife and I discussed this again  and what she again wanted to communicate  was the stairwell cleaning needs    Ill leave it at that  As per prior review  the bathroom needed more attention 
316593001,Great stay thanks  Floor was slightly dirty in a couple spots
347576459,Thanks for being a good host  So responsive  Toilet seat in second bathroom had drops of dried urine and the tub in first bathroom had leftover remains several strands of long pubic hair  Nothing gross Overall  clean but I would pay attention to details of areas that catches the eye 
347555347,Again  it was a reasonable place but we were disappointed by the sewage smell and the lack of responsiveness to our call  House was clean but there was a bad sewage odor when we entered   We opened window and turned on bathroom fan   We think it was coming from bathtub drain or one of the sink drains so we ran water to flush the sinks and closed the drain stoppers in the tub and two of the three sink drains    didnt see a stopper for the other kitchen sink drain   The smell went away  but came back the next morning after a shower  so we think it was coming from the tub drain   This is something that needs to be fixed 
311640354,the smell of mold was very strong and pervasive throughout the unit
601497672,It was great staying with you N a
309113130,Ants were all over the bathroom floor and large bugs were on the walls of the apartment in the bedroom 
722173416,Bathroom door handle was broken and I got stuck in the restroom for an hour 
712475189,whole place smelled if cigarette smoke  walls were browned and chairs had grease spots   had to leave because it was not worth the money
708318023,Needs new carpet
342799736,Could be cleaner and also needs couple of updates  but overall it was nice apartment  thanks  I already told about bed linens imperfections  Comforter needs washing  at least comforter case  it has huge yellowish stain right in the middle and we couldnt find any extra comforter case to replace it    Toilet paper holder is broken  Chips in a sink  Hair pins on a floor in bathroom  Some random small pieces of plastic paper on a carpet  Ventilation grid falls off  living room area

342300770,Appreciate the apology for after hours automated response  Suggestions for unit improvements given to host Found a pill on living room floor

340345028,Hi  I really loved my stay at the flat in Chicago  Thank you again for the good communication and for fixing the internet relatively quickly  For me as a woman travelling alone  I would have felt a bit safer though  if one could lock the appartment from inside  The day the man from maintenance just showed up in the flat made me feel a little uncomfortable because I dont want someone to just enter the flat when I am perhaps changing or sleeping  I said that already that the communication on this could have been better  but I guess that came through  Also  I know the building is quite old and this is not easy to work on  but the shower only from the top is not ideal  And  it was quite hard to get a stable temperature in the flat  because the heating  when turned on  would heat like crazy and sometimes one couldnt properly switch it off  But I grew up in an old building like this  so I know it is quite difficult to do anything about that  Thank you again for your hospitality  Cups and plates were perfectly fine  but the drawer with knives and forks needed a little clean up  Also  I find it great when there is a little bit of salt  pepper  oil  because that is really annoying to buy  But there was lots of food in the fridge  When I finally decided to take some of the ketchup I realised it was expired in summer       It would be great if someone could check on those things  But I have to say  I hate throwing things away  so I think it is a good option to leave something for the next person  It just requires Zencity to check from time to time

337862245,The site was a great value and very stylish   The place was quiet   Two suggestions would be to provide a TV service that allows for cable Netflix  and to provide coffee amenities  there were spills between the trashcan and the area behind it  there was also long hair on one of the pillows on the bed
285369518,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  towels and linens  bathroom  kitchen 
172684951,The TV    not sure what the issue was but we tried to get it to work and tried   Hot water in the shower   need to put directions      The pillows on the couch were kind of disgusting   The key on the scooter is a good idea  but when I opened the box it was half full of rusty dirty water   The piece of silverware and the pot that I used were not clean   I didnt look at the rest  
711483427,Floor is sticky and bathroom wall has stains

331764732,Thanks for having us  It was a great location and home  Check in and out was super easy  There was food on the carpet in the tv room which attracted some ants but we swept the area  Also there was some old food in the pantry  Everything else was really clean 
707150718,Thanks for the stay  the pictures online don t do the place justice  However  there were no paper towels to help me clean up after myself  so I needed to buy some for the duration of my stay  Also  the bench at the end of the bed broke when I sat on it  for the first time  on the last day  and scared the daylights out of me  I was glad I wasn t injured  Glassware in cabinets was all dirty  had to run them through the dishwasher before use 
722574430,Thank you so so much for hosting us  This place was great  I was so shocked when I saw the rooftop deck  it was incredible  I m surprised you don t advertise it more   the floors were a bit dirty in the kitchen and the shower floor didn t seem super clean  other than that it was fine

282528036,Hi Chris   We really enjoyed our stay   Here are a few suggestions for the future      Consider upgrading the window ac unit   It does not sufficiently cool the apartment   We got lucky the weather      Change the sponge in the kitchen between guest  and have the cleaning crew clean the kitchen sink drain stopper   Both had hair on them   I replaced the sponge and cleaned the stopper      If you are going to provide the basic spices  salt and pepper   provide sugar     Have at least   of each type of  drinking glass       Alert guests that parking should be closely watched   We got a     ticket for parking in a NON identified  street sweeping day  space  right across the street from the entrance   The signs were not up   NOT cool   Again  we enjoyed staying with you   Do repeat guests get discounts   Thanks much  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen

519455258,Thank you We found broken glass in the ice bin of the fridge  and hair throughout the appt  but it was no big deal to us really so we took care of it   but otherwise the place was sparkling clean
518989014,Shower drain was clogged and would fill with several inches of water during a normal length shower 
710063129,Please make sure sheets on bed and covers are properly washed  I saw stains as if someone stayed in the room and the person who was suppose to clean just remade the bed with the same covers  Very uncomfortable I had to get my own blankets to sleep with  Bedrooms could have been cleaner  Sheets look like they were used and not washed  also had stains on them  Dust build up and spider webs under beds and around room corners  Also the shower could have been cleaned better  I saw hair from prior guest on the walls and in the window sill 
604246556,I would definitely recommend this Zencity property to my friends and associates and I would also come to the same unit to stay again whenever Im looking for an Airbnb location in St  Louis area  The bathtub wasnt sparking clean but was touch up clean  I can tell when extra elbow grease cleaning is done  especially in the shower and bathtub areas 
601529149,window sills needed attention
517552569,Hey Zencity   I really enjoyed my stay at your appartement  It is a nice flat in a cool area  But you could be aware of a few small thing that would make it to a perfect Airbnb experience  Unfortunately  the bathroom wasn t as clean as I wished for  I found long dark hair that doesn t belong to me  Same in the bedroom  And please clean or replace the carpet in the living room  It is a bit disgusting   But other than that I was really happy  Thank you   Vivien I found some small vermin in the bathtub and bedroom  It s an old building   I know  But there where hairs in the badroom which didn t belong to me and the carpet in the living room has definitly to be cleaned or replaced

595637095,We really enjoyed our stay and it may have been the best part of our visit  The space was so cool and great for staying in  Our only suggestions would be that a longer shower curtain could be helpful  as well as a bath mat  The concrete got wet really fast and was sort of slippery  Other than that  no complaints  Long black hairs were strewn about the rugs
543448926,Thank you for being a great host with quick responses  Your apartment and your staff are a great combination that I would recommend to any friend  Stray hairs in bathroom
543413197,Thanks for being a great host  Glass shards were on the carpet near the window which probably means the floors were swept  but the carpets were not vaccines prior to arrival 
592663815,Overall stay was very nice besides a few things already noted  We definitely would recommend book with Zencity again  One broken glass in the cupboard  also looks like there was blood in the freezer ice maker from meat  So we had to burn the ice and clean the ice tray out

279787151,Loved the apartment  The location was exactly what I was looking for and the apartment was just as it was pictured    Suggestions      Invest in a small room fan for the back of the apartment  The living room a c was great but we were there for some really hot humid days and it was much stuffier in the entryway and bedroom      new shower curtain  the condition of the shower curtain although clean made you question the actual cleanliness of the bathroom as a whole      clean the blades on the bedroom ceiling fan regularly  when we turn the fan up to a higher speed  it began to rain dust bunnies onto the bed cover  
508944801,I am still waiting for a reply to my most recent message regarding my refund  In the meantime  I hope youve done a thorough cleaning and extermination in the studio  Stained sheets in the bedroom were the prelude to a cockroach in the bathroom 
607239173,Found a wet towel in the cabinet 
587083393,dryer washing machine
586328241,Thank you for our great stay  You have a beautiful apartment building and we enjoyed our time there  We hope to come back for a return visit in the future when the rooftop is complete  Overall  the place was fairly clean  however we found stray hairs   crumbs from previous guests  Additionally  the room spray used in the living room   kitchen was overpowering  even for non sensitive noses  We opened the windows for several hours each day in hopes of reducing the scent  but it was pervasive 
279063262,Chris  Your place is great and we had a fantastic time     I loved it  Only comment is for a deep cleaning  just a suggestion  and the Nest was very difficult to control  I would set it and by the time we came back at night  the house was    degrees and take forever to cool down  Very minor  We would stay again in a heartbeat    Thank you so much for sharing your place    We loved it   Overall was clean and tidy  I would only suggest having a deep cleaning every   months or so  For example  the air vent near the sofa in the den area where my son slept is filthy  Baseboards could use a wipe down  Floor had been swept but I noticed my socks were filthy from walking on it  Prolly needs a good wet cleaning 
130949498,the stay was wonderful  a simple check in process  easy access to the wonders of chicago  and a comfortable place to relax in between it all  we will definitely be looking to see if this area is up for grabs the next time we are down here  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  Additional comments   bathroom floor could have been wiped down better  but not bad at all   
130807511,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs  Additional comments   Found some roaches in the kitchen   The alley entrance had rats     
603736746,The bathtub was dirty and stained
582253983,Thanks so much  The building was in the final stages of remodeling   there were still some outlet covers missing  and one of the smoke alarms was not anchored on the wall  There were also boards in the hallways  Nothing that got in the way  but a couple places were unfinished and dusty in the hallways 
460963090,Great stay  Sparkling clean apartment  My one suggestion would be that you all update the mattress protector as when we were preparing to leave we noticed it was stained yellow and pink in a few places  Will definitely be back  The mattress protector was stained in several places  We just happened to see this when we were preparing to leave  Would be great to get this replaced 
497688872,Shower curtain needs to be replaced   Could see  mop marks  all over the floor in the living room 
568719306,Great place great location  would use this place again Lady bugs spotted few times near sofa
500081265,Just need to make sure the place is swept properly and checked for personal items  Since it looks like it s for work trips and longer stays  you could also provide some more shower soaps than the small ones provided  The kitchen s hand soap dispenser is really funky smelling  you might want to replace it  Other than that  it was great There was a lot of hair all over the place leftover from the previous resident  There was also leftover laundry from the previous resident 
576145640,Thanks for the great communication for this stay  you have a super location in town for anyone going to conferences at the local hotels  It appeared that no vacuuming had been done between guests  the countertops had residue on them  there was a dirty bowl in the kitchen cabinet  and the shower curtain had mysterious stains 
533395846,Everything was good  It s not a huge thing but I think it would add a bunch of value if you added any type of full length mirror  Upon arrival there was still hair in the bathroom sink and in the shower 
570948862,Toliet
495144625,Thanks for being so helpful and accommodating  and patio
573617032,The space we needed was available at a good price and a great location   The building renovations were extensive and messy  but future travelers shouldnt have such problems  Building renovation dust in bathroom and adjoining utility area   Should not be an ongoing problem  though 
494064353,Ac unit filter needed to be changed
531966568,This was one of the best airbnb experiences ever  Thank you so much  There was some hair lying around  We are both short haired people so we knew they weren t ours  Also the cabinets in the bathroom and the kitchen were a little unclean

485340475,Need to change the shower curtain it s was pretty bad but other than that a great space for the price  Very happy thank you The shower curtain has mold along the bottom and the tiles has some mildew
559038740,Corners and window sills
555290838,It was pretty cold because we couldn t get the heat on even turning the radiator knobs but overall great stay and we appreciate it  Also very glad the tv had lots of streaming options  There was quite a bit of hair on the counter and in the shower when we arrived
481351088,Besides the apartment smelling like cigarette smoke when we walked in  everything else was amazing  Smelled like cigarette smoke in the whole apartment
273923260,Awesome stay   A few suggestions   I couldnt find coffee pot or not sure if the white pot was it   I wanted so much to keep the patio doors and windows open but bugs kept flying in   Screens would be great   Otherwise  it was a perfect stay   fingerprints on cabinet and handles 
479101628,Your place was very comfortable and stylish  The included Netflix Hulu was a very nice touch and the view was nice also  I absolutely loved my stay here  thanks for having me  Very minor details   there was a bit of dust built up on all of the high vertical surfaces like door and closet frames  There were a few  small  but dead bugs on the windowsill  The rest of the place was sparkling clean  I would be delighted to stay here again 
459759751,We enjoyed our stay  The only thing was that the towels left on the bed for us to use smelled like cigarette smoke  The apartment did not however and everything was very clean  Thank you  Towels given smelled like cigarette smoke 
460184782,Thanks for being very responsive to my messages that was definitely a plus   The only suggestion I would have is to try and make sure that it is wiped down the same week or a few days before someone elses visit  especially on the black couch  The place itself presented itself very well  however there was dust all over the couch and looks as though it hasnt been wiped down in a week or two 
459557758,Hi there  thank you for having us at your place in Chicago   The location was wonderful  The Airbnb was incredibly spacious  and the beds were comfortable  The massive master bathroom was impressive   My communication with the host prior to arrival was great  In regards to feedback  there are a few things  We were anticipating a true sofa bed  as advertised   not a futon type situation  We were able to have an air mattress delivered to make things more comfortable for our friend who was planning to sleep on the sofa bed  Also  temperature control was difficult  The downstairs would be very cold and the upstairs was very hot which made sleeping comfortably difficult  Finally  we were not made aware of the large ceiling issue in the kitchen  This was not revealed in the pictures advertised  and it wasnt fixed during the maintenance visit that was scheduled during our visit  however  we were not told what that appointment was for   We did have an unfortunate issue with the couch futon on the last day where the arm seemed to break when one of the guests was leaning against it while sitting  We received the      request and sent the money within    hours  We apologize for any inconvenience  It seemed that floors in the living room kitchen area may have been missed by the cleaning service prior to our arrival  The linens and bedrooms were clean  The construction ceiling issue in the kitchen was not mentioned prior to our arrival or documented in the pictures advertised 
548066787,This was an amazing stay thank you  The bathroom was a little dirty when I arrived
477161654,BUGS   BUGS   BUGS   The space was beautiful  but there were nats EVERYWHERE   we put the flowers in the closet so that helped a little     then came my worse nightmare  A PREGNANT ROACH   Luckily my boyfriend killed it because I would of just got another airbnb all together if I was by myself  The pillows   sheets had stains on them  so we had to switch those out  There was hair EVERYWHERE  in the shower  on the floor  in the sinks  The cleanliness issue really put a damper on our whole trip 
475636146,Thank you for hosting me  my stay was amazing  The place was comfortable and located close to a lot of places I needed to visit    The layout of the stay and amenities made it feel like home  I really enjoyed my stay and I appreciate that you guys were so responsive    My only issue was the carpet wasn t really clean but other than that  I had an amazing stay  Carpet wasn t      clean 
273582956,The location of the home was amazing  The amenities were a good touch    lotion  shampoo  conditioner  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  Additional comments   Carpet needed vacuumed   
476121711,Thank you for being a great host  You and your time were very timely in your communication  The bathroom was very clean although needs a little repair around the tub  I appreciated the Netflix  Thanks a lot  I look forward to returning  As a private message to you about the bed that was not changed  Multiples hairs  dirt marks and a small blood splotch on the Duvet cover 
473408485,The floor was a bit grimy so I just wore my flip flops around but they do provide a vacuum and mop if you wanted to go over it quickly yourself  Overall very clean though and hardly any dust on the surfaces 
331809140,There were random hairs on the sheets 
471476339,Some kind of communication with the cleaning service is much needed  Dried on food on dishes  black hairs on towels  dish towel  and in the sheets on the bed 
261490547,Thank you Chris  This apartment helped make our stay incredibly enjoyable  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  Additional comments   The carpet had not been vacuumed  When I notified Chris he responded immediately    
199324227,Chris  we enjoyed our stay  The only note we have is that the carpet in the bedroom was a bit sticky  Thanks again    Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
259817789,Thanks again for everything Chris   Silverware 
577699916,Thank you so much  We enjoyed the apartment  Was a nice place to rest on our journey west  Wasn t expecting renovation construction in the apartment complex  Was a bit like a maze to find the room
258816971,Thanks for the stay  place was great  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust 
257534049,I throughouly enjoyed my stay here  Chris was very informative  and responded quickly to my request  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower 
255816199,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  unsanitary shower or tub 
253460863,Many excellent features  but the windows need serious repair because we could not close many of them and had to endure winds and rattling blinds the last evening  The apt  lock should have been fixed prior to our arrival  We liked that the objects we requested were there for us to use  We liked how big and modern the kitchen was  You do need a large  sharp chefs knife in the kitchen  Great laundry facilities and excellent TV and Netflix access   Some blinds on the windows were dirty  
248057768,Thanks so much Chris  Your place was great   the shower wasnt super clean  but it was ok   
247483276,Really liked the look of the place  only bad thing like I mentioned is the bathroom leak of dark water coming from floor above  Other than that everything was good thank you   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower  Additional comments   There was a leak coming from floor above  leaving a dirty spot on the window tile dripping to the showers floor   
247442993,The hot water in the shower wasnt working and I didnt tell you while I was there because I didnt mind the cold shower  But just wanted to let you know that  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  floors and carpet 
197076742,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  toilet 
244427909,It was good for what we needed but it included absolutely no amenities or extra touches  Very basic  Water pressure is low and extremely annoying  No bath stopper   Cheeto on the floor  
197725132,Only reason for the  stars on cleanliness was that the floors where dusty with hairs  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
239392617,Hi Chris  thanks for the stay at your apartment  The experience was mostly good  however when I arrived I found the toilet seat to be unclean which was a bit disappointing  Id also recommend changing the shower curtain as its looking pretty stained  It would be a cheap thing to replace and would greatly improve the visible cleanliness of the bathroom   Overall I enjoyed my stay and appreciated the kitchen amenities as well as the TV with Netflix  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  unsanitary toilet  unsanitary shower or tub 
619716563,Overall  we enjoyed your place  I would recommend getting better cleaning crew  or lower the cleaning fee  Also  there wasn t any bowls  which was something we found ourselves needing  I would also recommend buying a cooking sheet or two  since you do have an oven  Floors
526126784,Thanks for being a great host  Some of the white towels had a stain that is hard to see but if put in the light you could see it
232615128,Excellent place  and perfect for my visit  Chris  Aside from the toilet seat  only other thing would be nice to have some coffee for the coffee maker  Otherwise everything was seamless   Toilet seat had some residue on it  needed to reclean myself   
508306823,Our stay at Zencity   on N  Rockwell was comfortable   but we found the front foyer to the building was not very clean or welcoming   Also  not sure what the constant smell of air freshener was due to   but I found it bothersome as I am sensitive to perfumes  Otherwise  all was fine  Entrancehallway to building was not very clean or welcoming 
506553225,The bath tub was clogged  so water would accumulate during shower  The bath curtain was dirty  Also you should do something about key n    it takes about  min each time to open the door playing with the lock  The rest was fine  
228395067,Thank you for a great stay  The place had great views and we actually enjoyed the trains passing at night  we like to sleep with noise  Felt like home  Would suggest getting the place cleaner though  the shelves below the tv stand are very dusty  the floors aren t mopped    etc  Grew up with a housekeeper Mom    that type of mess really stands out  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower or tub  kitchen  dust  floors and carpet  Additional comments   Isn t thoroughly cleaned  floors hadn t been mopped nor vacuumed  dusty tv stand   the kitchen and bathroom were messy but once communicated it was cleaned   
700017332,Overall  disappointed with our stay and service  Will be avoiding any future stays under the name or entity with  Zen  in it   In general  the apartment did not feel clean 
486519160,Many thanks for being a great host and offering your superb property  We had a great time with lots of memories for a life time   Great property  outstanding location  well set up process  Would recommend  A  Better quality bed mattress and pillows B  Air conditioning the bedroom C  Local tips guidebook for dining  sights to see  public transport  etc  D  Some arrangements for quarters for laundry  this is something the building has to enable   We will happily come back to Del Prado and Zen City  Given long stay  a couple of housekeeping passes thru the flat will have helped  In fact  I wrote to you seeking this but never got a response
713813324,The unit could be so gorgeous with better upkeep  Arrived late after a   hr drive   still needed to clean for   hours  washing all linens  disinfecting surfaces  before I felt comfortable sleeping there 
476211906,Cleaning crews didn t finish until     hours after check in 
470805257,Hi Chris  we appreciate your prompt responses   three extra pillows  and though we would not call anything truly  bad    We found your place was not as welcoming as other apartments we stayed at in other States  Europe   Asia   It lacks the basic necessities like tissues paper  aluminum foil  saran wrap  foot towel  coffee   tea   Your tea kettle is broken   We couldn t make hot water for our tea    The foot rug in the bathroom didn t look clean so we didn t want to dry our feet on it   We loved your foam mattress so much that we ll buy two for our home   Thank you Bathroom floor  shower curtain  soap dish   rug
459563371,The place is super nice  Thanks for everything  One of the wine glasses had lipstick stains on it  It was like the glass hadn t been washed completely  just rinsed 
215411122,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower or tub 
458977996,Great stay   very easy check in  lovely decor  very comfortable  and such a perfect central location   Could use a look under the sink 
212981945,Thanks for being responsive  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  Additional comments   The dishes weren t clean  
210127222,Hi Chris  the place was pretty much as described and served us well  I reviewed it as we found it  However  I must say  I was a bit put off by the request for a   star review as this really distorts the information that is given to other renters  like me    Oh  and the purchasing of movies somehow does not work  Netflix as well as Amazon requested a password for the purchase of movies  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower or tub  Additional comments   Overall it was quite clean but the bathroom did have quite a bit of hair and dust   
436704058,We appreciate the stay  Our place was a smidge dirty with hairs in the bed and random crumbs  I am understanding  Some crumbs and hairs randomly through the place 
437547931,It seemed as if the cleaning process was interrupted  and the bathroom was overlooked    The rest of the place was perfect   the bathroom had hair on the floor and in the tub  the bathmat was still wet from previous guest 
718412240,I think curtains will be a very good touch because as it is theres no privacy  ceiling fans were dusty
428725921,Thanks for the quick responses on our issues  The space was really nice and comfortable   We were really unhappy on our first morning  especially with all of the warnings about noise levels  decibel readers  and quiet hours only to find that our upstairs neighbors clearly had an after bar party from           AM   I don t want to leave a bad review  because most of the experience was good  but the noise and the bathroom situation was less than ideal   Just honest feedback  Thanks for letting us stay  As I had mentioned  the cloudy  standing water in the clogged shower was really gross and off putting  It led me to believe that the shower floor had not been cleaned between guests  The toilet seat was really loose and wobbly  like  extremely    so my husband tightened that and plunged the shower drain  which was quite gross 
423268855,Hair in bathtub  living area had not been swept or vacuumed  dirty dishes left in dishwasher
422933587,Thanks Chris for a wonderful stay  Everything went smoothly  This is an excellent location  a cool suite  all at a great rate  Bedroom  The grey throw and pillows on the bed are worn  dingy  and dirty long  I suspect they were clean but may have just passed their utility and need to be replaced  It is the first thing a guest sees when entering the bedroom and gave me pause  I immediately pulled back the comforter to check the sheets  which were crisp  clean and smelled wonderful  Get rid of or update the throw and pillows for a better first impression  Kitchen  The top of the fridge needs to be cleaned  It is a compact fridge with the top being visible and there is a thick layer of dust on it  Again  a bad first impression  The rest of the kitchen was clean and up to par 
419225643,This was a very nice space to stay in  a great size and it was well put together  I enjoyed the stay and the nice area  thank you for allowing us your space for the weekend  Nothing major just finger prints on walls and crushed chocolate like pieces in the bedroom and livingroom
402767943,Thank you again so much  The place was beautiful and your instructions made it so easy to get into the building  We enjoyed our stay  Everything was immaculate  the only thing we noticed was the comforter smelled a bit like body odor and could use a wash 
403254375,the floor was not clean enough  you dont want to walk on your bare feet
722554150,Thanks for responding to me about the keys when I thought I lost them  Carpet was dirty  I can tell it hasn t been deep cleaned in awhile 
369158447,The tub was a little dirty but I easily found cleaning supplies and handled it
368657055,Great place  thank you for hosting us  My only suggestion would be to point out where heating can be adjusted  We looked around when it got cold  but found it after a few minutes  The bathroom itself was spotless  it s just one of the towels had a spot on it so I just used one of the extras provided 
366522412,I really did love your place and would maybe stay again  but the way the cleaning situation was handled was really poor  We wanted to ask for a refund of some sort due to your phone service and lost key but your cleaning woman was so nice we did not  We came into the apartment trashed  It had been overlooked  When I called Zencity to ask if it could be cleaned  they were very rude and asked if it was  urgent   The cleaning staff was very nice though when they arrived  but I felt uncomfortable the entire stay knowing the place really wasn t that clean 
362589600,Thanks for hosting us   The linen was just badly stained and there was no dish liquid soap to clean dishes especially for those who don t use dish washers  I did use it but the dishwasher still didn t clean dishes well even after pre wash 
361834049,thank you again this was a great place you gotta sweep  theres hair and stuff  and now my hair too  im a blonde and i shed  but someone with black hair and red hair have already shed      but this place was a really great place  it was so homey feeling  very calming
361770325,Tub was completely filthy    dirt and hairs throughout the tub  Shower curtain was stained with dirt as well  Hairs throughout the tub  bathroom floor and hairs on the bedroom sheets  Large bug on the wall as soon as we entered the unit 
359353575,This was a really nice stay  Your directions for checking in were very helpful and clear  The apartment was very nice  Which was surprising in the old building  We had everything we needed  Everything was overall very clean  However  there was a very long hair in the toilet 
354411213,Hi  thank you very much  We liked your place very much  but the fridge wasn t cleaned inside and we had some problems with the heating system  as when the lower floor was warm  the upper rooms were way to hot  Would be good to get some kind of instruction  But nevertheless we totally enjoyed our stay in Chicago and at your place   Thank you very much Fridge wasn t completely clean and not all rooms were vacuumed
354117105,The only real issue I had was there was only one kitchen towel  Some of the kitchen utensils were dirty
347060498,Thanks again Chris  and I hope youll have something available next time Im in Chicago    Lizzy  Elizabeth Gray  Really not bad    stars is good  right  The closets and corners of the floor were a bit dusty  probably just got missed by the vacuum 
345944057,Chris   Thank you again for your kindness and help with this Studio Hype Park location   It was just what I needed to get proper rest and meet all of my engagements   I am just upset that I didn t find out about Zencity and the properties that you utilize to assist someone like myself that has been town  There was a minor issue with the bathroom tub clogging up and causing the shower to build up with water    I address the issue with Chris and she had the maintenance guy to come over the following day so that he could drain the tub s drainage   I also cleaned up some the areas of the tub that had some hair and dust around the top of the tub   It wasn t major just some areas that I noticed that needed to be cleaned   I went ahead and cleaned it up and found a glob of hair in the shower s drain   Which was part of the reasoning of the tub s slow drainage   I would highly recommend purchasing a cover for the bathtub s drainage system  i e  Danco Perfect Match Tub Hair Catcher      This way it catch any excessive amounts of hair   Plus help in cutting down your cleaning time 
708330811,When I first arrived  the room had not been cleaned  There was scum and leftover waste in the toilet  The sheets had not been changed  Towels from the past person were still hanging and the floor had not been cleaned 
343502935,N A
341688593,Moldy bread left in the kitchen cabinet made the whole unit smell like trash 
329733508,Thank you for the nice stay   the view was amazing  I d appreciate a tea kettle  it s pure luck that the lamp that fell down didn t  hurt anybody  Other than these issues I already told you about  everything was great  As I said  when we arrived there was expired  a month ago  food in the fridge and the floors were definitely dirty  Ilafter I told you about it  it seemed that the floors were being cleaned almost every day of our stay  Thank you for that 
326616781,Whomever is doing your cleaning at this location is not doing a great job  Otherwise the space was lovely and just what we needed  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  shower  bugs  floors and carpet  Additional comments   There was a thick layer of dust on all the light fixtures  the fire extinguisher  and the windows  The hardwood floor in the kitchen was gritty   There were two large bugs in the shower  Also  the tub looked discolored  which made it look dirty   
328564636,The dishes kind of smelled bad but I figured it because they sit there  But everything was perfect definitely staying there again when I go back  
716091965,Thank you for having us It was a small hair ball of hair stuck to the inside of the bathroom sliding thing
463114818,dirt on bed
462938926,Thank you for the effort you put into our stay  We really appreciated the detailed instructions for check in  the spacious layout  and a comfortable bed    We had a few issues that Ive mentioned elsewhere  that made our stay a bit below a    experience for the price  we do appreciate that it was an extra pricey weekend everywhere due to the conference   I did want to mention that considering you have lockbox entry  I felt a bit stressed having to advise exactly when wed be checking in  on top of fairly rigid timing in the first place  plus then you didnt respond back once I tried to offer multiple best answers possible  With no context response  I couldnt tell if there was an issue  or if this was just a gentle inquiry  On the whole  our experience was solid and our public review will reflect that    Best wishes   leilah While most of the space was clean  there were several stains on the couch that were pretty unappealing   and empty and non functional handsoap in both bathrooms 
164256584,Hey  Great location  My only recommendation is more lighting in the bedroom and bedroom closet and the renters visits  Im glad they werent too frequent  Overall our stay was enjoyable and I would recommend again  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  dust  bathroom 
163391419,Thanks so much  We appreciate the stay  The location was wonderful and we had a great time  My one piece of advice for future guests is just maybe to freshen up a little just before guests come  The apartment seemed clean overall  just a little musty dusty when we first arrived  It seemed as though people hadnt been there in awhile if that makes sense  Overall we were satisfied with our first AirBnB experience  Thanks so much again   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust 
161867529,Hi Chris  The location was perfect  You probably need to attend to the AC in the br across from the entrance  it isnt cooling  We had a few very hot nights   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  dust 
153747064,We enjoyed the convenient location of the space and it was enough for what we needed it for  but the shower pressure was almost non existent  Also I couldnt get any hot water  so I was forced to shower at my friends apartment  Had I not known people in the city  this would have been a big problem for me  May want to have someone take a look at it  Thank you for the smooth check in and check out  just fix the water and it will be great   Found a used tissue in the window ledge  
153222428,Cubs   Had so much fun at Wrigley  drank through the rain delay yesterday   Sorry they lost  though       Streeters tavern peeps are very nice   Your place made a great time easy  thank you   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens 
607331031,Have stayed with you all before  and like you guys  Consider this stay a one off as it was a bit subpar with thermostat issues and used washcloth  but will explore staying with you all again on my next trip to kc  Used washcloth in shower
148290528,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  bathroom 
607374103,This was an amazing stay  thank you so much  The sheets in the bedroom did have a stain on them  but otherwise great 
604838000,Already left feedback  A great stay  Be sure to dust wall trims and ceiling fans  And scrub the bathtub  The ceiling fan needed dusting  Closet smelled funky due to mop  Vacuum cleaner was weak and the floor wasn t swept clean  Bathtub head rest area smelled funky 
562915657,Many thanks for your speedy responses  Dusty Area rug not well vacuumed
569750748,Thank you for the stay  In this private note  I just wanted to let you know that after maintenance came in a couple of times  the floor of the kitchen was dirty  dust and wood chips were on the ground and few boot footprints  not muddy   Wasnt a huge deal  so I didnt message about it at the time  but thought you should know  Maintenance and construction came in a few times and left some dust and footprints in the floor of the kitchen entrance
713311190,Hi There  this was an excellent stay  Ill be back for sure  Laundry Room   great deal of dryer lint that need deep cleaned at base of units and behind 
611372776,I didnt expect a refund for the bathroom issues but it would have been nice to offer something in its stead There was hair all over the shower and the toliet was slow to drain and got backed up
564336702,Might want to fix the front door handle    quite loose   The dishwasher almost didnt work   Would have washed dishes by hand  instead of trying to use the dishwasher but no towels to dry with   Nothing a huge deal   All fine but not great  Kitchen garbage was totally full with some nasty stuff    obviously missed by the cleaning crew from the previous guests   Hairs of numerous kinds in bathroom   I used to clean homes in a previous life  so Im picky about such things 
563968344,Thank you for the excellent communication with troubleshooting the wifi which wasnt working when I arrived  The cleaners werent very thorough with the bathroom  There were hairs in the sink and shower and a left over partially used shower gel container  The stovetop in the kitchen had caked on residue that wasnt wiped clean 
550947059,The key pad is a great feature but needs the ability to lock on command as one leaves the apartment  Getting in is just fine but I found myself spending upwards of       seconds trying to lock it back  It s kind of hit or miss  Could be a better way Not much of an issue  Just the dish washer and some hair in the bathroom  Mostly great  just something to lookout for
526211512,Thanks for the heads up on what the previous tenants issues  Definitely helped provide context  The front condo got super hot in the day  and the back condo in the night  There were marks on the walls throughout the space and the base boards throughout were dirty 
707827196,Long black hairs  kitchen counter  bathroom floor  shower stall
588532228,Thank you for allowing us to stay in your apartment  The apartment itself was amazing  and the location was perfect  but we did find it to be a bit spartan as far as furnishings  comfort and decor  We would have loved to have a couch that was comfortable enough to actually sit and watch TV  and maybe another comfy place to sit in the window in the next room  instead of a room devoted entirely to a record player that doesnt work and doesnt even have speakers attached to it  A few more  and larger  wall hangings and pops of color would help the place to feel less sterile  But the location was perfect  and the price was very reasonable  We were thankful to have this as a home base from which to explore the city with our family  Thank you again for hosting us  especially at the last minute  Some hairs in the beds  in and between the sheets  hair in the shower  a laundry basket with dirty towels in one bedroom
576895601,Carpeting was poorly vacuumed
579842252,The place was great  our favourite part about our stay was the staff at the front desk  WE LOVED THEM  The bathroom shower curtains were moldy  floors were dusty  hair all over washroom  the living room floors were dusty and the bedroom blankets  sheets and pillows were covered in stains 
570988769,Hey guys  there seems to be an issue with the shower and tub that seems to have been reported by an earlier user as well  The shower barely has any water pressure  some previous guest had mentioned this in the reviews  and the tub doesnt drain  The second thing was the bed sheets had stains on them and there was a hair stuck on the photo frame above the bed  With that said  the place itself is well laid out and the location is great  Overall we were fine for the short stay but fixing the shower and bedsheets issue would go a long way for future guests  Bed sheets had stains  Bathroom tub didnt drain and the shower water pressure was barely functional 
570533719,Looked good  neat  floor and counters were not really dirty but not clean either 
570525186,We weren t sure where to dispose of our trash  so left our trash bags in the  kitchen I hope that s okay   Thanks for the hospitality   There were no trash bags provided  so used our bags from Whole Foods and did not know where to dispose of our trash
619229974,It was a lovely place  Thank you for having us on such short notice There was quite a but off dirt and hair in odd places  including the sheets and showers 
187819364, Prior guest had sandals and sweatpants left behind   
613194893,Great place  The shower curtain in the second bath has mildew stains
607269622,We had a great stay   We would suggest you highlight the location has an exercise room   We would have brought clothes with us and used that had we known  A few crumbs on chairs when we arrived and floor
613111140,Shower floor was dirty
606654075,just was dusty
719130126,Trash cans were not emptied 
604814725,I loved the space and the thoughtful touches such as the books and French press coffee setup   I had wished to have been forewarned that some of the space was under light construction   Considering the price it s forgivable though   I also would ve liked to have known it was a ground level space  did I miss that in the description    I found objects from past guests  namely a hair tie and a hair clip in the living room    Also  I noticed a lot of debris on both the living room floors and the bathroom floor 
607288290,Ensure to respond to messages  Pillows smelled a little bit
605495137,Thanks again for a great place to stay  Other than a little trouble with the key fob on the side door one morning  and the little bit of dirty on the kitchen floor when we arrived  everything was great  We will definitely consider staying here again when we are back in town  We noticed that the kitchen floor was a little dirty when we arrived  The kitchen broom and dustpan quickly resolved the issue 
434780854,Thanks for a great stay  A slight issue with the dishwasher but nothing big 
614555424,Great place   Small touches were very nice   I didnt care for the surprise sound monitoring device and no trash bags in any of the trash cans   But that was not a big deal  Air conditioners and fixtures had significant dust buildup 
608871162,Space was very comfortable  I enjoyed my stay  I got pretty cold in the living room area due to only being able to raise the temperature to     With such large windows I was wishing to get it to at least        Bed was very comfortable and clean Shower floor was a bit dirty 
581366749,Thanks so much for a great stay  An idea that might be a nice touch for the next guests   a fan or white noise machine wouldve been great to help mitigate the construction noise from next door  We used an app but would have loved it if the place had either one of those things as an option for us  We noticed that the shower had somehow missed a cleaning from the last tenants  and the dishwasher had not been unpacked  Not the end of the world but good to run that by the person responsible for cleaning between guests 
722844636,Great stay experience  thank you  Pans and plates a little wet or not entirely clean
608045316,Beds dirty with hair and debris  Hall way up to unit smelled extremely terrible and was filthy  Unit smelled bad 
714554975,Cleaner showed up during our  pm check in to bleach the mildew mold in the shower  The entire unit was left smelling strongly of bleach for our first evening
713449899,I truly Enjoyed my stay then though I was suppose to stay until December  th But alternating didnt go through There was hair on the pillow cases and tables The dishes was dirty
711687580,enjoyed my stay  however  i feel like i should  refunded for cleaning service   Seeing the bedding was not clean  and  ghe tub had hair inside the shower th Bedding was not fresh  i contacted  company however  they responded late  Over all the bed was comfortable 
722602303,hello when i was about to cook i noticed that there was a dirty towel hanging from the stove like somebody used it to clean up then hung it back up  the toilet seat had brown stuff on it even when u lift the seat up    i clean for a living and the place was not cleaned properly     thanks when i went in the restroom the shower was not cleaned or the toilet i had to clean it before i used it     in the kitchen there was a dirty towel hanging from the stove
614546323,The view was amazing  I absolutely loved the downtown view  Shower wall grout lines
223674767,Brian  your place has great potential  but definitely some details to work out to match the level we are used to with AirBnb  For example  there is a ton of dirt under the sink in the front bathroom  It looks like construction dirt that is still there  There is no where at all to put your toiletries so that space is needed and it was pretty gross  Both bathrooms had a lot of hair and dust around the baseboards and the corners    We would highly recommend some boot racks  rugs  towels by the entrance  It was impossible to keep that area dry with nothing  Weather in Chicago will require those most of the year    More towels would also be really great  We had one large towel each and no personal hand towels or any washcloths    Last  just a reminder that the couch is broken  so we had barely anywhere to sit  We left the broken stool in the closest so no one would fall and get hurt  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  dust 
430491764,I did enjoy my stay there and appreciated the extra hospitality in returning my electronics  That was very kind  My notes on the kitchen are for improvements  One other thing that would have been great is if porch lights could have been left on since i made it clear I would be in later after dark  Was really hard to know which house was the right one and I had to call Slavik  who was asleep on the other side of the earth  LOL  Overall I would recommend to others  the house is really cute and has some nice features  Trash can swinging lid was quite dirty  refrigerator door handle dirty  coffee pot had old grounds and coffee in it  Kitchen floor also needed swept 
722825730,I appreciate being allowed to shorten my reservation however I don t think it s fair that a cleaning fee was charged to me due to the amount of sanitary issues I came across  I also had to use my own bug spray in the unit to make myself feel comfortable while there  We found a massive roach in our unit as well as mouse droppings in the bed
722399430,Id recommend adding some more cooking supplies and replacing the one medium sized pan because its difficult it cook with  The walls were a bit dirty as well not sure why  Communication was good between us however and the Thai restaurant was very good thank you for the recommendation  Not enough adequate cooking supplies to make food easily 
619173463,Smelly trashcan
719420415,thank you for hospitality  my stay was okay but I was very disappointed with the cleanliness of the apartment   the couch has many stains and crumps on it  the curtains were filthy and are in desperate need of a wash or new ones all together  the walls have stains and cracks everywhere  just because you plastered over a crack doesnt mean you shouldnt pain over it to match the rest of the wall  doing that made the apartment look old and unattractive  the whole apartment needs a deep cleaning and fresh paint  The couch in the living room had so many stains on it I didnt want to sit on it  when one of the cushions fell off there were crumps under the cushions  the curtain in both the living room and bedroom were dirty  you can they havent been cleaned in a long time  all the walls had cracks and dirt spots all over them  they could use a good wipe down 
715881334,Love the place  Love the price  The bathtub and wall opposite the shower head had streaks  It looked like cleaning product  but still  The kitchen had some small flecks of food on the counter and the strainer had some gunk collected in it 
719203323,I would suggest making sure the place is ready for the next guest so they won t go through the drama and filth I went through especially during COVID  For the amount of money spent to stay there and the time wasted on getting the place cleaned  obviously in a hurry since things were still left unclean  was not worth the money  Will not be staying here again  Place was not cleaned by time my check in  Was ready by     pm 
722418099,Thank you for this cute little space  Loved it  Aside from the strong odor of cigarette upon arrival it really was a great place to stay  Everything was very clean for the most part  A few spots on the couch  But the biggest thing was a strong smell of cigarette smoke when we first got in the room  We opened the windows and it went away eventually  The cleaning lady also left the dust pile on the floor but that was an easy fix 
719425392,Thank you for hosting us  We loved the apartment aside from the check in issue and the problem we had with the lock  once those things get fixed for future stays I think it d be perfect The comforters were damp wet still 
715751880,Thank you for the good communication and quick responses  I appreciate the stay There were a couple of things that needed cleaning on the floors and rugs from previous tenants animal droppings  but the host was quick in responding and taking care of the matter
