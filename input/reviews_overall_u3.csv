616427415,Our stay in this place was supposed to be a joyful one  We came for a few days to celebrate my daughters birthday  This place is very close to Barnes hospital which made it a perfect location to get together   It was very disappointing from the beginning  The bathroom was not cleaned and full of hair from the previous guest  A set of dirty linens was thrown in the closet if bedroom number one and in bedroom number   the linens were full of hairs  The companys response was slow and unapologetic and they did nothing to remediate the situation  We had to buy our own sheets  The next day they came to clean but  in spite of our request  they did not leave toilet paper  Avoid this place at all cost  The WiFi was not working  The username and password was incorrect The host kept avoiding the issue of dirty linens and bathroom  They insisted that we make the bed with a non existing spare set of linens  Actually there were dirty linens crumpled up in the closet  A clean space and a more responsive host  We will never again stay with this company 
617317015,Stay away  These places are not clean like they are said to be  I have videos and photos on my phone of how nasty the rooms were  I had   different rooms  Also  my wallet and license and ID along with   bank cards of mine were stolen from my room  I was the only one I my room besides Zencitys house maid  I spoke with Marty who is   of the owners of the apartment and he had a total attitude and did NOTHING about my things  He was suppose to call me back but after waiting for his call for almost a week I decided to call him back just for him to not even remember who I was  That showed right there that he didnt give a damN about my items missing from my room with only his personnel having access to my room    Makes me wonder if they go around scamming   frauding people  I will never stay in ZenCity properties again  I will also tell my friends   family to avoid them as well  So much  too frustrated to write  Today is Friday  I have literally been waiting on a call back from Zencity since Monday March  TH  Ive made at least    calls to them and even spoketo someone named Marty who was suppose to call me back on Monday as well and I still have yet to hear from him  My wallet  license and ID stolen from the room yet I was there alone  The only person that had access was the cleascleancleaning lady or maid so she called herself  After my wallet was stolen from the room I left my ID in the room hidden since it was the only identification I had left   when I checked out of the room I accidentally left it in there  The same day I went to get it but the security at del prado werent allowed to let me in to get my ID so I called Zencity management and spoke to Marty  Owner Manager  letting him know the cleaning guy for the apt was right across the street cleaning another apt   if he could give him the okay to go in the unit I rented and he said NO  After he asked me exactly where I left my ID and he said no theres nothing he can do     I believe he could be using my information   committing fraud  I just dont understand why he wouldnt let the cleaner in so I could get my stuff  I will NEVER stay in any ZenCity properties again  I will also let my friends and family know to NEVER stay in them as well  I also took videos with my phone on how filthy the place was and I had   different rooms  They both were dirty  The location was fiNe  A clean apartment and honestly a few more things Im just to frustrated to write about right now

706740163,The location was good but is it worth the hassle   The keypad info was wrong and there was no fob in the room for access to the apartment and parking garage   I had to find a place to park my car for the night because there was not a fob to get into the parking garage   Even after contacting the host  no fob  The keypad info was wrong and there was no fob   I had to find a place to park my car for the night because there was not a fob to get into the parking garage 
424006464,The area was nice I had no problem with finding things to do but the host responded very slow or not at all  I had an emergency that I had to attend to at home so I was going to leave a day early but they refused to give me any money back  they also never responded to me when I asked them why I couldnt receive any money back being that I let her know the day before I was going to leave  I also messaged them letting them know I was leaving at about   and no one responded till    am the next day  I just feel like the communication should Have been a little better and I should have been told why I couldnt receive any money back but I didnt even get that 
623553552,The most generous review I can give is that there are safer  more secure neighborhoods just blocks away  with hosts that go out of their way to make sure you have everything that may need  not to mention thats listed    This is unfortunately  not one of them  and I would have to question any listing with this management team behind it  Three days without access to a bath towel is really unacceptable  And with everyone overdue a trim a hairdryer is almost as much  No big deal if I would have known  please dont list it if its not going to be there   My apologies for breaking the French press that was in the unit when I arrived  btw   French press is not a coffee maker especially to those that dont know how to use one  but youll find I did replace it with a better model at least its not missing parts allowing it to come apart and break  And if the Monarch was supposed to be a solution for coffee   those prices are higher than Starbucks and an insult to your guests and to the community when people are eating out of dumpsters right behind the building  I cant recommend this listing at any price  BTW  your cleaning team arent cleaning the drawers  desk drawers  or under the bed  And   gauze squares doesnt make a  st aid kit found that one the hard way when trying to clean the French press and  lose the white bedspread  its stained near the top  center under the pillows  you can see it when the light shines thru the uncurtained windows  I do thank you for adding the extra day  I did appreciate the gesture even when you charged me almost double for the convenienc   Good luck to you   There werent any parking meters near the building  but it is limited to   hr between  am and  pm M F but thats only IF you can find a spot to park parallel against the curb and good luck with that if you drive anything larger than a sub compact   Several different people communicated with me  only one introduced themselves  And I dont think they share notes with each other about issues or what exactly is going on  They really should update their listing to let guests know that they are building a large apartment building about   ft away from one of the exterior walls  This apartment was on the opposite of the construction and it woke me up every morning  Behind the apartment building is also a very large  boarded up  vacant building that seem to be a gathering place for the homeless at night  The police do come thru and clear it out at least once a night  I guess you get what you pay for   so be prepared to bring towels  a hair dryer  an extra blanket  coffee  a coffee maker  sugar  dishwashing tabs  a mattress pad   there arent even any curtains  Dont forget earplugs as the walls are very thin and your door is right next to the back exit to the stairwell  Those steel doors with the bar across the middle you compress to open like you might find in a school   and just as loud 
444920817,NA Hi Brian thanks for letting us stay at your house  The only suggestions I have is more blankets pillows towels  Other then that the house just was not very clean  Hope this helps you in the future 
589152967,Awful experience  inaccurate listing  Hosts were helpful with initial issues but once the issues grew  They went silent and were no longer helpful  Apartment was dirty  no trash bags  no actual coffee maker  dryer did not work  I would not trust Zen city with another trip of mine  You were quick to respond to any initial issues but once you were asked for a partial refund you went silent and no longer were so helpful   We initially had no trash bags in our unit at all to throw any of our garbage in  They didn u    t deliver any until the next day around noon  Coffee maker was a French press which we had no idea how to use ad said floor to ceiling windows but they were not  It did have a dryer but the dryer would not stay on for more than five minutes at a time before it turned off I had to keep on turning it back on to get our clothes dry  Also the Internet lagged and it made it difficult to stream anything on Netflix  I did reset the router but it didn u    t help   The address given on the Airbnb reservation was different than the one on the check in instructions which made it confusing  Also  The deadbolt would not lock so we had to rely on the handle only  The host responded to issues at first but once I requested a partial refund they asked me to send pictures so their cleaners could come by and clean everything up and I said it was unacceptable that it shouldve already been clean when we walked in  They stopped responding and never gave me any refund  There were a lot of bums that resided on the sidewalks around this hotel 
584025767,Not great  Skip this listing for now until they get their systems improved  First negative review Ive written over dozens of stays  Cigarette marijuana smoke really triggering our breathing at night  Check in was not smooth  Waited about an hour to get the key problem figured out  No shower supplies  The place is bare bones   a bed  a few glasses  and a tv  Awful refund policy since we had to cancel     back  Really negative stay  well choose a hotel next time   Listing said washer and dryer  none in this unit   Shower supplies  better check in  all around could be improved 
709154835,I had high hopes from the reviews  but this Airbnb didnt live up to expectations  We spent    minutes standing in the hallway trying to call Zencity because they gave us the incorrect door code  We had the same issue one other time where we spent    minutes waiting for their help because they had changed the door code without letting us know  Some of the pans in the kitchen were very dirty  and they only have salt and pepper for use which wouldve been nice to know we had to bring other basics like olive oil  Neither the heat or the AC would work at all  causing us to prop the balcony door open all night to keep proper air flow  I was disappointed and wouldnt stay here again  We spent    minutes in the hallway calling the host because the keypad wouldnt work  Same at check out 
621467578,Dont stay there  
428631482,The only thing I enjoyed about this property was the memory foam mattress  Other than that it was a total miss  Check in was very easy  And location was great for us  However  every night as we tried to fall asleep there was constitution sounds like hammering all throughout the night 
619710114,This place needed a deep clean  Kitchen utensils and appliances as well as cups and bowls had actual dirt and dust on them  Different layout than pictures   Completely different apt setup than anticipated  Pictures looked far better than actual space   furnishing and layout were different than advertised   Access to building was only available through key card  which we were not provided with or informed about  We got in by chance with another group  but wouldve been left out on the st if not because of the hosts unresponsiveness  Did not respond to messages  Better cleanliness and responsiveness from host 
611633882,Noise  The apartment itself  is quaint  check in is easy  location is good   except for the bar directly below  The music from the bar plays until   or   am every night without fail  and is unceasing  The situation needs to be dealt with  Its a bummer because without this major major drawback  this would be a nice place  Unless you plan on only sleeping from   am to    am every day  do not plan to stay here  You need to disclose the bar directly below the apartment as well as the noise  and add a white noise maker to help counter it   Apartment is located directly above a very loud bar  Description deliberately skirts this fact   See above  Situation is almost unlivable  Loud music at all hours  Not their fault  but their fault for not disclosing 
405211776,This host appears to be a property management company  If thats what youre looking for  then go for it  Otherwise  you might as well stay in a hotel  The hotel I and my father ended up having to book at   pm  due to the misrepresentation of sleeping arrangements in this apartment  was cheaper and had   queen beds and a large bathroom   This space was advertised to have sleeping space for     people  The real sleeping capacity is     people  if you share the bed  The  nd sleeping spot was advertised as a sofa bed but was just a broken couch  Not big enough for a grown adult   The host  Zencity  was unwilling to make up for their misrepresentation and did not refund  nor rehouse us for our stay in Chicago    Overall  the place was clean and quaint  The bathroom sink was updated but the bathroom itself was very small  The kitchen was nice and good enough for a short stay  If the sleeping arrangements would have been as stated  this would have been a nice space  However  false advertising and poor care by the host company  Zencity  left small margin for a good review   The photos project the place to be much bigger than reality   nThis apartment only sleeps a max of   ppl if they share the bed  The listing said      There was no sofa bed   With all of the fees and how small the bathroom is  it was cheaper and better quality to stay in a hotel 
590797389,Do not try to change your dates  Marty will say   No Problem  Then Marty will say   just cancel your reservation and i will rebook you for the dates needed  Then marty will tell you that RIGHT AFTER you cancelled someone swooped in and took your dates  Sooo sorry  BUT dont worry  i have an inferior room for the SAME price  You booked a   bedroom  well  this one has one bedroom  and it costs      for   nights on AirBnB   however   its going to cost you good folks      for   nights  the cost of   bedrooms  just because i know you are in a hospital having cancer surgery and its probably incredibly inconvenient to find other more suitable accomodations with so little time now  Sigh  Marty  you little enterpriser you  Double charging for inferior accomodations is bad business  But having people cancel and then taking advantage of them is just grotesque  You should be ashamed of yourself for double charging me for an inferior room  If you were a good person you would have charged me the proper amount  especially after you made a mistake by not taking care of my reservation like we discussed  Im dying so i no longer mince words  Karma is real  The next time you get taken advantage of  i hope you think of me  May you get everything you deserve in       Marty      That we would be able to change our dates with ease  After being double charged for an inferior room  nothing was easy   Host told us he could accomodate switching our dates  but he instead had us cancel our reservation  then waited until it was booked by someone else before offering us an inferior room with one bedroom for the same price he booked us two bedrooms  When we looked up the room it was half of what he charged us  We were double charged for an inferior room   As i was having cancer surgery at the University of Chicago nearby  we had to stay near the hospital a week after   My    year old mother slept on a couch  I dont understand how Zen City is allowed to operate with such shady business tactics  If the host had not swindled us by pretending he could accomodate a date change  that he let someone else book after asking us to cancel our reservation  then offering us a one bedroom       for   nights room  but charging us      like we were still getting our   bedrooms  DOUBLE CHARGING US FOR AN INFERIOR ROOM  How is this allowed to occur  We would not have cancelled our reservation or asked to change the dates had we known Marty at Zen City would do that  If i hadnt been attached to    cords in the hospital i would have found other accomodations  but after having my torso opened up  i had no strength to fight the power  Nothing zen about zen city  I feel taken advantage of in my time of need frankly  Marty should be ashamed  there are things you dont do to the dying  Ripping them off surely has to be one of the unspoken rules 
590069736,Interior was nice and spacious  However  this apartment is directly above a bar thats open and playing music until   am on weeknights and   am weekends  If you like to go to bed in the quite or early this place is not for you   Right above a bar with loud music  Great area in town  not great above the bar
571849973,My experience was not amazing  but I am sure that yours could be  My problems with this particular listing were with security  the smartlock did not have batteries in it when I arrived and therefore was useless   There were no batteries in the apartment  otherwise I would have just resolved the issue myself  So I messaged through the app  due to it being Thanksgiving night I figured that they wouldnt be able to come out that night to fix the lock  which I understood   there was a deadbolt and I was able to safely spend the night  I took my stuff with me to work the following day since I couldnt secure it in the apartment until after they fixed my lock that day  a minor inconvenience  not something that would ruin a trip  They came on Black Friday  put batteries in and I came back to a lock that was not responsive  I attempted several times to put in the code and it would not accept it  It even set off an alarm  causing it to lock me out for five minutes from the panel and then reset and accepted the passcode that I had put in the same way every time  I messaged them and let them know about the issue  I was able to get in and secure the lock  slept  woke up  went to work and was able to lock the door behind me with the keypad  Came back from work and it was a repeat of the night before  I checked out the next morning as planned and only then did they offer to talk to me about the problem with the keypad    Additionally  they were very upfront about the fact that the building itself was still under construction but assured me that the apartment was ready to go  This was kinda true  The lock was clearly not ready to go and additionally there was a wall mount for a television  but no television  and a lamp that sat on the kitchen counter but was meant to go somewhere else because it was not near an outlet and uplugged  just chilling  There was also a water bottle filled with used paint water from when they painted  Furthermore  there was a trashcan in the closet the night I checked in  but after they came to put batteries in the lock  the trashcan mysteriously disappeared  All of these things would have been minor inconveniences and not earned a poor review from me  I am a reasonable person  But as a cumulative experience it was not great  I am sure that once they are finished with the building  it will be a nice place to stay  The bed was comfortable  there were plenty of dishes and flatware to use and space to lounge  But it was not a finished product and should not have been listed as a place to stay until it was checked for completion  I truly hope that you read and understand the comments that I submitted  I can tell that the furnishings are nice and that once the building is done this will be something that I am sure a lot of people will enjoy  I understood when I agreed to stay that the  common areas  were under construction but perhaps a quality check run should have been made to the apartment to ensure that the issues I mentioned were resolved  Particularly the lock  Best of luck in your future endeavors   While they were upfront about the building being brand new and   common areas   under construction they said that the room itself was   ready to go    A reasonable traveler would assume that the amenities listed and certainly the lock would be ready to go for someone to stay safely in their location  This was not the case  The smart lock did not even have batteries in it when I checked in   I messaged them to let them know that I was able to just walk in to the apartment and they were not able to come out  it was late on a holiday   I understood   but this should not even have been an issue to begin with  Additionally there was a lamp on the kitchen counter that was clearly meant to be placed somewhere but instead was placed on the counter not plugged in  Furthermore  the television was not in the apartment   there was the mount for it   but the television itself was not there  I understood the building itself was under construction when I agreed to stay   I did not realize however that the apartment was not truly ready   The directions to where this unit G  was located were not very clear and I spent a good ten minutes walking back and forth across the downstairs to attempt to find the location of the apartment  When I got there I was pretty positive I had to be in the wrong location because the door was already opened and not locked at all  The lock would not work and upon further inspection did not even have batteries in it  There were no batteries for me to put in the lock   otherwise I would have just fixed this issue myself  I messaged to let them know that this was an issue  There was a deadbolt that I was able to use to securely lock myself in for the night  However  when I went to work the next day I had to pack everything back up because there was no way to lock the apartment when I left   even though I was staying for a longer visit  They came the next day and put batteries in the lock   when I got back from work the lock would not accept the very long code that they had set  I tried multiple times until a little alarm went off  Then after five  minutes of waiting it let me back in  I had messaged to say there was a problem but by the time they got back to me I was able to get the lockpad to finally accept the code that I had been punching in since the beginning  The next night I had the same issue when I was coming back from work with the keypad not accepting the code   blaring the alarm   then accepting the code  even though I had put in the exact same code each time  They didnt contact me until AFTER I was gone to talk to them about the experience that I had with the lock  Even though it was a multi day issue  I understand that my trip was over the holiday weekend  but as a nurse I cannot help that I have to work on the holidays or the day after and require a place to stay  A security issue like the lock not working should have elicited a little bit more of a response  Like I said previously I understand someone not coming out at   PM on Thanksgiving night  But the future issues with the lock not working could have been looked into in a more timely fashion  Due to all of the issues with the listing   the lock not working  the unfinished nature of the apartment  the lack of timely communication about a security issue like the lock  I would say that it was not a great experience  This place had some very nice finishes where it was complete and it is obvious that this will be a nice place to stay once it is completely finished  But if the room wasnt ready  which it clearly was not as evidenced by the water bottle full of paint water in the sink  the random lamp on the counter  and the lack of a television and the lock not even having batteries in it  it should not have been advertised for a visit  Furthermore  when they came to install batteries in the lock   I was surprised to discover that they took the trashcan from the closet where it was stored  It was there the evening before and then randomly disappeared  I was happy I had taken my personal belongings with me in the morning  I am not a particularly picky person but all of this together was just a bit much  While it may be a nice place to stay in the future  it would take quite a bit to convince me to stay again when there are many other options in the area that have had seamless and pleasant experiences 
618602674,Great place  bad neighbors  terrible host  Did not approve my change to reduce number of people staying which would have resulted in a refund  Zencity now refuses to honor this because the reservation has ended  During our stay  the permanent neighbors were very loud and the upstairs neighbors flooded their toilet which resulted in poo water literally raining from the ceiling  Zencity did not send someone to clean this up after we called to report the incident  In fact  they did not follow up at all after we reported it  The place was otherwise great  just under poor management  Overall happy with the space but very unhappy with the lack of communication on the part of your company  I am owed       for having only   people in the apartment and I will be reaching out to Airbnb about this and how the maintenance issue was handled  I requested the number of people on my reservation be changed as we had people back out  The change was never approved even though I messaged the host several times  before the stay and before the stay was over  I also messaged about safety and maintenance issues we dealt with during our stay and the host never responded 
586273846,There were a couple of issues with this listing that were purely cosmetic  a broken smoke detector that was never fixed though we reported it  blood stains and dirt on the comforter  and a severely clogged tub    But the dealbreaker was noise  Every morning other than Sunday and a Wednesday that fell on New Years Day during a week long stay  we were awakened by trash collection noises  dumpsters rolling over pavement  revving and beeping trucks  that began between      and      am and lasted between    minutes and an hour  This is because both sets of bedroom windows overlook the alley where trash collection  takes place  a fact not mentioned in the listing  In addition  the apartment is located directly above the buildings trash room  which dumpsters were rolled in and out of repeatedly  Though we reported this issue to the host and provided photo documentation of trash collection happening immediately below our bedroom window  they denied that trash collection was occurring     and suggested the problem was our  sensitivity to noise   Had there been mention of the alley and the trash noises in the listing  we would never have booked this Airbnb    In short  noisy  dark  and not super clean  Hosts denied the noise was a problem despite ample documentation and refused to give a partial refund for the disruption to our stay  Though the building and location are lovely  I would steer clear of this unit and perhaps ZenCity altogether  Your business model seems to be to fail to disclose crucial details about your listing  noise  and then deny there is a problem when guests complain  The reason I didnt respond to requests for further clarification about the other stuff  smoke detector  gross menstrual blood stains on a comforter  is that it was relatively nbd  but together with being awakened by truck beeping and dumpster rolling     days of our vacation  it made for a pretty shitty experience  Rest assured I will be escalating this to Airbnb and letting my many local friends  Im a native Hyde Parker  know never to rent from ZenCity   Every morning other than Sunday and a Wednesday that fell on New Year u    s day during a nearly week long stay  we were awakened by trash collection noises  dumpsters rolling over pavement  revving and beeping trucks  that began between      and      am and lasted between    minutes and an hour  This is because both sets of bedroom windows overlook the alley where trash collection  takes place u     a fact not mentioned in the listing  In addition  the apartment is located directly over the building trash space  which dumpsters were rolled in and out of repeatedly  Though we reported this to the host and provided photo documentation of trash collection happening immediately below our bedroom window  they denied that trash collection was occurring     and suggested the problem was our  u   csensitivity to noise  u   d Had there been mention of the alley and the trash noises in the listing  I would never have booked this Airbnb   In addition to the gross conditions in the bedroom and bathroom   which we might have ignored if not for the horrible morning noise   we reported a chirping smoke detector upon our arrival and were told a work order to fix it was submitted  However  the smoke detector remained dismantled and nonfunctional throughout our week long stay  Noisy  dark  and not super clean  Hosts denied the noise was a problem despite ample documentation and refused to give a partial refund for the disruption to our stay  Though the building and location are lovely  I would steer clear of this unit and perhaps ZenCity altogether 
577531086,Ive never had a problem with Airbnb before and Im sure this was a miscommunication that can be easily fixed  We were unable to get into the place  The instructions were clear and we followed them   they just didnt work  The key from the lockbox did not open the door of the house with the correct address  Not sure why  We tried multiple times and tried to get in touch with the host but it was late and cold so we never got to use the place  The pictures look great and Im sue it wouldve been a great stay if we were able to get in  Hey there  Im not sure what happened  Ive been using Airbnb since      and have never had an issue  Im sure this was a miscommunication but we were not able to get into the airbnb  We tried several times  We were able to retrieve the key from the lockbox but it was not opening  It was the right building as well  It was freezing so after    minutes of trying we gave up and went to my apartment  It was a bummer  Wish I couldve gotten in touch with you because the place looked great from the photos  Hope it can get fixed for the next person   We were unable to open and get into the accommodation   We were not able to get into the location 
563978116,WARNING  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL   Misleading description of this accommodation  This accommodation is above a pub and unbearable loud music is played till      am  We tried to sleep as we had long business days ahead of us  but the music was so loud that the floor was vibrating from the speakers and was impossible to relax or sleep   It was clear for us  we cannot stay in this apartment and be fully functional for our next business day s  Half an hour after we tried to go in the bed  around   pm  we booked another hotel  and left the apartment with our entire luggage  The other reasons we decided to leave this place was the cleanliness of the apartment   so unacceptable   the mid frame of the split window next to the oven was with a greasy black layer and full of black sponge pieces  looks like dead flies laying on it  I tried to sit on the coach before to go to the bed and watch TV  but it is an old piece of furniture  looks like collected from the street with unpleasant smell and broken springs  I could not sit more than   min before I felt the hurting pain on my bones from the broken springs  The ventilation fan on the ceiling  greasy and dirty as well  additionally was generating loud noises like tractor  which I stopped with the hope that it will reduce the noise in the apartment  The  nd bedroom door was with penetrated hole  THE BREATHING AIR IN THE APARTMENT WAS HEAVY AND STALE  I lost        CAD thanks to the hosts misleading information and in spite of proving them wrong  the host refuse to reimburse me at all  Here is the misleading description at the time of our booking that the hose word it like that     The home is just a short walk from the park and the lake and stones throw from number of bars  restaurants and entertainment venues    This   stones throw  is not the same as above the bar in one wooden ceiling distance  A child can even throw a stone at least    yards  Ironically at the time of our booking  the House rules    says   Quiet time after   pm  Please read it twice before you get burned as we did with this booking and Zencitys management company   Misleading description  nIt says       stone u    s throw from number of bars        BUT does not say that is above a bar and loud music run till     am  nIronically a rule of house    is    Quiet time after   pm   when the floor is vibrating from the pubs music underneath   The host nether responded to our request for additional person  The host did not admit the misleading and slippery description of the apartment  hide the information of loud music every night till      am and refused to reimburse me with         CAD for refusing to stay in their accommodation  Unlisted from AirBnB and save other people money and the frustration we had to go through 
561429598,Not a good stay  We have used Air BnB frequently in the past   months  and had a really disappointing experience here  The space had glowing reviews for being clean  which we did not find to be the case  The building was shabby and had a very unpleasant smell  The heat was locked at     so we couldnt get the room to cool down making it impossible to sleep through the night  We also could not get the hot water to work  We left for a hotel after one evening   We didn u    t feel the photos accurately represented the space   The area surrounding was great but the building was not cracked up to what the description painted it to be  We paid far too much for such an unpleasant experience  We only stayed one night and ended up moving to a hotel because we were so uncomfortable in the space  Lost about      for a one night stay that was supposed to be a fun  relaxing getaway weekend 
536360294,If youre looking for a place thats cheap and not have high expectations then sure this is the place for it  wasnt happy with the place considering the water was shut off in the middle of my stay   Uncleaned bathroom and Im not even sure if the sheets were even switched from previous occupancy   did contact the manager about the situation and supposedly will get some credit which we will see    Should have known that something was not right with the bathroom when they had the shower covered  Well Im the middle of my stay the water was turned off and couldnt take a shower    This place needs some updating to be done   especially the bathroom   At one point I had no water in the shower  
656766909,I was not able to access the apartment from the front door because the key did not fit properly and the lock was loose  I then proceeded to speak to Zen City customer service representative  Marty  who was very cold  callus  condescending  and rude on the line    I explained the situation about not being able to get into the apartment  then he replied that we must not have been turning the key properly which is quite a jerk move to assume that adults are not able to place the key in the hole properly  and  it is very a ableist assumption    He then suggested that we go back downstairs   which the listing does not say that you must go up three flights of stairs to access the apartment  also  not ADA compliant  to look for the back up key  alas  there was no back up key when we went back to the lockboxes   As we  my friend and I  explained to Marty that there wasnt any back up key in any of the lockbox that he suggested  he accusatorially asked if we were sure that there were no key in the lockbox  He was extremely frustrating to work with     He finally suggest that we go to the back of the building to access the apartment  We couldnt figure out to get to the back of the apartment  So  while on the phone with Marty  we asked how to access the back of the apartment  in a very annoyed voice  he condescendingly told us that hes trying to help us and we need to listen to him    He explained that we needed to go through the common area of the building through the alley to access the back of the building  this is an alarming safety issue  walk up six     flight of stairs and didnt specify which back door to access  we tried the key for all of the four back doors and we were finally able to get in    Once  inside  I had asked Marty if we could get accommodated for another Airbnb that would be on another floor or another apartment  he stated  No   Then  I inquired why and he explicated thats they were fully booked  which was not true because we did not see anyone else in the building that we were in except for apartment  A  he was able to accommodate us  but refused    He then asked us for video evidence of us not getting into the apartment  we felt that he was being callus because we explicitly explained that we could not get into the front door due to the lock being not sturdy  He made us feel as if we were liars and that we were exaggerating on getting into the front door of apartment  A   Once  we were inside from the back door  we could NOT exit from the front door  a major SAFETY ISSUE just in case of a fire or other issues that could be unforeseeable   We highlighted to Marty that we could not exit the front door either  He then asked us again to send video proof of us not being able to exit the apartment  we took the video as well because we felt like he was accusing us of lying about not exiting the front door as well    It was extremely disheartening because we paid for the apartment in full and expected to have a great experience as well as good customer service without micro aggression  condescending behavior  and callus communication from the customer service representative  Marty    Moreover  the toilet was broken  but due to our very hostile conversation with Marty  the representative of Zen City  we decided that we would tell onsite maintenance staff   who were a supreme JOY  about the toilet not being functional    We were not compensated with a partial credit  we were not offered another place to accommodate us  nor did our initial concerns were rectified by Zen City    Zen City was very satisfied with taking our money and not doing anything to fix our safety concerns    Also  the apartment is extremely hot in the bedrooms  I had to purchase my own fan to not be sleeping in sweat for the days that we were there    Overall  I would suggest another apartment that is not  A with Zen City or go completely somewhere else that would have better customer service    The bright side  the maintenance crew  They were GREAT  I was not able to access the apartment from the front door because the key did not fit properly and the lock was loose  I then proceeded to

534525784,The location is AMAZING and the space is great but our group of   found ourselves with no running water after a full day of working out and hours of walking around the city  We reached out to the host via call   times and messaged for help  We couldnt shower  drink water  or use the bathroom  We learned from neighbors that this is common for the building but had been especially bad the past month  We understand building issues are out of the hosts hands but there was never a response to the messages left  I followed up again on the Monday after the weekend trip explaining further and asking for a partial refund discount and still no response  You have a great location but communication was significantly lacking when it was needed most  I wanted to leave a good review but still didnt receive responses to my messages   Recommendations on parking  A heads up that it was on the  rd floor with no elevator would have been helpful  We were unsure of level of checkout expectations  We weren u    t sure how much to clean up and where we could toss the trash  We cleaned up what we could with the supplies we could find   When arriving i messaged for recommendations on where to park with no response  On our second day the group went to work out  walk around for   hours on a tour  and went back to shower before heading out for the evening  Only to return and find there was no running water  We couldnt shower  use the bathroom  or drink water  We called the host   times and messaged for a request for a call back  We received no response  I messaged the next day asking for a partial refund and still no response  I learned from a neighbor that this was a common issue with the building and it was usually resolved within   min to a hour but had been especially bad this last month  It is understandable that the host doesnt own the building but communication on typical timeline of resolution  apology for inconvenience  partial refund  or at minimum an acknowledgment of communication is expected  Running water and communication from the host 
530419563,Check in was standard  The rooms themselves are nice  But the bathtub was absolutely disgusting  It was full of water  the drain was clogged  and there was dirt sediment on the floor of the tub  The WiFi didnt work  At all  Multiple devices couldnt detect it  All in all  not worth the price they charged  Clean your bathtub  thats unacceptable   The WiFi did not work at all  Having a clean bathtub and working WiFi would have been nice  It made the stay very inhospitable 
526344495,Hi  this is my first time giving a negative review on Airbnb     the listing said it has   queen beds and a sofa bed  after my complaint they change it   The sofa bed was NOT a sofa bed it was a regular sofa were if you are more than      or    feet you do not fit  which was our case   I asked about the possibility of getting an air mattress but did not have any answers about that so  you can imagine that having payed nearly    usd for a weekend we at least expected to be able to sleep    but I was offered an apology for the  confusion     seriously         The entrance to the building is full of spider webs and dirt  the stairs were really dirty and if you are allergic to cats you should be aware that they let some cat play on the stairs so there is also a  complicated  smell  There were also smaller spiderwebs inside the apartment    I would not recommend it at all  Definitely not worth    usd for a weekend  Definitely not what we expected   The amount of beds     
505615834,This location is within walking distance to the museum of Science and Industry  For many of the other attractions you would need to take Lyft or Uber  Not close to the train and although the bus is a few blocks away  its not safe to take at night   The apartment is simple  bedrooms nice size and we liked having our own bathrooms  Beds were comfortable   Some of the dish were put away dirty  and the utensils were minimal in the kitchen  however they did have a French Press   The white sofa in the living room did not look clean  and looked pretty worn   I was disappointed because we had   hosts and they were not quick to respond  Also  while we were gone  they had to shut off the water in the building and they did not tell us  We came home late at night wanting to take a shower and clean up  surprise  No water in bathrooms  and a little bit of cold water in the kitchen  The next day brown water came out of the pipes  but we eventually got it hot  and clear after we let it run a bit  Pretty disgusting  Plus it really gave us a late start the next day   This was my first Airbnb and I spent days searching and reading reviews and comparing prices  I was really looking forward to visiting Chicago and having a special trip with my daughter  Not what we were expecting  Although there were some nice things about your place  there were a few big issues we found disappointing  We liked having a washer and dryer  the beds were comfortable  bedrooms nice size and kitchen was okay  We also liked having our own bathrooms   Im glad there were only   of us  There were only   barstools  and a very small table to eat at   The kitchen had dirty dishes in the cabinet I had to wash before using  No forks  and the hands free soap dispenser in kitchen never did work  even with new batteries  What bothered me the most is the fact that the water had been turned off while we were gone one day  We came home about       pm  wanting to take showers and get cleaned up before going to bed  No water in our bathrooms  and only cold water in the kitchen   I had to email the host about it  I just gave up and went to bed  She sent me a response after I went to sleep  which woke me up  telling me there had been a leak somewhere and they had shut off the water  She told me to notify her in the morning if it wasnt back on   I had to turn the water on for awhile in AM  but it finally sputtered and eventually was hot  It was brown and disgusting coming out of the faucets  We had to run a complete washing cycle without clothes before we could run a load of laundry    This may not seem like much  but we really got a late start the next day because of all this   It was not close to any train station  The bus was not too far  but not safe to take at night  We had several locals tell us this  We spent a lot of   on Lyft And Uber   nThe reviews were not accurate about this   I was under the impression I would get a contact number of our host at check in  This did not happen  and we had to wait on email responses to questions and concerns  Very inconvenient when we didnt even have a fork to eat with in the kitchen  We had   people hosting I guess  I asked for a phone number and never got one  Although they did explain about the French press instead of a coffee maker  we had to wait quite awhile for someone to bring us forks for the kitchen  Also had to bring batteries for the soap dispenser which never did work  It said it was close and safe to use public transportation  Not close to any train  Bus unsafe at night  We spent a lot of   on Ubers  and Lyft getting around town   I specifically explained in a message before booking that we would not have a car  This was miscommunicated   It did have a nice view of Lake Michigan  Lower the price a bit since it is not close to public transportation 
497470868,Location is in a very nice part of town that is vibrant and up and coming  The  L  is about two blocks away and was very convenient  The amenities are modern and very accomodating  Unfortunately  during our stay the A C would not go below    F which was a big damper on our stay since it was summertime  As soon as I asked for a partial refund  the management company stopped all responses to my messages and I had to involve Airbnb to resolve the issues  Other issues is that one of the cabinets was not cleaned before our arrival and had a lot of a leftover trash from the previous guests  Theres also this running water noise at night that is quite loud if you are not a sound sleeper  Neither of these issues really bothered us  All in all  It was my first time staying at a place managed by a company and probably my last  to be honest   A  C is not effective in summer time  Room could not be cooled below    u  b F   The location is run by a management company it seems so I spoke to multiple during my stay  Most of the messages had a reasonable response time  However  my last message to the host where i asked for a partial refund was completely ignored  I had to file a dispute after our stay and based on airbnb policy  the host gets    hours to respond which they never did so i had to involve airbnb to resolve the issue 
480878800,Photos are of a different apartment  so just know that what you see is not the same as the apartment itself  Furniture is similar though  Much fewer windows in the actual unit    Water pressure and water temperature were truly the worst part of this apartment  Either scorching hot or freezing cold  And the pressure was just ridiculous   I could spit water at a higher pressure    Only   stove burner works  no kitchen knives   Pictures are of an entirely different apartment  Similar furniture  but different  
479339807,Honestly I was immensely disappointed by this experience  I love Airbnb and have stayed at dozens of places across the US   both for work and fun  Ive never been so shocked by how horrible a place was compared to what it was advertised as and how much I paid for it  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE  There was a giant hole in the ceiling in the kitchen  Every single drawer in the entire place was peeling grossly   to the point where we wouldnt put anything in them  There were bugs in the whole apartment  Couch was different than in photos  nothing on the deck worked at all  Basically an empty shell of an apartment  Honestly the location is THE ONLY positive about this entire place  However  theyre totally wrong about free street parking   its all permit on that street from  pm  am   Couch was different than in photos  nothing on the deck worked at all  Basically an empty shell of an apartment   Communicated fine  Honestly the location is THE ONLY positive about this entire place  However  theyre totally wrong about free street parking   its all permit on that street from  pm  am  Honestly I was immensely disappointed by this experience  I love Airbnb and have stayed at dozens of places across the US   both for work and fun  Ive never been so shocked by how horrible a place was compared to what it was advertised as and how much I paid for it  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE 
477119331,Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this  Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this   Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this   Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this 
423633241,The apartment was very dirty and I had to do much of the cleaning myself  Overall the neighborhood was nice and the price was cheap  I feel that due to the condition of the house and the lack of cleanliness of the apartment  we should have the cleaning fee returned  as we did much of the cleaning ourselves  There were dirty washcloths in the bathtubs  stains and hair on the sheets and towels in the bedroom  the overall smell of the apartment was unsavory  the amount of crumbs and human nails that were found was appalling  and it seemed that the apartment hadnt been cleaned in quite a while  We were not informed of the construction that did not let us enter through the front doors and we could not find the side door access  When we saw the construction we contacted the host to get further instruction to enter the building but we had to wait in our car for a long time because the host did not answer and we did not know how to access the building 
627067457,Place had a cool view but the room itself had a weird smell the whole weekend  I messaged through the app about getting into the place and didnt get a response back  Had to call which is fine  Hot water doesnt last long  WiFi didnt work  And there is no rooftop like it said in the description at the time of writing this review  Place had a weird smell  WiFi didnt work  there was no rooftop  Didnt respond to me on the app 
464023993,I could write a novel here about my personal opinions about renting from Zencity and how this is      a business and not someones personal property that they take care of or have any pride of ownership in  But Ill try not to  This is simply a turn and burn facility that is looking to make money  Period  As a fellow host  I just expected much more care and cleanliness for the price    I would caution anyone deciding to stay here or any Zencity property and Ill just stick to the facts as to why          Found a dead cockroach in bedroom     Found little black hairs all over bathtub  which was eroding  and black hair in freezer     Floors wore filthy  do not walk barefoot in there     The fridge was disgusting with leftover food and what looked like fresh spilled kool aid stains everywhere    We complained  they came into the apartment while we were away WITHOUT OUR COSENT to  re clean   We returned to the same mess and kool aid stains  The only difference was now the place had a horrible smell of chemical cleaners  we couldnt breathe and had to open all windows and leave for quite a while     The water was BROWN coming out of the pipes when we initially turned on the bath water   awesome     The neighborhood is great  Whole Foods is walking distance and so is the lake    Best part about our stay was checking out   just not what we expected at all  attention to detail  cleanliness and care
620786591,The nest had a lock on it  I had to ask twice for the heater to be turned off before they finally unlocked it remotely  Someone unlocked and went into the apartment during the day  Im assuming cleaning people  and when I addressed this with Zencity  I got no reply  I left a day early due to personal reasons and once again reached out to Zencity stating that the apartment needed extra clean due to my line of work as a nurse  I was leaving the apartment    hrs before check out  cleaned surfaces I touched often with hospital grade disinfectant  and still got not a single response  My plan had always been to stay with Zencity for the duration of my time in St  Louis but the lack of communication is a huge issue along with SOMEONE HAVING ACCESS TO MY APARTMENT WHILE IM IN IT  Im very upset with how this company has treated me these last few stays  I will no longer be staying with you  Someone WALKED INTO MY APARTMENT when I addressed it with them no one responded 
566246496,Unfortunately  I cant comment on the space  since I was not able to access the loft   I arrived and followed self check in instructions  but found no key in the lock box   I tried for over an hour to reach the host  via phone  supposed    hour urgent response line  and airbnb message  but after receiving no response  I ultimately had to make other plans  it was getting late  I had to be ready for early meetings    Hopefully  this was just a mistake on their part  but the communication went from great before my arrival to very slow and incomplete after things went wrong   I had to scramble to find alternative accommodations and am still working on getting a refund   I can say that the location seems to be convenient  near the convention center and restaurants    Please process refund grievance   No idea  aside from the lack of key where there should have been one   I can really only rate the check in here  since I wasnt able to access the apartment and  due to the late hour and a full schedule for the rest of my stay  moved to other accommodations after waiting more than an hour for a response to multiple messages by phone and over airbnb   Prior to this  the communication had been good  so I was surprised when I arrived to find no key in the lock box and no immediate response to my calls texts  The communication was great before my trip   However  this broke down when things started to go wrong with check in   I called the host phone number  and got to an automated messaging system   The system was strange  because it went back to the main menu once no matter which number option you pressed   Once I figured out that you have to go through the full system twice  I left two messages on the  urgent     hour message response system  and one on the regular help line hoping for a response   At the same time  I wrote to them via the airbnb messaging system   I arrived at   pm  and waited in the lobby until     before starting to look for a safe walking distance alternative place to stay   I stayed in the lobby for an additional     minutes doing this  while hoping to hear back from zencity   After moving on to a hotel so that I could use the facilities and get some sleep before early meetings  someone did finally reach out with an alternative code  via airbnb   they never called me back   but I had already gone to bed   So far    days after check in  I have only received one follow up message  telling me to cancel   Other requests for compensation have not be answered  nor has my grievance received a response  Would have been great  So far       for a very stressful  not at all zen  arrival for my first visit to St  Louis is not a good value   If the place is as advertised  would be great 
347130369,Dont expect reliable cleanliness or good customer service  Ive never had this situation in any other air bnb  but it makes me doubt the reliability   references to cleanliness  check in was fine My host was not helpful and instead was defensive when I said I was having a problem with the cleanliness of the rental   He offered no solution 
335990209,They manage many units so expect confusion and auto responses  And apparently key sets work for multiple units because arriving tenants were able to unlock our unit waking us up at  am  Not safe    Having multiple keys that access any unit is a safety hazard  We were mortified to have arriving tenants able to open our unit waking us up at  am  Thats really unacceptable   We were given pre arrival instructions to access a unit that was already occupied   The instructions lead to a key lockbox that already had the code dialed in and had no keys in it  We called and were given a new code for a different lockbox with keys for a different unit but found out that new unit was double boomed when the other tenants unlocked our door waking us up at  am leading us to understand that all of the keys work for any of the units which is most certainly a safety hazard  Responses seem mostly auto generated 
335576056,Wouldnt recommend this place  building is in good location  but the entrance and hallways are extremely old  dirty and uncomfortable  I chose this listing because of their location and amenities for my bussiness trip  there was no working internet connection  there for no working TV and the AC was broken  my first two days when the weather was warm  were unbearable inside the apartment   Slow response from the host  and when i called twice to complain  the person that was supposed to come over to fix the AC never showed up  I would never stay there again   There was no working internet connection   since this was a business trip  that was a major inconvenience  therefore there was no TV  and the AC wasnt working  and the firat   days  since the weather was warm  it was unbearable inside the apartment  The building hall is filthy and uncomfortable   The location was good  The building is extremely old and dirty  The unit itself is really old too  the furniture is nice  but in my experience the lack of advertised amenities made my stay really uncomfortable  Would not recommend   by far the worst experienceso far on Air BnB
332195580,the price is not matching the appartment  i paid too much  the photos made a good impression but the appartment is old and dusty  besides that its noisy  we left after only    min and i camcelled the booking  i also never got any response from Zenciry  definitly not recommandable   the appartment isnt luxurious or similar at all  the photos look much better then in real  its a tiny  noisy n dusty place  definitly no villa  as written at the entrance door  the price is way too much for what you get   checkin was easy and ok he never respondee nice neighbourhod but the building is very old and therefor noisy and dirty  too expensive  i paid over     dollar for   nights and expected a higher quality n comfort for that amount  the place is never worth that money 
316631996,Beware of this listing  The shower did not work and the host did not come by or send anyone to check the problem  The host has continued to maintain falsehoods and misrepresentations about this event in email communications   The shower did not function  It produced either ice cold water from the city or boiling water from the buildings boiler  There was no mixing and no way to take a shower   The worst part of this experience was that the host did not respond to my complaint and that I had no way of contacting him except through once a day AIRBNB emails  The host did not come by or send anyone to check out my complaint  AIRBNB has also been unresponsive and resistant to my request for a     discount for my payment  A lodging with a non working shower and an irresponsible  elusive host is not a good value 
305088132,This spot is fairly far from downtown and any L stops  But it is a cute spot in a lovely neighborhood  The space is NOT adequate for summer months due to issue with the electrical circuitry that the window AC unit is plugged into  But  it would likely be ok for cooler months  We had to move to another AirBNB due to this issue and had a lot of difficulty addressing this issue with the host    Photos of the space made it look better than it is  Space was fine  but shoddily put together and clearly needed better investment  Space has poor electrical circuitry than causes the kitchen light to be on when the AC window unit is on and you cannot turn off that light without turning off the AC    Hosts were difficult to communicate with and fairly unresponsive to our issue   Difficult to reach quick public transportation to downtown   This is a fine enough place for cooler months  but inadequate for the summer  
292262127,This place is very clean and functional but it IS NOT what it looks like in the pictures  Theres no washer and dryer  no marble counter tops  no tv in the bedroom  no luxury amenities as shown in the listing   Check in was very long  We didnt receive keys until   hours after checking in  This was my first airbnb so this wasnt a great experience   The record player  fresh sheets  towels  and comforters were a huge plus but I wouldnt book here again   This listing is NOT as described  The unit looks nothing like the pictures    The concierge did not have keys to give us upon arrival  It took   hours for us to receive keys  Host evaded the fact that the pictures that were shown did not match the actual unit  
159769196,If we could rate this half a star  we would due to multiple issues we had with our stay at Chriss residence  as well as the service with Chris as a host  The only positive is the neighborhood     The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price        per night   The building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that its in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator and freezer  as well as faulty hardware in the bathroom  We also noticed that the dishware was not properly cleaned and had yellow caked on residue from previous usage    Chris was extremely unprofessional  and needed to visit the residence multiple times during our stay which really made us feel uncomfortable  and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays  let alone hotel stays for comparable price points  There was a showing of the space scheduled during our stay  which was completely unacceptable  Chris also needed to retrieve a garment for a  supposedly  previous guest while we were staying  which also made no sense to us  Why couldnt these things be handled after our stay was finished     Furthermore  we had booked a stay at one of Chriss other listings which we had to unfortunately cancel due to a change of schedule in our business trip  The fact he was unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at the other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didnt settle well with us  Especially since we had booked a longer stay at his other listing    All in all  we are completely unsatisfied with Chris as a host  and even though the Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area  we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing    Unfortunately  we wont be able to provide you with a five star review due to multiple issues we had with our stay in your residence  as well as the service with you as a host     The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price  The building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that its in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator and freezer  as well as faulty hardware in the bathroom  We also noticed that the dishware was not properly cleaned and had yellow caked on residue from previous usage    We mentioned this to you during our stay  but the unprofessionalism of constantly needing to visit the residence during our stay really made us feel uncomfortable  and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays  let alone hotel stays for comparable price points  The need for you to schedule a showing of the space during our stay is completely unacceptable  And the need to retrieve a garment for a  supposedly  previous guest while we were staying there makes no sense to us  Why couldnt these things be handled after our stay was finished     Furthermore  the fact that you were unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at your other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didnt settle well with us  Frankly  it pissed us off  and we would have much rather have canceled the second reservation if we knew we wouldnt incur this ridiculous fee again  Especially since we had booked a longer stay at your other listing  You have every opportunity to refund this charge  AirBnB doesnt hold you to this  Weve already sent a refund request  yet we see that you are much more interested in taking advantage of funds from potential guests     All in all  we are completely unsatisfied with you as a host  and even though your Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area  we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  Additional comments   u   cThe building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that it u    s in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did   u   d    The retrieval of the keys was communicated very well  and it was easy to get into the building  however the elevator was broken and this was not communicated with us     Although in a great neighborhood  the apartment was overpriced and not of value  For the same price of the stay  we could have stayed in a hotel with clean linens  and an overall higher quality environment  
96588694,The Bad   Not clean  We had to clean up other peoples hair in the bathroom before we could use it  we were grossed out  There was hair and pee stains on the sheets  The walls  cabinets  and doors throughout are grimy with dirt and little spills here and there  I dont know how we can be charged a cleaning fee if it wasnt even cleaned for us  The Wifi doesnt work and it looks like other guests report the same  The location is right above a bar that plays music until  am  we didnt sleep much  We couldnt enjoy the views because there was construction going on which woke us up very early       The Good   Great location  There is a parking garage right across the street which was very convenient for our rental car  which you dont need  at all  parking is expensive  too   Divvy bikes were very accessible  right next to michigan avenue and all the restaurants and shops  Check in and out was fairly easy   The unit was larger than we expected    Would be nice to know theres construction going on so all the windows are blocked  Also  to know this is above a bar that plays music until  am ans that the walls are paper thin    Once you sent the written instructions  everything was good  I dont think there should ever be a youtube video  written instructions are the most accessible  especially if you dont have cell phone service   Good communication during check in but would have liked a response back to the message we sent after checking out   This is the most expensive weve ever paid for an airbnb and it was the dirtiest unit weve had  With the added cleaning fee  wed expect it to be clean for us  
91424776,My trip to Chicago with my girlfriend was amazing  no thanks to Chriss apartment  All the great reviews  made picking Chriss apartment an easy decision  However  my girlfriend and I experienced nothing but issues  We had difficulty checking in  There was confusion over which unit we were in and both units were dirty  We were never provided clean sheets or towels in the three nights we stayed at Chriss apartment  The sheets were covered in little hairs and smelled bad  The towels were damp and smelled worse than the sheets  The floors were dirty and half the light bulbs did not work  Chris stated he would provide a gift card to a local restaurant for the check in ordeal  but a gift card was never provided  After check out Chris stated he would issue a     refund for the awful hospitality  but the refund was never issued  Airbnb did take it upon themselves to issue a one night refund due to the check in issues we faced  Chris did not even call to express his apologies   To future renters    bring your own towels and sheets     The kitchen and bathroom did not match the pictures in the listing  Please let me know if pictures are needed to confirm   Instructions provided for check in were inaccurate  Lock box combination provided did not open the lock box  When correct combination was provided  keys were not in the lock box  After calling several times and waiting over    minutes after our check in time  the keys were placed in the lock box by the people previously renting the apartment  Once we go to the room  the place was not cleaned  After speaking with Paul  Chriss assistance   he indicated we were given instructions to the wrong apartment  Instructions stated  th floor  but we were supposed to be on the  nd  Regardless  both units were uncleaned upon arrival   Paul was extremely helpful and understanding of our ordeal  however  it seemed like Chris did not care  He indicated he would provide a local restaurant gift card to compensate for the issues we faced at check in  Gift card was not provided  After check out  Chris stated he would issue a     refund  refund was not provided   The location was great  Close to everything we wanted to do  I had a terrible experience staying at Chriss apartment  Based on all the great reviews  I thought staying here was a no brainer  I was wrong  I had issues with checking in  Both units I was directed to were dirty  I was never provided clean towels or sheets  Several of the light bulbs were out  the refrigerator seemed to be dipping coolant  my white socks turned black within minutes of walking on the carpet  and the pictures of the kitchen and bathroom provided on the site did not match the unit I stayed in   Chris assured me he would provide a gift card to a local restaurant for the issues faced at check in  Gift card was never provided  Chris then stated he would provide a     refund for the issues with my stay  another promise broken  To future renters of Chriss apartment  please bring your own towels and sheets to be safe  If you forget  there are plenty of nearby stores to buy some 
618137059,Poor service  poor communication  dirty towels  horrible customer service  I think our experience warrants a discount and refund of partial funds for our stay  It was terrible  Late  Not told the place was ready until we arrived to pick up keys  Then lied to and told the cleaner was in route the clean   After waiting    minutes the cleaner had still not arrived  Following thru on the promises you make customers 
668706993,There were multiple problems with the place and the host was either unresponsive or slow to respond 
613359193,Floor looks not cleaned for long long time  liquid spill markings in number of places over the laminated floor areas  white chalk like powder by the basebords  totally dirty all over the appartment  carpet in bedrooms not vaccumed  old spilled liquid residues in the fridge  glass or coffee cup rings on the countertop  old toothpaste markings on the bathroom sink area  dirty kitchen sink area  dirty utensils  Not sure if I want to stay in any units by Zencity  bc of the ignorance  I wrote a message to the host describing in details all cleaning issues troughout the appartment  received response that are sorry that the  cleaning crew missed few spots   The  few spots  is      sq ft area     I was asked to send pictures  which I did  but never received response  Clean place  Owner had a chance to send a cleaning crew and offer to clean it  Never offered to do so 
624310809,Good luck we paid for a   night stay and were given wrong code to smartlock so couldnt even get in and had to find another place to stay at the last minute  When someone pays to stay in your units and they never even get in the door because the smartlock code doesnt work is beyond unacceptable especially when it costs even more money to find a different place to stay last minute since your host never resolved issue to get us into the rental   Not to mention still havent received response to getting refund  or even an apology   The code for smartlock was incorrect   Never even got access to the rental since the code for smartlock didnt work and never got help to rectify the situation from host  Paid for a   night stay we were never able to use  Being able to actually use and access the rented unit 
592695957,Be cautious when deciding on a place  The pictures can be very deceiving  This place has a lot of potential but needs to be cleaned from top to bottom  We have small children and I was ashamed to have my children have to be in such conditions  They werent allowed to even play on the floor until I personally went out and purchased my own cleaning supplies and sweep and mopped the place  I washed all the linen and towel myself before using them  Nothing seem clean to me  There was hair everywhere  Food on the floors  in different area of the home    cereal  pizza crusts  crackers   Streaks in the toilet  urine and toilet paper in the other unclean bath   Comforters were filthy   Spider webs hanging in very visible places  The was old food and drinks left in the refrigerator  Floors hadnt been swept or mopped    Brian was very responsive in the beginning  once I expressed my concerns  I never heard back from him   I spent much in my vacation time cleaning the place up  purchased new comforters for my family to sleep on   Brian never responded to me after the first day of my   night stay I appreciate you hosting our stay but Im very disappointed that with your communication on addressing my concerns   Looks nicer on photos  Brian was very responsive in the beginning  once I expressed my concerns  I never heard back from him   I spent much in my vacation time cleaning the place up  purchased new comforters for my family to sleep on   Brian never responded to me after the first day of my   night stay If it were cleaned  more TVs  assigned parking 
619220055,I dont know where to start  I walked in the door  eyes heavy  legs stiff  with hopes of going straight to bed  However I choose my room  put down my bags  walk over to the bed  and I saw the most despicable thing on what was supposed to be a freshly made bed    A HAIR  I begin to inspect the rest of the room  long story short there were chips crumbs in the carpet  Also hair all over the rest of the bed  and might I add all the hair was a different color and texture  There was piss all over the bathroom floor  so I guess you could say this pissed me off  I made my boyfriend clean it up  he then got pissed off with me   While he cleaned the forsaken piss  I proceeded to inspect the rest of the apartment  I walk in the living room and youll never guess what I discovered   A HAIR  I also found more of what I presumed to be Doritos from the bed and dust bunnies  Luckily I found a candle under the sink to take away the OVERPOWERING miasma of what I believe to be marijuana   Needless to say the cleanliness of your establishment is why I declare this apartment highly inadequate  Signed  A Mad Black Woman   Her Pissed Off Mixed Boyfriend N A See cleanliness review above

620048275,Great location and stylish loft  Host was the disappointment  I had several issues no key fob to enter building after a certain time  a leak in the bedroom  etc and the host stopped responding to me  Your location was beautiful and well styled  I was very disappointed in the communication with whomever was hosting they just didnt care about my needs  There was no key fob which prevented me from leaving my air bnb after    I came to visit family and this severely impacted my time to connect  Also  there was a leak in my room over the bed since it was raining  I reached out to the host and they stop responding to me

636931536,Looked better online than in person  Before we even entered the building we had issues with parking  The directions from the company left out important details  The garage they instructed us to use was only open certain hours and when we arrived it was closed  There was an alternative entrance to the garage that we had found out about later  after we talked to someone who lived in the building  First thing we noticed when we walked in to the apartment was the smell of trash that did not go away our whole stay  The smell lingered throughout the whole apartment  Even after spraying a room refresher the smell did not go away    Second when we put our things down we saw what looked like pizza sauce on the table and we found a parking ticket from the previous month  Which iwas the first indication of the place not being cleaned prior to our arrival  Next while checking the beds for bedbugs we notice there were crumbs and hair on the sheets which means the sheets were not washed  Then we noticed the floors and rugs throughout the apartment also looked like they havent been vacuumed in awhile  There were other minor indicators of the place not being cleaned but these were the main ones  They pride themselves on keeping the property upto hotel standards but it was far from that    To top it off  after all of that  we couldnt even watch TV because it said too many people were using the account  They dont have regular TV they have Roku TV and I assume they use the same account for other rentals    Personal notes   We found the beds were way too stiff for our liking  We preferred sleeping on the couch    The curtains kept no light out so dont expect to sleep in    We noticed a monitoring device under the island  To us it was not that big of a deal but it would have been nice to know about   We were really looking forward to this place and saw all the great reviews  but I unfortunately we were extremely disappointed and would not recommend  The review well be leaving  Looked better online than in person  Before we even entered the building we had issues with parking  The directions from the company left out important details  The garage they instructed us to use was only open certain hours and when we arrived it was closed  There was an alternative entrance to the garage that we had found out about later  after we talked to someone who lived in the building  First thing we noticed when we walked in to the apartment was the smell of trash that did not go away our whole stay  The smell lingered throughout the whole apartment  Even after spraying a room refresher the smell did not go away    Second when we put our things down we saw what looked like pizza sauce on the table and we found a parking ticket from the previous month  Which iwas the first indication of the place not being cleaned prior to our arrival  Next while checking the beds for bedbugs we notice there were crumbs and hair on the sheets which means the sheets were not washed  Then we noticed the floors and rugs throughout the apartment also looked like they havent been vacuumed in awhile  There were other minor indicators of the place not being cleaned but these were the main ones  They pride themselves on keeping the property upto hotel standards but it was far from that    To top it off  after all of that  we couldnt even watch TV because it said too many people were using the account  They dont have regular TV they have Roku TV and I assume they use the same account for other rentals    Personal notes   We found the beds were way too stiff for our liking  We preferred sleeping on the couch    The curtains kept no light out so dont expect to sleep in    We noticed a monitoring device under the island  To us it was not that big of a deal but it would have been nice to know about   We were really looking forward to this place and saw all the great reviews  but I unfortunately we were extremely disappointed and would not recommend   Parking

616467131,Dont do it  Unclean   uncaring Management owner by the name of Marty  plus my wallet magically disappeared when I was the only   in my unit besides the house maid or whatever she calls herself  I am extremely disappointed  Maybe you should try hiring a new house maid or having someone inspect the properties personally bcuz both my units were not clean  I had  dust the hangers off along with cleaning out the microwaves  the refrigerators  the tubs and sweep the floors  Not   mention the bed sheets and pillow cases were filled with different types of hair so I didnt even sleep on the beds at either   of the units  The doorman even had to take the trash out bcuz it was left in the room  I also purposely placed seeds underthe chair in one unit and behind the table in the other and it wasnt cleaned  Its probably still there if you wana go and see for yourself bcuz I doubt she cleaned the rooms properly  Theres so much more than an unclean room that I endured   I will just say that I will not be renting anymore Zencity properties   also  I do not appreciate the way the man by the name of Marty didnt handle the situation I was in but I am sure you let everybody know   The cleanliness  The actual check in process was fiNe  it was walking into a used room and having   clean up after a late check in that was the problem  The doorman even gave me Clorox wipes   clean with  No response even after   days worth of voice mails  Location was cool if it was actually clean and the management owners werent so fraudulent
645256351,The unit was not as clean as we would have liked given the pandemic  We found hair of past residents all over the bathroom  in the drawers and the shower   as well as a used towel still hanging on the curtain rod  which was extremely off putting  Also  the units WiFi was very spotty   we ended up hotspotting our phones for most of the trip  Lastly  although we were worried at first at the proximity to the train stop  the noise did not bother us which was a pleasant surprise  We appreciate the effort you all made  but the units lack of cleaning was extremely off putting  especially given coronavirus   The unit was not as clean as the photos led us to believe  Also  the WiFi was not reliable   The host was responsive  however as mentioned above  no one came to clean after our complaint 
709393872,Dont trust the photos  The title and photos indicate there are laundry facilities in the apartment but there were none  Upon entering the space  I immediately knew it was not the space in the listing photos and I was very upset  Additionally  the power to the microwave would go out after about    seconds and the water temperature in the sink and shower would change dramatically in a short period of time  Additionally  because I had to buy things  coffee and laundry services  that I had thought would be included  change my meals because the microwave wasnt working  and because there is no on site parking  while it is in a good area the value is less than other similar options in the area  please ensure the listing photos actually match the apartment you are renting out  mine did not match and I am upset about this   The title and photos indicate there are laundry facilities in the apartment but there were none  Upon entering the space  I immediately knew it was not the space in the listing photos and I was very upset  Additionally  the power to the microwave would go out after about    seconds and the water temperature in the sink and shower would change dramatically in a short period of time  because I had to buy things  coffee and laundry services  that I had thought would be included  change my meals because the microwave wasnt working  and because there is no on site parking  the value is less than other similar options in the area
703760845,This studio would be ideal for short stays  The value is not the best for longer stays  with lack of long term parking unless you are able to reload the meter every   hours  The meter maids are literally so quick to write a parking ticket  It was hard for me as a night shift nurse  parking on the street during the day  It seems the host sometimes overlooks messages  so if you havent received a response within a reasonable length of time  shoot them another message  The response to my message hinting to have things fixed in the apartment didnt have the response I had hoped it would   the blinds were fixed after about a month and the shower head was still hanging out of the wall when I left  The rooftop access mentioned on the headline is actually at another building down the road  not at the actual building the unit is in  The rooftop access was a huge selling point for me to book  and it came as a disappointment when I found out it wasnt at the apartment building point  The bed was the best part of the stay   it was actually very comfortable  All in all  do your research and make sure this is the best option value wise  I felt like I overpaid   Photos  blinds missing slats  host fixed this issue about a month into stay   shower head dismantled from shower wall  never fixed  nAmenities  no rooftop access at unit building  was at another building down the street  Attempted to cut stay short due to issues mentioned above  but host never responded to my message asking to change reservation check out date until another message was sent regarding receiving mail    new netflix user named  Worst Airbnb Ever  however was added to the users on the netflix account that was signed in on the smart tv in unit  This was addressed with the host  who said that it was no one from the team that created this new user  However  it was not me either  The astonished faces of my coworkers were comical  when I told them I was paying       for a studio downtown  People at work told me they were paying roughly      less for a  br  ba mortgage just outside downtown 
626826592,We were very disappointed to discover when we checked in that our apartment smelled strongly of cigarette and or marijuana smoke   We found the packaging for an air filter and  smoke trapping ashtray  in a kitchen cabinet   Putting   and   together  it was clear that a smoker had stayed there and Zencity had not bothered to clean apartment to get rid of the smell    We emailed the photos to Zencity but this website wont let me upload them to this review    We contacted Zencity by email and their first response was we should look under the kitchen sink for cleaning supplies   We replied that it was not our responsibility to clean the entire apartment  the carpeting and furniture to get rid of smoke odors   We eventually sent Zencity an email asking them to consider a     refund of our fees and their response has been   silence   We left the windows open day and night and that did reduce but not eliminate the odor   It also created other issues because the weather was rainy and variable and the apartment was often either too hot or too cold   And on   nights there were heavy drinkers and loud partying on the rooftop above us  so with open windows it was very loud   By the way  both doors to the rooftop have big signs that it was closed   The apartment itself was OK  but the customer service by Zencity was completely unsatisfactory   There was a prominent sign in the apartment that smoking is prohibited and a smoker may be charged an extra      cleaning fee   Obviously that was not enforced   I read that Zencity manages extended stay apartments in Chicago  Kansas City and St  Louis   Based on this experience  I would be very cautious renting a property managed by them  Your company needs to be more responsive to customers when there is a problem   Your customer service was very disappointing   You can read the chain of emails between me and your representatives   The apartment was not cleaned as described   See above   See above 
669413907,Booked this place because a friend came in from out of town  We saw how their listing stated they did ultra cleaning so it made us want to book it especially because this is during covid  This place was the opposite it was SO dirty  There was a hair ball in the toilet and hairs on the seat  When we checked the bed there were hairs too and the table had dirty marks on it  I contacted the host immediately with pictures too and did not receive a response until the next day  We wanted to use the dishes that night and when we grabbed a dish it was dripping with water  The stove had dirty marks too  I was surprised that the host did not respond to at least accommodate  After check out I requested a refund and they said they can assure me the place was clean and that it was discounted too much already so they couldnt  I contacted air bnb support after and told them my experience and they refunded me the cleaning fee thankfully  I wish I would have gotten refunded for the whole thing as the host did nothing to accommodate  This place is unsafe  Dont stay here trust the reviews  This was the worst experience especially having a friend come in from out of town I was embarrassed 
627404246,FRAUDULENT LISTING    The address is on Pearson Street  around the corner from the Hermitage address  It is questionably connected to a different apartment building on Hermitage  but NOT the one on the listing  The questionable address that it is supposedly connected to has a porta potty in the front  with caution tape on the fence  and is in terrible shape     The photos do say that it is not exactly like the actual apartment because it is a new listing  Fine  But all the photos of windows show it is at an upper level  Which is true if it were in the correct address  Instead  it is direct from the sideway into the doorway  These are the apartments that get broken into in this neighborhood because theyre easy in and out    To add to the lack of safety  the door knob does not shut all the way  It was handmade drywall that didnt line up properly when they were trying to rehab the apartment  So the deadbolt works  but the door opens about an inch because the knob does not connect properly    It is connected to the remainder of the unfinished rehab apartments  which had THREE smoke detectors chirping  Unless the central air fan is on full blast it is every minute of that loud  low battery  chirp   I went in and tried to turn one off  but it still would not stop    Zencitys communication was terrible  I have transcripts to show for that  too    I HAVE PHOTOS DOCUMENTING EVERYTHING  I cannot speak for other listings  but either Zencity does not check their properties before they list them  or they are a fraudulent organization  Zencity  check your properties before you post them  If you are an honest company  and you sincerely did not check beforehand that it was a different building and address  then that is something you should look into in the future  If you do not care  I wonder if all of your listings are fraudulent  If you need proof that your company is representing a fraudulent listing  take a look at      W Pearson      N Hermitage  and     N Hermitage   The address is WRONG  They say it is     N Hermitage  It is      W Pearson  It is in NO WAY connected to     N Hermitage  It is connected to     N Hermitage      N Hermitage has a porta potty in front of the building  caution tape on the fence  and is in terrible shape   n nIt is not a second floor as the photos suggest  I know it says that it isnt exactly the pics because its a new place  but the multiple photos of windows suggest it is a second or third floor unit  First floor buildings are unsafe in that neighborhood   n nThe messages from host  when they actually responded  said it is connected to     which is FALSE  Either this company does not check their properties before posting them  or they are trying to get away with showing     as a nicer building than the one it actually is in   n nI have photos to prove this   I asked multiple times why it was a different address  no response  They did not respond until I went to the building to see it was  in fact  a different address and wrote them to tell them the door does not close all the way  It locks from the deadbolt  but the hand made drywall door frame is unacceptable  The doorknob itself does not close all the way  Even when locked with deadbolt  the door opens approximately   inch because the doorknob isnt lined up properly   When they finally did respond  the representative said they would send a  handyman  over and that never happened    Very disconcerting  Hours went by without hearing back from the host  When they did reply  it was false information  Listing address is a completely different building and street 
627349137,Thanks for hosting  Have blinds for the sake of peoples privacy  security needs to be updated anybody can just get in  have real cleaning personal that cares and takes there job seriously clean your units communicate with those that you are hosting   There werent any blinds in the kitchen and someone got into the building and knocked at my units door I called the police on May   rd to assist me  Having curtain or blinds in kitchen
669420299,The pictures showed a larger place with a kitchen table and chairs  a full size couch and larger bed area  We got a tiny place with barley enough room to set up a pack n play for our   month old  No kitchen table  no chairs and the  couch  fits   person comfortably  I dont know how people get away with renting places with pictures to obviously another unit they are renting  Id update your pictures to the actual place you are renting  The pictures showed a larger place with a kitchen table and chairs  a full size couch and larger bed area  We got a tiny place with barley enough room to set up a pack n play for our   month old  I don u    t know how people get away with renting places with pictures to obviously another place   It would have been great if it was the place of the pictures that we booked
628805160,I never had a problem with this company  I just know it was so hot and the air didnt work  The place is super nice just wish the air worked  I just expected them to have air that work are at least rush to get it fixed
651002990,The hosting company Zencity has terrible customer service  I was not able to enter the rental on time and they did not give the rental a thorough cleaning between visits  The key was not even in the lock box upon my arrival  Considering COVID     they should have spent more than    minutes cleaning and sanitizing the space  Unprofessional 
621134080,Pretty big disappointment and a few inconveniences  Host wasnt as professional as I thought he would have been    always a different person replying as zencity so communication was somewhat confusing as well
621072318,This was an experience that started out fine and ended horribly     Price gouging   We booked the space for six nights  Though the keypad was giving us issues every time we tried to enter the apartment  we once waited       minutes for Zencity to change the code since the keypad wasnt working   we wanted to extend our stay   They refused to give us the new daily rate  which was about     cheaper for those same new dates that we wanted to extend into   They said that if we extended it wed have to keep our same rate because they couldnt change it for us   Annoyed and frustrated  we said fine because we didnt want to have to move and the place was nice enough   After going back and forth  they finally sent a modification that actually added an additional day on top of what we requested   We were flexible  so we didnt say anything because we were already pretty annoyed and wanted to not have a sour relationship with Zencity   RODENT  I E  MOUSE  and poor response   A little past the midway point of our stay  I saw a mouse in the kitchen go from under the oven to under the dishwasher  and later to the bathroom   Now   my partner is TERRIFIED of mice  Terrified   I immediately messaged Zencity  asked them during one call to send someone  they said they would   then asked them on a second call  three hours later  to send someone  they said they would    About four hours after that  around      hours in total  they sent someone who said he just got word an hour before his arrival   In the meantime  like any reasonable person  I had to find another Airbnb last minute  which ended up costing more than this location   Despite the fact that we found large holes throughout the apartment  laundry room and bathroom  and the door doesnt have a door guard  so anything can slide right in        all of which we documented  we were only refunded half of the money we paid for the remaining days of our stay after Zencity ignored our messages and started only communicating with Airbnb     It really started out as a promising trip  but my partner is still reeling from the experience  Im out of a few hundred bucks unexpectedly and I dont even know if Ill have a job in a month  I will NEVER rent a place managed by Zencity again  The space was nice until I found a mouse   I think you all should consider plugging up the holes around the space  laundry room area  bathroom  and put a door guard under the doors  The keypad didnt work for the first few tries  When we couldnt get into the apartment and when we found a mouse in the apartment  we experienced pretty slow responses  When I booked the place  you were charging     a day   When I tried to extend it  you all were booking it for     a day at the time and refused to give me that rate   I extended anyway because of COVID    to be nice   Then you extended for one day more than I wanted originally  But I said fine   Then I find a mouse    you wait over    hours to send someone  who told me when he got there that he had only gotten notice an hour before   and then you only give me half my money back for the remaining three days  which shouldve been an additional two days had you not extended my time    I had to find another place last minute  which resulted in me spending even more money that I intended  and I dont even know if Ill have a job in a month    
511719147,I reached out to the company  host  as our power was out for a majority of the stay  Was told that someone would come and never did  We ended up leaving the property before time  Because of this situation  the good looks and location were over shined  I reached out to the company  host  as our power was out for a majority of the stay  Was told that someone would come and never did  We ended up leaving the property before time  Because of this situation  the good looks and location were over shined 
619854562,Zencity   great units and extrememly poor customer support    Rented two places from them starting on           The rooms are really new and nice   Near the Country Club Plaza in KC   Underground parking  new units  nice building so a big thumbs up for that    Kitchen amenities are quite sparse though  so cooking isnt that easy   Maybe they expect you to eat out a lot since you are travelling   Rooms were spacious and beds nice    Customer support is atrocious  worst of any Airbnb I have stayed in by far   Had an issue in the first place  no shower curtain  and it was never addressed   We were told a shower curtain would be delivered and that did not happen   The second stay never happened due to the covid    issues   Trying toe communicate with zencity and get a reasonable refund has been an ordeal  with way too much time of mine utilized for this effort  Extremely poor customer service for an agency that runs multiple Airbnb units   Never stayed there   Just clicking to get through review  Due to the covid    outbreak my wife  who was going to stay in the unit from         decided to fly home   Her activities later that week were cancelled and she was afraid that flights home would be cancelled    She called the zencity contact number at noon and no response   I subsequently contacted zencity through the account and let them know we would not be using the reservation   Zencity offered a refund of          of unused nights  which was Tuesday   Wednesday    I attempted multiple times to contact zencity and could not get through and or left messages and they were not returned   I was asking for     of unused plus the cleaning fee         We never even checked into the room  so no cleaning would be necessary   Zencity then offered     which I accepted  as I want to end this ordeal    Very disappointed in the customer service of zencity and will not rent one of their spaces again 
622864247,After check out host asked me to pay     for a Pillow that had been drawn on  Which was not from me  Hi I agreed to pay it just to not have an issue then they came back asking for another     for the same reason which Im not about to pay 
670562219,Hard to find key and unit  Host not willing to work with me on refunding money for the reservation even though I didnt stay
621933981,I booked a one bedroom with elevator access  When I arrived at the building  elevator did not work   was stuck on  th floor    I tried to call zen city through the app but no one picked up  Finally someone responded to my message on the app and told me I can use the back door to access stairs to the  th floor  I declined this because I had a lot of luggage  They finally re booked a small studio with elevator access but when I asked for   back  ZenCity refused   so far   I have used ZenCity before but this experience was far below their standards   I booked a one bedroom with elevator access  When I arrived at the building  elevator did not work   was stuck on  th floor    I tried to call zen city through the app but no one picked up  Finally someone responded to my message on the app and told me I can use the back door to access stairs to the  th floor  I declined this because I had a lot of luggage  They finally re booked a small studio with elevator access but when I asked for   back  ZenCity refused   so far   I have used ZenCity before and this was very unprofessional in how I was treated   I booked a one bedroom with elevator access  When I arrived at the building  elevator did not work   was stuck on  th floor    I tried to call zen city through the app but no one picked up  Finally someone responded to my message on the app and told me I can use the back door to access stairs to the  th floor  I declined this because I had a lot of luggage  They finally re booked a small studio with elevator access but when I asked for   back  ZenCity refused   so far   
621937629,This place is cute st first glance however upon waking up at night to use the restroom  I discovered this place had roaches and these bugs were huge  One was in the bathroom and touched my toothbrush and i showed another in the bedroom  As you can imagine i was disgusted  I informed the host and sent photos but they did nothing  Also though it sys there is no parking on oremus  understand it really means that   There is NO place to park if staffing here   Honestly i feel like i deserve a refund  i wouldnt recommend staying here  I appreciate you letting me rent your space however im incredibly disappointed with how the ROACH  situation was handled  No one ever came to address the issue  I did Mohr sleep the next two nights after seeing bugs in the bathroom and bedroom  Very upset  There were bugs iight took   hrs after me notifying the host before i recieved a response  They were shooting outside the window  The entrance to the building isas nooottt rally accessible also street parking was almost nonexistent  Cute setup but not worth the bugs and headache 
619905216,Very gross and dirty  There were hairs all over the bathroom floor and the bathtub as well as the entire bed  sheets  comforter and pillows  You can tell they dont even clean it and only get away with it because the place is up to date so it looks clean and nice at first   This was during the corona virus outbreak too  very gross   Our fire alarm also went off every single time we used the oven  and continued to beep every minute for   whole days  Asked the front desk to look at it or try and fix it and they kept saying they would but never did  Other than the neglect and uncleanliness  the place was very accessible and had decent parking space nearby  Location was great too 
622907426,Zen city  Patch up mouse holes communicate with people at your property provided more sheets and towels and blankets  Never messaged or answered responded    hours later  Never responded had dangerous situation Being better hosts
629064232,Good luck in your search and always price check  Prices are not that great   A message was sent to me saying I overpaid     dollars for a airbnb in the Skyline building  when I tried to book the same place that week  it was not available and nothing was said or done about the money i paid    weeks later it was available  I really liked Zencity until the last   trips  A refund would be nice as I always followed the rules and kept the places clean  Thank you  When I asked about the overpaid refund  Same as above A refund or a free weeks stay 
643368492,Great location  Needed a much  much better cleaning before my colleague and I arrived for our business trip  Zencity were very friendly  and wanted to help however they could  but responsivity was spotty  and we ended up leaving halfway through our trip  If this unit receives a deep cleaning  a couple repairs  and is maintained with more thorough cleanings between guests  then it will be a great place to stay  This unit has great potential  but needs serious attention first  Fix the hardwood floorings loose slats  Get more comfortable  less firm  mattresses  Fix the couch leg  Clean the AC units deeply  Clean everything deeply  Replace old kitchenware  Add more silverware  Repair the bathroom where fixtures used to be  Clean better between guests  Replace the shower curtain  Leave enough keys for each guest  or at least for each bedroom   The unit was as photographed  and the location was excellent  Its construction quality  furniture condition  and cleanliness were very disappointing  Ex  the flooring was so loose throughout most of the unit that it clattered noisily as hardwood slats slid under my feet  even when tiptoeing   We were only given   key  despite the unit being a   bedroom booked for business travel  It took several days to get a second key  which was rather inconvenient as my colleague and I had different schedules  Communications were relatively helpful and very friendly  but variable on promptness  For the price  the cleanliness should have been significantly better 
624151641,Terrible  Do not stay at this place or any Zencity location  The person renting out this place did not have the rights to the apartment as their lease had ended  As a result  we were kicked out a couple hours into the stay by the landlord and were not even issued a refund   The host did not have the right to rent out this unit and we were therefore forced to leave a couple hours into our stay  
563003543,Upon arrival to the Airbnb we noticed an extremely pungent smell  it had clearly been masked with some Febreeze or air freshener spray  we contacted the host and they sent someone in the next morning  However  after several messages back and forth we noticed we were communicating with three different people which made voicing our concerns difficult and it seemed dismissive because each person would just say  hope youre enjoying your stay  when we really werent  After sending someone to look at the place  they basically said nothing was wrong and left it at that  Im not sure if the smell was from the old furnace or just because the building itself was old  but their way of dealing with the issue wasnt great  The place itself was nice but the smell was pretty unbearable for most of the stay    The host then contacted me again and said they hoped I had a good stay and proceeded to ask that if I had any complaints to send it to his private feedback  I thought Id post it all here so everyone is aware  Multiple different people communicating with me which made it extremely frustrating to voice concerns 
664902188,Dont go with zencity  they failed to have the apartment cleaned when I arrived  The bed was slept in  dishes in the sink  trash in all the garbages and used toothpaste in the bathroom sink  Then on my last day of the stay a maintenance man unlocked the door and came in while I was sleeping at     am  They would not make it right  Its big corporate and you get the run around  Having the matinace man come in while I was asleep is horrible  If I had been a girl I would sue you for sexual harassment  Having a locked door open at      am out of your sleep in your underwear is not a good experience  All that after non cleaning   It u    s much much smaller than the pictures make it look   The key pad does work  It would be fine if they had better customer service 
625236828,The location is great with a nice view  It is in a posh building in Hyde Park with a nice restaurant which will deliver to your room  The room is sparse with no desk or kitchen table to eat at or work at   The unfortunate part is that the place was dirty  The fridge and light switches  which I personally wiped down   There were no paper towels  so I had to use my own wipes   But the worst was that the sheets were blood stained  Some of the stains had even soaked through to the mattress cover  It was evident that the staff had not changed the sheets  I had to change everything myself  because Zen city had no staff in the area to come over and take care of the problems    I was thoroughly grossed out and just wanted to get out of there  Then they overcharged me      for a one nights stay at a     place   Bad experience  Please clean your facilities   The washer  dryer is not in the unit  but on the same floor  down the hall   All went well  Responses okay cleanliness
651582618,Although the building staff was great  parking isnt great  the apartment was okay but very dirty  Comfy couch   bed though  Already spoke to Stuart about my issues 
623307502,Read carefully All my food for that stay spoiled since I was in a hotel without a kitchen   No mention that there was a flight of stairs outside making it handicapped inaccessible   Told them I was NOT staying there apparently that wasnt enough to convince them 
647013691,location communication and free parking was awesome  Only thing  I was just very bothered by how dirty it was  There was a ton of dust on the fan  old cookies above the fridge in the cabinet  and the bedding was stained  It has blood stains and hair on it along with other random stains  Also by the windows was a used q tip  Super dirty  location communication and free parking was awesome  Only thing  I was just very bothered by how dirty it was  There was a ton of dust on the fan  old cookies above the fridge in the cabinet  and the bedding was stained  It has blood stains and hair on it along with other random stains  Also by the windows was a used q tip  Super dirty

641794828,Upon arrival at      we realized its coded to open at three  Then the cleaning crew arrived and said we would need to wait another       minutes  After already paying for parking we sat in the hall and waited  The construction from     everyday was also rather inconvenient and we were not notified about the noise prior to check in  It was chilly so we tried opening the windows and they came out of the frames  In totality it was worse than we expected  Upon arrival at      we realized its coded to open at three  Then the cleaning crew arrived and said we would need to wait another       minutes  After already paying for parking we sat in the hall and waited  The construction from     everyday was also rather inconvenient and we were not notified about the noise prior to check in  It was chilly so we tried opening the windows and they came out of the frames  In totality it was worse than we expected 
625980313,Our experience could have been a lot better  Unfortunately  the WiFi doesnt really work  We could not use the TV because the fire stick couldnt connect to the WiFi  The ceiling leaked when it rained and we didnt know until my girlfriend slipped on the water  Also  during our stay two men came in the apartment without any prior notice from Zencity to us  It was extremely scary because they walked in on one of us getting out the shower and one sleeping and we did not have clothes on  The second man came with two children to install something and again  walked right in with the access code  He also stated that The owner knew that he was coming to do the install  However  Zencity did not mention it to us  We were out of the place a lot because when we were there we slept with a chair under the door and took turns watching it be just to be safe  we didnt know who else has the code and might come in  We also received a noise complaint while we were sleeping  It was extremely crazy because my fianc e had just flown in  It was extremely difficult to find somewhere else to stay because a chunk of our money was tied up in this place and it was extremely short notice  Most places were booked  The experience wasnt horrible however  it definitely could have been better  There definitely should be communication with the guests about other people being able to just walk in when they feel like it  TV did not work  internet connection was very inconsistent which is why the TV did not work   I feel as though the communication stopped when I checked in because we were not aware of the two men being able to just walk in on us
650523880,Look elsewhere for decent accommodations  The place REEKED of cigarettes  even thought there is a non smoking policy  Our hair and clothes smelled like cigarettes after the first night  Going out and about smelling of cigarettes was awful   Sleeping in that was unpleasant  to say the least  We absolutely could not spend a second night at the apartment and found new accommodations the next day and checked out  We washed our cigarette smelling clothes ASAP  It was really gross   Sam and I are not ones to complain usually  but this had to be addressed  There were a variety of smaller issues  which are easily overlooked  considering the basic requirements of cleanliness are held up  However  this was not the case as the place was an ashtray  The apartment and its furniture were falling apart  The fridge leaked  The toilet did not flush  the shower took a solid    minutes to warm up  and the water pressure was very weak  Some other minor things  like the blinds were all convoluted and not attended to properly   All in all  The biggest issue was the reek of cigarette smoke that made our stay unbearable  besides the variety of falsely advertised amenities  Also  Zencitys reluctance to properly address the situation was disappointing    I contacted and explained our issues with the apartment to Zencity  First they offered alternative accommodation  but for another date  Which of course  visiting Chicago  we needed a place to sleep then and there  They initially charged us for the second night we did not stay  When I declined their offer and further explained the cause of our cancellation  Zencity went quiet and has not responded to my request for a refund  Ive tried to contact them for multiple days now   Spare yourself the headache  money  and unpleasant consequences of booking with Zencity and go with another Airbnb host  I wish I could leave a good review and not have had dealt with all this  The new place I booked is cheaper  in a great location  and is truly CLEAN and properly maintained  Hi Zencity   can somebody please get back to me regarding my stay and refund for checking out  Thanks   The place reeked of cigarettes  even thought there is a no smoking policy  The apartment and its furniture were falling apart  The bathroom had issues with the toilet  water heater and pressure   Responsive at first  and then not at all  when confronted with a complaint and the request to resolve a refund  Accurate description of expected environment 
652351810,Air conditioning doesnt work and they didnt fix it the entire time we stayed there  It was very hot and we contacted host multiple times about this  They said they will send maintenance team but no one arrived to fix this  The place is not at all worth of the money  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE   They didnt let us know about the air conditioning issue  Fixing the addressed problems and being nice to the customers  
632304466,This stay was disappointing   Wifi didn u    t work and host was unresponsive   The host forgot to approval my reservation after check in time 
650581504,Beware  its not whats described and the host does not exist  Please contact me  You over promised and under delivered  No key fob for two days  no washer  dryer for me to use as described  no pool no gym access 
521168271,The place is honestly just not clean  found used qtip  and very expensive  Opt for something else if at all possible  Just clean the place  The cleanliness and attention to details is simply not up to par  You can get a similar room in a private home at half the price

711932454,I would not recommend this Airbnb for the following reasons     whole apartment smells of cigarettes    Shower curtain reeks of pee    Toilet was clogged when we arrived    Bedroom fan completely covered in dust    Wrong apartment  different from photos on Airbnb    Popsicle stick found on top ledge of shower    Wifi information was hard to find  It was not labeled  Apartment was a different one than shown in the pictures   Overall the experience was uncomfortable due to the uncleanliness  it not being the same apartment as listed  and the fact that the toilet was clogged when we arrived  I would not recommend staying at this Airbnb 
621153530,I will not personally ever recommend this place  Horrible experience  Very strict building to be in  No personal space  Room photos look smaller in person  If you want fresh air theres no windows that can be open in this room  Horrible security  Horrible property manager  Just save your time and headache away from this place 
651610312,The rounds of clips  rapid gunfire  drive by shootings  screaming  sirens and murders went on all weekend long   The rounds of clips  rapid gunfire  drive by shootings  screaming  sirens and murders went on all weekend long  
700435530,This might get long winded so bear with me  The first thing youll encounter is that the check in instructions to get in arent accurate  Youll have to wait for someone to eventually leave for them to open the door to the hallway you need to get in to access the elevator  Once you overcome that hurdle  youll be let down when you walk into your room  The unit has a prominent smell of cigarette smoke  This is strictly a non smoking until so if you have health reasons or just want a smoke free room for comfort this place is probably not for you  If you are a smoker  you wont be the first to smoke here and will probably get away with it by the look at the response that I got when bringing up this issue  The rug had bread crumbs trash on it  The floors felt like there was a layer of grime on them  The comforter had a yellow stain on it  Speaking of stains  the bedroom and bathroom walls have stains that appear to be from bodily fluids  The shower floor was stained where one would typically stand while showering  Had to get one my hands and knees to scrub the shower floor so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out  Horrible water pressure in the shower by the way  The thermostat was locked so I couldnt make it colder than    degrees  After I contacted the host about this issue it took them two days to lower it to    degrees  By then I had figure out a way to make it cooler  just gotta be a little creative  Another annoying thing was that the light switch for the kitchen also controlled the outlet where the tv was connected to  So you could only watch tv with a huge glare on it  Another workout was found for this issue  Got one of the two extension cords behind the couch and connected it the outlet in the room and ran it under the door  Unplug the tv from the outlet and take the cord out of the plastic cable hider to have enough slack to connect it to the extension cord  Another inconvenience was that the key fob they provided at first didnt allow access to the parking lot or the roof  After the second day they did provide a secondary key that worked for everything but they didnt request permission when dropping it off and just helped themselves in  Even though we werent in the room at the time  its common courtesy to ask when entering the until like other hosts and handy men have  It felt like a violation of our privacy and made us feel uneasy  Other than that the location was good and the aesthetics of the renovations were nice  Please get rid of that awful smoke smell and do a deep cleaning  Update the check in instructions as well as the first key fob that was given since it doesnt give access to the parking lot or the rooftop  Change the stained comforter and clean repaint the stains on the walls  Give better access to the thermostat     degrees is horrible to sleep in   The description states that this is a non smoking unit but the place reeked of cigarette smoke   The instructions to get into the building were accurate but to get into the actual unit  were not  No way to get into the hallway without a key fob following the instructions provided by the host  Took    minutes for someone to be coming out for us the get in  Then the key fob did not open the gate to the parking lot nor to the rooftop  A second key fob was provided after the second day  which raised another concern  Someone when into the unit without authorization  In the past  when the host or a handyman had to get inside the unit permission was requested and only until I granted that permission would they come in  Common courtesy to ask for permission to go into the unit since for all intents and purposes I am in charge and responsible while I pay to stay here  This gave us a sense of having our privacy violated and honestly rubbed us the wrong way  Communication wasnt as fast or as helpful as most Airbnbs  When mentioning about the key fob not working to open the gate to the parking lot  a response wasnt received until someone went into the unit without authorization to drop off the second key fob  Noticed that while we were staying at this Airbnb the price to stay there decreased a bit  After having the complains and inconvenience we mentioned  a partial refund discount would have been appreciated 
646749862,Pros  Great location  Cons  There was a listening  recording device hidden under the desk  No where in the listing does it mention it nor in the apartment  Floors look as if they have not been vacuumed in months  Head board had hand prints  Washer smelt of mildew  Could not park in the gated parking lot because the fob would not work  They brought me a new one and it still didnt work    Before you book on Airbnb check out the Zencity website  Rates are much cheaper and you shouldnt have to pay anything for a dirty and privacy invading space  My suggestion would be to remove the Alexa  any listen  recording devices from the home   hirer a true house keeper   Under the desk was an Alexa  Some sort of device that can easily listen in on conversations or whatever you may do in the air bnb  The concerning part was that it was hidden and NOT mentioned anywhere on the listing or in the apartment  I managed hotels for years privacy is a number one priority for guests  Shame on you   It was upsetting to see the cheaper rate on the  Zincity  website  Ultimately the privacy   cleanliness of the apartment made me feel that I shouldnt have had to pay the higher rate 
624544419,Well I paid for my place little did I know they gave me wrong codes answered my text or my emails with automated responses and then at the very end they offered me     of my money back which I thought was a joke if I gave them     of their apartment back after renting it they would not have been very happy about that but since Im a great guest and I always leave my places in excellent condition  why would they think I would be happy with that offer
627318602,Good place with a low price  Unfortunately during my stay the host was very slow to respond  and it seems as if they werent prepared for people to stay  Good location  but parking was pretty hard to find since its only street parking by the building 
624944548,This was my first time getting an Airbnb and I have to say for it to be the first time it did not go as well as it should especially since it was my birthday  The host was very dramatic and very paranoid about the amount of cars that were outside he acted as if there were cars covering the entire block and I had a huge gathering or party or something overall he was very strict  and it didnt help that he lived only   houses down  I have to say if I am going to do this again it will have to be a way more private and secluded area  My gmail account couldnt reply back  Was having issues communicating with the host 
714125531,They cancelled my reservation hours before I was supposedly to get there  They cited  maintenance issues   I asked what kind of maintenance issues they were and why they would take all five of the days that I had reserved  They had no answer  I had to settle for another place  as it was the last minute and I needed a place to stay  Very stressful and disappointing 
629613866,Do not stay here  Entry box was broken and I couldnt get in  Host owner called me back two hours later and called me a fucken bitch because I was unhappy that I was locked out  I am   months pregnant and drove    hours to attend my sisters funeral only to be cussed out  lose money and not have anywhere to stay  I am devastated  Go out of business  This was listed as luxury  upscale  Instead the box was broken and I couldn u    t get into building   Box was broken  Called the owner host for access  Im  months pregnant and drove    hours for a funeral  Only to be called a fucken bitch when I called the host owner and was threatened by him as well  I ended up not having a place to stay during the trip  Owner was rude  irate and unorganized  Called me back hours later only to blame me for not accessing the unit  Called me a bitch and threatened me  Place is run down and entry box is broken  I took pictures so there is proof  I was never able to stay in the unit and lost money and had nowhere to stay for my sisters funeral 
653182904,     be aware it is next to a metro station  it is quiet enough where you cannot hear it  There needs to be an extensive cleaning before anyone is allowed to stay there  Covid isnt a joke  The cleaniness and condition was pathetic and dangerous with an  ongoing pandemic   Many of the photos showed furniture in good condition  When we arrived a chair was broken and hidden in the closet  We were also unaware the apartment was next to the train station   An attempt to contact hosts with some issues was met with no response during stay  Although they were responsive prior to check in and with a refund for a night  The quality and condition of furniture left a distaste  There were many knicks in the walls  There was dust on the books and magazines left by the nightstand  Dishes and utensils needed extra cleaning and replacing 
672958151,  
627483199,This location is GORGEOUS  Truly stunning  well staged in a great building   However  getting into the building is a formidable challenge at best  If you arrive late on a weekend be prepared to park on the street if you can find parking as this location is downtown  You must then enter into a garage and then get keys from a box and then trek through an office building to correct elevator banks   The biggest issue was that our unit was DIRTY  I sent pictures and contacted someone and was told it would be cleaned and it never was  I was then told I could not have a refund on the cleaning fee as I had to clean Urine and fecal matter off both the toilets  change the sheets  clean the counter tops and after that I gave up  The showers were dirty  long hair everywhere  It was just dirty  point blank period   The fan in the guest bathroom never turned off and rattled like it was going to project itself out of the ceiling at any point    I received a text about the tv being too loud before the cleaning issue was addressed and thats unacceptable    The staff with Zencity was friendly  and one gentleman helped me with the key situation so I was appreciative of that  Im disappointed that no one came to clean while I was there  Nor is the cleaning fee being refunded as I had to clean myself    The space is stunning and worth the price  if it was clean  It was literally like Fort Knox getting into this building  Super secure but took Atleast    minutes initially due to difficult lockers
672974944,The place was comfortable for one person not two and if your not from here its in a bad area The place was comfortable for one person not two The key was not in the box we had to go through a whole thing just to check in
659090502,There are better places in the area for the cost   It was not kept up like shown in the pictures   Overall OK   I wont book with Zencity again  but will go local  You need to send a worker in to fix things up  replace light bulbs  and do regular maintenance
713114362,Not bad    Cigarette smoke all throughout the apartment
658523246,There were a  multitude of issues that werent addressed  First and foremost  this place is advertised with AC but that is not the case  The unit in the living room is so tiny  it doesnt even cool off the living room and attached kitchen adequately  When I brought this up  I was told by Zencity that they would have maintenance come and install at least   AC unit  if not   in the two bedrooms  The way the place is set up  the bedrooms are down a hallway from the living area   there is no way in hell this tiny unit would be able to cool the bedrooms  The towel rack was broken  They said maintenance would also fix that  MAINTENANCE NEVER CAME  We slept on the floor of the living room because the bedrooms were so hot  Which caused me to have neck and back pain  Its one thing to have an issue  its another to make promises and not deliver  They also said that there was a fan in the closet   there was no fan when we got home on Friday night  We found   blood stains on the rug and a used condom wrapper on the floor of one bedroom  We had issues checking in as there was no key to the building in the lockbox nor instructions on the alternate way of getting into the building  Also  after sleeping on the floor and picking up the comforter to clean up the space  it was filthy underneath  I dont think the floor has been vacuumed in some time which made me even more nervous because of covid  While they were timely in their responses to my concerns  none of them were actually fixed  Their solution was to let us leave on Saturday and get a small refund  not even     saying it didnt  seem like a good match   We were there for a funeral and did not have the time or the mental space to search for another place and move all of our things  This is the first time Ive had a negative experience with Airbnb  I still love Airbnb but definitely not this place  You need to get your stuff together  One problem after another  that you did not address  You made promises that were not kept  Im very disappointed   There is a tiny AC unit in the living room that was so small and weak  it did not even cool the living room and attached kitchen adequately  The way the space is set up  the two bedrooms are down the hall from the living room   there is NO WAY even a high end AC unit would be able to get to them  When I called about it  I was told that maintenance would come and install at least   unit  if not   in each of the bedrooms  Maintenance never came  I was told via messenger that there was a fan in the closet that we could certainly use and when I returned  there was no fan either  Maintenance did not come on Friday when we checked in nor Saturday  I did not sleep well either night as we slept on the floor   and in fact  had neck and back pain   There was no key to the building front door in the lockbox  There were detailed instructions on getting the key to getting in the front door to actually getting inside the unit  But there was no key to the front door  I re read the instructions a few times and finally called ZenCity  I was told the  code  to get into the building after waiting on hold and waiting in the heat outside  If their instructions were so detailed  why werent they updated in the instructions  They later told me that the last tenant  took the key   I dont believe that for a minute  Communication was good and somewhat timely but it was all lies  They promised maintenance would come with   AC units and would fix the towel rack  That never happened  Its one thing to have issues which can happen  its another to make promises and not deliver on said issues  Its completely unprofessional  If you advertise AC  then there should be adequate AC which there wasnt  Every host should be cleaning more than thoroughly with covid in the air  If there is a problem  fix it   they just made a bunch of empty promises  This was the worst Airbnb experience Ive ever had  Truly disappointed  The  solution  they had was attempt to kick us out on Saturday before our departing day of Sunday  saying  it wasnt a good fit   We were there for a funeral   there was no time or energy to look for a new place and move all of our things in between going to the wake and funeral  How about you just deliver on what you promise  I believe we should get a     refund for the problems we had   Airbnb was not helpful either 
673434796,The good  bad and ugly  Location is great  the apt is run down and not stocked up at all  Listing says quiet time after   pm and yes  there is a bar downstairs bit its more of a club   Loud music banging the apt till  am almost every night  Good luck sleeping  Not bar downstairs  its a club  Goes almost   nights till  am  Good luck sleeping 
627129594,When arriving to the apartment I noticed the floors were very sticky so I took it upon myself to sweep and mop  The mop water came out brown  There was also hair that was not mine in the bed  This was disappointing since I had messaged the host requesting an early check in but was told no because the place needed to be cleaned but I arrived to a not clean place  Other than that it wasnt too bad 
512688252,First the good  this house is in a great neighborhood   Lots of restaurants and things to do   The apartment also has three large bedrooms   However  the unit is not well maintained   First  the unit does not have its own internet router   The internet is taken from a business on the first floor  the unit is on the third floor    The reception was so weak we could not connect our devices   Even worse  the TV is on a sling  so the TV did not work because the internet did not work   Other problems  when we arrived the deadlock was exposed  in other words the steel plate was not installed  which I imagine is a security problem  though Im no expert   The overhead light did not work in the living room and a light was burned out in one of the living room   Maybe the worst is that the host simply did not respond when I pointed out the internet problem  I didnt even bother raising the other issues    Basically  this place had the potential to be great  but mismanagement made it a disappointment for me and my friends   This apartment does not have its own Internet   It uses it from a business located on the first floor  but the apartment was on the third floor  and the reception was terrible   The TV had sling  not cable  so the apartment was without internet and without cable the entire stay   We only got the code when I specifically asked a couple hours prior to check in  The host did not respond when I pointed out that there was no Internet and no cable  actually having the amenities posted 
635512070,Pending    Follow up contact was less than desirable 
633015624,I would never suggest booking with this host  They are very dishonest and will not respond to legit concerns  Our place did not have lights in the bathroom for   days  They never came out to fix it  We had to use our phones as flashlights to shower  They told us that it was not an emergency  Who does that   There was only one set of towels for   adults  Our reservation got changed a day before we came into town  I tried reaching out to the host only to be ignored  They are very shady and I will never stay at their properties in the future  They ruined my first time in St  Louis  Also the photos that they post is all smoke and mirrors  The place is sooooo much smaller than the pictures depict  Cheaply made furniture and there was damage to the property as soon as we got there  The bathroom had a dirty tub and dried up poop stuck on the toilet  Renters Beware     You guys suck  You ruined me and my friends first visit to St  Louis  I will never be back  I hope you all are happy with my hard earned money  Businesses like yours will never prosper because all you care about is money and not the actual person  I saved up for months for this trip just to have it ruined  I hope you can sleep well at night knowing how you operate your business   Our booking got switched the day we came into town  This was not our original booking  They moved us from the heart of downtown to the   Hood    They would not respond to any messages about the mix up  We were forced to stay there because they only wanted to refund less than half of our money  I will definitely be contacting the Better Business Bureau about this host and Air B B   We had no lights in the bathroom for three days  They told us that it was not an emergency and that they wouldnt be able to fix it  We had to shower and get dressed using our phones as flashlights  I was hosting this trip for my friends  can you imagine how embarrassing this whole experience was    The placed us in a bad neighborhood  This was not the original listing that I signed up for  I paid almost      to stay   days in a cramped  dirty  dark apartment  I will never rent with Zencity again  I took so many pictures to back up what took place  I also have every screenshot from the constant contact that I tried to make with the host  Very unprofessional and dismissive 
607405331,This place has a lot of potential if they clean it up and get some better furnishings in it   The furniture thats in the picture isnt the same in some rooms   It needs a thorough cleaning  This was my first bad Airbnb experience  You have to do a better job at maintaining cleanliness  The furnishings need to be fixed and updated  This listing doesnt Have the same furnishings as the pictures   The places needs a thorough cleaning 
634334623,Do not book  You will get a roulette of apartments none of which will be cleaned  Do yourself a favor  dont book with Zencity  Wow   This is not the unit I booked on air bnb  This is a false advertisement with no contact with the host what so ever  
634255763,If you want to wait outside the unit for an hour and have soaking wet carpet that smells awful this is the place for you  The only thing that was good about this Airbnb was the kitchen  I suggest making sure everything actually works and smells nice in your units before giving them to visitors  Carpet was soaking wet and left an awful smell  and air conditioning did not work   Lock did not work to get into unit  Had to wait an hour to be switched to a different unit that seemed like they just cleaned while we were waiting  I would reccomend this place be listed at    
670210965,Unfortunately  we had a male use the key code we had to come into the house and as two sisters staying there  it was very unsettling  The next morning we also found cockroaches  If these two incidents were taken care of and prevented  then I would recommend this place but cannot until this is dealt with  We had a man break into the house using the same key code that you gave us  He came into the house and closed the door before we got over to the stairs and he let us know he was in the wrong house  While this seemed to be an innocent mistake  there have been people who use this approach to check to see if a house is a good place to come back to and burglarize  My sister and I did not feel safe in this house after that and its very concerning that someone else would have the same key code that we did to this place  I messaged you immediately and never heard a response which is also very disappointing   The next morning we also found cockroaches in the kitchen drawers  the brown banded ones  Im not sure why we would be paying an     cleaning fee  which Im sure each customer is paying and still find cockroaches in a house   Both of these were very disappointing because both of us were very excited to stay and were ready to book again until these two incidents occurred  Check in communication was great  I however did not get any response to my concerns about someone breaking into the house 
651044591,The apartment is smelly   elevator is dirty   nasty   common area is just horrendous  Parking is difficult to find   street parking   I paid      for two horrible nights  Read the cleaning fee and parking accommodations before renting   not worth it   
650182512,Do not rent from these people They are liars and deceivers  What they advertise is a lie  I have a medical condition which excludes me for the governor of wearing a mask I went into the building and was thrown out of the  building because I couldnt wear a mask  They did not tell me this  Nothing was open as they advertise it was  And they wanted to charge my account without my approval when I never stayed in the room  Beware there are plenty of places do not spend it with these people they will steal your money and will not give you a refund  Beware You are the worst place I have ever engaged  Your lies and your deception will catch up with you  Taking money from peoples accounts and lying to them is unacceptable and it will come back to you   They lied about everything they advertised nothing was open  Terrible just terrible just terribleTerrible No  These people lied about this place  False advertisement  I never stayed at the place and yet they still wanted to charge me on my credit card and I never authorized it  Dont stay with these people
651009021,Be very wary when booking your stay  Online description does not fit  Very rude and unhelpful  They will not assist you to make your stay comfortable especially during hard times No comment
634282975,This air bnb is not the nicest or prettiest air bnb  It looks like the pictures but when you get to the space youll realize it is actually much older than it seems in pictures  When we moved in there was no A C  That is a major problem as it was said in the description of the bnb that there was A C  It took days to even get a temporary fix on this problem and communication was very slow  They ended up providing two portable A C units  did not cool the whole house so we had to flip a coin every night for who would get A C   The living room temp unit they provided leaked so they provided a bucket and told us we had to dump it every day  This air bnb isnt the worst day but definitely not the best  If you only plan to be in your air bnb to sleep then go for it    The apartment does look very similar to the pictures but when you arrive you u    ll notice the apartment is much older than it appears in pictures  There was no A  C in the apartment when we moved in  although it said there was A  C on the amenities list when we booked  This was a major flaw that was not fixed during our stay  They provided a couple of temporary A  C units  One they provided leaked and they informed us we would have to dump the bucket of water that it leaked every day  This was the biggest issue in staying here and resulted in a very early termination of our stay   Sometimes responses would be slow which was unfortunate because we had a major A C problem and would have to call many times to receive a response  A C in the summer is definitely considered emergency maintenance but we had to wait days before we received even a temporary fix  They had no communication on when there would be an actual fix to the A C problem  Before you book here I would definitely call to make sure theres A C  You get what you pay for in this listing 
636931679,Make sure WiFi works before you check in  mine didnt work for a entire   night stay  Also be weary of a heavy smell in the bathroom from something unknown   No WiFi  dirty dishes were unexpected  also who would expect a stinky bathroom  Working WiFi and not a stench in the bathroom of mold or something dead
641163310,DO NOT BOOK HERE   Host is unhelpful and apartment was not clean  This was the worst experience I have ever encountered on Airbnb   To add to my frustration I saw that multiple other guests had posted similar issues regarding cleanliness   I booked this at an advertised      night and was charged         night  Room was not clean Marty was evasive in his responses and unproductive in solving the problems Clean conditions  responsive host  amenities that demonstrated the host actually wanted their guest to feel comfortable   No detergent for the dishwasher or washing machine
231309932,This is probably the worst place and the worst experience I have had in using Airbnb       I had to stood in freezing Chicago winter night for over half hour because the check in instruction does not work  He did not want to give the backup option until all the efforts he told me to try failed  including to warm up the lock by rubbing  breathe and banging it  Imagining doing all these after a long flight in the a freezing night of winter Chicago      Despite I told him that my phone with Airbnb app was going to battery out  please call me on the other phone  He stayed on Airbnb msg only  Luckily  my other phone just had data plan in  Otherwise  I might have to stand in the cold all night or arrange alternative       The interior room is not as clean as the picture  It is probably due to old units and poor house keeping  Some of the things on the wall  for example the intercom  is half falling  The hallway  stairway  and elevator are just unbearably dirty and scary  When I come back from work  I work late   I felt like in a horror movie       I regret booking with   weeks up front  He charges     of payment for all the rest night if I check out early  disregarding how many days ahead of the final check out date       On the last day  my meeting went longer because we need to surely wrap up some works  I missed the check out time by an hour and half  He charged additional fee right way when I arrived airport  I acknowledge that check out time is a a upfront rule  However  given a   weeks good deal for him  it is not unreasonable to expect him to have a bit grace   The check in incident and the shabby hallway  interior were bugging already  On top of that  despite a great deal for you with my two weeks stay  you want to charge additional for I missing the check out time  I will just return a straight frank host with frank honest comments     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements 
622155959,Wouldnt recommend this unit   AC is malfunctioning in bedroom and dust was so bad that I had to turn off both AC units   Literally got a sore throat from only staying inside unit during quarantine   And couldnt sleep with windows open by of downtown traffic noise Checked in about issues with ac unit and dust in heater   No response   Can not recommend this unit and contacting AirBNB for resolution
641165332,WARNING  For our entire stay the apartment flooded   There was a lot of water that was coming in from the walls and eventually went into the master bedroom and completely soaked the carpet to the point we couldnt walk on it  The hallway was filled with water  The host never once fixed the issue  They said they would get maintenance there and never did  We had to deal with the flooding and actually use our own towels to clean it up since there was not enough   The host is now ignoring my messages despite sending them proof of all the flooding  which they have known about since another guest stated it flooded during their stay as well  I would highly recommend staying somewhere else as this may flood during your stay as well   and the host is not in any rush to help fix it or make it right  It is clear they do not care about their guests safety satisfaction  Horrible experience  I will not be booking with ZenCity again  Instead of trying to make money  put your guests firsts  I have tried to be patient and kind to you throughout this experience and your company has done nothing but ignore the fact you allowed us to stay in a flooded apartment and did NOTHING to help us  You refuse to provide us a refund and ignore my messages  I will never rent from your company again  Host was not concerned at all about the flooding issue happening in our apartment during our stay   was told there was nothing we could do as the apartment hallway completely flooded as well as bedroom floor was soaking wet  Did not even provide extra towels as we had to use our own to clean it up  Never once sent maintenance and never once tried to refund us for all the issues  The host knew of flooding issues happening in the apartment from January and still has this place listed knowing it may flood when it rains 
640108989,A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet  A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet   A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet   When I communicated to the Host about the room they stopped replying  False Advertisement Not worth the stay 
622465106,They changed my Airbnb   hours before but wouldnt reply to my messages or questions regarding it  so I went ahead and went to the new Airbnb provided by them and it was dirty with hair everywhere and a pair or socks under the bed that wasnt mine   Lets me know it wasnt cleaned properly  I had multiple questions regarding my stay and they never replied even after they changed my Airbnb they didnt even respond  Not changing the Airbnb   hours before before check in  Actually respond to people thats paying money that have questions  Actually clean the place especially with the virus going around  
659659784,RODENT INFESTATION    UNCLEAN    UNSAFE    TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE    Mouse seen in the kitchen  Rodent traps already placed in the utility closet  Sticky floors  Dirty walls  Towels smelled like cigarette smoke  No salt  pepper  or cooking oil provided as advertised  I am still waiting for a call from management that I was told would happen  and my refund for staying in a rodent infested apartment Stopped responding to issue altogether Good location  Being clean and having described amenities would have helped
661173417,No WiFi the whole stay  Couldnt work  couldnt use Netflix or any streaming service  The apartment smelled like sewage every single night to the point we didnt even want to be in our room    However the location cannot be beat  Hoping for them that this just happened to be an off week   
645461541,Let me first start by saying that i hadnt checked into my stay until       PM on July   st        and I checked in with a very pleasant woman    The walls themselves were dirty and we noticed the second we walked in  but we didnt pay much attention  When i walked into the bedroom the towels were dingy and hair hair in them  The shower curtain was yellow and orange  with hair in the shower as well  There were dirty handprints above the bed I was expected to sleep in  In The kitchen  the sponge was not replaced so I can only imagine how dirty the dishes were  In the unc leaned freezer  the ice tray was half full and look as if it was used as an ashtray or something   the previous occupants left   uncased beer  And the microwave was BARELY in working condition  There was a fist print in the refrigerator and the A C was not dusted  Immediately upon noticing all of these things  I contacted a Zencity rep through the Airbnb app and he had me send pictures and seemed as if he wanted to be helpful  It was going smooth until I was told that he  didnt understand what was wrong from the pictures that I sent  so I called  While on hold on the FIRST call  I walked downstairs to speak with the lady that I checked in with  but she was no longer there there was a young man and he was very helpful he provided me a different number  One that I hadnt called already  I got a little further this call  they told me they they would have a property manager call me  I ATTEMPTED to express my concerns with him   frustrated  YES  frantic  YES because it was very hard to even get to speak with him  He immediately cut me off and said  maam  maam   you need to calm down  and proceeded to tell me how he had complaints about me harassing and threatening door staff   which NEVER happened  Even after everything was settled I spoke with the gentleman who only gave me a phone number and was MORE than compassionate and understanding  the Property manager that I spoke with  Gary  told me that security was notified of these false allegations and that they were going to come up and  AND I QUOTE   DRAG me off the property  Im not sure if thats how they run their business but I want no parts and I dont want anyone else to have to encounter this unprofessional business    Not to mention the time i was lied to    When speaking with the Zencity rep through the AirBNB app  he told me that the room was cleaned THE DAY that I checked in            but the whiteboard posted had the date           on it      All in all AirBNB was extremely helpful in getting me my money back  he was friendly and responded to me in a very timely manner so that i wasnt without somewhere to stay my first night in Chicago  He even gave me a voucher for my next stay  So i was satisfied in the end 
661712765,If you like access to TV or internet  do not stay here   No TV and no internet after repeated conversations with Zencity   TV and internet are basic amenities that were not provided as advertised
719772540,So so
447989700,To be honest  this was MY WORST AirBNB EXPERIENCE  I was completely shocked because I use AirBNB more than the typical hotel   Ive never experienced anything like this through AirBNB  For starters  check in was a little off  You had to go from one building to another just to retrieve the key  I was traveling with Uber   extra stops means more money paid  Im sure they are able to install a similar lockbox with check in keys in the actual building where the guest will be staying  Also  this listing needs more cookware for the kitchen  Being vegan  I make my own meals   would have had to buy a set of knives   other utensils if I decided to cook  My biggest issue was dealing with the unprofesional employees that I had to communicate with during my stay  They made my stay extremely stressful  Their responses were very slow which caused me to almost be in really bad position outside on the streets with no where to go   I had to threaten to leave a   star rating to get any assistance from a manager and the problems just continued even after I was gone  This is a long review but it isnt even HALF of what I experienced while being here  It all would be too long to describe in full  I did enjoy the speaker they had in the apartment  the location   the decor  Wouldnt stay with Zencity again   def wouldnt recommend to anyone else Check in was super inconvenient Poor customer service
661736974,   Room was not the room pictured   Had no hot water going into our  rd day of stay  Called  messaged  pretty much told to sit and wait until someone showed up 
662439756,So first of all let me just say the place is beautiful but it absolutely is not what they have shown in the pictures   The whole entire layout is different and it looks like theres a balcony but there is not  Second of all I got there and the air conditioning didnt work at all  I reached out to the host and they said they would contact maintenance and bring me fans  They also said they would give me a partial refund for my inconvenience  I NEVER RECEIVED EITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS  It was    degrees In Kansas City when I arrived  I was literally drenched in sweat before I even unpacked a single thing  In the beginning the host was very responsive and I truly thought I would get at least the fans and hopefully my  partial refund  that THEY suggested to give me  I honestly am so disappointed in the way they handled this situation because I have stayed in a different air bnb through Zencity and didnt have a single issue so I thought the experience would be great  Honestly  if they would have at least brought the fans I wouldnt be so upset  It was soooo not  They have been ignoring me ever since I checked out and have yet to give me my refund as promised  I do not understand why they handled this the way they did but I definitely wont be booking any more AirBnBs through these people  The location was great though  very close to everything but thats about it  You guys are so unprofessional for the way you handled my stay  No air conditioning  it never got fixed and you said you would bring me fans and give me a partial refund and I never received either of those things  I will be notifying Air BNB and figuring out how I can get my refund because this is absolutely ridiculous
662952749,Apartment was different then listing and got water didnt work
662410507,This was our  st First booking with Airbnb  Considering Covid   and the disclaimers stating additional cleaning will be done  That was Not the case  We had to use our Clorox cleaning wipes to clean the bathrooms  the kitchen  the refrigerator Ect  The floors were not clean  The rug wasnt vacuumed  There was a dirty air filter in the laundry room just sitting there for who knows how long  The corners of the bathrooms havent been cleaned in a longtime  There were chip bags under the beds  I reached out to Zencity provided pictures and they said theres nothing they can do  They charge a cleaning fee but the apartment wasnt cleaned for our stay  After several calls and emails they said they cant do anything  All I asked is to be refunded the cleaning fee  They refuse to make this right  I will Not be booking with this company again  Waiting for Stuart which is a supervisor to contact me back   This was our  st First booking with Airbnb  Considering Covid   and the disclaimers stating additional cleaning will be done  That was Not the case  We had to use our Clorox cleaning wipes to clean the bathrooms  the kitchen  the refrigerator  The floors were not clean  The rug wasn u    t vacuumed  There was a dirty air filter in the laundry room just sitting there  The corners of the bathrooms haven u    t been cleaned in a longtime  There were chip bags under the beds  I reached out to Zencity provided pictures and they said there u    s nothing they can do  They charge a cleaning fee but the apartment wasn u    t cleaned for our stay  After several calls and emails they said they can u    t do anything  All I asked is to be refunded the cleaning fee  They refuse to make this right  I will Not be booking with this company again   They blew me off by saying well investigate and get back to you  That never happened and they knew they werent going to help me  They even stalled so I cant even get help from Airbnb  This is not okay all  Just be honest with people  We spent over        for our   day stay  Honesty goes along way  You shouldnt waist peoples time
619430171,The place was a mess from the previous guests  Obviously the cleaners didnt come through  I contacted the host and didnt get a reply until I contacted air bnb directly  He assured me the cleaners would come the next day  we had to scramble to find a place to stay somewhere else the first night because there was no clean bedding or towels or detergent to wash them  In the morning he again did not reply to my messages about a refund for the first night or when I also asked what time the cleaners would be by because they still werent there by       pm  He didnt respond until I contacted air bnb directly again and they got me a new place to stay and a full refund  Air bnb came through and helped me out a lot but I can not say that for the host here
661296240,The apartment is a basement apartment where the bedroom window was left open  the window screen was up and was not able to be locked which is concerning   The apartment otherwise was fine  but I couldnt get past the safety concern with anyone being able to have access into the bedroom of this apartment   I left and stayed in a hotel but was still charged the price for the majority of the stay for my booking   which should not be the case as I left for safety concerns   The apartment is a basement apartment where the bedroom window was left open and was not able to be locked which is concerning   poor customer service when I had a safety concern with the host
701177315,The actual unit received was not the same as the picture   There was a flood in the unit during the stay   While the Zencity representative was very nice  no compensation was offered despite the major inconvenience of a serious flood and resulting smell   A discount should have been provided 
492919137,I would not choose to stay here again  Upon arriving the directions were great describing where the lockbox was but  locating our room took a bit  A message about where the stairwell was located and that it was on the second floor would have been helpful  I read the reviews saying the place was very clean but  unfortunately I entered to find a studio apartment with no couch  as it was listed   a white comforter that was stained up quite a bit speckled with black curly hairs when pulling back the sheets  The bathroom also had black hairs in the shower to match  The coffee pot as described in amenities was a French press that had a broken plunger making it useless for coffee  I attempted to use the hair dryer that was provided in the bathroom as I didnt bring my own  I turned it on and it began to smoke  Thankfully my trip was short  I spent a total of   hrs here for a total of       I would have been better off sleeping in my car 
441075293,This was by far my worst AirBnB experience and I can only advise everybody else to not make the same mistake and book the apartment   The entire apartment was extremely unhygienic and dirty   there were hairs and even traces of food in both of the beds  In addition  the floor had obviously not been cleaned and the table in the living room was so dirty that we couldnt even put our things on it   When I informed Zencity about these issues  they did not take any action  regardless of the exorbitant price that we paid for the apartment  Once I brought attention to this problem again  they stopped replying at all  so dont except any cooperation or assistance from their side  Is that how you treat your customers   The final disappointed happened the day of our check out  We were supposed to leave at    am  However  Zencitys cleaning staff entered the apartment about half an hour earlier without a warning  At that time  I was coming right out of the shower  covered with nothing but a towel  I felt extremely violated in my privacy   All in all  our stay has been beyond terrible and I certainly cant recommend neither the apartment nor the host  I am still waiting to hear back from you 
704655876,Something I Didnt Expect
660334756,If safety  cleanliness and communication is important to you I wouldnt suggest booking  Photos are deceiving  I left and canceled Not even knowing where I would go  But I knew I wasnt going to stay there  Please take the time to go to place and look around  Would you want your family Coming from out of town to stay here or experience  bad communication or for place to not be ready at time stated on booking  I suggest serious upgrade s including entry and inform people to be careful in this area  Cleaning is so important especially during this COVID   times and I m disappointed that this is Not top priority with your company   The photos in add don u    t show stains dirty window and the bad area  Thank  I asked for early check in since I was driving from out of town when i booked  Didnt get a response so I assumed it was alright  I was told I couldnt and place wouldnt be ready at the time stated I could check in  They would notify me  They didnt notify me at all Horrible at communicating  Question s asked at booking NOT answered  Even asked several times with no response i was told they would notify me when place was ready  Sat out front for        No response Area looks very unsafe  People around and going in and out of building  suspicious  looking  Dirty and not so neat looking surroundings  For the area and the looks of the place   dirty furniture and carpet  price was a little high  I expected  better 
310634719,The apartment that sleeps   was newly renovated   had great possibilities   We had a group of   staying here  Brian Host did great allowing us an early check  in as we all came in to Chicago for my sons wedding weekend   Brian informed me a couple hours prior to arrival that the some of the shades   a bedroom door had been ruined by guests the night before  He also told me later that a towel rack had been torn down by them    Brian said he tentatively fixed all those items but had to get special parts for all before they could be permanently fixed   Unfortunately  the towel rack wouldnt stay up  the door wouldnt shut   the windows in the common area didnt all have shades   Shortly after we all arrived we realized that there were only   place settings of dishes  cups  plates  cereal bowls   I sent my husband to the store to pick up some paper products to get us by   When he returned we realized there were no serving dishes or serving utensils   As we started to get ready for the rehearsal dinner  we found only   bath towels  no wash cloths     hand towel in the   bathrooms    I messaged Brian on this right away and reminded him we had   people staying there   Brian never responded       Later we also realized the only bed pillows were the ones in shams not pillow cases  For the   sofa beds we were only able to find   set of sheets  There were   pillows found but only   pillow case    It was bad enough that the towel rack  shades  door had been ruined but then not to have the necessary towels  linens   dishes was unacceptable for a unit that was available for up to   people   Then to have the host not acknowledge my message on the shortage of bath towels  washcloths   dishes was very unprofessional   It really makes me question the integrity of the host   I am very embarrassed that I asked special friends to stay with us at this Airbnb    Listed to sleep   people however we had   people in our group   There were only   bath towels provided    hand towel  no wash cloths for   bathrooms   There was only   coffee cups    plates     cereal bowls  No serving bowls  platters  utensils  pans  There were no dish towels only dish cloths were in a cupboard   Brian provided the code prior to an early check in request  And he informed me that the place was damaged by drunken guests the night before our stay was to begin  Though he said he tentatively attached the towel rack that had been ripped off the wall  it didnt stay attached   Brian didnt respond when I alerted him that we didnt have enough towels or dishes for the number of guests       though he listed the place was for up to   guests   I had informed Brian months ago that the   of us were coming into town for my sons wedding  Unbelievable that a host would not respond to apologize   personally deliver what was needed since we were already staying in a damaged apartment  
616391083,Horrible host  not worth the money for the smell  broken toilet and dirty sunken couch  Dont recommend zen city at all stay away  Overlooked and ignored my questions 
717288295,Unsanitary bathroom and bedroom  Small and large hairs all over the shower  clearly not cleaned   Small and large hairs all over the linen  Not cleaned properly   Cleaning supplies found in the place were  fresheners   No laundry soap for the washer  Likely does not have proper cleaning supplies  ex laundry detergent  to clean between stays  Hot water for shower did not work well  Had to cancel stay    Host did let me retrieve forgotten item   Hot water in shower did not work  Poor insulation Had to get a full refund through Airbnb because owner was not willing to fulfill request  Hot water in shower did not work  Wanted us to clean  Very very unsanitary 
717152522,the price was attractive for   bed  BUT     the unit is in poor condition meaning  the sofa is broken and not practical to seat  bedroom pillows are suggy and old  no hangers cleaningness is on the bad side   over all good location easy to get in  but if Im paying tjis amount expected to get practical thing for my comfort   its annoying me to see that the sofa is completely broken  and NO one care   someone clean the home and notice it for sure  you need to update your unit  sofa is broken and not practical  bedroom pillows are old saggy and grows  missing blinds at guest bedroom  no hangers for clothes  cleaningness of unit is bad especially the floor was with guie spots and unit smell funky  had to buy refresher to unit and open windows   broken sofa  stools too  the quality and condition of unit is poor for the money i payed 
667081096,  
668104642,Nice place  quiet and clean   Poor rehab work and finishing  poor HVAc drainage contributing to organic growth  poor shower cleaning full of mildew and growth   Light switches dont operate logically  different rooms operate switches from other rooms and so on  very poor electrical work 
664059334,Good location  older home with very steep skinny steps so no older people should rent this location  Also old tub hard for my father in law to use  I already messaged him privately  Photos were not in accurate they were just very bright and made the place look newer and nicer than it was 
701831562,   Turn both locks clockwise   the door knob is fixed and wont ever turn from the outside  This took us some figuring  While this unit does not allow smoking  it has been smoked in previously and the smell of stale cigarettes was strong and permeated our clothing after staying there  The neighborhood is awesome and the kitchen is a little bare  no measuring cups  for instance  but there is a toaster and coffee pot   but has new appliances  The dishwasher wont run unless the switch on the wall is activated  Good place to stay if the price is right  but there are lots of  pretty thoughtful  college students around so things can get a little lively on the weekends  They neighbors were really friendly and helpful when we had issues unlocking the door of the unit and the neighborhood is great  The floors throughout the building are incredibly loud  you can hear every movement in the upstairs unit   Perhaps this is already priced into the unit  but it certainly wasnt obvious when we were booking  Also  the light fixture in the main  living  room would not full illuminate on our last day   it could be the lightbulbs  as they would glow slightly but never fully light up    Thanks for letting us stay at your place    Again  the unit has been smoked in and there are holes in the floors   While the host sent instructions on the lock box location  which were helpful  We found  as others had described in their reviews  that working the lots on the door took some insight and understanding  both locks require the key to be turned clockwise and the knob is fixed from the outside   which was frustrating  We figured it out  but it took about    minutes and several conversations with other tenants at      am  A guide book in the unit would be very helpful  There are idiosynchrasies to the unit that took effort to figure out   including that fact that the dishwasher is only activated when a switch in the kitchen is turned to  on   Chiefly  not being smoked in  With cleaning fee included  one could stay at a decent hotel downtown for a similar price and not smell like smoke 
705945239,The location is the best part of the apartment  Its a nice street well illuminated close to bars and restaurants  The bathroom however is the worst part of the apartment  The rest of the apartment is okay   The photos are taken to show a nice bathroom  When we arrived the bathroom was not as portrayed as in the pictures  It was older  uglier and dirty   The rest of the apartment was okay   I had booked an apartment for one day and then cancelled and booked another apartment for a week  I thought I was booking with  another host but it was the same person  They provided me with the wrong address and caused some confusion in the beginning but nothing too upsetting with checkin  The host took a little while to help us understand what was happening  see problems above  but then responded quickly  The location is perfect but this was not a pleasant stay and not worth my money 
672163291,AirBnB ers  please beware of this apartment  If your intention is to stay at a place that is clean this is not the place to stay  The bed linens were infested with hair from previous occupants  not just the one before us  but throughout the existence of this air bnb   They also smelled of body odor  The bathrooms were DIRTY with stains and hairs  It seemed as if the counter tops had not even been wiped down  There was an awful stench throughout the apartment  almost of sewage   The walls and baseboards are dirty and full of dust  The overall condition of the apartment is filthy and not worth a penny of your money  The views through the  very tall  windows are inaccessible if youre below    but beautiful if you meet the height requirement just be careful  you might inhale a dead bug from the windowsill s  that was never wiped away  The host does not respond quickly  The location is great  but the apartment is not worth the location  Inaccurate description of the cleanliness of the apartment   The photos depicted a clean space but that is not at all what my family and I walked in to   Delayed responses Accuracy of description and cleanliness of the space
660246068,Booked for two nights   stayed less than an hour due to  critters  as he calls it on the pillow  I was told to cancel my booking which would result in me receiving none of my money back for a place I didnt even stay in  Besides the bugs the place is beautiful 
700419721,Dont stay here  Its not like the pictures Re evaluate the units door  Its broken and anyone could have gotten into that elevator and up to the room levels and kicked it in   In the inner city and there was so description of that  Photos looked much more modern and cleaner than the place was  The amenities listed were there  like a microwave and a fully loaded kitchen  We couldn u    t even make ramen noodles   I feel like we shouldve been told that we would be more downtown  I almost got my purse stolen a block away  For it to be what I expected  More modern and secure  The door was wiggly because it was broken 
659124602,Great view and location but needs deep cleaned badly  I had to send in many pictures of uncleanliness  The sheets in one of the bedrooms had pubic and strands of hair on them  Upon arrival  we were forces to wash the linen to both of the beds  sweep floors  and clean spider webs from the walls and window ceilings  Lots of scuff marks on the walls  The location and scenery outdoors were amazing  Unfortunately  the place needs some deep cleaning and a new couch  The couch is filthy and we had to place a comforter on it before sitting on it  It was disgusting 
653885905,Make sure you take pictures of things look suspicious to ensure you dont get charge for anything you didnt do Not trying to charge me for a smoking fee when I did nothing of the sort
633653625,Dont expect much
717300131,Do not rent from them   I was giving crappy check in instructions then asked cancel with the print of full refund only to be scammed       You wrong for not giving me my   back knowing I never stepped foot on your place but its ok because nothing good will come your way for scamming me        Wasn u    t replying right away  Check in didnt work   days straight   The host had me to cancel stating Id get my full refund only to then not agree to give it back   I never stepped foot inside here  still did not get my   back   I had to call more then once to get response   No parking Horrible host money hungry 
717719008,Th hey had damages to the apartment and blamed me for it and the host kept messaging about a party and there was only me and my sisters there  He disturbed us the entire time  I was bothered all night about things already discussed before the booking  The couch and chairs were broken
627469989,Not bad place  Thought it was a little bigger  Went in the middle of a riot but over all  Its a pretty decent place We called zencity and told about our issue and they told us they cant do anything about it We was in the middle of the riot downtown in st  Louis tried to call and let some one know  Nobody even got back with me  We didnt stay out second night and had to going somewhere else to sleep
610540497,Unsafe practices  other people had access to my unit  belongings were moved and an item stolen    Stay at your own risk  Your company utilizes unsafe business practices and seems to care very little about guest safety 
719460988,Great location  STOP   No heat for   days except for a on bedroom space heart   Freezing   Workers can two different times   Could not fix first time night  Finally got it working the  rd day but left the work mess    Loud clanging radiators all through the night  like a bunch of spoons rolling around in a dryer  that were trying to work but didnt  Unbearably loud   Arrived to dirty dishwasher  soiled living room furniture  toilets that take two flushes to get  residue  down the chute  door knobs coming off    I mean  yes the location is great but this entire experience has been more than disappointing  This place was NOT ready to rent   no heat  old apartment  
669134716,This place was not cleaned at all prior to me arriving  Floor was dirty and sticky  The entire place was dirty  Had it been cleaned  There was a quiet time but the entire building was loud 
544215359,This apartment is in a great location and is very affordable  however it is not clean and is falling apart at the seams  There was mold and mildew everywhere  The refrigerator was covered in something that resembled vomit  The bathroom sink wouldnt drain and was leaking from its base  The curtain rods and bathroom rods were falling off the walls  probably due to the moisture causing the mold  The owner dismissed my concerns and said the appliances were just old  Old and dirty are two completely different things 
717986524,Checked in very late after driving    hours  still couldnt find it in me to stay  Absolute filth  The lockbox was jammed  instructions complex  parking was scarce  neighborhood sketch  but the icing on the shit cake was the condo itself  Floors have never been mopped  carpets had NEVER been vacuumed  Toilet had pee in it and wouldnt flush  It felt like someone had left their dirty house unexpectedly and then we checked in  The tv was on  couch was clearly recently slept on  dirty laundry in the bedrooms  Trash in the cans and they had the nerve to leave one piece of paper on the paper towel roll as decoration  AVOID THIS PLACE   
104844919,The apartment was an overal letdown  The listing was advertised to have things like a gym and laundry room  Both were currently not available for guests  There were no curtains in the bedroom with bright lampposts in front of the window  Little things such as the internet password were no where to be found  meaning I had to contact the host  Upstairs and downstairs neighbours are loud  amplified in with an older building  The apartment was not particularly clean  especially the bathrooms  Chris tried to help where he could  Curtains were fixed and he was very responsive  However  it didnt chance the fact that I checked into a hotel after a number of nights  Not a place I would recommend if youre planning to stay for a couple of weeks for business    Limited number of photos do not give a good overall impression of the apartment  Amenities were not there as advertised    House manual of some sort would be useful  Especially if internet is down as was in my case   Chris was quick in his responses  Location is great  It is a main road through downtown so can be busy throughout the night  
72338679,The location of this one bedroom flat was terrific  close by the  Red Line  subway   high end shopping  Water Tower Place  is nearby     s of bars and restaurants of all sorts are also right around the corner  Rush Street    The apartment was clean  everything worked   My stay was on a Sunday evening and I could hear music coming from outside  a bar nearby  But it didnt last past       PM or so       To summarize  this is the perfect place for the location  but amenities were non existent  no information about the wifi connections such as in a  welcome book of instructions to the flat  were to be found  I had to call to find out the password  and the outside scaffolding on the building Im sure will not be up forever          
718098013,Really wish it was a better experience for my first interaction with Zencity   The pictures implicated that the room was a lot bigger 
717715230,I would not recommend this company or property to anyone  Horrible holiday trip for the amount of money I spent  One issue after another with no response from any member of management  Pictures are deceiving  waste of time and money for my daughter and I   There was one towel  it actually had shampoo and conditioner  There was no working lights in bedroom or working ceiling fan  The bed sheets were a wrinkled mess  There was no extra pillows  sheets or even an extra blanket  The pictures clearly were better than in actuality    I called several times to let management know about problems and I was very unhappy with room  I was told he was in a meeting  which apparently lasted the entire day  This was a terrible night that got worse in the am  To begin my holiday stay I was welcomed by an elevator that did not allow me to use it so I end up waking seven flights of stairs to my room  This continues as trip is still in progress  Several people were and called with no response except manager was in a meeting  I tried to reach out to remedy the issues and find a new place however no one has responded to my emails or calls  It is very inconvenient to deal with all the issues when a large amount of money was paid  Tried to enjoy a holiday trip  instead Im stuck here till I checkout  I wouldnt recommend Zencity  unfortunately I didnt research the properties or the company 
435872809,Pros     Building has an elevator    Quiet most of the time  after   PM really quiet    Apartment has most amenities  stove top and oven  big fridge  iron and ironing table    Close to Target and CVS Pharmacy  Some restaurants nearby  Also close to Mccormick center     min drive away    Apartment is big  with   bathrooms    Cons    Apartment was really dirty  there was dirt and hair everywhere  even on the walls  Really never saw such a dirty apartment  The windows were almost opaque with grime  Also it smelled quite bad  The bathtub was dirty and the drain was clogged     Interior is really  really old  by the way  old does not necessarily mean vintage  with dirty carpets  dirty couch  dirty windows and cracked walls  Most doors did not close shut    I had heat in the apartment for   days out of    Due to the cold temperature in the apartment  I caught a cold    Lack of toiletries  only shampoo and shower gel were present    The lock on the entrance door is quite flimsy  would not leave valuables inside unattended   The apartment has very old  not vintage   decaying furnishings  Cracks everywhere  doors were not closing shut  There was no soap at the sink or bathtub  Bathtub had a clogged drain  Had to  buy soap  Draino and Lysol  to clean the bathtub    Cleaning  toiletries  proper heating and refurbishing 
203830343,I was disappointed with this accommodation  The apartment was not clean and smelled like smoke  We booked for two days  but only stayed for one  We stayed the second night at a hotel  The listing said the apartment slept three people  but there was only one blanket so my friend and I shared the bed and the blanket  Great location   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  Additional comments   We were unable to get in touch with the host on the day we checked in      Very expensive for what it was   
709780708,Super annoying    if we put Music in that tv she was text me   min later       we cant even Watch a movie in peace          that place is nice just not clean we had to clean myself to feel Good      
435869528,I did not have a good experience with Zencity  Upon my arrival to the apartment I found the back door facing the alleyway partially open and unlocked  Unable to figure out the locking mechanism I called for assistance  The call center could not help me  Between that and the extremely noisy neighbor I opted to stay elsewhere that night   They suggested different fixes throughout the day the next day  all of which I had tried  until their last suggestion was something new and actually worked to fix the door   My main concern was that Zencity never sent someone to check on the issue and seemed unable to do so even if they had wanted to   The inability to respond to guest issues and emergencies will be why I will most likely not stay with Zencity in the future  The biggest issue with my stay was that I was unable to lock the back door my first night  The apartment was easily accessible from the back alley  The people I called were unable to help me resolve the issue so for my safety I was forced to spend the night elsewhere  spending an extra      at the only available hotel in the vicinity  Over the course of the next day they were able to find someone who knew how to operate the unusual lock  In the future please be sure to have your cleaning staff secure the door or leave instructions for guests on how to do so as the lock is not intuitive  Responsive but not located in the area so unable too assist with any issues  Also did not know who to contact to give me assistance with issues 
413624553,I hate to write negative reviews and I pretty much never do  but I was really disappointed in my stay at this apartment and it negatively affected my experience in Chicago     The unit was run down     I felt unsafe in the unit  I am a small     person  and I could have easily kicked the door down i e  the bolt lock on the door wouldnt have actually prevented someone from breaking into the unit     The bathroom sink and bathroom tub didnt have a steady water stream coming out of them  It was difficult to shower or use the bathroom sink because of this     By far  the worst thing about this unit was that it was extremely cold  There is no way to adjust the AC  The unit is run off of three radiators  One in the living room  bedroom and bathroom  The bathroom and bedroom ones worked  but were still too cold for me  The living room radiator was obviously damaged i e  it had duck tape and water dripping from it into a pot  The living room stayed at a low    degree temperature the entire time  I had to scurry between the bedroom and the bathroom in order to minimize my time in the cold kitchen living room  I did message the host about it and they didnt indicate that there was any way for me to control the unit  Overall  Im really disappointed because I decided to pay more money to stay in this unit in comparison to some of the surrounding units because I thought that I was ensuring there wouldnt be issues with my stay   The house manual says   Feel free to adjust the AC temp to your liking     there was no way to control the AC from the apartment  The living room radiator was clearly damaged  The living room was in the low    degrees my entire stay  I asked the host about AC control and they said I jut needed to wait for the radiator to turn on   There were issues with the heater that were unresolved This place was priced higher relative to the other places to stay in the surrounding area  I chose to pay a higher price thinking that the ZenCity apartment would be much better than the others 
413518084,The Good   Apartment was in a great location in Hyde Park  I was visiting UChicago and it was an easy walk to campus  with several restaurants  cafes  and a drug store also nearby  Accessing the apartment was easy  with clear instructions and a lockbox in place  Zencity was prompt and helpful with communication throughout the process  and was quick to answer any questions or concerns I might have  The apartment was well stocked with amenities  including an iron  a steamer  a lint roller  extra towels  etc  It is well sized for one or two individuals with a small gas stove  a full sized refrigerator  and a small breakfast nook  I enjoyed the low key decorating style    The Bad   Water pressure in the bathroom wasnt great I usually ended up washing my hands in the bathtub because the waterflow in the sink was frustratingly slow  There was some hair around the bathtub and toilet  which didnt bother me  but I can imagine other future guests may be particular about that  As other reviewers have noted  the lighting in the main room is unusual the kitchen lights need to be on to use the outlets on the far side of the apartment  which is where the television is located  This wasnt a problem for me  but again  I can imagine other guests wanting to be able to watch television without the lights on or wanting to watch TV right before they go to sleep    The Ugly   My phone charger and headphones inexplicably went missing on my second day here   The room came stocked with a phone charger  and a charitable explanation would be that someone came in while I was gone to retrieve that charger and accidentally mistook my charger for that one  It is also POSSIBLE that I may have put my headphones in my pocket and subsequently lost them outside of the apartment  I think this is the most likely explanation for how both items ended up missing   A less charitable explanation would be that someone deliberately took two items that were placed right inside the door of my room      I spoke with the Zencity management about this  and they assured me that no one on their crew came into my room while I was staying there  And I can understand how ridiculous this sounds from their perspective  if someone told me that his phone charger went missing  I would assume he had misplaced it and it was somewhere in his bag  or hed left it in the bathroom  or left it at Starbucks or something  But I am clinically OCD about my stuff  I rarely misplace things  let alone lose them  and I spent several hours scouring the apartment  unpacking my luggage over and over again  and even sorting through the trash can multiple times in an effort to find these items  I am quite confident that I do not have these items  and I am genuinely perplexed as to how they went missing  It seems unlikely that anyone on a cleaning crew or a landlord with an extra key would take the time to come into my room and take these two small things  But any other possible explanations I can think of a burglary with no signs of forced entry  A previously unknown occasion of sleepwalking where I took these items outside the apartment  seem even more far fetched   I dont mean to be throwing around reckless accusations  I chose this apartment because it was well reviewed  and it sounds like most guests have had a really positive time staying here  But this was my experience  I left feeling uncomfortable and unnerved that someone had gone through my stuff  This is the first time when using Airbnb in which I feel like my trust has been violated  and while I dont think it was prompted by any personal animus again  I think the most likely explanation is that someone came into my room and took my phone charger by mistake I would not stay here again 
409759483,the location and price are both great  and the check in process is straightforward  my first issue is that the radiators in the apartment have covers on them with clutter on top  denying access to the control valves  thereby making the whole apartment hotter than    degrees the whole time  when I contacted the host about it they said there were control valves on the bottom of the radiators  however this was not true  the only valves were blocked by metal covers and clutter  the second issue was that the host scheduled maintenance repairs in the bathroom during the time that I paid for to stay there  expecting me to let the workers in and watch them while they did the repairs  I dont pay to be a housesitter and ensure repairs are done when I book an Airbnb    the place being so hot the whole time with no solution aside from keeping all the windows open made the experience much less enjoyable than it should have been  but it was a nice place otherwise  they were good about responding in a timely manner  however the responses didnt provide proper help  their radiators have covers over them that prevented access to the control valves  and the covers have random clutter on them preventing them from being opened  they told me the valves were accessible from the bottom  however this was not the case  as a result  the entire place was well over    degrees the entire stay  making it extremely uncomfortable 
626319708,This was my first time to KC and was really looking forward to going to my girlfriends hometown  The view was absolutely amazing  But checking in was a hassle  The code to the lockbox was incorrect so had to call management to issue us a new box  When we opened that box we got a key  but had no key fob to open the doors     luckily a couple who was staying there to was able to let us in with them  Having to open multiple lock boxes just to get a key and key fob was ridiculous  We arrived at          minutes before check in  and we did not have our key and keyfob until   PM  We get upstairs and are shocked with how dirty the place was  there was food on the cabinets  hair in the shower and on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed  We asked if we could check in early and were told that wouldnt happen because they needed to clean the place  They obviously didnt or did a HORRIBLE job at it  There were no trash bags in the unit either  Ive stayed with other companies like VRBO or Homeaway  this was my first Airbnb experience and other than the view  it was absolutely horrendous  My girlfriend and I slept on the couch the entire visit since there was hair on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed   Private   This was my first time to KC and was really looking forward to going to my girlfriends hometown  The view was absolutely amazing  But checking in was a hassle  The code to the lockbox was incorrect so had to call management to issue us a new box  When we opened that box we got a key  but had no key fob to open the doors     luckily a couple who was staying there to was able to let us in with them  Having to open multiple lock boxes just to get a key and key fob was ridiculous  We arrived at          minutes before check in  and we did not have our key and keyfob until   PM  We get upstairs and are shocked with how dirty the place was  there was food on the cabinets  hair in the shower and on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed  We asked if we could check in early and were told that wouldnt happen because they needed to clean the place  They obviously didnt or did a HORRIBLE job at it  There were no trash bags in the unit either  Ive stayed with other companies like VRBO or Homeaway  this was my first Airbnb experience and other than the view  it was absolutely horrendous  My girlfriend and I slept on the couch the entire visit since there was hair on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed  
412079359,WiFi didnt work the whole time I was there  The mattress is completely broken in  my back still hurts from   nights of restless sleep  Theres a barking dog next door and also a loud crashing sound  Ice machine  at least once an hour  No extra blankets for the    degree Chicago weather  Thank you trying to have people fix the WiFi for me but Im not tech savvy and did I that I could on multiple devices to try and figure it out  Please replace the mattress for people with back problems  Theres a barking dog next door and also a loud crashing sound  Ice machine  at least once an hour  No extra blankets for the    degree weather  WiFi wasn u    t working the entire time I was there  The mattress is totally broken in  I kept sinking towards the middle  My back still hurts from   nights of restless sleep  Front desk didnt know who Zencity was  Insisted I show them a reservation which I was scared to do because Zencity told me explicitly not to mention Airbnb  Didnt feel good to be put in a situation like that Although the WiFi was out I had people trying to solve it ASAP which was appreciated  Even though it didnt amount to the WiFi getting fixed
622529890,Place was listed as non smoking  Terrible smoke smell and cigarette butts in this apartment  Bed sheets stained  Hair in bathroom sink  Leftover food in refrigerator which stunk  Reached out twice  no resolve was ever offered  Very disappointed  Will never stay with Zencity again  Asked for partial refund  no response  Reached out to host twice to explain situation of place smelling  like smoke  First response was  okay  thanks for letting me know    no resolve  Second time I contacted host  no response 
479941797,Trash place no parking 
400313894,Experience was OK  Location was fine  relative to UChicago  Plenty of space in the apartment  Bedroom door and bathroom door didnt close properly  however  Couch was worn in and pretty uncomfortable  Very average experience  but given the other reviews expected much more   I was left expecting more  space was good  but far from expectations  lock box didnt work properly  still made it in but had to use Cleaners keys  where the lockbox was unlocked  raising security concerns 
659202120,The place was nice inside and it had a great view  However  trying to communicate with the host was very difficult  I left some keys on accident and it was quite difficult to get ahold of them  Also when checking in  it was difficult to find the correct location 
366454782,There were several issues during my stay  Upon entry there was a harsh odor in addition to the smell of cigarettes  Additionally  the linens were stained  the tub was clogged and would not drain  and the bathroom sink was not working properly either  They were however pretty responsive and did their best to fix the tub  not the odor   Overall  made the best of it but would not stay again nor recommend  There were several issues during my stay  Upon entry there was a harsh odor in addition to the smell of cigarettes  Additionally  the linens were stained  the tub was clogged and would not drain  and the bathroom sink was not working properly either  They were however pretty responsive and did their best to fix the tub  not the odor   If it had been throughly cleaned before guests arrived 
666867196,I have stayed with Zencity now a handful of times  hoping the experience would eventually get better since the properties are so beautiful  It becomes obvious that their customer service is ran by an automated response system   you very rarely get to talk to an actual person  There have been occasions where Ive actually called instead of messaging   never actually spoke to a person  On all of my stays but one  I have received the check in information as much as   hours after the check in time  As well as checking into an apartment only to realize that its a completely different home than advertised without the promised amenities  I advise you to save the time   hassle  For very similar pricing you can find equally if not better listings in the area  Stay away from Zencity  You can find better deals staying at hotel in the same area
651000975,Other than water leak and mildew ell it was an ok place to stay Spend a lot of time cleaning up water and trying not to fall when you walk out of the room onto the vinyl floor Wet carpet  kids would walk from the carpet area and end up slipping and fell a couple times
632600899,This was worst experience with Airbnb  The bed had hair all over I asked for new sheets and even those  looked nasty     there were no pots or pans to cook with no even a dish towel     no paper towels in the kitchen      there was no dish soap or dish towel to clean off the couple plates they had        I would like a full refund because this was just the worst really  If the bed was clean 
652242490,In my opinion this unit was not in rentable condition but not all bad  Good  location  beds  linens  size  furnishings  Bad  Not very clean  mold in bedroom  ceiling fan not installed correctly and fell from  ceiling  shower drain clogged  This unit was not In rentable condition  Should spend some time and attention on this unit  Cleaner  things not broken  This was more like a college dorm room apartment than a place for a professional to stay  Terrible smell in the common areas of the building the place needs more attention 
434804845,I would have forgiven several thigs and given a five star review because the bedroom was nice  but they tried to charge me      for some cheap chair I never touched   Room was nice but building was a little run down and sketchy overall  Told me I couldnt check in early because the space needed to be cleaned    then the bathroom wasnt clean  Quick to response until I refused to pay      for a cheap particle board chair I didnt use strange part of town would have given five starts anyway if they didnt try to charge me      for a chair I didnt break
591599892,The place looks great in the pictures but it is the complete opposite  The place is dirty and smells like there is a gas leak in there  The couch and carpet in the living room are filthy  The bathroom was partly clean  the sink was nasty   The bed sheets were full of stains and long hair  The place gives you a good impression in the pics but its the complete opposite  The price might seem good but trust me    its not worth it  I stayed there   days and it was a bad experience  I just moved to another Airbnb   miles away for the same night rate and its super amazing  Also the parking is if you get lucky to find a spot 
645306829,I was very surprised at how filthy the place was  the host were very slow about fixing the issue and sending people to clean the mess  Its cheap though so you get what you pay for but hopefully they fix the issue as soon as possible  other than that it wouldve been perfect  very nice spot in a good location  please just take care of your cleaning people so they take better care of your business  invest in candles  always keep the air blowing even if no one is there  house cleaner never came  it wasnt urgent to fix my issue  i couldve paid for a hotel and atleast had housekeeping come asap or gotten a new room  but overall good concept 
669935197,I would NOT recommend this apartment to anyone  I was looking for a modern cozy apartment  but this was anything but that  The apartment did NOT look like the pictures that were posted  It was outdated and misrepresented  According  to Zencity the place recently underwent a renovation which is why the pictures differ from actual apartment  However  the said  renovations  made the apartment look worse  The apartment was not clean to my satisfaction  The apartment window seals were dirty and the blinds were COVERED with dust  The toilet was broken  I have a video  and a light was blew out in the bathroom  The apartment is located in CWE  loved that  but they are doing construction  Construction workers wake you up at the crack of dawn  if youre in to that kind of thing   GO FOR IT   The people who represented Zencity were anything  but helpful  They were snippy and rude  You can see them argue with customers in the review comments under other postings  You can count on that they ARENT going to do the right thing by their customers  All they can offer you are excuses and insincere apologies  Do not book with Zencity   If you are looking to rent here RUN     A total catfish  This apartment looks NOTHING like the pictures  which the exception of the sheets on the bed  Next to the cleanliness  THIS WAS MY BIGGEST CONCERN  They lure you in with a modern look  but the apartment has anything but that  I u    m unable to upload pics of the actual apartment  When I notified Zencity of my concern they stated the apartment had recent renovations  I thought renovations where supposed to make spaces look better   not worse  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE      Zencity is RUDE and unapologetic  As you can see on other posts they like to argue with their customers and point the finger  No responsibility  Location is not horrible because it is in the CWE  but they are doing construction and you can here it every morning at the crack of dawn  If you are looking for a getaway to get rest   dont stay here  The apartment looking as host presented in photos 
700265059,Honestly a great Airbnb in a beautiful are  alittle far from the airport and from the tourist spots but still a great deal  My only problem was the rude staff and waiting hours to check in just to be told  people have lunch breaks you know 
646349974,Good location  decent value  decent amenities  but it just was not very clean  You need a new cleaning company 
569800514,This is my first poor experience with Airbnb  it was a mess from the beginning  The toilet leaked dirty water into the floor  there was exposed wiring  the shower didnt drain  The host was extremely responsive and sent maintenance out to correct the issues in a reasonable amount of time  but not being able to use the shower or toilet for periods of time  shower out of service for over    hours   shouldnt happen in any place you stay  Its a great location building and these issues should now be corrected   Other notes   I didnt realize until after booking that there is no parking available  so be prepared to pay to park or have to park a block away as street parking is limited    The wifi is very very weak  we had to hot spot our phones to even stream a youtube video   Listed as workspace friendly  but the wifi was too poor to work from home  They also claim to have basic amenities to cook  but there wasnt even salt and pepper available  
628942484,Overall the places and value of this company are great but the people skills we ran into were well below average  Sneaky practices and bad support teams locally  First place was amazing  The second was going well and then the lady ruined it 
646408838,Overall  I was very disappointed in my stay here and would not stay again unless some things were improved     Ill say the good things first  Zencitys communication   customer service was great   They got back to texts in about    minutes every time   Also  this is  or at least could be  a beautiful apartment   location  It is right along the L train which is great for access to the city but does cause some noise and people waiting for the train can see right in the windows so theres also its no privacy   Shades that open from the bottom would be nice so you can still see the horizon but block commuters view    That said  theres A LOT to improve at this location  It seems like it hasnt really been up kept and really needs some love to make it better   FOR EXAMPLE    there was mold growing visibly on the bathroom ceiling  both bedside lamps were very broken and not very useable   half the light bulbs burnt out    there was hair on the floor upon arrival  very gross     the throw rug under the bed was very grimy  the garbage was broken  not much privacy from L commuters   and the kitchen sink kept backing up     Honestly  I expected more from Zencity and was disappointed   It ended being a good stay but could have been far better   I hope things can be improved and to stay again if so  It is a beautiful location and I think Zencity has the potential to do better  Hi   thanks for your quick replies   Your communication was great   That said  I think theres a lot to improve at this location   It is a beautiful unit and can be great but seems like it hasnt really been up kept and really needs some love to make it better    E g   mold in the bathroom  two broken bedside lamps  half the light bulbs burnt out  hair on the floor upon arrival  grimy carpet  etc     I expected more from Zencity and was disappointed   It ended being a good stay but could have been far better   I hope to stay with you again and dont mean to insult you all  I just want to be honest to help improve things   Thanks again   hope youre well    Sincerely  James
351689495,Unit very basic and lacking in warmth   very bare bones  hanging  closet  a joke  Total lack of atmosphere  Poor shower head  Information lacking on use of TV 
555294053,The location was great but we ended up getting locked out of our loft for some reason that no one cannot explain  The host blaimed the loft manager for the locks they left on but also said it was not the first time it happened  We had to pay a locksmith to break in the lock so we can get in  I think its horrible that we did not get a refund for paying the locksmith  We waited for almost   hours with   babies just for the host  to tell us he couldnt let us in  He promised a refund for the Saturday night but I asked about it He ignored my messages and this wont be the end of it  We also tried to get our clothes back that we left in the dryer  and he only responded back one time and after that we heard nothing back  I tried calling and no answer nor call back  So now we are also stuck with no refund or our clothes back  Get your stuff in order and more organized  Im sorry this had to go this route but I refuse to let it be unnoticed I think its horrible that we did not get a refund for paying the locksmith  We waited for almost   hours with   babies just for your company to tell us you couldnt let us in  You ignored my messages and this wont be the end of it  We also tried to get our clothes back and you only responded back one time and after that we heard nothing back  I tried calling and no answer nor call back  Get your stuff in order and more organized  Im sorry this had to go this route but I refuse to let it be unnoticed Got locked out room  was stuck outside for almost   hours with my wife and       year old then WE had to pay      to a locksman to break in the loft because the  handyman  the host sent had no idea how to get us in  And they refused to refund us or pay us back When we asked about our refund to pay us back to get inside theyre loft they did not respond back AT ALL and we forgot clothes in the dryer and tried to set something up to get them but they only responded once and after that would not respond anymore so we are stuck without those clothes
607419303,The stay was a slight mess with a late check in due to the cleaning crew getting to the apartment the same time we arrived  we actually helped the cleaning crew clean an hour after leaving to give them time to clean   the place had been smoked in by the guest prior to our stay  speaking to multiple ZenCity agents with little response using the AirBnB app  the WiFi was slow and information listed in regards to name of network were incorrect and the cleaning crew walking into the apartment while we were sleeping which was very alarming  The location was great for us and the actual property was clean  Everyone has off days and plans dont always go as planned so we tried to be understanding  The cleaning crew did have their work cut out for them and they apologized  The stay started off rough but while there the bed was comfy and the kitchen was great  The stay was a slight mess with a late check in due to the cleaning crew getting to the apartment the same time we arrived  we actually helped the cleaning crew clean an hour after leaving to give them time to clean   the place had been smoked in by the guest prior to our stay  speaking to multiple ZenCity agents with little response using the AirBnB app  the WiFi was slow and information listed in regards to name of network were incorrect and the cleaning crew walking into the apartment while we were sleeping which was very alarming  The location was great for us and the actual property was clean  Everyone has off days and plans dont always go as planned so we tried to be understanding  The cleaning crew did have their work cut out for them and they apologized  The stay started off rough but while there the bed was comfy and the kitchen was great 
611321709,If you want to be harassed every time you walk into the building this is the place for you 
456459231,if you want to go to an airbnb with an unresponsive host then this will be a perfect place  The heat was pumping on when it was    degrees out  We tried turning it off multiple times and contacting the host but never heard back  If someone contacts you about an issue please do your job and respond back in a prompt fashion  We had contacted multiple times about the heat not being able to turn off  I also had messaged about the sheets being dirty 
628922820,Good location Not a great space if youre not a fan of roaches Still waiting on a response for a refund  I had to leave after being there only a couple hours because there was a huge cockroach in the bathroom
545572806,The photographer should get an Academy Award for Photographers  We DO NOT recommend this place   Stayed in AirBNBs all over the world and NEVER been in anyplace so gross   Staircase is really dirty and the mold spores are palatable  Once in the apartment  the smell is ok  not great  but ok  The furnishings are very sparse  No dressers on which to put jewelry   change   you know  a spot to empty your pocket contents  Do not look under the sink cabinets   YIKES   They offered an insta pot water heater  a french press  and the remnants of a bag of coffee which we had no idea how long it had been in the cabinet and whose hands had been in the bag   it is flu season  ya know  No ice trays  but a     used bag of ice   again  flu season   They did bring a fresh bag of coffee and   ice trays on day   of our   day stay   No salt  pepper  sugar or sweetener  Two mirrors over the   bath sinks   be sure what you pack will look good  cause there is no chance to check before going out   unless you can get your reflection in the TV  Tub is a safety hazard   Big climb into the claw footed tub with nothing to hold onto   Take care not to trip on the too  long curtain  Also  be very careful about the coffee table   it is concave and will swallow  whatever you set on the edge   go for the center to be safe  Linens and towels were fine  mini toiletries ok  bed was good  location was great  communication was very good and they were very nice  Not much  zen  from Zencity  tho  My advice   keep looking  As you know  we were much less than impressed  You can read my review   Sorry   gotta be honest  For what it was  it was too expensive  I guess we paid for the location  but wed have rather stayed in a different neighborhood under better conditions 
710620726,NA Get better housekeeping Cracks in the walls  area rug was dirty  and shelves were not placed 
628349360,This guy accused me of all kinds of stuff that wasnt true tried to blame me for his broken window and accused me of absurd things then wanted to request more money from me    for the maid to have to wash a few dishes when I was rushed out with people knocking at the door at       I paid a cleaning fee once and would have cleaned the few dishes had I not been rushed out at           I dont know if hes just hurting for money or what his deal is but I was shocked and appalled
714710387,Feels more like a hospital setting   the space is extremely small
337530589,La unidad es muy comoda en muy buena ubicaci n   el lugar por fuera es un poco viejo pero muy c modo  lo  nico malo fue que al llegar al self check in a las   am nuestras llaves no estaban y al recibir el duplicado hab a gente en nuestra unidad tardaron   hora para darnos otra unidad  La unidad es muy buena  tiene todo lo que se necesita lo malo solo fue el error que cometieron al tener a otras personas en la unidad que nos correspond a y hacernos esperar a esas horas de la madrugada  sugiero un poco m s cuidado con las reservaciones  fuera de eso todo excelente   La TV nunca funciono  el internet si estuvo muy bien  igual como la comodidad y limpieza   Al llegar a las   am en el self check in no estaba la llave y cuando nos pasaron el duplicado hab a gente en nuestra unidad completamente desagradable esa noche  despu s de   hora nos ofrecieron otra unidad para pasar la noche  Tardaron   hora para resolvernos lo de la unidad que ya estaba ocupada por otras personas 
708541466,Our stay at Zencity was very short lived  Upon entering the apartment  the tables  toilets  walls and flooring were not clean  The whole place smelled horrible because the dishwasher was full of water and dishes  We had to leave right after when checked in related to the poor conditions  Although we did have great and expeditious responses from customer service  we still were not fully refunded what we originally paid  I would not consider renting from zencity in the future  I wanted to say thank for your quick response and customer service  but this apartment really needs some upkeep and deep cleaning performed before it is rented out again  I am also upset that I lost one night on my refund  But I was pleased with the quick responses from Marty   The photos made the place look clean and upscale  When in reality  it was the complete opposite   It was absolutely not worth the listed price 
719767361,The apartment was almost all clean   outside of the bathroom tub which was cleaned within    hours  and was nicely decorated  It was in a nice location  The issue is really with the customer service  A company hosts this Airbnb and so we expected to interact with customer service representatives who were efficient  professional  and pleasant  Unfortunately  we did not have that experience at all  We attempted to extend the Airbnb by   day  The day was available on Airbnb and we figured there would not be any issues in extending  We attempted to extend   days prior to our check out date and did not receive any correspondence from the company until the day we were supposed to check out  They called us in the afternoon and told us there were folks waiting outside to clean and asked us whether we were going to check out  I tried to explain that we had requested an extension  The representative said that despite that   business days had past  their team of representatives had failed to see the request  They also said that they saw it today and attempted to approve it but because they saw it after   am they could not approve it  They said  your only option is to pay an additional    for the remaining day  They did not express any empathy or understanding or acknowledge their negligence and lack of responsiveness  Eventually  the customer service representative became rude and quite patronizing over the phone  even trying to give me unsolicited advice about how I should go about things in the future  We decided to go ahead and leave    All things considered  could we have reminded the customer service representatives that there was an outstanding request  sure  But  thats not our job as a customer  I expect that the customer service and their team can manage their work without their customers needing to intervene  I was disappointed to see that for Zencity  that is not the case  Code to get in was complicated  long  and not correct  Took us about    minutes to be able to get in  Zencity waited two days to respond about the extension  Truly  they never did respond to the request  they just called to say that somebody was at the apartment to clean it  They never gave check out instructions and never replied to our extension request to deny or approve  It was very unclear what was happening  The customer service rep told me that nobody even looked at the request until the day we ended up having to leave  Neither of the two days that passed were holidays or weekends  Both were business days  Ultimately their negligence caused a lot of miscommunication  Their customer service over the phone was terrible  Condescending  patronizing  and unhelpful  They do not take responsibility for their actions  The apartment is great and the price is good  but the customer service experience is awful 
311173223,We moved out after night   of a planned   night stay due to cleanliness and maintenance issues  Situation made good by Airbnb after only a small refund offered by the host     Property was still being serviced when we arrived to check in
618693237,Its a beautiful place  I just advise you to inspect carefully that its cleaned  I called a few times and was not able to get in contact with my host  It went to voicemail several times before reaching someone  It was pertinent to speak with someone because the door codes didnt not work upon arrival  Better cleaning      
344408147,There was a terrifying domestic disturbance in the apartment next door  The police came and diffused the situation but according to the other neighbor  this happens all the time  There was no WiFi and the  owner  of the Airbnb told us several times the WiFI was fixed when it wasnt  This is the problem with these Airbnbs that are one of many owned by the same company  The actual owner lives far away from the property and has several people who work for them  making it near impossible to get issues resolved  Thanks for nothing   Zen City   The host gave us inaccurate information over and over again 
97415912,I found the handoff didnt work  I was running as fast as I could to a work dinner and the key handoff didnt workout  the key wasnt there I had to reach out to the rental place   There was really no proactive engagement at all   Location was acceptable but I think overpriced   Communication is difficult   Shower photos would be a big improvement     As Chris knows  the handoff didnt workout  Many layers of communication w  different parties makes direct communication difficult   
571832075,An odd place to stay  Felt very bare with not much on the walls and an odd style which seemed like they valued the look of he furniture vs  the actual comfort  Check was easy and no direct need to communicate with the host  Location has good access to the L  Random  but all the light switches and toilet were rather low to the ground  Just a note for taller individuals  Could have been better with more things on the walls  Felt very bare   Not sure what was up with this place  but everything was set up for a human of a smaller stature   Check in was easy and instructions were clear  Never communicated  But also didnt need to  Location was good  For the feel and dynamic of this place  I did not think this was a good value  Couch was terribly uncomfortable to sit on 
568563880,Advise not to park in the U  Car got broken into  Advise future costumers not to park in the U  Ask the front desk what the U is  Its about    ft from the residences  My car got broken into window shattered and belongings stolen while parked on the premises of the residence which is the U 
710962860,This place was the worst AirBnB experience I have ever had  The people are not communicative and do not try to help  I highly recommend not renting from this company  Wifi bad  place unclean  tv broken  support unhelpful        Wifi horrible  appliances bad  can hear everyone outside and above you  Horrible took weeks to respond to emails and when talking over the phone people who said they would come out to fix an issue never did  The only good part of the listing Find another spot
593690139,Honestly very disappointed  The space is as pictured and would make for a lovely stay if I didnt have to listen to the so sound of construction in be the building from early morning to late evening   I wouldnt be so upset if I had been told it was a possibility  but that didnt happen  Also instructions on finding the back units were all kinds of wrong  Wont be back  the space the hassel  I am very disappointed with this place  Sounds of construction every morning  construction materials everywhere  Not a pleasant experience at all  Directions for check in were incorrect 
280621026,This apartment is located well within the small downtown of Hyde Park  There are a few cafes and restaurants close by with a Target around the corner for convenience    When my wife and I were first contacted by Chris we felt a bit misled since the apartment we stayed in is on the first floor  but this is not described anywhere  The only piece of info to indicate this is a photo of the balcony which seems to be more than a story up  but its in fact just a couple feet off the ground  As we are not very familiar with this city we would rather have been above the first floor  so this indication would be important for future guests   Within    minutes of arriving we heard noise on the room adjacent and one above us  I gave it some time  but then contacted Chris when nothing changed  He responded that he has never had problems with noise  and was regretful that we are experiencing it  Peace and quiet are extremely important to me  and I did not find that here  I understand that in the city youll hear people outside police cars  but there was little of that here  Constant banging from above and beside us  We could actually listen to conversations from people in both of these apartments  Ive honestly never been to an Air BnB  or even hotel rather  that has been this loud   Aside from those issues the apartment was very clean  All the appliances were working except for the water and ice dispenser on the fridge which isnt a huge deal  Plenty of hot water  and good water pressure from the shower  A small addition that l enjoyed was the automatic soap dispensers in the bathroom and kitchen    All in all the stay was okay  but the noise really ruined it for us  The only bright side is that it kept us out of the apartment most of the day night  and forced us to enjoy the sights of Chicago   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  listing description  size of home   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements 
671874978,Didnt recieve key fob so wasnt able to check out any amenities  Slow response from host
658050724,This place was horrible  Its a crumby apartment  but what made it insufferable was that it was filled with a stench of cigarette smoke  We were forced to leave and contacted the host to receive a refund  but the host had still not responded  I am requesting that you immediately issue us a refund Refund requested but no response
503591948,After I could not get a key out of the automatic lock box at the property  I was without a place to sleep for almost    hours overnight  The property Managers access code for their lock box was incorrect on the initial email and the subsequent code sent failed to open the key repository     After numerous phone calls to an answering service and only a single message sent by the Airbnb app  I was finally granted a refund from Airbnb  The number supplied to Airbnb and on their website does not go to any actual employee of the company but a answering service    The property Management company of these apartments is disconnected from the St Louis area  after having stayed in a property in the same facility that you manage I was looking forward to staying here again  Your communication and technical facilities are lacking   The messages from the host did not help in this situation   When finally contacted about the key box not being accessible and me being locked out for the first day of my trip  a non apology was sent   They stated as if the lock box   seemed   not to work   The property Managers failed to ensure I could enter the property  I had only   hours sleep in a terrible motel before heading to work  The property Manager only responded once during my support request overnight  After the information they gave me was ineffective  they didnt respond again until almost   hours later  Their support line after      p m  is a message taking service  nothing more  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me 
503259970,Great view  but not very comfortable for the price  Great location  decent space  but compares poorly to a hotel room in terms of amenities for the price   We didnt reach out while there because we were simply too busy   Should mention that there is no dresser  one poor futon in LR  one dining room chair for the LR  one lightbulb in LR  no instructions for TV and trash  no recycling container  Two teaspoons in service for eight  no bathmat for slippery bathtub  etc   No info booklet
622466879,awesome check in  nice entertainment provided  some pics can be misleading for studio   bedrooms but overall i would continue to book here photos were misleading   listed as   bedroom and not a studio  Barely any kitchen accessories  no kitchen vent when cooking  boxed in environment  Check in is never an issue with zencity  ive been successful with you all before this is just a misleading listing so my expectations were set high due to the previous stay i had before this one 
631169213,Photos are accurate  I hope your stay is better than mine was  Missing key  Cheaper
555441561,We booked this condo based on the location and the photos   It was very run down  with mold in several places   We had to purchase cheap sandals to wear in the bathroom   Would not stay here again   The photos make the condo look very nice  it is not  
660638539,No one deserves to get money robed from them  If you agree dont book with zencity  They are thieves  This small unit is next to a unit occupied by a full time tenant of the building  If you lucky enough you will hear punk rock  screamo  and tribal music blaring all night with one one to turn to help for but knocking on a stranger door who gets in fights with his party guest alot   lol  People coming and going all night  dogs barking  horns honking  Drag racing and cruising on the street out the bedroom window   Not safe cops always rolling around  Save yourself days of trouble trying to get a refund  This is not a pretty looking part of downtown  smoke stacks right out front billowing smelly fumes all day and night  The hosting company does not respond personally everything is automated by a  rd party add on service  You will not experience that if you stay with a real human in a real house with a real host  You are booking a motel  I brought it to their attention that the listing was      misleading the guy confirmed I was at the right address and right unit  He told me there was no where to transfer me then hung up and blocked my number I wasnt on the phone for more than   seconds before he hung up  The photos are  brightened with photoshop  There was rotten take out food in the refrigerator with a receipt dated             I booked           The towels are stiff and old  Calling the number listed again the next day because Airbnb told me to reach out one more time  He said if I called again he would take my security deposit wow  Please do not stay with this  company  not even if your desperate
635434920,The floors are disgusting  you can tell they didnt Mop or sweep before us   There was bugs everywhere  the ac barley worked  PLENTY of things were broken like no doorknobs   shower was messed up  the doors barley closed   Nothings was wiped down  This place has a lot of potential with the area it is sadly its not taken care of  
246890119,My trip started well yet ended unpleasantly  Chris is responsive via email  The unit gets good natural light and the minimalist decor is nice  But when I got locked out of the unit  he was no help  I asked him to provide a number to maintenance and he didnt  Luckily someone saw me helpless and standing in the hallway for over an hour and told me whom to call  The building maintenance staff had to drill and remove the lock  but they finally let me in  I was locked out for over two hours  I prefer to leave more positive reviews  but I want to be honest and help others so that you dont have my same experience  I feel that leaving this negative review may result in my receiving a negative review from the host  But I am ok with this because my review may help other potential guests  I prefer to be honest and transparent  The much longer version is below  The positives  The unit has so much natural light  The unit is a corner unit so there are lots of windows  The units minimalist decor is nice too  Chris was responsive via email  When I told him about a mildew like odor in the unit  he sent three people to check on the odor  However  none of them were able to fix it  The area rug in the bedroom reeked of the mildew smell  so I folded it and placed it in the closet  I decided to check out early because the odor was too strong  Even one of his staff confirmed the foul odor  Chris let me me check out after    am  which I appreciated  When I told him that I wanted a refund for the remaining nights  he messaged me   I am happy to refund you the remaining portion of your stay  however  I ask that you leave a positive review  I have hosted many guests here and have not had an odor issue before  If that is acceptable to you  I will have Airbnb cancel the remaining portion of your stay and issue the refund   I found this odd because reviews should be honest  And I responded that I would leave an honest review  I previously emailed Chris that the key to the unit wasnt working properly to unlock the deadbolt  And guess what  I ended up getting locked out of the unit right before I checked out  In desperation  I emailed him repeatedly and asked for a number to his staff or maintenance  He would not provide any phone number and his response was to jimmy the lock  Chris did not offer any support beyond jimmying and playing with the lock  After finally finding a phone number to the building manager  two maintenance staff drilled and removed the lock from the door  Luckily  this happened during the daytime  What if this happened at night  I mightve been stranded  Chris never emailed to see if I got in  I do not see myself renting    Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  Additional comments   host emailed me but did not help when I was locked out      my experience was not good    
238450899,nice freshly repainted airbnb appartment  perfect location when visiting students at UChicago  downtown Hyde park  good size  BUT The third guest  who pays  sleeps on a sofa  NOT a sofabed   the mattress is very uncomfortable  and there are no linens or towels for this guest  when I asked  linens and towels were delivered the next day only  at  pm  Kind of too late  Too bad  because the location is great   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  Additional comments   u   cthe sofa bed could not be unfolded  the mattress was really bad  and there was no linen or towel for the person sleeping on the sofa for   h u   d  
502490967,The Bed was comfortable and the location is nice  but the dishwasher didnt work  the Electric water boiler didnt work  and the Extra linens were dirty  There also wasnt enough dishware for four people  For the price  we expected these amenities to be available  For      a night the dishwasher should work  the hot water boiler should work  and the extra linen should be clean 
626439223,The  host  that message you  dont speak proper english  It smells like weed everywhere  Too loud at night because of people throwing parties  The  step by step  instructions were shit  I even messaged you guys for help  because what I was told was incorrect  Then whomever responded back to me  said that it was my fault  You guys need to learn proper english  A few minute drive to downtown  that was nice and handy 
672965074,DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY   I hope this review will save EVERYONE from ever having to deal with what we endured on what was supposed to be a fun family getaway  I have NEVER taken the time to write a review  but this experience was so unbelievably awful  that I wont waste the opportunity to help warn others about this terrible company    We purchased a unit that specifically  listed it had   queen beds to accommodate our family  Zen City posted a listing for a unit with exactly that in an area that was relatively close to the things we wanted to see and do in downtown St Louis  so we purchased the unit   As soon as we get to the unit  we knew something was wrong  The first thing we noticed was that the place was absolutely filthy  Hair and dirt EVERYWHERE  So what does that hefty  cleaning fee  they charge go towards I wonder  Certainly not CLEANING THE UNIT   So  right off the bat  that was disgusting    Next thing we noticed was that we didnt have the   queen beds we were supposed to have  We got in late  but we contacted the host right away to tell them these things  They ended up trying to go into the listing and CHANGING THE LISTING  to the unit they had put us in  Luckily  we still had pictures of the original listing we purchased and our confirmation email showing everything we were supposed to have    This company repeatedly try to put the blame on us saying several times  Oh  I see how you could have been confused  and  Sorry  you must have overlooked and bought a different listing   after we kept providing proof of what we originally purchased   As you may have already guessed  this host refused make the situation right  hung up on us  and told us to go through AirBnB  So  we did  AirBnB immediately saw right through this deceitful company  They saw that they tried to update the listing AFTER we initially contacted them  as well as the lies they told through the messenger  We ended up receiving a FULL REFUND  and immediately got our belongings out of that nasty dump and went to a nearby hotel  where we were able to salvage the rest of our trip    Of course  this company will do anything other than accept responsibility and be accountable for their deceitful actions  so Im sure we received a delusional review in response to this one  reminds me of a    year old child throwing a tantrum screaming  I know you are  but what am I       However  if this review can save ANYONE from having to deal with this God awful company  then taking the time to write this review will have been well worth it   DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST    Please stop messaging us through AirBnB messenger  You act like a little twelve year old who is so insecure that they feel like they have to have the last word  You lied  You got caught  Be an adult and own it   This host deceivingly posted pictures of a different unit with different accommodations  only to get caught and try to deny it  AirBnB saw right through their lies and issued us a full refund  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST   We were given a completely different unit than we purchased  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  They do nothing but lie  even when they are caught red handed  Thankfully  AirBnB saw right through them and issued us a full refund  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  Regardless of where the location is  this company is ran by horrible human beings  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  After getting a FULL REFUND from AirBnB due to the outright lying and deception of Zen City  we found much better value at a hotel nearby that didnt have hair and dirt al over the floor  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST 
585158276,The worst place to stay ever  when I read the reviews for this place I was comfortable but then when I got there I was shocked  The host wasnt helpful when you ask about places around the apartment  The apartment was super small and different from the pictures that were provided  The most problem that I faced is I cant adjust the AC temp  It was extremely hot and when I talked to the host he said just open the windows and itll be fine  Also  he lied to me by saying you can adjust that and it took him two days to say that theres no way to completely to turn on the A C control since its building controlled Even if you open the window theres a lot of noise from the train and the cars outside  Theres no parking spot close to the apartment  The elevator smells like Marijuana everyday  I was uncomfortable the entire trip  Gives a wrong information
721091014,As a fair warning  just look elsewhere  My rental unit was not adequately prepared though my reservation was made well in advance  The bed sheets and pillow cases were lined with all sorts of hair   short and long  I literally bought sheets to change those with because it was very unhygienic  Additionally  the bathroom has hairs  of various contributors  posted all over the walls as if it hadnt been cleaned in weeks  My biggest issue is that the listing and check in clearly states access to a key fob for use of the multiple entrances of the building  Upon checking in  this wasnt available  When I asked when it would be I was told  maybe tomorrow    This was a very unprofessional response  I never got a key fob and had to resort to screaming the building access code outside the single intercom access door in the middle of Chicago when it was    degrees outside  When I brought these issues up to Zencity and asked for financial compensation  it was blatantly ignored by their support staff  Stay else where if you value amenities like cleanliness and a functioning key  I would suggest really focusing on cleanliness and accuracy of your check in instructions  Also  ZC support representatives could be better versed in dealing with these types of issues because the support was not beneficial at all  Also make sure youre providing whats listed in your listings   I e  a key fob  I booked a unit that was to be clean and provided a key fob   I did not have this in my experience   I was provided no key fob for getting into the building though clearly listed in the listing itself and check in instructions  I wouldve much rather stayed else where  Zen city lacks the ability to effectively facilitate their own guests  Will make sure to not stay with Zen City in the future and warn other renters 
624084536,Not what I expected
334674906,I dont think they would want to hear my critique This has burned me off to Airbnb  not sure if I would use this service again   Not my idea of a luxury apartment  for the price fresh toiletries should have been provided  fresh bar of soap   body wash at least  also extra towels would have been nice   Lots of noise from trains  kind of a transitional neighborhood  close to El which was convenient Could have stayed in a hotel for the price  also no welcome kit when we got there  just keys on the counter  Would have liked a more user friendly coffee pot  not familiar with a French press   no instructions provided  Also opened bag of coffee in fridge  who knows how long that was there as other food was obviously spoiled 
538414983,I have stayed at AirBnb locations across the globe and this is one of the worst experiences I have had  Terrible check in on an unlit street  extremely dirty  hair everywhere  All over the sheets pillows  towels  shower  sink   and loud  The walls are paper thin overlooking a train station and but the biggest issue is the other tenants   The instructions guide you up   flights of stairs  NEVER MIND there is an elevator  Accesible from the side entrance or if you walk to the  st floor from the entrance they instruct you to use   Worst check in experience Ive ever had  Dark unlit street a block away from the actual location of the airbnb  The code given for the lockbox did  not work  Had to get a code for a backup lockbox  Code given for lock box did not work  called  phone number provided was answering machine  left a message no one called back  messaged on Airbnb app finally got a message back  Good neighborhood but literally on the train tracks  Very noisy 
638500601,Tbh it really could have been better  Im sorry about the sheets  My period came unexpectedly and I didnt know what to do  Otherwise cleaning walls needs done swept and mopped properly and the kitchen cabinets needed washed bad  We arrived early which was on us but even waiting   hours and we were told that it would be ready at   pm they still hadnt came in to clean anything  I asked about early check in was ok we couldnt but the for it to not be ready at check in time was ridiculous

625986401,Whatever you guy think about renting this apartment DONT  You will regret it I promise you the pictures are misleading they have a washer dryer in the bedroom the room is small and it doesnt even work right   The kitchen is dirty as well   dishes   cups   dirty frying pans mouses running around the apartment  my son is   years old and he was scared to come out of the bedroom  spiders everywhere with spiderweb all around the place and the WiFi wasnt working   I wrote all of this to the host and he never got back to me   I was in   other apartments from Airbnb and never had a issue but lets put it like this I felt like was stuck in a hell hole for    days  Very bad experience    Very bad experience you could of at least got back to me about the mouse and WiFi my son was scared to come out of the bedroom  Washer and dryer was in the bedroom     cups   dishes   very dirty frying pans    The back bathroom no cold water only very hot burning water   The walls were very dirty I was very disappointed in the apartment   In my opinion Airbnb shouldn u    t not have this apartment on your website    I texted   times about the mouses and there was no WiFi in the house and he never got back to me The place had to be cleaner and if hes doesnt have Certain stuff like in the kitchen dont say you have them   Say that the WASHER  DRYER ARE IN THE BEDROOM      
601481898,The apartment was not clean  The bed sheets had multiple long strands everywhere and the sheets were wrinkled as if somebody had just slept in it  Somebody pooped and left it there so the bathroom smelled  There were multiple stains on the couch and the sink was not clean either  The host still has not responded for my request for a refund a week later  We had to find another hotel room at      am  This will be my last time using Air bnb as when you do request a refund  they dont allow you to request the full amount  I would like a complete refund please  I called the host when we arrived to let them know and I sent a message to her my money back and have not received a response 
606670582,Upon arrival there was a pile of dirty sheets on the living room floor and the TV and all lights were on  After a   hour flight with a toddler  this was the last think we expected  Zencity simply forgot to clean the place  When we called  no apology was given and we had to grab sheets from another unit and do laundry of some of the existing sheets  Nobody came for an exceptional cleaning  the cleaner came the next day for a mediocre cleaning job  and we had to shower in dirty bathrooms  hairs on the floors  in bathtubs and toilets   Quite unfortunate as the place is nicely located with a great view  Also  no reply was received regarding our request on reimbursement of the cleaning aand service fees  As a result  I do not recommend Zencitys services  Unfortunately we cannot say we enjoyed our stay and will not be able to recommend your services to friends   In the kitchen many utensils were missing and not enough for   adults   Nobody available to come and clean on the evening of our arrival  Partial apologies or reimbursement of cleaning fees  Being sensitive to our reimbursement request on the cleaning fee and service fee 
720122761,Check in instructions werent clear  Cant even get in the side door they say to go into where the lock boxes are  Theres a man and a woman at the main door that youre forced to enter without choice  whom dont wear masks  and harass everyone that passes through the front door to access their units  Unit was missing key amenities and the host became Unresponsive and ghosted us when we reached out to them  Bring your own TV of you wanna watch TV at all   There isnt a remote for the TV and its human proofed without any buttons  as they expect you to watch a blue screen in Spanish language your entire stay  They pay the service fee which is  To help Airbnb run smoothly and to cover the costs of the products and services we provide  like      customer support  we charge a service fee when a booking is confirmed     Yet because they pay the service fee  you dont get the support you need for the issues that you are faced with when renting from them  Also  if you do choose to take the risk of renting from them     TAKE PICTURES OF EVERYTHING WHEN YOU ENTER THE UNIT and WHEN YOU LEAVE  My final thoughts       Everything Zen   I dont think so      Key amenities werent available upon checking or for the entire remainder of my stay  Host was Unresponsiveness and ghosted me after receiving payment   The instructions werent clear and it took a good while to figure it out  also there is a man and woman who stand at a desk to the entry way of the main door   they question every person on where their staying why their there  where they parked and just basically anything and everything THAT ISNT THEIR BUSINESS  Host was Unresponsive which has lead to unresolved trip issues  location is sub par and for the price I think parking should be included  Not worth a dime
720076330,This was one of the most difficult experiences that I have ever had while using Airbnb services  The check in process was a bit difficult due to me being provided a code that didnt give me access to the building  It took me   min to contact them multiple times and to finally get a physical key fob to get inside   The description states that it offers free parking space and thats one of the reasons why I chose this location  but once I arrived to check in  I was told that the previous guest lost the parking pass and I would have to pay for my own parking during my   day stay  I asked for a reimbursement  which they agreed to but I have still have received nothing and it has been WEEKS  I have reached out and have no gotten a response   The apartment that I stayed in had a messed up door   I ended up being locked out of the apartment for   hours while I waited for someone to come out and fix it  once he let me into the apartment I was told that I would need a whole new lock for the door since it was so messed up  Another guy was sent out and it took him   hours of banging  drilling  and cursing at the door to get it fixed  Chipping away at my peace and privacy during my stay  I explained this to the host and I have not heard anything back   I will never stay here again   thats for sure  In the description  it listed that there was a free parking space that would be available  After I arrive for me   day trip  I was told that there wasn u    t a parking pass due to the previous guest losing it  I was told that I would have to pay for my own parking for   days and that they would reimburse me  They have not been returning any of my messages and have yet to reimburse me  I spent    minutes trying to get into the building  The code that I was given  was not working and I had to call multiple times to get assistance During my stay communication was fine  Since my stay  there has been little to no communication in regards to reimbursing me and resolving the issues that I was having while I stayed at the location
640229639,You can expect that one of your guests wont be able to shut their bedroom door because the door is laying on the closet because it was knocked off of the hinges  You can also expect there will only be one bar chair to sit at the island and two chairs are so low that your chin will probably touch the top of the table  Wifi didnt work  You can also expect any concerns or issues you may run across you have to deal with yourself because the host is unresponsive   I had   guests for this   bedroom air bnb   guests traveling from Minnesota  I checked in before my guests arrived and one of the bedroom doors were completely off the hinges laying on the closet  So now one of my traveling guests don u    t have privacy to shut their paid for bedroom door  I expect to see what was advertised in this listing and that wasn u    t the case  The pool table was filthy the sticks were broken  One bar chair for island the rest of the chairs are short so don u    t expect to sit there with your guests  Mediocre for the price  Update photos for this listing   The host or Air Bnb never responded to the place smelling like cigarettes or the broken bedroom door laying on the closet  Horrible experience overall 
222406570,The place is big and nice and has a good potential  We did have some problems though  to start with a problem getting into the apartment  The caretaker  not owner  was unwilling to come and assist when the key box was not working  After     hours we got in as the owner picked us up  Sheets were dirty and floors needed vacuuming  This was fixed though rather fast after we pointed it out  The kitchen was nice and modern but missed many amenities and cooking equipment  broken glassware   one wine glass  no wine opener etc  The apartment is missing chars so not all can sit around the dining table and eat  Bed covers and towels were too few  Although it cannot be expected we could not get   hour extension on checkout   All in all we did have a good time at the place but a lot of time and trouble went with the issues that needed to be solved  Again the apartment is nice  newly renovated etc but currently not worth the high price  The place could become really nice with smoother checkin  fixing the lack of amenities  kitchen items  chairs  towels  bed covers to mention some   In the current condition though we didnt feel it was worth the money   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  Additional comments   u   cMissing kitchen items  chairs  towels  bed covers to mention some  u   d   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   Could not get into home  Keybox was broken and the caretaker was hesitant to come and let us in  We were stuck in the cold for a good half hour and continued to a another place waiting another hour before we could get in    Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  check in arrangements   Location ok  Not fantastic    The place was generally nice and big but expensive considering the missing amenities and trouble with checkin  cleanines  missing bed covers and towels

578724338,The bathroom was not cleaned properly  but i overlooked since it was a good price and a nice location  You cant have it all  can u  Had to clean the bathroom myself before using it  The bathmat  was broken and when i stepped on it   it came apart  Definently shouldve taken a picture of that  One doorknob was fixed with tape   again  not that big of a deal so i overlooked it  The problems and bad experience started  however   when i received a message from the host to rate him as a  star host and if i had any complaints i should tell them in private   A little wierd but ok  maybe thats how he runs his business   After leaving i was asked for money from the host in order to fix what suposingly i broke  Im sorry if someone broke them before me and the host didnt notice but i will not pay for something i didnt broke  It was a good location and i dont think the host had bad intentions  but again  the request for   stars and the whole experience was not a good one for me  The bathroom was not cleaned properly  but i overlooked since it was a good price and a nice location  You cant have it all  can u  Had to clean the bathroom myself before using it  The bathmat  was broken and when i stepped on it   it came apart  Definently shouldve taken a picture of that  One doorknob was fixed with tape   again  not that big of a deal so i overlooked it  The problems and bad experience started  however   when i received a message from the host to rate him as a  star host and if i had any complaints i should tell them in private   A little wierd but ok  maybe thats how he runs his business   After leaving i was asked for money from the host in order to fix what suposingly i broke  Im sorry if someone broke them before me and the host didnt notice but i will not pay for something i didnt broke  It was a good location and i dont think the host had bad intentions  but again  the request for   stars and the whole experience was not a good one for me 
721988090,From my experience I would say Zencity is a terrible property manager and I would not use them again  I was notified   minutes before my check in that the housekeeper took the keys out of town and they didnt know when she would be back  It was extremely disappointing and I was left scrambling to find a place last minute  To top it off they offered me a stay somewhere of half the value or a refund for half of what I paid for the air bnb  All in all I felt like I got scammed and I will be fighting for a full refund In my opinion there needs to be some major restructuring of how zen city manages properties  it was unacceptable to be notified   minutes before check in that I wouldnt be able to stay there and was left scrambling to find somewhere to say  The air bnb I was offered was significantly less than the one i booked meaning I would lose money then they tried to offer me half of a refund when I never even stepped foot on the property  I refused to cancel my reservation because this was in no way my fault nor did I have anything to do with why I couldnt stay there  Whoever is in charge of making sure check in will go smoothly needs to be notifying guests at least    hours in advance so they can make other arrangements  This whole situation was just absolutely unacceptable and I felt like I got scammed   Again I wouldn u    t know because I was informed   minutes before check in I wouldn u    t be able to stay there  I was told   minutes before check in that there was a  lock issue  and was offered a place to stay that was less than what I paid for the original place I booked when I asked what the lock issue was they said the housekeeper took the keys out of town They waited until   minutes before I was supposed to check in to tell me they didnt have the keys to the room because the housekeeper took them out of town  Then took even longer to try and come up with a half assed solution All I know is what the parking lot looks like Not good if I paid over      and couldnt even stay there 
719773589,Upon arriving at the location in Stl  my host did not send me check in instructions  After calling them it took another    minutes for them to find my information  As I enter the room the Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone would come to help with the alarm  They Completely failed to take care of it   so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in          would not recommend  this location or host  Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in   This is absolutely ridiculous that I have to go through so much to get a refund for such an awful stay  I will continue to reach out and request my money back   Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in   Host did not send me check in  instructions  Took    minutes in the cold outdoors foe them to figure it out Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in

617280915,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival  This is an automated posting 
551956934,This place was not very clean when we arrived and there were other guests in our airbnb when we arrived  The host was nice  but the space was not as expected and had barely any supplies such as plates  silver ware  cups  cooking necessities  etc   The description said there were all the essentials and then some  There were not enough dishes  only   frying pans to cook with  nothing to clean up at all  not enough pillows  blankets  sheets   The listing said Apt A  but the building said Apt     There were also people in our airbnb when we arrived  They were renting another listing of his and the code worked for both  Eventually he responded  but he was very slow at responding to any questions  Having a cleaner place with more amenities such as plates  cups  baking dishes  silver ware  serving bowls  etc  etc 
713103476,Everything was dirty and I didnt feel very safe  I cancelled the reservation and got a refund  I even found chewed gum in the bedroom  The host wanted to charge me and rent the space out the very next night  which is against zencitys claimed policy of having a gap between guests to clean the place  They have awful business practices  I wont be booking with them again  This place was disgusting  have better business practices   pictures looked the same  it wasnt advertised as a garden unit   easy enough to check in  the number combination was generic enough that I wasnt sure it had been changed and I didnt feel comfortable  After contacting the host to say I was cancelling my reservation because the whole place was a mess  air bnb got back to me way before the host did  and the host only offered to change the sheets so Id keep my reservation  He also wanted to charge me for an extra night so that he could rent the place out again that night  even though zencity says they have a gap between stays to professionally clean their places  Close to work  where I needed to go  was not told it was a garden unit  The location was creepy and not  well lit  This place was so gross I cancelled my week long reservation the next day  If I knew to call air bnb that night to complain  I wouldnt have spent any time there 
712403188,It expect the unexpected  The furniture was torn apart and there were plenty of stains and burned spots on the couches and carpet  The neighborhood is very nice and the house was clean but the furniture was all in bad shape  The bed frames are missing pieces which cause the bed to be uncomfortable and not leveled  The dining room chairs legs are all weak there for you cant sit down and eat at the dinning table  Also the couches were dirty  I couldnt have a sit  Last but not least the weather had dropped to below    and I wasnt able to adjust the temperature of the house  It was very cold   The dining room chairs are broken  the legs on the chairs are very weak  It caused my sister to hurt herself  The master bedroom bedroom frame is also broken  The bed isnt leveled  Last but not least the couches were dirty and plenty stains and the coffee table was broken aswell   The coffee table was extremely weak   It was very cold in each night inside the house and the host has a lock on the thermostat  The host took hours to respond back to me when I mentioned the fact Almost every piece of furniture has dirt and burn stains   The most important funter
715748715,It is spacious  has a nice tv and living room setup  and the kitchen has a lot of gadgets  However  I had a few sleepless nights  The radiator is not working correctly  About every     hours it starts a clanking noise that is indescribably loud  It certainly woke me up every few hours   The maintenance person had a look and confirmed that it needs to be repaired  Im sure he will repair it but it was not done so while I was there   Moving on to the bathroom  I lived in a similar building down the street a few years back  Both were old hotels which still contain the same bathtub  doors  door knobs and bathroom tile when it was first opened  A previous owner painted over the subway tiles on the wall in this place  as well as the porcelain bathtub  It looks awful and feels grimy  Also the doorknob fell off on the inside  trapping my wife in the bathroom for a bit before I was awoken and able to let her out  The maintenance man fixed that  The last thing to mention is that you can hear the pulley system of the elevator from the bedroom very clearly  The elevator shaft is next to the interior bedroom wall  so whenever it is in use  it causes a loud noise to occur   Ive stayed with zen city before and the places are usually much higher quality   The listing says there is a washer and dryer  There is not  The listing said the bathroom was new   It is at least    years old with the original tub and knobs from when it was first opened as a hotel

400594828,I  was scammed out of my money and a great experience  I would NEVER suggest anyone to utilize an Air Bnb if this will The result  I was NEVER acknowledged or apologized too in regards to this inconvenience  Im NOT sure if this company  or the host is racist  Im very upset and disappointed  Ive NEVER beeen treated like this before in my entire life   I am not refunded my money In a situation in which I contacted the host during the stay to Report a problem that was was never resolved during the stay   He never apologize or acknowledged the misrepresentation and lack of concern of Zencity end  This unacceptable   Proper preparation prevents poor performance  Never again Before you all scam others Out of a great experience  the lesser you can do is provide dish washing soap and heating in unit  When a guest contacts you in regards to this  atleast respond  Proper preparation prevents poor performance  Zencity performed and represented poorly  Never again will I book with Air Bnb or through Zencity again
590762586,I was going to over look how dirty this place was just because the bed was so amazingly comfortable and the tv in the living room had Netflix  After getting locked out for an hour on our second day  and not having the WiFi work for almost the entire time we were there I realized this place is crap  There were short curly black hairs in the dirty bathtub  The dishes put away in the cupboards were dirty  The kitchen counters were sticky  I will never stay here again It was really disappointing to pay a     cleaning fee and find the place so dirty  The dishes in the cupboards werent clean  The kitchen counters were sticky  The bathtub had hairs in it  short  curly hairs  and a ring around it  The internet also did not work after our first day there  Getting locked out for an hour was really unfortunate too  I could not be more unhappy with the service you provided and I will tell my friends and family never to book anything with you
588448936,Blood on the sheets and bathroom was filthy it was never cleaned before me and my   yr old got there  Just nasty I paid a cleaning fee just to have to clean up soon as I got in the door and buy blankets  I feel I should have been refunded my cleaning fee No parking at all If it was clean
571860734,First things first  the pictures of the apartment on the post is not the one you will get  We arrived at      PM  had a very long flight  however this is no hot water  no hot shower  Contact the host at      PM  and got reply the next morning at     AM  I dont blame the late reply because it was late in the night when I found out there is completely no hot water   The next morning my colleague told me her bed is very dirty l  lots of black and brown particles   Also I noticed there are hairs on the towel  After   hours waiting  The host sent a building manager to check hot water   and confirm there is completely no hot water in the shower  In the kitchen he was letting the water running about half an hour and start to feeling some temperature  The most ridiculous thing is  the host charge us     cleaning fee  He was doing nothing but wasting our time  There is no compensation for our time  the miss led pictures of hosts post  the awful experience of our stay    I have notice this is a so called professional management company  under its name of Zencity there are several airbnb properties    I will defiantly be caution and  wake away 
519993626,I wouldnt stay here again  First  I arrived around   pm  As I was settling in  I realized that there were no bath towels in the unit  Two washcloths and a hand towel   thats it  I usually shower at night because I have to wake up quite early  so this was a huge inconvenience off the bat  I contacted the host immediately  and they said they had someone in the building who could do a load of laundry and drop towels off later in the evening  which would have been around    pm   past the time I needed to be in bed  I waited until    pm  but no towels arrived  Frustrating beyond belief  What kind of Airbnb doesnt have towels waiting for you    To make matters worse  as I resigned myself to the fact that I wasnt going to be getting the towels before morning  I found a dead cockroach on the bathroom floor  At this point  I considered gathering my things and finding another place to stay  but I was too tired  so I just went to bed  The next morning  I went to the kitchen to make tea and noticed that the cabinets were covered in grease  There were also dishes in the dishwasher that I couldnt tell were clean or dirty  On top of that  the floors of the unit hadnt been thoroughly swept or vacuumed  and I found little pieces of hair in the bed linens as I was making the bed  Overall  the lack of cleanliness in this unit made me feel uneasy both nights of my stay  On a positive note  the door staff were super friendly  and the location was great  Just be mindful of parking as others have noted 
490217002,Im not really sure what to say but this was probably my worst Airbnb experience  When I arrived  I was surprised to discover that there wasnt any central air conditioning  I know that Chicago is the Windy City and that high temperatures arent the norm  but given that there was a heat advisory the week of my trip  it made for some miserable and sweaty nights  Though the host did his best to accommodate my needs by providing fans  it just wasnt enough  If there was an a c unit in the bedroom that wouldve been helpful  but unfortunately  there is only one in the living room  I also thought that this property is overpriced and that the pictures are a bit deceiving  I was underwhelmed upon arrival  I also was really disappointed in the couch  It was pretty uncomfortable  Overall  I was disappointed  However  I do think this would be a cool place to stay in the cooler months  Its a really fun area  Thank you so much for trying to accommodate my needs by providing two fans upon request  However  given how hot it was in Chicago during my visit  it made for a pretty unpleasant stay  I honestly was surprised that there wasnt any central air or at least an air conditioning unit in the bedroom  I slept in the living room the last night of my stay  which might of been a good solution if the couch cushion were so worn  Also  I felt as though your listing was a bit deceitful  You dont disclose the lack of central air and even cover up the a c unit with a curtain  If I had none this in the beginning  especially since I have asthma  I would not have made this reservation  Overall  I was pretty disappointed  Furniture and Central Air Conditioning
489343789,The place was acceptable the views were great  The A C was ok but not great  The bathroom had peeling paint on the ceiling and the light fixtures were rusted  My wife slipped and fell in the Bathtub that had no mat or anti slip coating or grab bars  Once we reported this and that she broke a rib  the host abandoned us  For those who follow us  we bought a mat for the tub so no one else would experience the same humiliation  We had no help once we reported the problem  We will not reccomend or rent from this group again  When we had a problem you abandoned us  We had a problem and once we let them know all communication stopped 
481975249,Upon arrival  we were greeted with two persistent alarms beeping  It turned out to be the carbon monoxide detectors  I immediately alerted the host and they said they would contact maintenance to check it out  In the meantime  we unplugged and reset them  That seemed to do the trick and the beeping stopped    at least for a while    Later that night     we plugged them back in and went to bed  No beeping until  am when we were startled out of sleep   We could not get the carbon monoxide alarms to stop  It wasnt until we opened up all the windows and turned on all the fans that the alarms would finally stop  unplugging and resetting didnt do anything   Needless to say  we had a pretty fit full night of sleep   I messaged the host again  explaining that the carbon monoxide detectors went off again  They said they were sorry for the inconvenience and that maybe the maintenance crew couldnt make it out because on the holiday  I then went on to explain in detail what happened that night and added   Also  alarming   it appears that all of the smoke detectors are dead  and missing in some rooms    No response from the host  other than asking me to give them a   star review    Wow  Unresponsive when I mentioned that there was a more serious issue with the carbon monoxide detectors and dead and missing smoke detectors  More comfortable living room furniture  dressers  full set of dishes and glassware  ie only one wine glass   one ceiling fan in living room is broken  nonworking smoke detectors  an obvious carbon monoxide issue   
480832069,The place is fine  decorated well and in a nice area  But it smells very bad  check in was very difficult and you may be accused of taking random things from the room that the cleaning person decides have gone missing and charged for them later  We called Zencity customer service to help us with check in to get into the building and they couldnt even help  We just had to wait    minutes until someone came by willing to open the door for us  The check in gave us a keypad code for the door to the apartment  but the whole apartment building was locked and we were supposed to have a FOB available to unlock the building  The door is not manned at all times to let people in  Wouldve been great  until the host told us the cleaning person reported iPhone docks missing that were not in the apartment at all to our knowledge and tried to charge us nearly      There are way too many factors to accuse guests of taking some random object from a place  especially when they werent there in the first place 
470767218,I made it clear that there were three of us  all adults  arriving  yet it turned out that only one queen sized bed was available and there was no couch  This meant that we had to go all the way to the city center to purchase a sleeping bag the day of our arrival  after the fatigue of a    hour flight   This was not the service I had expected after paying such a high price   I made it clear that there were three adults arriving  yet it turned out that only one queen sized bed was available and there was no couch  This meant that we had to go all the way to the city center to purchase a sleeping bag the day of our arrival  after a    hour flight   This was not the service I had expected after paying such a high price  
362546015,Not recommend  The host would be so unresponsive and  irresponsible when you encounter some problem even though it is not your fault  In my case  he just told me to call the building technician  which was not free  when I was locked out  because I got no key on check in and  the two locks on the door both work  Now the host still ignores my request for the reimbursement of the stupid money I paid   Last issue   the Wifi is not so stable and fast even after being restarted  We did not get the fob to the main entrance when we checked and no one sent it to us after we notified the host The host is so irresponsible  Firstly  he did not inform us that there were two locks for the door which both worked well  When we were locked out because of the door knob lock  he just told us to call the building maintenance and did not send us the key  In the end  we had to pay eighty dollars to the technician for sending us the key  Ironically  he sent two of his men to disable the door knob lock the next day and finally gave me the fob but still did not admit that it was totally his faut 
358224193,Dont expect communication other than an answering service that goes unanswered  They just disappear behind cancellation charges and no compassion for legitimate excuse for cancellation and rebooking  Then raise the rates the next week for same nights  Cold and opportunistic  Never will rebook with them  No response to many communications you said I could cancel and then charge  night stay I know that was your policy but you didnt have to enforce it and could have rebooked me for same days the next week that I asked for  Instead you charge      more for the list day and increased rates the next week  Bad busines  Never responded to my communication other than saying I could cancel before I arrived but still charged  night stay  I booked the wrong week 
333694054,This was my first Airbnb experience and I was definitely not happy with the management  Arriving after waiting all day to check in only to find that the unit had not been cleaned was quite disappointing and highly inconvenient  The dishes were not clean despite being in the cabinet so we were unable to cook  There was also a problem with the entertainment WiFi so we were unable to watch TV until we purchased our own HDMI cable  I am hesitant to use Airbnb again due to this extremely poor experience  This was my first Airbnb experience and I was definitely not happy with the management  Arriving after waiting all day to check in only to find that the unit had not been cleaned was quite disappointing and highly inconvenient  The dishes were not clean despite being in the cabinet so we were unable to cook  There was also a problem with the entertainment WiFi so we were unable to watch TV until we purchased our own HDMI cable  I am hesitant to use Airbnb again due to this extremely poor experience 
332574093,The hot water was out one morning  cold shower before work  and the host response time was very poor  Six hours to respond the message     hours to get someone out there  All the responses started with  Sorry for the delayed response      I cant stay here again because if something goes wrong  like basic necessities fail or the front door lock fails  Im afraid it will take   hours for the host to check his messages and two days to get anyone out to the property  As a business traveler this is a risk I can not tolerate  The slow to no response time when the hot water was out only made us wonder what would happen if the electronic front door lock failed  How long we would be on the street   Great location and a great place  but we are business travelers and wont be able to stay here again  One morning we woke to no hot water   I messaged and texted the host at      AM  and again later in the morning  I didnt here back until about      PM    he had  put in a request with maintenance    Follow up text was not answered until after we came back from a day of work to no hot water  SO that meant cold showers  again  All the hosts replies started with  Sorry for the delayed response       We found the poorly labeled fuse box and threw fuses until the hot water heater reset  I messaged the host  he responded late  again and still sent a guy out the following evening       hour response time for a hot water outage  which would have been two days of cold showers if we didnt take matters into our own hands  The uncertainty that if anything went wrong there would be no to slow response ruined the stay  I imagine if the electronic lock failed we would be on the street for the night 
325721274,the bathroom flooded   times  Water overflowed  Notified the owner said he would send maintenance and when we came back from dinner water was still there and bathroom was not clean  went and got maintenance from the front desk and stayed up till   am cleaning everything  Next morning used it again over flowed and just decided it was time to leave  Told the owner we used the clean towels to make a barricade so water would not flow into the living room asked to send towels in the morning  sent them at   pm next day  Ruined our first night in Chicago  Nice place  just never renovated the bathroom  Asked the maintenance if it was our fault even tho we only used it for number    he replied no the building has this issue 
297881275,Overall   the place was nice    Previous reviews mentioned noisy neighbors  which was the case  but thats not on the owner by any means  The neighbors were also smoking weed all through the night with the smell creeping into the bedroom  Again  thats not on the owner   There was quite a bit of hair on the bathroom and kitchen floors which made it seem as if there was zero vacuuming before our arrival   Bring a sleep mask  Theres a bright light outside of the bedroom window and the window curtain is piece of paper thin and white as a ghost  Some blackout curtains need to be installed if you want a quality night of sleep   The above issues arent a huge deal at the end of the day  The big issue was when my girlfriend came back in the middle of the day and found phone chargers on the kitchen table which were not there when we arrived the previous night  Im assuming the owner came to drop them off while we were not there  Im not sure what Air B Bs rule is for owners coming to the place during a customers stay  but thats screwed up  in my opinion  For one  I had my laptop and a few hundred dollars in cash in my bag  Two  my girlfriend had been in the shower at one point  so they could of knocked and just came in when she was in there    And no  I was not previously informed that he she would be stopping by  
292702382,Suite was nicely equipped with all the stuff youd need for a short stay  Cookware the landlord provided is of surprisingly good quality  However  we found the bathtub was clogged when we arrived  Landlord wasnt able to provide us with any help on a timely manner except for saying no one in his team was available to take a look  I had to walk to Target in the middle of the night to buy Drano  After a couple hours of trying different things we managed to fix it ourselves   and that left me not much time to sleep before my poster presentation  God  such a nightmare  Landlord refunded me for the Drano  But at one point we felt like we were there to be his cleaning staff and he didnt even pay for our labour and time  Didnt argue further  I am just trying to forget the sewage back flow and the ball of hair and filth we pulled out from the sewer  Oh god   
642252246,Great place and location  had a hard time getting host to reply back
625136906,Apartment is in a good area  some issues with cleanliness  but other than that it was a nice weekend away just clean better especially during a pandemic  nobody wants to walk in to a place that is supposed to be covid free and see hand prints and stains from previous guest  It being clean 
603234505,When my family and I arrived  the thermostat in the apartment read    degrees    it was only    outside in Chicago  I tried contacting via message and     hour  support  The apartment hadnt been recently cleaned and it seemed as if no one had stepped foot in it for a while  I left   voice messages with no reply  I chatted with one person back and forth about that and issues with the cleanliness of the apartment and after about    minutes  she stopped responding to my messages after telling me theyd try to find building maintenance but couldnt guarantee because it was a Friday   I finally had to contact Airbnb directly who actually talked to the host  as he ignored my messages and calls  and was told that he couldnt handle it as it was a Friday night  At this point  it was almost midnight and no other property could be booked   Due to the frigid temperatures  there was no way we could stay and were forced to find a hotel    which most were booked for the evening  Communication is key  The lack of responsiveness via message and phone was frustrating  Also  checking location before guests arrive would have solve the problems experienced 
586366342,Please make better efforts when it comes to cleaning the room  We had a dirty towel  bed sheets had stains  bar stools were beyond filthy  both bathroom showers were dirty and had smashed gnats on the ceiling  The bed in back bedroom is just about broke  blinds didnt work at all  None of us were able to successfully connect to the WiFi  The entry way when first walking in was a disaster  Looked like it hasnt been swept in months  Mail and newspaper laid in the walkway  Stains all on the walls and bathroom doors  We went to cook and utensils hadnt been washed  The picture are a bit misleading when it come to the cleanliness of the the place  Please make better efforts when it comes to cleaning the room  We had a dirty towel  bed sheets had stains  bar stools were beyond filthy  both bathroom showers were dirty and had smashed gnats on the ceiling  The bed in back bedroom is just about broke  blinds didnt work at all  None of us were able to successfully connect to the WiFi  The entry way when first walking in was a disaster  Looked like it hasnt been swept in months  Mail and newspaper laid in the walkway  Stains all on the walls and bathroom doors  We went to cook and utensils hadnt been washed  The picture are a bit misleading when it come to the cleanliness of the the place  No place to park  Better efforts on cleaning and designated parking spot 
627334983,Terrible stay 
626137343,Cute place  Quiet  Safe feeling 
644310046,X Terrible check in  No doorman       Had to call maintenance  person in Chicago  didnt respond for more than one hour   Had to wait for pseudo doorman to unlock main door  Also  when I requested an extra day no one communicated the code  had changed   Seems like amateurs in action   No apologies or refunds from anyone 
640083008,Do NOT stay here  Do not support Zencity  Absolutely the worst experience  Dirty furniture  dirty pillows  reeked of smoke and alcohol  there was cigerette burns  carpet stains  worse yet extremely dirty hand prints and gross muck over all the handles and doorknobs  Dirty mop water left in toliet  Worst yet  there was a red fluid smeared all over the place  on furniture and the drapes   absoluely disgusting  This all started with them giving me a   hour delay on my checkin  then when i finally get the room  it was a horror show  I called and asked for a different room and asked them to come to room to see the issues  They said they were all booked and couldnt help me  i said i would stay at friends and they would send a really good cleaning crew and would fix the room in the morning  I came back to the room the next day at  pm and they didnt send anyone  Room was the exact same  So i called to get a refund and they would not answer my calls or texts  They do not care about their guests health  If you are at all worried about Covid do not stay here  They are taking no measures for guests  You treated me completely terrible and with total disregard  i am literally traumatized by my experience   Literally zero compassion or care for your guests health or well being   From the two hour late checkin  to the completely disgusting room  and then you promised me to clean room and lied and never sent anyone to fix  Then act like you doing me a favor by giving me    dollars  The absolute worst host ive ever seen  Im not done with this    Showed up and place was not ready  Had to wait in lobby as they  cleaned  the place   Finally got my room at    So a two hour late check in  and then the room was disgusting You like your health  Dont stay here  They are not a responsible host   Btw Airbnb was completely unhelpful    hour wait times on phone  Keep moving me to different responders  Supposed to be contacted and moved to another place as part of their guarantee and they never responded back 
661158798,DO NOT STAY HERE  UNSAFE   The door to my Airbnb automatically locked when the door closed  The door code was on my Airbnb app  I walked out the side of my room and the door closed behind me  My cell phone was inside  Luckily I had my wallet with my ID  So I thought Id be fine  I was wrong  I went to the lobby of the apartment building and used the phone in there  I didnt have any numbers so I called the number listed on the door of the building  I was basically told that they could not help me  They wouldnt look up the number to a locksmith for me  I called them a total of four times begging for help  I told them I have my ID and everything  They refused again and again  They told a single woman at      in the morning to walk the street and figure it out basically    It was appalling to me to hear someone tell a young woman to do that  This is totally unacceptable  If youre going to have an automatic locking device you should know that theres a chance someone can get locked out of that without the code  You should have a procedure in place  Im contacting my attorney  I suffer from PTSD and Im so shaken up  I was put in a dangerous situation due to negligence and I am very upset  We were locked out of our Airbnb at around   PM  with no cell phones because of keypad entry and auto locking device    We could not log into airbnb due to security features    I used the phone in the apartment buildings lobby  We had no numbers because our phones were locked in the room    I called the buildings number listed on the door  I was told that they could not get in touch with the Airbnb host  They could not help me get into my Airbnb  They could not log in to any electronic devices on my behalf  They refused to look up the number to a locksmith  They told me that I would need to find a phone to use  So I was basically told to wander around Kansas City Missouri at night as a single woman  I was terrified  My safety was totally put at risk  I was downtown  I was lost    I suffer from ptsd and I was so shaken up  I didnt know who to ask to use a cell phone    I couldnt get into my Airbnb for five hours  I was on the street until close to   or   AM  I was unsafe 
643949008,BEWARE     the apartment I was in had DAMAGE already in several areas   Closet doorknob broken off and lying on the floor  golf ball size hole in the bottom of the bedroom door  hole scratch in closet door  etc etc    I luckily had the forethought to take pictures of all of the scratches and holes in doors when I arrived  They tried to charge me      for a broken doorknob and a scratch on the front door  that one I hadnt seen  In total there was about   things damaged in the apartment  So they completely picked and chose which damages to charge me for amd which to ignore completely    I have a feeling they charge people for damage that they never end up fixing    and thats how they make money  Its disgusting  I will be fighting this issue  I rejected the request for money and had heard nothing from them since after I yelled at whoever was on the phone  So we will see  Its sad because the apartment and the view was gorgeous  But I WILL NOT be renting from them ever again  They have several apartments they rent out  BEWARE OF ZENCITY 
648999479,A dirty ass place Get a new cleaning crew Didnt call Get a new cleaning crew
623662914,Good value Unfortunately disappointed with the way the place was cleaned  If Im honest with you I dont think anyone had cleaned it prior to us coming  It looked like no one had stayed for a while and dust had built up on the covers and furniture  Then to top it off your covers have blood stains on them as well  There were no paper towels either in the kitchen  The dryer and washer never turned on 
646694542,Very unresponsive  definitely would book elsewhere if your not wanting to stress over your room on vacation at all 
722199816,WORST Airbnb experience EVER  Awful instructions and NO PARKING  We were locked out for HOURS because our key fob did not allow us access  We made it in with help of apartment tenants  The individuals working this scheme dump were fairly quick at responding but not at all helpful  The place itself was NOT cleaned and smelled like CIGARETTE smoke  The sinks in the bathroom as well as the shower had HAIR in it  Plus the couches and lounge chairs also had a horrible smell and significant amount of hair in it  The worst part was the BED  There is no way ANY person on earth would find this mattress comfortable  We felt as though we were sleeping on a wood plank  We were both afraid to make any quick movements in fear we would break a bone or paralyze ourselves  VERY LOUD ambulances all evening long  We were supposed to stay   nights and ended up leaving in the middle of the night to get a hotel nearby  Locked out of building for HOURS Somewhat quick responses Awful parking options
722017187,Maybe it was an off weekend for them but there was no towels in the apartment  The bathroom still had hair in the shower from last tenant and hair in the corners of the bathroom  It was unclean  Difficult to check in  More difficult than most Ive dealt with 
627988415,  Had injury due to broken furniture in properties
619055091,I am extremely disappointed in your unwillingness to refund        for Sunday nights stay  There is enough stress traveling during these uncertain times and your uncompassionate decision not to refund us made things ever more difficult  Our pre existing conditions  asthma and COPD  make us vulnerable to Covis     our decision to leave and get home as soon as possible was mandatory  Id never consider staying at your place again  nor will I recommend you as hosts to others  An entire disappointment  I am extremely disappointed in your unwillingness to refund        for Sunday nights stay  There is enough stress traveling during these uncertain times and your uncompassionate decision not to refund us makes things ever more difficult  Our pre existing conditions  asthma and COPD  make us vulnerable to Covis     our decision to leave and get home as soon as possible was mandatory  Id never consider staying at your place again  nor will I recommend you as hosts to others 
622143655,Police calls and lying neighbors Neighbors didnt call police on no one outside none of my stay while they sat out smoking whatever they had that was horrible for what I paid for  Neighbors call the police  I stepped outside for my little brother to smoke a cigarette hes a military vet and his wife  However I stepped outside sat on the hood of my car did not make any noise some neighbor called police  no one walked past us no one came up to us to ask questions  however the police parked on the wrong side of the street with his high beams on us  We sat till he was done smoking his cigarette  went back in ate dinner he left  I received a call from the host stating a neighbor called police and him saying we were loud and smoking pot in the neighborhood garden   But police passed right by us  The temperature in the house is locked at       degrees    There is no smoking allowed however thee apartment building its self smelt like pot everyday  The walls are paper then I heard the neighbors entire conversation upstairs  I wanted to extend but my God after the first day incident I was afraid to even go outside for fresh air         but get this I told my little brother we could smoke outside because this is non smoking thinking it was ok because I seen other people from the time I checked in  pm  stayed inside   min to the time I actually came back in to sit and cook  about   maybe  pm  people were outside just puffing away no problem  I drive for Instacart just moved back from ATL Ga  If neighbors will do horrible things like call police on guest for no reason there should b smoking allowed inside 
622515880,Make sure you take pictures of the place before you stay they will blame you for existing damage
622741752,Never again Horrible  Worst experience ever  My car and purse was stolen and I tried having a different card billed and they just couldnt get it correct for the life of them
631305704,The internet speed was below     Mbps and I wasnt able to work from this location or even stream Netflix  The rug in the main living room needed to be vacuumed pretty badly and the comforter in the bedroom had a pretty big brown stain on it  No parking  I just think with what I paid  I would have expected it to be cleaner 
624154378,We have stayed with this host in the past and had minor issues  This time around we were placed in an entirely different unit than pictured  Our headboard was missing  furniture was missing  no table and chairs  etc  The foyer was of the space was gorgeous  however  once we got to our floor it smelled like cat litter and the floor was dirty  There is tons of construction that kept us up into the wee hours  This was not a pleasant experience  The unit assigned was not the one pictured  It was mid update  no headboard  no accent furniture pictured  entirely different 
673678395,We arrived at the unit about    mins before  pm so I messaged the host to see if we could check in early  We didnt get a response so we waited in the car until the  pm check in time  We went up to the unit  through a very dirty building and elevator   we arrived to the unit and followed the checkin instructions for the keypad  It didnt work  We tried multiple times and the door alarm started going off  because of too many failed attempts Im assuming   I messaged zencity to see what was going on and we waited again  No response  so I called to see how we get in    while on hold we tried the door a couple more times and it finally allowed us in  We finally got a callback from a zencity representative    mins after my initial message about the entry issues    The first thing we noticed on entry is that there are no locks on the doors other than the keypad lock  There werent even handle locks on the main or patio door  That didnt make us feel very safe  When zencity finally contacted me about the entry issues I asked them about the sofa bed  we were under the impression the sofa was a bed as well  as there were two of us traveling and a need for two sleeping accommodations   The rep said to remove the cushions from the couch and the area creates enough room for someone to sleep  I told him a small child could not even fit on the couch comfortably as it was maybe only   feet long  Then I was informed that the unit we booked was the smaller couch unit and wouldnt work  So that was disappointing   Of course one thing piles on top of another at this point and we started noticing the cleanliness issues in the unit  We expected more cleaning practices since COVID   has created higher cleaning standards  The floorboards had dust build up  which meant they hadnt been touched in some time  There were fingerprint smudges on the mirror and glass door to the patio  The bathroom sink had soap residue as if the the dispenser was recently used  the toilet had stains and residue on the outside of the toilet and the inside rim  and there was dirt buildup in the corners  The walkthrough closet between the main area and bathroom had a broken table chair  which means our table only had one chair  and several other items stacked up in the space  Upon our discovery of the cleanliness issues on top of the lack of locks and sofa bed issue  we decided the place was not fit for us to stay as health and safety standards were not appeasing  Upon speaking with the host  and escalating it to Airbnb for support because the host refused issues  about the issues  cancellation  and possible refunds because we even had picture evidence of our issues    the host only agreed to refund half of   night of a   night stay and Airbnb was able to get them to agree to refund the cleaning fee   The building itself is    blocks from downtown  so it is not  close  to the touristy areas of the arch  Busch stadium  or the river and the neighborhoods between are not the best to walk  especially at night  We had asked prior to our arrival about dining places around the area as we are avid foodies and so we could get a better feel for the area  but there was never a response to that message  Im assuming because the host is not actually onsite or possibly not even located in St Louis  they are an offsite property management company  If you do stay here  Id recommend you drive or use a rideshare to get downtown safely as there were no dining options in the direct vicinity of the building  Which had we known prior to arriving  by means of getting a response about the dining options  which we never got  we wouldve cancelled well before arrival and zencity wouldve been required by their own cancellation policy to refund us more than     for   nights   Overall  I would not recommend this or any Zencity unit to anyone  as the cleanliness and safety standards were less than needed to be and the lack of communication  guest service  and resolve were unacceptable  We arrived at the unit    minutes early so we waited in the car until  pm  We went to the unit at     pm and the code did not work  We tried it multiple times and it still did not worked  and locked out the system to where an alarm started going off  I messaged zencity to let them know the issues  they called    mins later   While we were waiting for a response from Zencity I also decided to call them and see if that was faster than the emails  Was on hold and we kept trying the door  It finally allowed us entry after a couple more tries and I hung up from being on hold 
625681617,Construction worker attempted to enter my Airbnb  Im a small woman and while staying here a construction worker tried to enter the Unit  I called hello and he ignored me and tried the lock again  I had to get up and run to lock it   He continues to ignore me while I scream hello and tries again  Finally he walks away talking to a colleague   Simply terrifying   I also had no WiFi for the majority of my stay  Wrong password was given to me  then once it was found  it was shut off   I had to pay for hotspot on my phone because I had to work still  CONSTRUCTION at  AM TILL  PM DIRECTLY ABOVE MY UNIT    The space itself was beautiful  Couldve been cleaned a bit more  Such a shame  Was looking forward to escaping for a relaxing few days  Instead was meet with more terror and frustration  The WiFi password was wrong for the first days  Then I got the right one only to have it shut off    The construction worker not only attempting to enter but IGNORING when I called out hello only to have him try to come in again after HEARING ME INSIDE AND NOT RESPONDING is unacceptable and likely to be a criminal offense    Im a victim of sexual assault and mugging  This was extremely distressing and caused ptsd   ADD A DEADBOLT    No guest SHOULD EVER feel this way  There was no WiFi nearly the entire time  Construction all day in the unit directly above me  Im a small woman alone and a construction worker attempted to enter the air Bnb while I was there   I screamed hello and he imputes the access code to the door  I heard it unlock and I ran to relock it  Terrifying experience  Management provided a     discount for the  brief interruption   it wouldve been perfect if I had internet  wasnt scared to death  or construction    
628497897,The place had not been cleaned since the previous guests   You could tell someone picked up but the carpets were not vacuumed and had god knows what in them  The floors were half swept  the bedding smelled like it had been slept in  The instructions to get in were not clear  You have to hold your hand up to the lock and use the code they send  The AC unit has no physical control unit so it was FREEZING and there was nothing I could do about it  The windows had no screens  Sticky cabinets  I wish it had been cleaned because if so it was honestly a cute place in a quiet neighborhood  During the pandemic  One would think improper cleaning should result in an internal investigation  I honestly do not understand how this place was so dirty  I had no idea how to use the lock I had to google it Cleanliness
628936807,This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with booking  Upon arrival which was after  PM the entire apartment was filthy  not dirty but filthy  When I reached out to the host  there was no response until  pm regarding the nature of the apartment  By this time a woman arrived at the apartment without knocking  entered the apartment and did not state who she was  It was revealed upon me asking she was the cleaning person for the apartment   arriving   hours later  This is unacceptable with COVID being popular  I even sent pictures to the host showing how dirty the apartment was  I had to wipe down the entire apartment with disinfect wipes and change the sheets myself  The only thing the cleaning lady did was sweep and take the trash out as I had already did her job  Which is something I should have not been compelled to do  The host was not accommodating as I expressed how upset I was  for what I experienced  The response was   well she cleaned it now  No I cleaned it  She just took the trash out  I will NEVER rent here again  Rent at your own risk  If you like piss smell and a filthy environment  this is the place for you  Sometimes reasonable cheap is not worth your comfort 
623300084,  The floor had stuff on the floor when you walk in    Then the bathroom still had hair in the tub
624616469,The place was infested with bugs  I reached out to Zencity three times and I was told that a maintenance man would be out  They never sent anyone  Imagine bugs being all over the walls   floors  night stand  and bed  They suggested I use some spray that was there  I did  It did not work  I even asked if they had another Airbnb available  They did not  They offered no compensation    Also the walls are thin  You can hear everything outside your door  I asked for a refund and have not got a response  The bedroom was infested with bugs 
627858649,Honestly I could see Zencity having really great airbnbs  but I got unlucky  No working lock for three days  massive leaks from dishwasher  maintenance coming in and out  construction going on   asked for towels and got them on the third day  I have nothing but complaints and asked for my money back or help and got no response  Awful  They sent me the wrong key code  AFTER I had to call and ask for it   Then when the lock didnt work the rest of the time it was suggested that I was not typing in the right code  On my third day  or not having a working lock and relying on the doorman to let us in and out of the flat  they said the electric lock is broke  Guess it wasnt my fault after all  Dismal  Response rate slow  closed after  pm  not very professional
671899189,The place wasnt cleaned when I got there  I had to stay in a hotel instead  The host has not refunded me    weeks later  My place wasnt cleaned out at all when I got there  I had to find a hotel at    at night   You promised a refund   weeks ago and I havent gotten one  Please refund me immediately 
624037737,Unit was clean but not sparkling clean and in an area with several homeless wandering and didnt feel safe   While it was cheap and a good value close to downtown I would give this a     out of   overall and we didnt stay our  nd night to just move on      The apartment was not as pictured  different furniture  different layout  it is probably another unit in the building but I was confused why they wouldnt put up exact pictures of the unit   There was also a strong marijuana odor likely coming from other units and both elevators were not working the  nd half of our stay   The stairwell was completely disgusting  as we had to hold our breath to go up from floor   to   as floors     smelled of strong human urine   We left at   oclock on our  nd day there and did not stay the night of       Overall a     stay    
705951268,The bones of this apartment were nice  It has comfortable furniture  was clean  had nice amenities in the kitchen and bathroom and had an awesome location  Unfortunately  I am quite disappointed in the management during my stay  After the first night  I reported an issue with the heater making excessive noise  The responded that they would send someone to check it out  Later in the week  nobody had come to check it yet and it stopped heating all together  I informed the manager again via message and phone call and he said that he would send someone that day to check it but again nobody came  so I had to spend two nights without heat  I will definitely avoid renting from Zencity again  It took the host several hours to respond to questions  Also  I communicated an issue with the heater and was told twice that they would send someone to come check it out but never received follow up  I spent two nights without heat 
623563772,   stairs but its beautiful  The place looked beautiful but it really need some changes  Thank you for allowing me to stay  When I arrived the unit smelled like the cleaning staff took a poop and left  It was a long lingering stench  There was no tub stop to take a bath  I had to run out and buy one and when I returned and turned the water on the knob fell off in my hand  Thee was huge wet stain on the couch like someone had sex and left  I tried to negotiate another couple days because I accumulated a lot of things and the unit was on the fourth floor   They never responded and then said the unit was booked  It forced me to leave pre maturely and I wasnt prepared  It is a few feet from a train that ran all day and all night  I couldnt sleep much because it was very noisey   It was    stairs to get to the unit  If you are not able to do steps you will lose your money  I was exhausted  It needed repairs and new furniture 
702154519,We were told to be quit and respectful to the other units and they had an all night and day party with tons of people and made tons of noise  It was really bad  On top of that not having warm water was a struggle for showers   The key was put in the wrong lock box  so there was a delay in check in  Great location  but I wouldnt recommend this place  We were told to be quit and respectful to the other units and they had an all night and day party with tons of people and made tons of noise  It was really bad  On top of that not having warm water was a struggle for showers  Keys were put into the wrong lock box Water was cold for    hours  and a     hour loud party going on upstairs Location was the only thing good about this place  We wouldnt recommend it or use it again 
645261912,The place is fine  The location is fine  Just note  I went to the CVS on Sunday night      pm for water and I was locked out of this apartment on July    through  July    at      am because their  electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  All of my things were already inside the apartment  I called their number and they said they could not help me until tommorow  They also did not have another spare key to get into the apartment  I went back to the apartment at      am and finally someone came to open up the apartment  They removed the broken electronic keypad and gave me a key  They do not know what went wrong  I also noticed this place is charging me for all the days in the apartment even though I could not stay there on Sunday night  Very shady practice    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience I was locked out of your apartment on july    through  July         am because your electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  Then at      am someone came to open up the apartment    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience I was locked out of your apartment on july    through  July         am because your electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  Then at      am someone came to open up the apartment    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience
652910643,I was refused entry after notifying the hosts and Airbnb that I tested positive for COVID  I wasnt offered a refund  yet instead was promoted to cancel on my own  while paying over half for the stay   Then when I communicated that I wasnt able to where masks  short supply at the hospital  and my disposables were destroyed  after being hospitalized and having no support  canceling my flight  and driving   hours to St  Louis to stay in the listing  I was told  the check in was in fact accessible through a door man  and was threatened if I show I wont be able to enter and that my code to do was indeed revoked   I was stranded  no place to sleep and slept in my rental car  I also had to find abandoned areas to use the restroom due to COVID and me not wanting to enter any stores or restaurants and infect other ppl   This all could have been avoided had Airbnb either intervened or if the host would have canceled  seeing as I wasnt allowed in the listing and also a health threat to everyone in the building    Also  I was allowed to still stay even though I was positive I was refused entry because I didnt have any face coverings  I didnt bother to  check in  anyways for fear of my safety  or the police being called  With all that I experienced from having COVID  this wasnt worth it   Beware of positive COVID guests  however this hosts posses proper professionalism until I refused to gave cancelation penalties    I cant rate what I didnt see  so my rating reflects just that   Wishing you well  Ryann
653928700,I didnt have a great experience when I got there  No water pressure  no hot water  WiFi stopped working when I was on a conference call  no hair dryer and it smelled like cigarettes   The location however is perfect and the host moved me to another apartment which made up for all my negative experiences It started kind of like a disaster but glad you moved me to the other apartment which made up for all the bad experiences  You should however try to respond quicker
672666876,Close to everything but furniture needs to be replace Bed rails are broken and sofa leg was broken 
652305052,If you are looking for a nice set up based on pictures  this is your spot  But once you arrive  you may think feel otherwise  The kitchen common area is nice  And the location is ideal   However  once you get to the rooms   thats another story  Theres a visible leak outside of the apartment that seems to have been a problem for months  You can see the ceiling in the hallway of the apartment starting to buckle  Once you get to the master bedroom  youre met with a TERRIBLE smell thats deeply embedded in the carpet and it just needs to come up  The carpet is definitely wet from the leak as you can see the wording on the bottom of your shoes on the bathroom tile  Hand grease prints on the wall and the ceiling fan is packed with dust and spiderwebs forming   you can tell its been months since that was cleaned  The cleaning is simply just not up to par for the price of the stay  Luckily we only stayed   nights   You can take your chances on this one   the issue may or may not be resolved by the time you stay  Dont waste your money on a  pretty set up  based on the kitchen common area  You should definitely have the issue with the leak bedroom carpet smell checked out before allowing other guests to spend money for possible hazardous conditions   That carpet simply needs to come up  Period  The smell was worse every night   another night spent and it would have been quite unbearable  And also hire someone who is going to thoroughly clean ALLLLL areas of your apartment   not just the kitchen common area   Whoever cleans  simply does the bare minimum  And thats unfortunate and unacceptable   Ive stayed in much better AirBnB residences over the course of time   and this has been the absolute worst stay  This listing looked really nice  However  the resting areas were definitely not up to par as it should have been for the price of the stay  Would have done better staying at a hotel 
630473008,The host sent us the wrong access code and so we were unable to check in  When we had trouble accessing the property  there was no response from the host  We ended up having to contact AirBnB to handle the issue  We were unable to stay in the apartment  and had to find a hotel that could accommodate us at the last minute  We were really disappointed with our experience  Absolutely unacceptable  We were sent the wrong check in information  and we were unable to contact the host for assistance  Host did not contact me until I first messaged them on the morning of our arrival 
658586253,Good price  Wi Fi would not work for us  The TV speakers didnt work at all  Easy access to downtown  Door code didnt work  but got resolved after talking on the phone for a minute  Working TV and working Wi Fi
715925593,There was hair EVERYWHERE  on the rug  in the blankets   in the bathroom  everywhere  The ground was very sticky as well    The Netflix account will probably be down since users in zencitys other apartments are using it  Theres Hulu which we liked    Could not find the thermostat the whole time   They were not responsive when our new access code did not work when we got a new one since we extended our stay   I did like how there were serve ware  the showers water pressure was solid  the wiki worked well  the overall place was spacious  there were plenty of towels  and the kitchen was big  The bed was comfy as well   TIP  I do not recommend parking outside      Like street parking  my friend got her catalytic converter stolen  and she was parked right in front of the apartment  Its a safe area but not at night 
702335887,When we arrived  the front door of the apartment building was open  but no one was nearby  A bit sketchy  and this happened several times more throughout our stay  On first arrival  there were dirty dishes in the dishwasher  with no soap anywhere  we had to request more   The bedroom carpets and linens were a bit dirty  and so were the wood floor in the living room and kitchen   About half way through our stay  the smart lock on the door stopped working   After spending a few HOURS on chat with the hosts  trying several different resolutions  they hired a handyman to come the next afternoon  For that period of time  I could not leave the Airbnb because the door would not lock behind me  and if it did  Id have no way of getting back in   There is no physical key   Its really not worth the high fee  and Id recommend searching elsewhere  Front door of apartment building  not unit  was open when we arrived and no one was nearby  Slow responses to their smart lock breaking 
657031597,This experience was incredibly disappointing and considering my last stay I do not know if Ill be staying with Zencity again  I stayed with this host  same building but different unit  couple weeks back  I love the location  its near plenty of shops  and I love waking up being across the street from tennis courts  The host had the audacity to display signage boasting about the cleanliness of the room when it was nothing but  The restroom was full of urine and hair everywhere  The issue was so bad I sent the host   messages within an hour of my arrival with pictures   There was an offer after receiving several automated messages in response to my email to have someone clean the problem areas and sweep the floors   No one ever showed  The issue was so bad I used boiling water and the apartment cleaning products to disinfect the restroom  The young lady at concierge  who checked me in on my last visit  even reported the issue to a Zencity cleaner the following morning    This room did not meet the standards of cleanliness in the midst of Covid     theres no way  and you all should be ashamed  If I could have cancelled this booking and received a full refund I would have  Extremely disappointed  This experience was incredibly disappointing and considering my last stay I do not know if Ill be staying with Zencity again  The audacity to display signage boasting about the cleanliness of the room when it was nothing but    This room did not meet the standards of cleanliness in the midst of Covid    and you all should be ashamed  If I couldve cancelled this booking and received a full refund I would have  Extremely disappointed  I immediately reached out to the host about the hair everywhere  the lack of cleanliness  a piece of broken furniture  and a small hole in the wall  Initially all I received was automated emails about check in  When I finally got a proper response offering to have someone come clean I was in a tennis tournament  I responded with a proposed time for tomorrow and no one showed  Its a global pandemic at the least I expect the space to be clean
654834111,The locks to the building and the apartment took forever to open due to outdated door locks  The WiFi didnt work  It wasnt Covid    ready  No hand sanitizer  face masks  or anything of that sort  The host didnt respond to any of my calls during my stay  It was a terrible experience  Ive tried to reach out to the host several times  however  no one answered nor returned my missed phone calls  The wifi did not work at all  It was a struggle to get inside the building and inside the actual apartment because the locks are extremely old and require a lot of wiggling the keys  The location was nice  It would have been nice to utilize the Wifi  It would have better if it was cleaner  There wasnt any hand sanitizer  face mask or anything to help keep us save during the Covid    
714589123,They cancelled on me hours before I was supposed to check in and I had to stay in a filthy unit in a sketchy part of town with a dishonest owner   Zen City told me I couldnt have the unit because of  maintenance  issues  When I asked what maintenance issue takes five days  they had no reply  So  they left me stranded on the streets of St  Louis  Deplorable  You never answered what maintenance issue takes five days to repair  Not that I would believe any answer you give me  having experienced your lack of regard for customers who have made and paid for reservations days in advance  I suspect you just got more money from another client and didnt care if I was raped  robbed  or killed on the St  Louis streets Deplorable 
711149100,I would recommend to get every detail you can before renting from this company  Parking is horrible and Zencity arent good at communicating 
707893249,Had problems checking in  took over an hour before we were settled into a unit that was    min away from our original booking  I had to reach out to the company the next day to figure out checking in to our original booking  Upon checking in  there was a light bulb out in the bathroom and there wasnt a lot of cups and dishware for even two people  Disappointed since I saw so many good reviews for this company  Very disappointed with how our first night staying with you went  I understand having issues  but it was very frustrating being shuffled around and it seemed like your company didnt know what was going on  i e not knowing where your keys were   and garage arm at one property was not working and light bulb was out in our unit  Just didnt meet my expectations  Intercom system was broken at our original booking  then keys were missing from  nd unit they tried to put us at  and then garage arm didnt open at  rd unit we ended up staying at  And the only communication used was messaging through Airbnb instead of calling  We got shuffled between   different properties before we could settle in for the night  Slow responses  and customer support wasnt able to get in touch with people who supposedly had our keys 
652893918,I am from St  Louis and wanted to show my boyfriend around the area   This is a great location right across from Forest Park and the front desk attendants were very nice and accomodating   Unfortunately  the apartment was not clean examples being an old bar of soap with hair on it in the bathroom  spoiled milk in the refrigerator  no trash bags in the apartment  or the trashcan   Parking is difficult   Wifi was terrible basically didnt work  forced us to leave early so we could complete our telework   This is run by an agency so there is no incentive to make it better   I prefer real owners as they have pride in their property    There is a no visitor policy which we didnt know about until we arrived so my parents couldnt come to see us for dinner    I love STL and there are so many great houses and homes to rent from   This wasnt one of them  This is clearly run by an agency and not an owner   There was no help with the wifi which wouldnt even allow us to do our work remotely   We ended up having to pay for a wework as we couldnt take meetings  clean the apartment  there is a pandemic going on  and invest in better wifi 
630251543,This place has serious cleanliness issues  The host did not offer appropriate solutions  There was hair from several people all over the floor and the surfaces were noticeable dirty  Little to no effort to clean and disinfect  I noticed the morning after a late check in and was horrified  There was even something that looked like a bloody smear on one wall  It is abundantly clear that they are letting the place go between several guests with minimal attention  Hopefully they will fix these issues going forward  However  I would advise anyone traveling during the pandemic to avoid this place AT ALL COSTS   it is not safe and the hosts seem ambivalent about it  They hadnt even bothered to empty the bathroom trash between guests  and it was nearly overflowing   The amenities were poor at best  Cheap bed and pillows  no soap in one of the dispensers  stained and grimy furniture  I ended up getting a refund and booking a hotel for the same price 
671224681,I would not recommend spending this kind of money on this building  It is unclean  and more of a hassle than a  vacation   I would really like my money back  This is not a clean  safe environment  I contacted the host about the poop stain on the sheets Saturday afternoon and received a response Sunday at   am  We were leaving on Sunday so that really didnt help  It was just a hassle  The buildings elevator was  reserved  for the day and we had no way of knowing there was an additional one in another part of the building  To get to it we had to leave the building and walk a block to get to the other side  I at one time had to walk up the   flights of stairs 
630558777,Booked this Airbnb last minute because I was coming home to KC for some family stuff  Tried getting into the unit around  am after getting into town and the code for the door I was given was wrong  Tried calling leaving messages   but no one answered until the next day  If I would of been in a city I didnt know I would of had to sleep in the hallway  but luckily I knew people in town for a place to crash  Next day I got a new code  got into the Airbnb and was changing when a maintenance guy walks into the unit  He said he didnt think anyone was in the unit  but was told there was supposed to be a photo shoot later and that I should call to make sure I have the correct unit  When calling zencity they wanted to still do the shoot at a time I wouldnt be in the apartment  but verified that I had the correct unit and that I could stay in it  I was supposed to have a late check out the next day to compensate for all the miscommunication and that was not communicated with the cleaning lady and she also walked into the unit while I was still I was there and verified that she was never told about the late check out    Zencity refused to give me a refund for the night that I couldnt get into the unit even though they gave me the wrong code to get in  Because of that and the fact that there was clearly no communication with staff to update them on the status of the room  and I had my privacy and honestly safety compromised multiple times I will not be booking this unit or any other listing that uses zencity going forward 
631715128,This place was in a perfect location and was exactly what I was looking for to have a stay cation  However  I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the entire house  especially the bathrooms and kitchen  During Covid there should be even more importance from the host on how the home is cleaned  The house also had no paper towels or anything for me to clean up with  We did really love the outdoor patio area  but the lights did not work to enjoy during the night time 
637485809,Place was not clean it all floor very sticky had ants all over and to top it off it was hot as hell with the weather being in the   s my whole stay the air was only set to go to    which was not sufficient enough it was hot there were no brooms or mop in sight have to buy one and also have to purchase a fan
630425922,Do NOT pick this co  to host your stay  We will never stay here with this Company ever again  Even though the housing was well kept  the look of this place was tarnished due to the lack of knowledge of the property and the INSANE hidden fees  The cleaning fee was waaaaay higher than the room cost  Which literally doubled our payment per night  On top of this the instructions were so inaccurate it took us    min just to be able to enter the apartment  On top of this the parking they suggested was costly as well  which is common with  downtown  locations  but there were ZERO less convenient though less expensive alternatives suggested by the host to aid with options  This was not worth our time or our money  By far our worst experience with Air BnB  Knowledge on the property was severely lacking which made for a nightmare of a time trying to even access the apartment  The directions were not very accurate  The keys werent labeled like you said  it was PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the keys in the room after check out  and the parking situation should have been extremely clear and more knowledgeable on the situation  This was unlike any Ari BnB we have ever stayed in  The place did not make up for the lack of customer service or description of how to get into the apartment  Would send almost automated responses that didnt answer my question till after the auto responses went out
634325531,I would not stay here again  When I entered the apartment  it was apparent that the management of the property does not align with the curated finishes and furnishings of the space  There was long black hair laying on the kitchen counter  When I took a shower the bath towels and wash clothes were covered in pubes  The unit is undoubtedly trendy but was not clean  One roll of toilet paper was left for a week long stay  After reaching out  it took two days before I received a response and have more dropped off  I had to go out and buy toilet paper which was not ideal as this was meant to be a safe retreat during covid while visiting a family member reviewing chemo treatment nearby  After a few nights of my stay  I asked to receive a partial refund so that I could check into a hotel  Various members of property management will respond to you  sometimes the next day and sometimes several days later  While waiting on a response  my week stay ended and I was informed I was no longer eligible for a refund  Other things I wouldnt mention if the rest of the experience had been better   the key fob to the entrance is broken and there is no way to get ahold of management in a timely manner so you have to wait for someone to exit and let you in  the unit is in the basement and the only windows are part of the property dog park  the entire basement unit smelled of musty mold  the elevator was very sticky  the outdoor rooftop was not open  the hand soap is watered down  and when it was raining the living room started flooding 
650181735,I do not recommend this place  It is completely over priced  The pictures are very misleading  The structure of the place is nice and it does have a lot of space and a nice balcony  The place was disgusting tho  I saw a bug  the couch was so nasty and badly stained that I had to put a covering over it just to feel comfortable sitting on it   The toilet seats were so badly stained  completely unacceptable  I was there for business  couldnt find the iron   messages the host multiple times about it   very slow responses and no attempt to fix the issue  I couldnt even control the air system on my own and once again  very slow or no response from the host  Multiple things were broken  it was just an overall disgusting experience and if youre looking for a nice place to stay  This isnt it  This place was just genuinely not what I expected  The pictures were absolutely misleading   the place was disgusting  The couch was so dirty and stained that I refused to sit on it without something covering it  There was bugs  the stove was disgusting  the refrigerator was disgusting  Needs new appliances if youre going to charge this much for it  Maybe I just like luxury and for the price I paid  This just wasnt it  By far my worst AirBnB experience ever  Even with communication  terrible Overall 
636913071,Checked in on July   and walked into an awesome view of all the fireworks in the surrounding neighborhoods  But things went downhill from there   The AC in the bedroom was out before I got there  Instead of informing me about the situation beforehand they allowed me to have one of my worst experiences ever in an Airbnb  Bc the The broken AC started to leak from the pipes underneath the floor  Zencity did try to get the situation fix but the repairs were too major so I checked out early  Im not a complainer but I was a bit confused on why the only supplied only   towels and   washcloth for my   week stay   I did get more after requesting   The kitchen was well prepped with silverware  pots and pans  and a few spices  Parking isnt too bad  You can usually find parking relatively close  This place does have potential to be really good once the repairs are made  It was bad luck for me 
633360426,Overall  the stay is OK  It is in a great location in the city  No issues checking in or coming as far going as we pleased  HOWEVER  the listing is extremely deceiving  The images shown are not at all accurate to the unit we stayed in  The place gave of more of a  hotel room  vibe than it did an apartment  If what was booked matched what was received  the experience would have been better  The picture in the listing were NOT at all accurate  The unit re stayed in was not the one we thought we booked  The bedroom was also lacking in cleanliness  At one point we got down to pick up something that rolled under the bed and there were visible staining on the carpet from what looked like a pet  The  view of the city  was not much of a view  Overall our stay was fine  the place was suitable for our weekend  However it was EXTREMELY disappointing to stay somewhere completely different than what we were expecting  The place overall was not horrible  however the posting was deceiving  The pictures show on the listing were not at all accurate  Im not even sure the unit we got is the same one we booked 
641116912,Furniture nearly broken  flimsy  No reply from host when contacted  Pest control came and sprayed for roaches while I was there  Noisy neighbors 
640248782,This was not what I expected in a bad way   Pros  The rate was cheap  The area was very pretty  There is parking in a gated parking lot   Cons    MICE   I should have been suspicious seeing the   mousetraps by the washer dryer  but I thought it was more precautionary  However at night I heard clear sounds around the apartment  Then one night around   pm I saw   mice running around the kitchen and livingroom  I tried to get a hold of the host to find a immediate solution or accommodation but they never got back to me   Not Clean  Although the listing says that they do enhanced cleaning measures to help combat COVID  I dont believe it  The walls are painted with a chalkboard like paint that shows every scratch and scuff mark  When I walked in there were clearly visible liquid splash marks on the wall  The handles of the refrigerator were very sticky for some reason  The remote had ketchup on the side from the last guest  I dropped my phone in the seat cushions and when I lifted the cushion I saw so much crumbs and dirt and even a dirty earbud   Fixtures  The restroom sink faucet is placed so incorrectly that when you go to wash your hands you end up splashing the entire counter  The air conditioner is preset with a schedule that only the host has control of  The lowest it can go is     If you set it to a certain temp at night  youll wake up to it at about     which is the locked setting   Overall  I could have put up with everything else if it werent for the fact that this place had a clear mouse problem and didnt inform me before hand  The directions to the apartment door should include that you enter the door at the end of the first hall  The door looks like you need a fob to enter it and it took me a while to figure out how to get to the apartment Host was difficult to get a hold of for urgent situations  Higher cleaning standards and being transparent about a clear mouse problem 
704278898,Ive previously stayed with Zencity through Airbnb   had such a positive   accommodating experience that I had high expectations for this stay with them as well  Check in was very easy   the location is great  Unfortunately  that was the best part of this eleven day stay  The apartment itself has so much potential that it could be a fantastic stay but the cleanliness of the place was terrible especially during a pandemic  when the cleaning should be very thorough between guests  The smell of the building  apartment was terrible so much so that I had to buy several wall plug ins as well as candles  The washer wreaked of mildew and the dryer makes the most obnoxious sound when its on  I reached out to Zencity about maintenance and was told they would let maintenance know and hopefully the issue would be resolved soon   and then nothing came of it  There were pubic hairs from previous stays in the shower and the tub doesnt drain so when youre showering the water is around your ankles  Hair that was not mine was found on the bedding  in the refrigerator and an entire clump of hair was sitting on a shelf   All of the silverware was dirty  There was a pile of dirt that had been swept up and just left on the floor  from the cleaner Im assuming    There was already trash in the trashcan upon my arrival  These things truly made my stay terrible  Again  not bashing Zencity as a whole because I have stayed with them before and had a great experience but this place in particular needs WORK 
718658529,Booked then was sent check in information that didnt work   We could get into lobby but the code given to get key didnt work  Was supposed to check in  pm day before and never got in ended up sleeping in our car while trying to find another Airbnb for the next day   Worst experience ever from my home town  
653935151,We arrived to the space and it was not cleaned  It was very grouse and there was dust flying out of the vents  something ive never seen before  i had to chnage a filter that looked like it hasnt been changed in over a year  There was a   inch build up dust  hair and dirt on the old filter  Not only was it dirty but there was a bad stench of a Cat and kitten litter in one bedroom that made the whole house smell  When i messaged Zen city all they did was tell me this was not an issue and that they would only send over a cleaning lady after we cleaned twice  They told me that was my only option and basically oh well  After speaking with Airbnb  they understood and saw the grouse photos i posted and got me and my girlfriend out of there   Lastly the washer and dryer are all the way outside  down a creepy hallway  in the basement of building  Not in the building    Apartment is nice  in a great location  I just wished we didnt have this experience 
636236068,Firstly  am very mad that I cant give a no star on this review  This is just a terrible experience for me and I would advice anyone thinking of booking this place to back off immediately except you dont mind dwelling in filth     this host handed me keys to an unsanitary environment  There was dust and dirt everywhere  food residue on the carpet and floor  the kitchen utensils were half clean and I found blood stains on the bathroom walls  To make matters worse this host offered me no solution and kept lying that the place was just cleaned  I literally had to partially clean this place myself just to get through the night because Airbnb werent answering my calls for solution  I have pictures of the whole experience and I await my FULL refund from Airbnb     
700257562,This is my first and only critical review on Air BnB and Ive used Air BnB a lot  over several years now  Even on the rare occasion that a BnB let us down  Ive always found hosts to be honest and responsive   When we checked into this place  it was not yet cleaned after the previous guests  Like bedding in the living room  food and dirty dishes out in kitchen and dining table  That too during a pandemic where other BnBs have taken immense efforts towards the safety of their guests  I tried calling them  then sent images of the place via the messaging app   no response until I explained to the door person at the apartment that I was going to cancel    They explained to the door person that the cleaner had   other apartments to clean and this would take an hour  Only after I walked out did they message me  And when I asked them to cancel and fully refund my booking  they just sent me their cancellation policy  When we tried to mediate through Air BnB they falsely stated to them  that the problem was that we checked in too early  When in fact  we left well after check in time and no cleaner had arrived    Air BnB did a great job mediating but Zen City was terrible  Pretty apartment and would have been such a good experience if they were atleast moderately responsive or responsible 
661662584,Becareful with everything in the room  may be you needed to take pictures of everything in the room the first day that you get there  to prove that you did not do anything wrong to everything in that room I dont know what to say just feel disappoint  cleanliness and sincere
656399832,Do not stay here   Horrible customer service and mediocre accommodations   Look for another unit  Im shocked that I was told by one of your agents that I would be compensated for the three hours I was locked out of your unit and never heard anything back  I was locked out of the unit for   hours due to the electronic locking system malfunction   It took Ive an hour for the cleaning person to show up and try the exact same thing I was trying to do to open the unit  This didnt work  as I stated to the agent several times   It then took an additional two hours for someone to show up with the master key to get in   I was told that I would be compensated for my time and Never heard back from anyone   What a joke 
660307410,Nice location
705464238,Lock your car doors  Sheets were soiled as well  The bedding was very clear soiled 
669623964,I want to be able to recommend this  because had it been clean it would have been great  Hoping its a fluke  But the place was gross  Food stuck to the stove backsplash  sticky alcohol rings on the desks  hair on the carpets and in the sinks   I didnt stay here  I have to travel for work or I wouldnt  WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC  corners cannot be cut on cleaning   Plus  yes they refunded their part but  I still lost     in service fees and    to park in their garage for the    minutes I was there  Not a great experience  I know its not one specific persons fault  but in a normal world I expect to not have hair clumps on the rugs  rings of sticky alcohol on the desks  etc  In a NORMAL world  We are in a worldwide pandemic  Protocol needs to be better The instructions do TRY to be clear But they need updated because the key pad is broken  you have to call a    go to a whole New garage  Its just a bit of a hassle  And then there are elevators right inside the door that ARE NOT the elevators you have to use so thats confusing  Then the elevators have a scan pad outside AND inside  i had to have someone help Me  They made an effort but It wasnt immediate 
665432543,Mattress and couch cushions smelled very bad  Carpet had black mold 
663296164,Okay  WiFi didnt work  and I had online school  It was very frustrating  We didnt have WiFi during our entire stay and it was never addressed 
663313973,Beautiful place but it has large rats  I would bet stay there if I was you  The place it self was beautiful however  it has a rodent problem  I saw a few large rats and they were running up and down the hallway late at night  Also  they were eating my bread and fruits  I would never stay there nor would I recommend it to anyone else  Had issues with getting into to the building and the unit upon check but even though in was after hours the host did respond quickly  However  later I had additional issues with with digital key  Still the host was very responsive  Thanks for that  Nice place beside the rodent problem 
663015374,This experience was very unfortunate  Working in hospitality myself  from start to finish I did not feel like my comfort as a customer was placed at the forefront  I waited in the pouring rain for a delayed response of the check in details  The next morning there was shattering glass at  am right below our window due to the construction  Theres heavy road work AND construction happening right below the apartment that starts promptly at sunrise  The bathroom reeks of mold which is probably due to how old the building is  When I went to turn on the water  the entire handle fell off  The pipes were hissing and due to the handle literally falling off  it made it an incredibly difficult to just take a shower  Worse of all was Zencitys delayed and seemingly unconcerned response  basically saying I should have manage working with a broken shower on my own  For the price that their charging per night  it seems well within reason to expect a working shower and to be at least treated with a grain of care  Truly a disappointing experience  This experience was very unfortunate  Working in hospitality myself  from start to finish I did not feel like my comfort as a customer was placed at the forefront  I waited in the pouring rain after reaching out once I booked for check in details since it was passed  pm  The response came in about       mins later which generally might not be in issue but as a traveler in the middle of a pandemic  it left me waiting  drenched in the rain  The next morning there was shattering glass at  am right below our window due to the construction  Obviously not within your control but I do feel you should have a disclaimer to your guests that theres heavy road work AND construction happening right below the apartment  The bathroom reeks of mold which is probably due to how old the building is  When I went to turn on the water   the entire handle fell off  I did try to latch it back on to at least take a shower but the knob was too difficult for me to turn on my own  the pressure and temperature would fluctuate because I couldnt get a good handle on it and the pipes were hissing the entire time  Regardless of anything  you charge your guests      to be their own plumbers  Worst of all  is the delayed and minimal response and effort to even being helpful or wanting to satisfy your customer  Instead you say that I shouldve managed  not having an easy accesible shower in the morning  I stand that as I guest  it is not unreasonable to expect a working shower and at the very least your response in the world of hospitality  should be that of wanting to accommodate  It begs the question  why name yourself se city if this is an experience your comfortable giving to your guests 
669933110,I wish I could say I enjoyed my stay   Lets start with the good  The location is awesome   Just a short uber or even walk from downtown  and there are bike rentals   mins away so I rented a bike and biked to the museums and around Chicago  There is also a great Thai place STEPS from the building   Bed   The bed was quite comfy  like other reviewers say   Price   Obviously this is a cheaper listing in the area  so thats nice   Now for the bad      First off  walking in to this airbnb is like walking into a pre owned vehicle owned by a smoker    Maybe no one had recently smoked in there  but the whole place had a horrible smokey odor  Ironically there were TWO no smoking signs in the space      Second  there were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been cleaned for some time  Huge buildup of dust and dirt etc in the corners of the room  baseboards and cracks in the stove had food in them  These things made me question how well cleaned the rest of the space was   Third  the tub   shower had very little water pressure and took a long time to get hot  and every time you shower the drain backs up after about   mins of running the water  so you have to stand with your feet in disgusting shower drain back flow while you try to clean yourself    Finally  the bedroom also had top sheet   Only a duvet  Since most of the time a duvet doesnt get washed every guest  this was an additional gross factor    Last  you should know that street cleaners and construction vehicles of various kinds might wake you up in the morning  This might be seasonal  but while I was there at about  am every morning there was some kind of beeping construction or city vehicle that slowly drove by the building  Because the AC unit is in the window  it lets all the sound in    Oh and one more thing   Host says there is street parking in the listing  I attempted to park on the street and wound up with a     ticket  Clearly I missed a sign somewhere and so this is not the hosts fault  but I wouldnt stay here if you intend on having a car  I couldnt enjoy my stay because the whole place smelt like cigarettes and felt dirty  The price was good  but it needed to be clean and smell decent 
716085187,I would not recommend this air bnb owner gave   men our codes to get into our air bnb to fix the heat but never notified us and we didnt have heat for   days on our extended day which was the   th day of our stay they decided to fix it we were freezing holes in the sheets  Rug linty boiler room was leaking  Forks and spoons were very dirty not like we were going to use them anyways but still HORRIBLE The key was hard to unlock we had to knock on neighbors door several times and also contacted the host multiple times during our stay  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
718371497,Overall the place was fine   Had minor issues with the ceiling leaking water through the ceiling fan It was very difficult to get someone on the phone when I was having difficulties The first two days water was leaking from the ceiling through the ceiling fan which soaked my bed and had me scared to turn on the lights
719199145,smh
719199265,There were hairs in the bed and shower  the ceiling fan in the bedroom didnt work  the lighting in the bathroom is horrible  the dishwasher had an awful smell and could smelt while sitting on the couch  there were fake finger nails broken on the side of the bed on the floor and crumbs in the bed  The lock on door was broken and we had to stick it back onto the door to make it work properly  It took us    minutes to figure out that was the problem  The location is great though  The cleanliness of the apartment was not good at all  Free coffee would be nice to set out for guests  The room was unmarked  No room number was posted outside the door  Average communication
673955924,The    Penn units are luxurious and with a great location towards the Plaza   walking distance   It has a lot of amenities but I was only able to use the gym due to COVID    even though  all the amenities are open   They assign you a private parking so you dont have to leave your car outside   I found the apartments are in a safe zone and the building has personnel checking out people that comes in  At my arrival to the apartment  I noticed the COVID    cleaning protocol wasnt employed   Under the couch there was a takeout sushi lid  the bathroom had hair residues in the cabinet and towel closet   I had to take care of the cleaning myself  The apartments are great  the problem is the Zencity Co  as the hosting entity  I had an accident at my unit and first it was a challenge to communicate with Zencity and when they did communicate  they tried to relocate me to a place that I previously told them was unsafe    Meanwhile they where handling the damages caused to the unit by the accident  I had to move for   weeks and pay for hotel stays while they were trying to get an available unit for me    They never got the safe unit I asked and stalled the process of finding one   Because my stay was time sensitive  I had to book another Airbnb  All because I wasnt provided an alternate option or accommodation in a safe location by Zencity   Thus  I ended up having to pay for   Airbnbs and a hotel room at once because they didnt provide a timeline on the repairs or even communicating what was being done   At one point  Airbnb had to become involved in the process   It has been one of the worst experiences Ive had with an Airbnb host  Zencity management is very difficult to reach    I had an accident at their apartment an I quickly notified them but they answered   days later when the emergency was already being dealt with   I consider that as an unprofessional behavior  If you a have little kids be sure to rent a   Bedroom apt from the same building which has a bathtub as well as shower   Having a bathtub with a shower in the property will increase the value of the apartment   Also for guests  it would be good to have a balcony with maybe   chairs and a little table to be able to admire the wonderful view you have towards the pool at night 
666812850,My girlfriend and I stayed here for her surprise birthday trip  The unit itself was everything  the description gave  One issue I noticed was that it was not throughly cleaned  but overlooked it  With it being a basement ground level pedestrians walking pass the unit can look directly inside when the blinds are opened  The mattress also felt old and sunken in  in the middle  The major issue came the last night at approx            pm when we returned from dinner  My girlfriend being pregnant had to use the restroom as soon as we entered  While using the restroom she seen a mouse run across the laundry room floor and into the bedroom  I didnt believe her until it ran from the bedroom into a closet  We immediately went outside  attempted to call the host several times  and leave voicemails  No response    I then emailed them  which they replied pretty quick  I advised them of the situation and that we need to stay somewhere else for the final night  They were able to get us into another unit   floors up  Before that we had to take all belongings into and down the hallway  checking to make sure other mice didnt get inside our things  We finally got upstairs and I did another walk through  I noticed this unit wasnt throughly cleaned either  The light switch for the kitchen and tv outlet were wired together  So the kitchen light had to be on to watch tv  The washing machine was also broken  with a full drum of  stale water inside  I contacted the host the next day about being compensated something for having to move out so late with a pregnant girlfriend for the rodent issue  then to get upstairs to a unit with broke appliances and partially cleaned and still havent heard anything back  The cleaning woman actually came in the checkout morning promptly at    am to clean both units  I told her the situation and she seemed nonchalant as of this happened before  Zencity did inbox and advise they would fix the issue with the washing machine  But that was it  When it came to  the rodent issue it was thanks for letting us know   Im not sure if pest control came out or not I feel like the unit was cleaned for the next upcoming guest and that was it  The location was great  close to downtown  I definitely would not be staying here again though and would not be gking through Zencity  Good luck If a customer call  call them back and dont refer to inboxing especially during emergency situations  Attempted to call  but no one called back
620785771,DO NOT STAY HERE  AND READ THIS REVIEW  I dont really know where to start with this review  I have never had a bad experience with any stay on AIR B B till now      First this place is filthy  I am talking dirty floors  dirty counters  Considering we are in an actual HEALTH PANDEMIC at the moment this is unacceptable  The  cleaners  and I say cleaners very loosely considering they did not actually clean  Tidied up no trash yes  at first glance it looked clean  Until you touched the counters  felt the dirt under your feet  opened the fridge and get hit with an old rotten food smell  Or just look at anything for longer than a minute   Stains everywhere  loved the big questionable stain on the master bedrooms carpet   sticky  overall  just absolutely disgusting  Not to mention the dirty BANDAID left in the master bedroom  I wish I would have brought with me cleaning supplies  but I did not expect to clean at a location with a     cleaning fee   Onto the couch situation and the kitchen chair   As soon as I step into the place  I noticed the couch  It was a bit lopsided thought this odd    on closer inspection the couch was broken  The legs of the couch were not installed properly or installed by someone who has never put together basic furniture one even with a crack  I immediately reached out to the renters regarding both the cleanliness the couch   chair   Received no aid in the matter just a  we know    also they knew the kitchen chair is broken as well  I expressed my need for actually working furniture since this is a basic necessity and I mean BASIC  I even asked for tools to fix it myself  No reply  Go figure  I actually had to flip the couch myself and attempt to jimmy rig it with a knife  I actually did better then the person who put this together Ill tell you that much   I didnt try to fix their kitchen chair   Maybe I should of since they clearly dont care   Lastly  we have the patio   You see that nice patio offered in the listing hell its even in the name    well guess what you cant access it  The door does not open to that area  So  you can waive at it from the couch   If you want to do some handywork first   Honorable mention  The lack of a clean sponge or dish soap in the kitchen  I did find a dirty sponge that had actual dirt on it and dishwasher gel  guess this is better than nothing  loved the empty hand soap dispenser it really added to the ambiance of the stay  I also have pictures of all of this   Followed by pictures of how I left the stay just as my own insurance  You can never be to safe 
718884193,This is not the first time this has happened  When I arrived the key pad wouldnt let me in  I attempted to contact and was unable to reach anyone or have anyone return my calls  I ended up having to get a hotel 
435135529,The place was extremely far away from Downtown  The whole place smelled moldy  the fan didnt work and the light switches were very hard to find  The place was extremely far away from Downtown  The whole place smelled moldy  the fan didnt work and the light switches were very hard to find 
702119492,Very serious maintenance issues  Toilet  bathroom and kitchen sink did not drain  sewage pipe water bubbles up from the kitchen sink  giving the unit a foul raw sewage smell  Toilet did not drain  so we were not able to go to the bathroom in the unit  a basic expectation for a habitable unit  We were told a plumber would arrive  but never did  Hosts demonstrated extreme negligence for a serious maintenance issue  Again  we arrived to the unit to these conditions  Communication was timely  but largely unresponsive to inquiries or requests  I provided an opportunity to rectify the situation prior to writing this review  but you failed to take steps on repeated occasions  Responded  but did not answer inquiries and did not address problems 
554124458,Do not stay here See emails and messages Quality furniture and cleanliness
526229221,Cute place  in a good area The house was a bit disheveled when I arrived and couldnt watch tv  WiFi was bad  also unclear instructions for leaving
421475388,couldnt open the apartment door with the key given to us I had to pay for a hotel called several times with no response at all terrible experience overall couldnt open the apartment door with the key given to us I had to pay for a hotel called several times with no response at all terrible experience overall
516629577,Dont even know where to start  Pubic hair on the  clean  towels and in the shower  Fire alarm beeping first night  all night  A C  Nest  kept adjusting and changing on its own  not sure if someone else was messing with it remotely but it is weird that the A C was adjusting by itself  Other than that  the apt was very nice and nice location  Beautiful views from the window 
704234978,First Id like to say considering staying in Hyde park I assumed that regents was going to be ok to stay in during my visit  The experience I have over the weekend was horrible  First off  the walls were dirty  the couch  and the kitchen sink was linking from the bottom  The bathroom had surfaced mold around tub and ceiling  the bathroom sink had a disgusting build up around faucet  This location needs a serious upgrade  The most worst experience I ever had
512864403,Heres the deal   This was my first experience with Air BnB   Suffice to say that disappointment is an understatement   I could handle the fact that there was no parking as I was visiting my brother  in critical care  at Barnes and we parked the car there   But as soon as I went to take a shower and saw the handle was broken off and that we had to rig it to work  I called and left a message   I assumed  incorrectly  that someone would be over to fix it for our next day   Sadly  that never happened   I have no idea why they Wifi password written on the chalkboard was incorrect   Fortunately  when I called  someone clarified  you need to add        Funny how it works when you have the right Wifi password   So imagine our surprise when day two left us with very sporadic Wifi   to the point of connecting and dropping within a minute     Finally  I couldnt understand why my Bible was getting wet on the coffee table   When I looked up  I could see the ceiling was leaking   Again  I called and had to leave a voicemail   Suffice to say  no one called me back to see what the issue was   Fortunately  the girl had the front desk called her maintenance guys so hope it was attended to before the next guest experience the same   All in all  I cant give you a five star rating   Considering the price we paid compared a hotel and the unfortunate set of events that plagued our stay  it is simply not possible   At least with a hotel  we would have been refunded some of the money due the extremely poor experience  Heres the deal   This was my first experience with Air BnB   Suffice to say that disappointment is an understatement   I could handle the fact that there was no parking as I was visiting my brother  in critical care  at Barnes and we parked the car there   But as soon as I went to take a shower and saw the handle was broken off and that we had to rig it to work  I called and left a message   I assumed  incorrectly  that someone would be over to fix it for our next day   Sadly  that never happened   I have no idea why they Wifi password written on the chalkboard was incorrect   Fortunately  when I called  someone clarified  you need to add        Funny how it works when you have the right Wifi password   So imagine our surprise when day two left us with very sporadic Wifi   to the point of connecting and dropping within a minute     Finally  I couldnt understand why my Bible was getting wet on the coffee table   When I looked up  I could see the ceiling was leaking   Again  I called and had to leave a voicemail   Suffice to say  no one called me back to see what the issue was   Fortunately  the girl had the front desk called her maintenance guys so hope it was attended to   All in all  I cant give you a five star rating   Considering the price we paid compared a hotel and the unfortunate set of events that plagued our stay  it is simply not possible   At least with a hotel  we would have been refunded some of the money due the extremely poor experience  Shower handle was broke   no one fixed it  no one responded to the issue   Living room ceiling was leaking   Called and left a message   no response at all   You would think this would have registered as  we need to fix this   Location was described accurately  However  no parking available was a dissapointment  Had the shower worked without our rigging the handle and the ceiling not been leaking  the value would have been worth it   More disappointing was the lack of host response 
508873974,My first weird experience on Airbnb  I made a mistake when booking since I needed a place where some friends could spend very briefly before going together to a friends wedding  I assumed that that would be not a problem since this place is published as  entire apartment   I understand that customer is supposed to be an adult and responsible person and they can act as if it were their home  this is not the case in this place so I think it is something that future visitors should consider  There is no such assumption of good faith here  I was even warned that I could be taken out at any time if I dared to take a visit  so if you are not used to these kinds of extremely conservative rules  it may not be your place for you  The worst part was when I proposed to change my reservation for two weeks later that I would return to Chicago  it seemed like a fair proposal since I would stay with them for the same price and I could look for another more convenient place  they simply ignored my proposal and after my insistence they told me that I could cancel  losing more than half of the money   The location was quite good  it is somewhat far from the center  loop  but it can be easily reached using bus and the Uber pool is less than    dollars  Also the apartment is quite comfortable and well decorated  the towels and sheets were quite clean  Only two small details  the air conditioning is in the main room and it is not good enough to cool the bedroom  and although I did not use the kitchen  on the last day I saw a small cockroach walking there  It was quite unfair that you ignored the fact that I made the reservation by mistake and when I proposed you to postpone the reservation you only told me to cancel losing more than half of the money More empathy with a customer that made a mistake with the reservation
412479951,Wouldnt stay with this company again  You can check my reviews  I have nothing but positive reviews  I know when things are clean and when theyre not  Given the fact that this unit as well as most of this companies units are low cost  I dont believe this means that the units get to be disgusting  ESPECIALLY  when Im paying almost the same amount Im paying for a nights stay in cleaning fees  I had to vacuum the unit as well as use the disinfectant spray on all the surfaces  I went to the target around the block and got air freshener and candles  ran the fan for hours just so it wouldnt have the musty smell it had when we got there  This was our second unit with zencity after staying in another unit in the same building and having to add another night  The bedroom doer was broken  The bathroom door doesnt close as well as being a very outdated and dirty bathroom  The fridge wasnt clean and had old milk from the previous guest in it  The linens and the towels had an excessive amount of random lint and hairs in it  The whole stay I was very uncomfortable and this is by far the worst experience Ive ever had with Airbnb Horrible horrible response time  I even had to call to get a response and she said she would call me back  never did  Refer to above  Horrible response times  And it wasnt just on the times you guys claim to not be as available as I saw in other reviews No matter the price the place should be clean  I dont believe you guys even clean the units out  especially me coming from one unit to the next  the first being directly above my second
706211828,Very disappointed   Easily the dirtiest Airbnb Ive had to stay in  If I were at a hotel I would have requested a new room  Unlucky for my boyfriend and I  we got there late and had a flight early the next morning so we had to sleep in that filth  There was hair everywhere in all shapes and sizes  The sheets  extra sheets  bed spread  floors  walls  along the toilet  and bathroom floors all had hair  There were stains on bed spread    To make matters even better the door didnt lock unless you pushed it from the outside  We felt very unsafe so we slept with a bar stool in front of the door  Only thing that would have done is heard if someone came in   We stayed in one of their other places a few days prior and it was one of the nicest Airbnbs I have stayed in so I hope they make this right  Disgusting place would love a refund or I will be sending pictures and videos of the place to Airbnb  I recommend getting a new cleaning person and finding someone to fix the door that is unable to lock from the inside  Very dirty Other peoples hair everywhere  stains on bed spread  and the door didnt lock unless you pushed it from the outside 
409711601,What started out as a decent stay  ended in a terrible stay  In the unit that I stayed in  the window broke  and would not latch and stay closed  Thus  in temperature that dropped to    degrees  I was expected to sleep in said room  When I complained during the   oclock hour  the questioning I received  inferred that I was at fault for breaking the window  Seeing that I dont smoke and it was freezing outside  I had no reason even to think about the window  yet alone opening the window  When I requested maintenance  I was told that they were gone for the day  and would have to bundle up and wait until the morning  Again  it was    degrees outside  When I complained more  I was told to turn the heat up  in the midst of    degree weather coming in  To make matters worse  the radiator worked when it wanted to  barely emitting any heat  After asking for a refund  they said theyd only be willing to offer a refund on half a night stay  When I said that was unacceptable  Zencity ceased communicating with me  Needless to say  I will never stay in this property again  because they dont consider the health and safety of their guests  After staying in your property in March of      and referring to classmates to your property this past week  I was extremely disappointed and offended by the way you handled the situation with the broken window last night  Unfortunately  I would no longer use your properties when I come to Chicago or refer people to your properties  To expect someone to sleep in a room  with a window open  allowing    degree air in is not only ridiculous but dangerous  Im appalled at your lack of customer service  When I called the host with an issue on two separate occasions  they never returned my call  after saying they would  When communicating through text  the responses were extremely slow  There is no value in sleeping in a room with a broken window in below freezing temperatures and an insensitive host 
406993403,The experience was okay for the price  I think that next there should be a price reduction for the lack of heat and the room downgrade  The quality had a big impact on the stay  so much that I preferred to sleep somewhere else on the  nd night   I did not stay at the location that I booked The room was a downgrade but the price was the same 
481884024,Misleading listing  Its a mistake to deal with a host like Zencity because its a property owner  not a home owner  and they take no pride or care  What they offer is not worth the price and the standards of the accommodation make you think you wouldve been better off in a motel  Your satisfaction is not their priority  out smarting you to keep your money is  Dont trust these people with your stay  Have no pride in what they do and do not care about customer satisfaction  they do a disservice to the reputation of Airbnb
478178134,Save your    not worth the hype   Doesnt even have central A C
470962956,Nope Zencity has always been responsive  But this stay was terrible especially given the amount we paid  I understand that you gouged us because of UC graduation weekend demand  Past experiences with Zencity have always been positive  Thus i assumed that for the money i paid I would get a nice place  Very disappointing  Two nights for over         Seasons would have been cheaper  Shame on me    Bad lighting  sofa sagging  back door was unlocked when we arrived 
468069079,This space is in the heart of Hyde Park  and the unit offers good views of the neighborhood and downtown  A deadbolt lock that we were not given a key for prevented us from accessing the unit  Lock code didnt work Took more than an hour to gain access after failed lock code 
468061139,Stained sheets  Clogged tub  After taking a shower  pools of water all over the bathroom  Missing items listed as amenities  soap  shampoo  salt   Not enough dishes to really use the kitchen without running the dishwasher constantly  No replacement trash bags  Sent a maintenance person without checking if that was ok with us  Would not recommend this location for this price   needs to be significantly cheaper given the experience 
705867750,My stay at this Zencity location was disappointing  My   stars are for the view from the bedroom and the convenient location  Read this review until the end because any travelers looking to stay at any of the Zencity locations should beware of the stunts they tried to pull    The Space This apartment looks a lot better in pictures than it does in person  Definitely in need of some updates and TLC  Paint on the bedroom walls is cracked and chipping  The hosts provide you with the bare minimum but honestly  there is nothing else special about this place    Checking in Checking in was quick and easy  Front desk staff was kind and friendly   Now  Ill speak on my experience  I knew Id be landing in Chicago over an hour before check in and when I asked the hosts if Id be able to actually check in early  I was denied which wasnt terrible but it may have saved me  a huge headache later  I finally arrived to the Airbnb at      on the dot to find that the apartment was dirty  as if someone checked out and no one came to clean after   Bed was not made  leftover food was in the refrigerator  living room rug and the kitchen were dirty  Im sure everyone has heard that COVID is still a thing  so walking into a dirty Airbnb during these times is the last thing youd ever expect  right  When I messaged the hosts WITH pictures  the response I got from Stuart was  Sorry about that  It seems there might have been some miscommunication over another tenant in the building using the space or not last night  Im checking now to see if we can get a cleaner there right away     Ok  so does that mean that someone else may have access to this apartment without your knowledge  Not a very settling feeling for a solo  female traveler    I did book this saying there were   guests for my own safety  and Im glad I did because who knows what else couldve happened    It was now too late and a cleaner was not around so I had the option to go to their other Airbnb which luckily was only a   minute walk around the corner for the night and then go back to the location that i actually paid for the next day   I was desperate and had no other options for a place to stay and agreed after going back and forth with the hosts and customer support about how much Id be refunded for my inconvenience  Zencity didnt want to refund me the cleaning fee for their dirty apartment but thankfully Airbnb customer support said yes along with only     for the first night   The new apartment was fine but upon reading reviews for it I found that a female solo traveler stated that a male cleaner came into the apartment while she was there  without warning and she was very uncomfortable  When I pointed this out to Zencity i was assured by Marty that the cleaners have already been notified that Id be checking out late so it wouldnt be a problem  Guess who knocked on the door at       a m  on the dot the next morning   the cleaners  More miscommunication Im guessing  They left once i explained the situation and an hour later i walked back to my original Airbnb and it was clean  Like the way it shouldve been when I first checked in  I was not very comfortable during my stay just knowing that someone else had access to the apartment  I was nervous whenever i left out thinking someone would come in and take or go through my things  I was nervous when i went to bed at night knowing that I was alone  but there were no other problems  Now heres the good part  Zencity had the AUDACITY to accuse me  a non smoker  of smoking marijuana in their apartment and had the nerve to request      from me because of it  This is the lowest  most desperate and manipulative thing Ive ever heard of an Airbnb host doing  Maybe theyre mad that they lost money because of their own mistakes and miscommunications  Thats not my problem  Like I said  the best part of this Airbnb experience was the view and location so travelers  beware 
717881033,Nice apartment for the price but the intercom failed to work multiple times which left us stuck outside for hours  Fix the intercom and should have a number to call Intercom failed to work multiple times and waited hours to get in the last day
350894465,No comment No wifi for   days till you put an extension  No water during a shower  because the building is too old and it can not support all the people using the shower  Police at midnight in the next door apartment as guests were fighting        had to leave the apartment at midnight and move to my sons apartment  The suggestion is  THIS APARTMENT  THIS BUILDING IS NOT PROPER TO BE OFFERED FOR SHORT RENT  I WILL NEVER EVER TRUST AIRBNB AGAIN  And I am sorry for that because we as family have rented via airbnb in snowmass colorado  rio de janeiro brazil  filadelfia  atlanta etc     I am very sorry  Best regards The location is fantastic because it is close to the restaurants and shops  The problem is the building too old  dirty and UNSAFE
350214976,first of all  this apartment is rented out by a service  so there is no host  i would be wary of renting from a management company like Zencity instead of a host  since they dont really care about you  we had major issues getting into the apartment building and locking the apartment whenever we left  because this was a management company  we reached customer service reps who werent able to help us   only try to call someone onsite  when we tried to follow the instructions to get into the building  the zencity customer service rep kept hanging up  luckily  someone leaving the building let us in  otherwise we would have been outside much longer  when we had issues with the lock and could not leave the apartment since we couldnt secure our belongings  they were unable to reach their  emergency services 
708483786, 
712867405,generic  they all are the sa h e  so if something seems a little off  it is likely a LOT is wrong  perhaps give a heads up if tradesmen are coming to fix things  dont forget about a problem when notified  the place was freezing with no heat 
432093794,Could not check in  Called the host multiple times  no response until   AM the following day stating they would look into it  At  pm  the day after check in  I received a text saying that they would not be refunding me and that they were able to open the lock box 
431265127,Poor management  Would not recommend  Learn to effectively communicate
722392118,I honestly just have no words lol
405176623,fumes were coming through the vents from the unit below  me and my bf could barely breath through the toxic varnish fumes  host refused to move us to another unit  terrible customer service  fumes were coming through the vents from the unit below  me and my bf could barely breath through the toxic varnish fumes  host refused to move us to another unit  terrible customer service 
721540559,The key fob did not work  I was told the security was supposed to fix the key fob but security told me that the company is supposed to take care of that  The door to get into the apartment was hard to unlock you have to unlock it then lock it back and keep turning it to you here click  Had to stand outside in the cold until the security guard came to let us in because the key fob wouldnt work every time we left  No parking  The view was great The apartment was clean Key fob did not work  Kept getting the runaround about who is supposed to fix it  Hard to unlock the front door to get into the apartment  Had to stand outside and wait for the guard to let us in
363368689,Overall it was a very good apartment but there was a very disgusting smell of rotting meat throughout the apartment  We had to spray our own body spray in order to just sit in the common area  Overall it was a very good apartment but there was a very disgusting smell of rotting meat throughout the apartment  We had to spray our own body spray in order to just sit in the common area 
362609274,This host will assume criminal activity if youre black  DONT DO IT I checked in early because i didnt have to meet the host  When i called to see if i can check in i got an approval and someone else was already there 
319217665,Toooooo hot  Walked in at     checked an hour later and it was now     Ac ran nonstop all night  loudly  but still never dropped below       Smoke detector hanging from the roof instead of being properly installed   Otherwise  location  the place itself  and the instructions to get in were all good  Nice location overall but the AC was terrible  It was just too hot  We were pretty much sweating all night    There was also a hanging smoke detector  instead of being mounted  Not sure if that was even functional or not  Definitely not up to code  Could be cheape
309113130,The apartment had ants in the bathroom and large bugs crawling on the walls in the bedroom  The A C went out multiple times during our stay  if you plug in too many things at once the power goes out  The apartment did have nice furniture arrangements   The A C went out the first day  and we notified the host  but it was not fixed until the next morning 
308020656,The pictures definitely look better than the reality of this place  The building is quite old and out dated  The shower head is old and ineffective  needs to be replaced    The worst thing about this place is the A C unit they have in the space  Its an old window air conditioner  it blows out cool air but doesnt cool the room at all  youll just be sitting there for hours waiting for the room to get cool and it wont happen    I couldnt sleep and had to check out the next day and pay extra for a hotel for the rest of my trip   I definitely recommend not staying here  theres definitely much better options closer to the city  and Zencity charges a     cleaning fee  but for what  You should invest in a proper A C unit and a better shower head  you shouldnt accept guests until you have resolved these issues  You cant run an airbnb like this and I feel cheated  
712475189,double check that apartment has been cleaned thoroughly before you book  this place smelled heavily of cigarettes and was dirty all around  had to leave and book a told me they would refund me and then went ghost great price   great building but not as depicted
303546516,Good but AC isnt effective  
290079008,Great location but more hotel than home away   Although you have a lovely looking apartment  It was very obvious that no one lives here as a number of essentials were not in place from the start to the end of my trip  Internet  Iron  TV remote  blocked bath tub   Took a while to verify key handover   Gaps in information  I had people coming into the apartment without being notified
332560086,It was really bad experience  I dont recommend this apartment or host at all   While Im sleeping someone tried to open the door by the code and the end she entered right and she told me that she wants the other floor but my concern that how other people can open and know the code of this apartment  Also  the host isnt responsible at all  I cant reach her  so at the midnight I left the apartment and she called me on the morning shell send someone to change the code thats what she offers after all bad experience happened  I really advise everyone to not book this apartment if you care about your safety and have family  They dont have any responsibility 
567136249,The location is fine  However  the impression of the pictures is misleading and cleanliness is an issue  The place is just worn down and needs a remake  All written above  Carpets are done and someone needs to clean the apartment and wet clean the floor until its not sticky anymore  The place was not wet cleaned for a very long time 
594473218,Nice location and apartment  We were disappointed in  our stay as we had issues checking in and with amenities in the apartment  Keys were mixed up and somebody had to come figure out which key we needed  Not helpful  generic responses that didnt resolve anything
524341490,The place is very cramped  The building had a nasty smell  The place looked very unsafe and the deadlock for the door was not working  There is lot of bleach and clorox smell in the room  I decided to vacate earlier than my stay due to these reasons and didnt receive refund  Dont stay here  The place is very cramped  The building had a nasty smell  The place looked very unsafe and the deadlock for the door was not working  There is lot of bleach and clorox smell in the room  I decided to vacate earlier than my stay due to these reasons and didnt receive refund  Dont stay here 
466879620,No electricity  hot water  or gas  We checked in around    pm  exhausted from a long day of traveling  The check in instructions were incorrect  so we were led to the wrong door to enter the building  When we finally heard back from the host  after waiting outside in the dark for almost a half hour  they told us that even though the instructions say  the door to the left of the lock box   and there is a door directly left to the lock box  you are supposed to go to the second door  which is further down the building and not at all referenced in the instructions  When we finally got in  there was no power in the entire unit  Again  it is    pm  we are very tired  and already irritated because we couldnt get in to the place  Again  I have to message and call the host and wait for someone to get back to me  They tell me they have to call the electric provider so we just need to wait  We waited almost an hour in the dark until the electricity was reset   After that  we are all so exhausted we get ready for bed  We try the hot water and its not working and we figure  maybe it just needs to heat up and we will try again in the morning  We were wrong  There was no hot water all weekend  We had to take ice cold showers  Again  the host told us it was a provider issue and we just needed to wait  There was also no gas   so we were unable to cook   I am not a high maintenance person  and I realize this was a relatively inexpensive spot for a Chicago stay  but electricity  gas  and hot water are basic living needs  They wouldnt put us in a new place and they would only refund us half of what we paid  after I went back and forth with Airbnb all day   Instructions for check in were wrong   It led us to the wrong door  and then we had to wait    minutes to hear back from the host who finally responded to tell us  Oh yeah  the instructions say the door to the left of the lock box but really its the second door further down   This was all at    pm when we were exhausted from traveling and just standing outside in the dark trying to get in  Because its a company  you have to wait to get through to people and give them all your information just to talk to someone  Electricity  hot water  and gas 
518989014,The two most important things about a place to stay are the bed and the shower  They are the things that you cant do anywhere else  Everything about this place except those two things was   stars  but they alone dropped it down to   stars   The bed was very soft and had an exceptionally warm comforter  Those may sound like good things  and for some people maybe they are  but the result for me was that every morning I woke up drenched in sweat and with severe back pain  Any amount of the comforter covering me would cause that part to sweat because it did not breath at all   I would recommend immediately purchasing a firmer mattress and a more breathable comforter  Ive stayed in many hotels and Airbnbs  and this is the worst sleeping experience I can remember   The shower barely drained  I complained the very first night of a week long stay  they said theyd  filed a maintenance request   and I never heard another word about it  Despite cleaning the incredible easy to clog drain grate twice myself  which was disgusting   I never managed to take a shower with less than   inches of water pooling at my feet  A disgusting way to start every day   I would recommend getting a less easily clogged drain grate  making sure its cleaned every flip  and checking that the drain is functioning properly more often  I would also recommend making sure to have someone in the unit fixing a problem within    hours of a complaint like this  Complained of shower drain issue and was told a  maintenance request has been filed  but never heard back after that about anything actually being done 
716876108,I would have had a better experience at the motel    This was the absolute worst experience Ive ever had  We couldnt get into the apartment for over   hrs  When we did the apartment had no heat and was beyond freezing  We were told to turn on the radiators and the noise would stop after a few minutes  We turned them on and went to dinner to escape the cold and noise only to return to a freezing cold apartment and raging radiator  We were told nothing they could do and other guests complained before but it would stop  It never stopped and the heat never cut on  Not to mention the dirty dishes  Best part  host was unapologetic and seemed irritated with our request for a warm place to sleep  Unable to open the door with because they provided the wrong code  Then i was unable to contact anyone Host answered our messages several hours later No heat in the apartment  We slept in full clothes
508944801,Skip this nightmare  The building is dark and dank  the elevators out of service  None of that is Zencitys fault  but their slow responses when something goes wrong  in my case  a very active cockroach in the bathroom  make this an unpleasant stay  and simply not the small savings  I am still waiting for a reply to my most recent message regarding my refund  In the meantime  I hope youve done a thorough cleaning and extermination in the studio  Information about how to find the lock box was a little confusing  but the lack of information about which floor a room was located on  and how to get there  meant I wandered around a bit trying to find my way 
578685951,Nice place but still under construction  Washer machine flooded  no response to fix it  Terrible experience 
611684950,This is a below average quality corporate apartment  Flat was not clean upon arrival  Extra linens were clearly dirty  Dishwasher does not work  Dishwasher does not work  Flat not clean upon arrival   Extra linens just balled up in closet and not clean  Neighbors dogs barking at all hours of day and night 
572099457,I would not recommend staying with Zencity at all  Upon arrival we found the whole apartment dirty and without towels in any of the bathrooms  The towels that we did find look like they were thrown in the back of the closet  The host was unresponsive when we tried to contact them with the issues  We had to stay in apartment for over an hour until we found other accommodations  It was a very inconvenient situation for us and we will not stay with this host ever again  Did not get back to us when we had issues about cleanliness 
722802157,Was disappointed with this stay  I have booked through zencity before and was very impressed with communication  Check in process is not accurate because you have to access the building through the back and not the side  Did not have a remote to use the tv  notified them Monday and did not get the issue fixed  They just blamed it on the previous stay  
714103435,False advertising  No W D in room  Late responses from host with lack of information about units This host is using false advertising Parking
545136455,Terrible host service 
482528789,The apartment itself was well decorated  and the bed was pretty comfortable  During the hot summer months  the small window AC didnt cool the unit to a comfortable temp  so sleeping here was challenging  The WIFI here didnt work either  but that may have just been a temporary issue   Overall  would not care to stay here again  It would have really improved our stay if someone had taken a minute to turn the AC on before our arrival   The unit never got to a comfortable temperature  and sleeping was very difficult  Working WiFi  functioning AC
229631547,The host canceled this reservation    days before arrival  This is an automated posting 
458165183,Overall   the place in itself is very functional and clean  Customer service was horrible  They just didnt care about our needs and never offered any viable solution to the problems that the place presented  We had requested to cancel our last day and were denied the refund in spite of the fact that it was a week prior to the rental date   It was really cold in the apt  and after not responding to our messages the first day  we were told that is was too bad it was unusually cold  We had an entire day with no lift and were not notified     we were staying on the  th floor  The second day a lady and a gentleman came in unannounced and made a hole in the wall to install something  The third day a guy opened the door without notice and came in to do some maintenance work  I was in bed  I had to insist to send him away  The neighborhood didnt feel safe nor friendly   we were two ladies traveling for work and somewhat this place popped in our zip code request  it was very far away from our area   Not a place I suggest to anyone wants to enjoy Chicago  we had requested to cancel our last day and were denied the refund in spite of the fact that it was a week prior to the rental date  we had very cold days and after not responding we were told that is was too bad it was unusually cold we had an entire day with no lift and were not notified     we were staying on the  th floor  the second day a lady and a gentleman came in unannounced and made a hole in the wall to install something  the third day a guy open the door without notice and came in to do some maintenance   I was in bed  I had to insist to send him away  Overall   the place in itself is very functional and clean  Customer service was horrible  not safe customer service was horrible 
594073876,Nice location and very home like feeling inside the apartment  However communication was NOT good   often took multiple messages and a couple of days  to get a response  Interacting with the workers was not pleasant but as a whole  Id give this place a       Will never be staying in this location or with you guys again  So beyond disappointed  You guys use to be great  Cleaning lady was halfway through cleaning when we walked in after check in  Asked for a key because we were having troubles with ours and it took    hours and a triple text to get a text back and over    hours till we actually got one 
230036678,The host canceled this reservation     days before arrival  This is an automated posting 
595744420,Beware if you like to sleep before     AM  This apartment is above a bar with loud club music playing every night  Music begins at    AM  lasts until     AM  In addition to the music  the bar patrons are very loud  Constant shouting and fights  vomit on the sidewalk  The actual apartment is fine enough  but the proximity to this bar is a huge issue  You should disclose the fact that this apartment is above a bar when renting and that loud club music plays until     AM every night  It is impossible to sleep here  This apartment is above a very loud bar  club music until     AM every night  Lower price considering you cant sleep here until after     AM 
700017332,Our stay felt quite the opposite of many reviews posted to Airbnb  Overall  disappointed with our stay and the lack of service provided by Zencity  didnt feel very  zen  like     The apartment felt a bit more run down and dirty than expected  We had a difficult time accessing the AC controls because they are locked by the property manager making it a very uncomfortable sleep on the very uncomfortable beds even with the partially working fans on and windows open  It should be common knowledge that peoples comfort and sleep during their stay is top priority  would you agree Zen   insert YES neon sign here      In general  we felt the price did not reflect the value of our stay and service  Would not recommend even with the location being much desired  Overall  disappointed with our stay and service  Will be avoiding any future stays under the name or entity with  Zen  in it   Despite the instructions  the code to access the key was incorrect and it would have been helpful to know exactly which exterior door to access and was difficult to find the  sweet spot  to unlock the doors  Lots of communication leading up to the trip a week   a few days before  but communication and care lacked when asked about gaining access to the AC controls and or being given a fan to supplement the broken ceiling fan in one of the bedrooms  Im willing to sleep in an uncomfortable bed but atleast provide some air so were not sweating throughout the night  even with the windows open    Lowering the price to match its value 
479862725,Zencity is the third party handling this location and frankly I would stay away    If you have any travel issue  I e  cannot access the building  they dont have a number to contact anyone to get it resolved immediately    I had reserved this particular location with two teenage girls because of a concert that was going on    Check in is only after  p and the event was open at   p  so we only were able to get to the Airbnb by after midnight    Support cant help you  You dont get direct contact to the host  You also dont get any compromise for the experience you have    We were locked out and we felt unsafe  It was frustrating and scary  Luckily the email support answered us  but it was not timely    We spent almost   hours sitting by the door  unsure of what to do  I almost had to book a room elsewhere    Place was nice  once we were able to get in  but at the expense of dealing with Zencity and being denied something in return  its not worth it    I would much rather book at a hotel  because I know Im GUARANTEED access to my room  I think its ridiculous that I cannot speak directly with the host whether through Zencity or even through Airbnb    Its clear Chris has no concern for safety  has no sympathy  or even cares for what happened  I wont be staying at an Airbnb ever again    At least a hotel will GUARANTEE an accessible room     Chris should have courtesy towards his clients    Its simple business practice to take responsibility for a bad procedure  and in return  do something to make up for it    I feel betrayed because I was not taken care of and Im sure I will continue to be ignored    Clients concerns should not be ignored  I hope this company can learn from this  Its unfair how this has turned out to me when I had two teenage girls to look after    Were very lucky that nothing bad happened to us  There wasnt a second lockbox code provided just in case the first key was missing  Theres no way to contact anyone on the phone and receive immediate support during an emergency  Customer support could give no advice in what to do  An email was provided but it was not timely 
444233744,Room     leaves a lot to be desired  The kitchen has NO counter to work on  no cooking sharp knife  very little cutlery  if youre   tall you can use the cabinets  seating only for    The bed was lumpy  no air condition in bedroom  the tubs are slippery  the worse sofa to sit on  We sat on extra pillows on top of the sofa to have a little comfort  It was noisy   No lighting as you come in at night  you need to turn on a lamp that barely lights the living room   Theres a place to sit on in the living room that is super dirty   In short  that and a previos Airbnb place we stayed on Blackstone have the worst places weve ever stayed  I dont recommend this place except for having two bathrooms  The apartment was not what we hoped for or expected
423268855,The overall stay was okay  The space and location were great  I stayed for   days  When I got there most of the dishes were dirty in the dishwasher  I located those AFTER I purchased paper plates and cups  The living room and bathroom needed to be cleaned  as it hadnt been swept  and there was long brown hair in the tub  On my last day  I cleaned the entire apartment and washed the linens  as I assumed I needed to because the apartment hadnt been cleaned after the previous guests  I came out to find that my car had been towed  It hadnt been specified by the host nor in the listing that parking is PRIVATE and paid for by residents  Im currently out of an extra      that I had to pay to get my car back AND a cleaning crew showed up  So a waste of energy as well  Im highly disappointed and disgusted 
412108484,I wrote on another unit from this company and Im going to write on this one too  I would never stay with this company again  The place was disgusting  I dont believe they have people cleaning the units  at least in the building I stayed in  As soon as you walk in your reaction is  ew   Had a disgusting smell  The couch reaked  of body fluid odor and had what I believe to be a stain from sexual intercourse  All of the linens were dirty as well as the fridge and the bathroom  I had to go to work cleaning the unit as soon as I got in because it was either that or leave and not have a place to stay due to things being last minute  The company has a horrible response time and are very unorganized  Ive never had a problem with any Airbnb Ive stayed in and Ive now stayed in a few to say the least  This one was absolutely gross  You pay almost as you do for a nights stay  as a cleaning fee  Just to have the unit very gross  Would never stay with this company again  Very gross
364511264,The place was very clean  but  much smaller than I expected it to be  The bathroom was extremely small and I didnt even want to take a shower because of the joke of a shower head that was there  It was very hot when I arrived and the old school heaters made it difficult to bring the temperature down  My husband searched all over for a remote and was unable to find it so we never touched the television  The heater in the living room was leaking when we returned after a night Out  and it was  water all over the floor which was annoying  The host was responsive but unable to actually make our stay more comfortable  I appreciated the place being clean  in a nice area  and well stocked of toiletries but with the little issues we had helped me to decide that I would never use this location again 
361770325,Very disappointing experience  Check in was fine overall  though the host did not inform of a second non working lock on the door  therefore we had some difficulty accessing the unit  Host was slow to respond and refused to send someone to clean the unit  although we thought we paid for an already cleaned unit  until the next day  We waited around the next morning and no one arrived to clean while we were present  Very disappointing   especially due to it being Christmas weekend 
356579353,It was one of the worst experiences I have had with Airbnb zencity is a unprofessional company I had medical supplements maild and everything arrived fine I picked them up from the mailroom BUT THE LAS   pakeges that were diliverd I was told by the mail room employee that it was in the mailbox so I contained Chris from zencity he said he would go on Monday to get it from the mailbox this was a Friday I said ok Monday come around he never replied until I contacted hem then he said that there was nothing in the mailbox I had tracking the tracking information said the pakege was diliverd whe theres a diliverd the delivery company scans it therefore I knew that it had been delivered then Chris sent me a message saying that he is not liable for anything I basically believe that they kept my pakeges he was rude and disrespectful  You are unprofessional company
708330811,I typically never write bad reviews and often am pretty easy to forgive and accomdate for the situation  However  when I had arrived  the place had not been cleaned despite their COVID policies in the listing  There was brown and yellow things floating in the toilet and other waste  The sheets hadnt been changed  towels that had been used were still hanging and the floor was not clean  I did  book my stay the day of  but I dont think that if a room isnt ready  that it excuses a room from not being cleaned prior especially given the pandemic and need for cleanliness as a health and safety risk  I did contact support and at first they said they would send someone for touch up  but it really needed more than a touch up   needed a full clean  Thankfully the lady who cleaned the room was kind and did a great job  but I am definitely not booking again with Zencity ever again and did not appreciate the nonchalant approach at first when I made my request 
343502935,Host number on listing does not take calls for AirBNB reservations  Gave me another number which just slowed down response time  Keys left did not fit lockset  so I was unable to check into apartment  Ended up paying twice as much for a hotel        a few blocks away  The number listed on your page does not answer Airbnb calls  This delayed a prompt resolution  Your instruction said one key should open both locks for the apartment door and it only fits one key  The second key  the one that broke  does fit the lock but broke before unlocking 
336806566,This place was a lot smaller than expected and not worth the price 
463114818,dont stay here lost email with instructions host never responded to a long time to in said there was street parking   good luck with that
611618230,I was waiting for   more hours for check in 
583384352,Centrally located on main strip of central west end  No designated parking but street parking on the side with meters  Wi fi was super slow the whole time  We couldnt log into Netflix because there were too many users  Check in instructions were very complicated but well laid out  The florescent lighting is abrasive in most rooms  Feels more like a hotel than an air bnb  Nice lobby  nice furnishings in the room  Good water pressure  The listing says sleeps   but only one bed available  Very pricey for the amenities available  Not many  Clean but I do not recommend  Add a wi fi server because yours was very slow  Too many people were on Netflix so we couldnt watch  we had to use our own  Please sign out of ours  Also the listing says sleeps   but there was only one bed  There is no designated parking  Try using soft white light bulbs for lamps  not as abrasive Parking  Working wifi  Netflix that worked   Food staples  Difficult instructions to check in to follow very complex  Non flourescent lights 
576895601,I checked ahead of time to make sure a later arrival would be ok  I was told there would be no problem  I got into rental property place at roughly  AM and was told by the staff I was not on the list of guests by Zencity to be staying in the apartment for the night  I showed them my airbnb reservation along with my receipt of payment  The rental property staff tried contacting Zencity where they said they were being answered and then told they would get back into contact with them before getting hung up  It took until  AM for them to get back into contact to let the rental property know that I was approved  I had a meeting this morning in Chicago that I only got   hours of sleep for  I leave Chicago Saturday morning and now my trip is ruined because I am exhausted from last night  I had paid for a service that was not met  I had planned and notified them of a late arrival and was told it would be ok  I would have otherwise made arrangements to get into town earlier had I been notified it would not be ok  It was frustrating being told by the rental property that we would most likely not be allowed to stay the night and having to figure out other arrangements  Asked for a refund that they said they would grant over the phone  however didnt hold up to their word  Escalated to airbnb 
575577631,My fianc  and I had multiple issues with this Airbnb  First off  upon arriving I was told per my itinerary that the keys to the apartment would be with the doorman at the entrance to the building  Which was not the case   the doorman could not locate the keys and seemed to act like he had no idea what I was talking about  I was also told not to mention anything about Airbnb and instead say that I am staying in a corporate rental  Not sure why the secrecy is necessary but if there is some type of stipulation with the apartment building that bans Airbnb hosts from renting units out you probably shouldnt put your paying customers in the middle of that dont you think  Anyway  He ended up calling a maintenance worker to let us into the apartment after he verified my identification  Upon being let into the apartment at      pm  Airbnb host was not flexible whatsoever about check in time even though he knew it would result in us being basically stranded with nowhere to put our luggage for several hours  the room was occupied with several people whom Im assuming were cleaning the apartment although there was quite the language barrier between us  They informed us the Airbnb   that I already paid hundreds of dollars for for LESS THAN a    hour stay  was NOT ready for us yet and to come back later   mind you our check in itinerary told us  pm and it was well passed  pm by this point  So we had to leave our luggage  which my fianc  didnt know at the time contained an extremely expensive engagement ring  with   complete strangers in an apartment that we still did NOT have keys to for another hour  Which as you can imagine was not a comfortable or secure feeling  When we finally returned the cleaning lady was STILL there and I basically had to ask her to leave  We both have been traveling since   am that morning and were exhausted and had dinner reservations  that we ended up missing because we couldnt get ready in time due to our late check in  to get ready for  Also  the floors surrounding the apartment are currently under construction so expect ALOT of very  disruptive noises throughout the wee hours of the morning  At times it sounded like someone was going to basically come through the ceiling  Not happy whatsoever and will not be booking with zen city again  I hope you guys do better 
608045316,Thanks Had to leave property and get an alternative room due to unsanitary property  Requested a refund and took days to get a response which was ultimately denied  Near alot of bars and restaurants  Over a run down cleaners  Property is owned by zencity and they really dropped the ball on this one  I would advise against staying at any of their properties  A refund in my option was fair since I left the property and never returned  Their communication was slow and poor customer service  Airbnb was no help  They have no standards for customer service in these instances so dont waste your time and money with this pair 
717712132,This place gets two stars    for location and   for responsiveness of the host  We rented for a month long stay and we paid a lot of money for it  The laundry list of damaged furniture and the filth of the place was offensive  We had to have a handy man in twice to properly fix broken furniture and appliances and to scrub scum and dirt from the bathroom tiles  The couch had to be steam cleaned it was so filthy and smelly  We had to request mattress covers because the mattresses were stained and had pubic hair on them  This is definitely a place for parties and not for long terms stays  I corresponded frequently with the host and while super responsive to get issues addressed which was appreciated  a discount reflecting the extend of the disruption would have been even more appreciated  I unfortunately cannot recommend this unit  I appreciate the responsive customer service  However as I communicated early in the stay the cleanliness issues were insulting to the price we paid  Equally the resistance to offering an appropriate discount for the disruption we experienced was disappointing 
720515582,TERRIBLE customer support   Its a shame that this place was so cute  I just wasnt able to get into the building  The access code they gave me was wrong  the key fob to get into the building and use the elevators was not working and on top of that Zencity did NOTHING to help  Residents had to keep letting me into the building  when contacting the host they saw that as a resolution  It was New Years Eve with Covid and not a lot of foot traffic  My boyfriend and I were stuck at the entrance for over    minutes waiting for a resident to come home  I had book this place for one night  and had way to much trouble to pay       This was a complete rip off and Im VERY disappointed on how the host has handled my situation and lack of communication  Pick wick place apartments should no longer do business with this company because they have such a nice apartment building  that I would have loved to stay there again  but most definitely WILL NOT  I am VERY displeased with the way your company handled my situation  We were locked out of the building and was told that nothing was wrong  The access code to get into the building was wrong  and our key fob was not working  When trying to get in touch with support  it was difficult  Then when trying to resolve the situation  it was even more difficult  No one actually resolved my error with the access code  or my non working fob  Residents had to keep letting me in and Zencity kept seeing that as a resolution  Couldnt get in contact when I was locked out of the building 
722825730,The apartment building had very bad cellular reception  I also found a huge roach which I had to kill  I also found mouse droppings in the bed  When I asked the property manager about refunding the cleaning fee they pretty much ignored my request   only refunded the days left on my reservation due to me requesting to leave early  I appreciate being allowed to shorten my reservation however I dont think its fair that a cleaning fee was charged to me due to the amount of sanitary issues I came across  I also had to use my own bug spray in the unit to make myself feel comfortable while there  When I asked for a refund for the cleaning fee I was ignored The apartment unit has horrible cellular reception  I had to leave in order to have a full phone conversation
722550803,This was the worst AirBnB experiences Ive had  I drove    hours and arrived at the AirBnB at    pm  It was self check in  and the code to get the key didnt work  I contacted the host who then self released the key box  No key inside  We try   other boxes and the key was not there  She said the cleaner did not return the key to the box and to go up to the unit to see if it was unlocked  When I went in the tv was on  furniture moved around and the bed un made w make up on the sheets  She had me drive to another unit in town   which had unclear instructions on how to arrive  I ended up not inside until      am  It was not the ladys fault who helped me  I asked for    extra minutes for check out and another person told me it was impossible for them to allow that and I needed to leave by the time they said  They ignored my message when I asked why no one had rectified or even attempted to rectify any of these issues  Strongly would not recommend any bookings w ZenCity no one rectified all my issues and were rude about check out
459619503,Brian let his place to us after mentioning that the previous group had damaged the place  He then proceeded to try and charge us       for the damages by the previous group  He also provided no brooms  mops  paper towels or cleaning supplies and then chastised us for not leaving the place spotless  Either leave supplies or use the       you charged us for the place to clean it yourself  Ruined what was a nice weekend with odd behavior after 
719785019,Nice place  Nice Location  Past reviews stated it gets cold  I inquired on that  they said I shouldnt have a problem AND  it was cold   lol  Heater works great  they dont do any winterizing and the bedrooms are frigid and the main room  close to the windows dont seem to stay warm  it wasnt terrible  but I definitely wore my winter hat a vest and a sweatshirt    Customer service was terrible  I got locked out of the building for an hour when when it was     out during a pandemic so I couldnt seek refuge anywhere  They never really responded and I resorted to emailing the rental department off of their website and finally got a response    In any event  I will NEVER rent from a COMPANY on Airbnb ONLY owners    The place was cute though  just be aware that ur on ur own if you rent from ZEN CITY  You need to review protocols on customer service as we move into winter during a pandemic  I got locked out of the building on check out  my fault  and my keys were in the car  Couldnt get any response and it was   degrees in the middle of pandemic  so I couldnt seek refuge anywhere  I ended up having to email their Rental Felt from their Website  no one EVER responded on Airbnb    only BOT responses like  PLEASE SEND REVIEWS     sy time booking an airbnb from a legit company  NEVER AGAIN  Ill only rent from owners who care about customer service 
719203323,The communication was good but the place was unclean which raised a lot of concern especially during the current pandemic  After not being able to check in until      pm  throughout the rest of our stay we found things such as undergarments in the dryer and food left in the oven and microwave  I would suggest if you stay here to take pictures WITH time stamps of every single thing wrong  For the amount of money spent to stay there and the time wasted on getting the place cleaned and coming to some kind of reasonable resolution was not worth the money AT ALL  Will not be staying here again  I would suggest making sure the place is ready for the next guest so they wont go through the drama and filth I went through especially during COVID  For the amount of money spent to stay there and the time wasted on getting the place cleaned  obviously in a hurry since things were still left unclean  was not worth the money  Will not be staying here again  Could not check in in time due to room being unclean 
714712529,This place is in a great location and the beds were comfy  Unfortunately  everything else was rather disappointing  Given that they charged a high cleaning fee  I expected it to be cleaner than it was  The shower curtain  for example had a layer of mildew at the bottom of it  last     inches   A shower curtain is pretty easy to clean and or replace  There were also hairs all over the beds and bathtub    The hallway of the building constantly smelled of smoke as another reviewer pointed out and at times we could smell the smoke coming into the apartment   One thing to note is that its an old Chicago apartment building so it does get cold unless the radiator is running and I was pretty cold a good portion of the time   a space heater would have been nice   What sent us over the edge though is that the wifi wasnt working and the property managers took half a day to get back to us when we first reached out  if this was being managed by an individual we might have been more forgiving but its a company managing this property so their response time  in my opinion should have been fast  Hosts at every other Airbnb Ive ever stayed at have responded within the hour whenever Ive reached out during a stay    Overall  I would say that if you are not going to spend much time here other than to sleep  if you dont mind paying an overpriced cleaning fee  and if you dont ever need to use wifi  this might be a good spot for you
