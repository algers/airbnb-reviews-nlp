618658345,its in a great neighborhood and close to a lot of cool places  theres quite a big price jump at the end of checking out so be a bit weary of that  also the heater was not working as well as the couch outside near the heater not being the cleanest  the street parking seems to be free but its a bit confusing on when you can use it   obviously the weekend is fine  but during weekdays we werent so sure  other than that I had a great stay here and would love to come back with some things being closer paid attention to  just pay a little closer attention to detail  the guests before me I assume had leftover food in the microwave  the shower had quite a bit of mildew on the wall  as well as that weird older piece having some  the bathtub was missing a knob so I didnt feel comfy using it  it would be nice if the heater outside worked as well as the couch being a little cleaner so it was more useable  also the odd price jump to almost double was a bit disheartening and im not sure why it happened  other than that its in a great neighborhood and close to a lot of things that were very handy  I would love to stay back here with some improvements and a better understanding in the change of price  thank you  the price about doubled when I checked out  wasnt sure why especially with there being some knicks and dings on the walls  as well as not having a working heater outside that we assumed was in working condition
616427415,Our stay in this place was supposed to be a joyful one  We came for a few days to celebrate my daughters birthday  This place is very close to Barnes hospital which made it a perfect location to get together   It was very disappointing from the beginning  The bathroom was not cleaned and full of hair from the previous guest  A set of dirty linens was thrown in the closet if bedroom number one and in bedroom number   the linens were full of hairs  The companys response was slow and unapologetic and they did nothing to remediate the situation  We had to buy our own sheets  The next day they came to clean but  in spite of our request  they did not leave toilet paper  Avoid this place at all cost  The WiFi was not working  The username and password was incorrect The host kept avoiding the issue of dirty linens and bathroom  They insisted that we make the bed with a non existing spare set of linens  Actually there were dirty linens crumpled up in the closet  A clean space and a more responsive host  We will never again stay with this company 
624952307,good for the value
617317015,Stay away  These places are not clean like they are said to be  I have videos and photos on my phone of how nasty the rooms were  I had   different rooms  Also  my wallet and license and ID along with   bank cards of mine were stolen from my room  I was the only one I my room besides Zencitys house maid  I spoke with Marty who is   of the owners of the apartment and he had a total attitude and did NOTHING about my things  He was suppose to call me back but after waiting for his call for almost a week I decided to call him back just for him to not even remember who I was  That showed right there that he didnt give a damN about my items missing from my room with only his personnel having access to my room    Makes me wonder if they go around scamming   frauding people  I will never stay in ZenCity properties again  I will also tell my friends   family to avoid them as well  So much  too frustrated to write  Today is Friday  I have literally been waiting on a call back from Zencity since Monday March  TH  Ive made at least    calls to them and even spoketo someone named Marty who was suppose to call me back on Monday as well and I still have yet to hear from him  My wallet  license and ID stolen from the room yet I was there alone  The only person that had access was the cleascleancleaning lady or maid so she called herself  After my wallet was stolen from the room I left my ID in the room hidden since it was the only identification I had left   when I checked out of the room I accidentally left it in there  The same day I went to get it but the security at del prado werent allowed to let me in to get my ID so I called Zencity management and spoke to Marty  Owner Manager  letting him know the cleaning guy for the apt was right across the street cleaning another apt   if he could give him the okay to go in the unit I rented and he said NO  After he asked me exactly where I left my ID and he said no theres nothing he can do     I believe he could be using my information   committing fraud  I just dont understand why he wouldnt let the cleaner in so I could get my stuff  I will NEVER stay in any ZenCity properties again  I will also let my friends and family know to NEVER stay in them as well  I also took videos with my phone on how filthy the place was and I had   different rooms  They both were dirty  The location was fiNe  A clean apartment and honestly a few more things Im just to frustrated to write about right now 
611314369,I checked in after      PM as I was instructed  However  the apartment was still a mess when I walked in because the cleaning lady was still working in the apartment  Need to improve your internal communications between the host and the cleaning service   A window blind did not work   The room was still being cleaned when I checked in  at     PM   The cleaning lady said she was not aware of a check in on the apartment  She spent almost another    minutes to finish the cleaning  I received a message from the host that the apartment was being  touched up  because it was unoccupied for a while  I did not really care who was telling the truth  but I was disappointed when walking in the apartment that was still messy as it was being cleaned 
626688366,Great location  overall good apartment  but bathroom needed some maintenance before we got there   Just wish the bathroom didnt smell  clean bathroom
434319501,This is a lovely apartment with a wonderful view   The elevators in the building  however  are not all working but they get you there with some wait   There is no parking on premises but mostly its fine to park on the street  Would have loved to give this a   star but couldnt because the kitchen is ridiculously under provisioned  Only two forks  two knives   Not a salad or mixing bowl to make a salad  I had to use a pot  One small limp towel to dry  Worst provisioned kitchen in all my AirBNB stays  and that includes a disappointing stay in Istanbul  The kitchen is ridiculously under provisioned  Two forks  Two knives   Not a salad or mixing bowl to make a salad   No cleaning liquids to clean the counters   Not even pepper or regular salt as basic provisions  Worst provisioned kitchen in all my AirBNB stays  and that includes a disappointing stay in Istanbul   When you list you have a kitchen  it should be properly provisioned   Confusing address and directions to the building A better equipped kitchen
606791298,The location was the best part of this Airbnb property  Lafayette square restaurants and bars are well within walking distance  However one issue that I will remember in the future was with parking  The ad stated a gated parking lot was provided to guest with access from a key fob  When we arrived the fob was not there  I called Zencity and they told me previous renter took it and they didnt have a replacement  I was told sorry for the inconvenience  We had to park on the street for the two day stay which can sometimes be tricky in busy St  Louis neighborhoods  The apartment was very nice but one thing I noticed was that the floors were dirty  There was drywall dust on several places and I wouldnt call the place sparkling clean  Nice appliances and kitchen but beware of the limited hot water supply  Its a small tank and forces a very quick shower  Kind of a bummer if you need to relax or shave  Pluses and minuses for this place  The location was convenient and the building seemed safe  For      a night it would have been nice to have a sparkling clean place  parking as listed  and extra towels   Gated parking was listed and a selling point however  the fob was not there and a replacement wasn u    t given  I realize this was an issue with previous renter but plans should be in place to provide a backup to next guest  I u    m sure there u    s s fee for lost fobs that covers this expense for owner   Gated parking was listed but fob was not there and no replacement was given  On the street parking is fine but doesnt guarantee a spot close to building or safety of vehicle  A bit cleaner  more towels  and parking issues accurate and correct 
604558659,The place was large  pretty clean  although it could use some remodeling  The water pressure in the shower was pretty low  The main issue I experienced was the failure of the management to provide WiFi  as promised in the description    I contacted them immediately about that  and  unfortunately  they did not fix the issue until the final day of my stay  While their responses regarding this issue were relatively prompt  they were unprofessional  In fact  they provided   additional passwords for me to try  and they assumed I was not competent enough to select the right network and enter the password correctly  The last straw was that on the last day  when I informed them that the WiFi was finally working  they claimed that nothing had changed on their end  and that the WiFi was working during the entire stay  which implied that I was lying about the WiFi not working earlier    If you are looking for a bargain basement price for a stay in Central West End  this is a good place to stay  However  if you need to be confident about having working WiFi   or if you would like competent management in case another issue arises  look elsewhere  Everything was good  but your failure to provide WiFi was a material breach of trust   WiFi was  listed in the description but not available on the first two days out of my   day stay  The entry code was changed last minute  and I only found out because I messaged the host about checking in early  Providing WiFI as advertised

672418662,Average stay  looks exactly like it is  Floor and bathroom are dirty however  Make sure to clean  Looked exactly like it is 
626651694,The place was nice and clean despite a few mishaps  Communication couldve been better as well  The place was nice but the few mishaps couldve been prevented or handled a little better  The window was literally loose off the hinges when it fell with one simple touch  Also  I was not at fault for the tv table  I was barely even there let alone using the tv or the stand  I do apologize for the mishaps and wish everything couldve went smoother 
613224745,The location was very convenient  there are food options in walking distance  Comfortable beds and bedding  Price was fair   Cons  There is only one set of keys available so if you are traveling with others you all have to be on the same schedule  coming and going   The place wasnt cleaned thoroughly  The floors had dirt dust  and the showers hadnt been wiped down  There was no coffee pot  but a grinder      A lot of light comes into the larger bedroom which makes it hard to sleep in nap  The gym is in the basement and the equipment was nice but it was all dirty  Please pay attention to cleanliness  add a coffee maker  and two sets of keys should be standard for a   bedroom place  The host responded but didnt help with my issue 
428063106,Good location  Unfortunately the neighbors are super sensitive to noise and at  pm on a Saturday  they complained about us playing music through the tv at     volume  Being let in was the worst issue we had because the call box wasnt working and the company said there wasnt anything they could do for us  Once we finally made it in  it was pretty smooth otherwise  Be prepared for a leg workout making it up all of the stairs though  When I called from the directory box to be buzzed in  the person on the other line couldnt hear me  I tried calling multiple times to no success  I tried calling the host but I was connected to an operator for the company and he said there was nothing he could do about the situation 
637453214,THE GOOD  Gorgeous historic building exterior was fantastic for our photos as we are celebrating a girlfriends upcoming wedding  Park and beach just across  plenty of room with laundry    THE BAD   We sanitized the whole kitchen area and living area that we had to touch as weve noticed that it wasnt clean  Host was veeeerrryyy slow to respond and offer no help  Sofa was very dirty and stained  hair  pieces of candy wrapper under cushion  we had to put over a comforter to sit on it  Kitchen was not cleaned  fridge smells  microwave splatters all over inside  oven handle and front is sticky  Tons of dead bugs in window sills  NO WIFI our entire stay  Their router modem was faulty   nd bedrooms bed was very light and slides on the floor everytime
706740163,The location was good but is it worth the hassle   The keypad info was wrong and there was no fob in the room for access to the apartment and parking garage   I had to find a place to park my car for the night because there was not a fob to get into the parking garage   Even after contacting the host  no fob  The keypad info was wrong and there was no fob   I had to find a place to park my car for the night because there was not a fob to get into the parking garage 
424006464,The area was nice I had no problem with finding things to do but the host responded very slow or not at all  I had an emergency that I had to attend to at home so I was going to leave a day early but they refused to give me any money back  they also never responded to me when I asked them why I couldnt receive any money back being that I let her know the day before I was going to leave  I also messaged them letting them know I was leaving at about   and no one responded till    am the next day  I just feel like the communication should Have been a little better and I should have been told why I couldnt receive any money back but I didnt even get that 
638181673,Was not exactly worth the price  Kind of dirty  But if you like a good view the rooftop is really neat  The decor of the apartment was nice  it just wasnt clean  and there was a bad smell the whole time in the kitchen  It was okay  but there was a horrible rancid smell in the kitchen  There was very long dark hair all over the bathroom and shower  The air conditioner in the living room is pretty gross honestly could use some good cleaning  Both of them need filters changed too  Your floors definitely need mopped  we could not walk on them with bare feet without our feet becoming black  But we loved the rooftop view  and the decor of the apartment  If it had been clean  Was not very clean at all
623347108,The unit was fantastic  Price was cheaper than expected for the unit  It was clean  nice furniture  comfortable bed   Location was great  Check in instructions were perfect   Dishes were sparse but sufficient  I would have liked wine glasses and they didnt have any but maybe thats expecting a bit too much  The view was amazing   The only downside was that communication was bad   It took the host about a day and a half to respond to a question I had about amenities   Next  the dishwasher didnt work  I discovered this on a Saturday and messaged them about it   They didnt reply until      on Tuesday which was   days later  Plus  my stay ended Wednesday  and I had to be out by    so obviously the dishwasher wasnt going to be fixed during my stay  I had to do dishes by hand which Im not a fan of  There was no drain plug for the sink so I used a pot to wash the dishes in  There was only one hand towel  and I was using it to dry my hands so I used a bath towel to let the dishes air dry   When Zen city did reply about the dishwasher not working  they said   perhaps there is a switch in the kitchen which will turn on the dishwasher since it doesnt seem to have power  Let us know if we can do anything else for you during your stay    You could have replied much sooner  tried to fix my dishwasher much sooner  and DURING my stay  So you havent done anything for me in the first place  let alone  anything else      Perhaps there is a switch     Because you DONT KNOW your own unit     So they obviously had not called maintenance yet since now they were attempting to get me to trouble shoot   I had looked for a switch everywhere in the kitchen  as well as finding the fuse box  flipping the breaker off and back on  as well as looking for the plug in for the dishwasher  None of that fixed the dishwasher  There was no switch   Lovely how they contacted me so late after my issue that my stay was now nearly over  They didnt resolve my issue   It felt like they didnt try to resolve my issue during my stay and they didnt seem to care or act concerned  For this reason  I reduced stars  Its a shame because the place was great   Zen City contacted me a few hours before check in to move me to a different building stating there was a maintenance issue  I didn u    t mind this too much as it was a nice place  But  considering I had a maintenance issue that wasn u    t resolved during my stay  it made me feel they do not address maintenance issues promptly   It took the host about a day and a half to respond to a question I had   Next  the dishwasher didnt work  I discovered this on a Saturday and messaged them about it   They didnt reply until      on Tuesday which was   days later  Plus  my stay ended Wednesday  and I had to be out by    so obviously the dishwasher wasnt going to be fixed during my stay  I had to do dishes by hand  There was no drain plug for the sink so I used a pot to wash the dishes in  There was only one hand towel I was using to dry my hands so I tased a bath towel to let the dishes air dry   When Zen city did reply about the dishwasher not working  they said   perhaps there is a switch in the kitchen which will turn on the dishwasher since it doesnt seem to have power  Let us know if we can do anything wise for you during your stay    You could have fixed my dishwasher much sooner  and during my stay  So you havent done anything for me in the first place  let alone  anything else      Perhaps     Because you DONT KNOW your own unit     So they obviously had not called maintenance yet   I had looked for a switch everywhere in the kitchen  as well as flipping the breaker off and back on  as well as looking for the plug in for the dishwasher  None of that fixed the dishwasher  There was no switch   Lovely how i was contacted so late after my issue that my stay was now near over within less than a day until check out 
623553552,The most generous review I can give is that there are safer  more secure neighborhoods just blocks away  with hosts that go out of their way to make sure you have everything that may need  not to mention thats listed    This is unfortunately  not one of them  and I would have to question any listing with this management team behind it  Three days without access to a bath towel is really unacceptable  And with everyone overdue a trim a hairdryer is almost as much  No big deal if I would have known  please dont list it if its not going to be there   My apologies for breaking the French press that was in the unit when I arrived  btw   French press is not a coffee maker especially to those that dont know how to use one  but youll find I did replace it with a better model at least its not missing parts allowing it to come apart and break  And if the Monarch was supposed to be a solution for coffee   those prices are higher than Starbucks and an insult to your guests and to the community when people are eating out of dumpsters right behind the building  I cant recommend this listing at any price  BTW  your cleaning team arent cleaning the drawers  desk drawers  or under the bed  And   gauze squares doesnt make a  st aid kit found that one the hard way when trying to clean the French press and  lose the white bedspread  its stained near the top  center under the pillows  you can see it when the light shines thru the uncurtained windows  I do thank you for adding the extra day  I did appreciate the gesture even when you charged me almost double for the convenienc   Good luck to you   There werent any parking meters near the building  but it is limited to   hr between  am and  pm M F but thats only IF you can find a spot to park parallel against the curb and good luck with that if you drive anything larger than a sub compact   Several different people communicated with me  only one introduced themselves  And I dont think they share notes with each other about issues or what exactly is going on  They really should update their listing to let guests know that they are building a large apartment building about   ft away from one of the exterior walls  This apartment was on the opposite of the construction and it woke me up every morning  Behind the apartment building is also a very large  boarded up  vacant building that seem to be a gathering place for the homeless at night  The police do come thru and clear it out at least once a night  I guess you get what you pay for   so be prepared to bring towels  a hair dryer  an extra blanket  coffee  a coffee maker  sugar  dishwashing tabs  a mattress pad   there arent even any curtains  Dont forget earplugs as the walls are very thin and your door is right next to the back exit to the stairwell  Those steel doors with the bar across the middle you compress to open like you might find in a school   and just as loud 
444920817,NA Hi Brian thanks for letting us stay at your house  The only suggestions I have is more blankets pillows towels  Other then that the house just was not very clean  Hope this helps you in the future 
630076064,Nice place to chill  Bathroom had a leak  There was a pot catching the water  It smelled like mildew in there  Bed was comfy  Couch very sunk in  Appliances and kitchen was nice  Overall if they fix this place up a bit it would be a wonderful stay 
589152967,Awful experience  inaccurate listing  Hosts were helpful with initial issues but once the issues grew  They went silent and were no longer helpful  Apartment was dirty  no trash bags  no actual coffee maker  dryer did not work  I would not trust Zen city with another trip of mine  You were quick to respond to any initial issues but once you were asked for a partial refund you went silent and no longer were so helpful   We initially had no trash bags in our unit at all to throw any of our garbage in  They didn u    t deliver any until the next day around noon  Coffee maker was a French press which we had no idea how to use ad said floor to ceiling windows but they were not  It did have a dryer but the dryer would not stay on for more than five minutes at a time before it turned off I had to keep on turning it back on to get our clothes dry  Also the Internet lagged and it made it difficult to stream anything on Netflix  I did reset the router but it didn u    t help   The address given on the Airbnb reservation was different than the one on the check in instructions which made it confusing  Also  The deadbolt would not lock so we had to rely on the handle only  The host responded to issues at first but once I requested a partial refund they asked me to send pictures so their cleaners could come by and clean everything up and I said it was unacceptable that it shouldve already been clean when we walked in  They stopped responding and never gave me any refund  There were a lot of bums that resided on the sidewalks around this hotel 
710988449,Gday toeat cute place that is easy to access  the hardest part really is street parking  This is an old building so it will be very drafty  It was a bit cold during my stay  Grub Hub also refused to read the address as accurate so I had to o get things rather than have them delivered The washing machine only runs hot warm water  so dont mix your colors    The first night I was there  a pipe leaked all over the kitchen  It was a mess  The repair guy took half a day to get there  and left without fixing it  Host wanted me to confirm it was no longer an issue after I repeatedly asked for another repair man to be sent    As the kitchen was still a soapy swamp  They eventually did  on the second day  with no warning  and he fixed it immediately  He also checked other kitchen water features to ensure they were working  I had to ask for a partial refund for not having a kitchen for two nights and a whole day    The blinds in the space were mostly damaged or dysfunctional  and one of the bedroom doors had no functional hanle  lock or catch  It was also hollowed out  Host was made aware of these issues  but check your doors before you settle in  Thank you for working with me on the pipe leak   Washing machine only runs hot   Host asked for confirmation that a repair man fixed a pipe  after I repeatedly ask for them to send another because the first didnt fix it  A major leak sprung in the kitchen and it took forever to get fixed 
584025767,Not great  Skip this listing for now until they get their systems improved  First negative review Ive written over dozens of stays  Cigarette marijuana smoke really triggering our breathing at night  Check in was not smooth  Waited about an hour to get the key problem figured out  No shower supplies  The place is bare bones   a bed  a few glasses  and a tv  Awful refund policy since we had to cancel     back  Really negative stay  well choose a hotel next time   Listing said washer and dryer  none in this unit   Shower supplies  better check in  all around could be improved 
709619727,Very nice in many ways  such as being large and spacious  However  the bathroom and kitchen were not clean  If the apartment was fully cleaned it would be an incredible place 
618065045,Nice modern unit with great location for downtown Live Music Bars P L District  and Sprint Center    block walk to trolley   Have all apps on TV but no Cable   Beware of parking cost availability especially if there is a major event happening downtown   We were staying for Big    Tourney and closest parking for was about   block South of Truman Road I    at a cost of      for   nights and you could only bring your vehicle in once and leave once so basically could not use it   May be better if no major events going on downtown   We just parked in North Kansas City and too a bout a    Lift Ride to the Building   Unfortunately during our stay there was some construction going on right above us and all they host said was sorry  if we knew  we would have warned you   Woke us up every morning at   am    For groups of more than   adults  they should provide more fobs for access into the building elevator and provide more than   key into the actual unit   Not good when a couple people want to stay out later and then when come in have to wake others to unlock door  Construction every morning at   am woke us up   More fobs to enter Building Elevator and actual keys to get into unit need to be provided if   couples or larger group is staying   Not enough info about how much parking would cost or only giving one key for a group of   Adults  Late response when asked for additional fobs to at lest get in building elevator and still only   key to get into actual unit 
709154835,I had high hopes from the reviews  but this Airbnb didnt live up to expectations  We spent    minutes standing in the hallway trying to call Zencity because they gave us the incorrect door code  We had the same issue one other time where we spent    minutes waiting for their help because they had changed the door code without letting us know  Some of the pans in the kitchen were very dirty  and they only have salt and pepper for use which wouldve been nice to know we had to bring other basics like olive oil  Neither the heat or the AC would work at all  causing us to prop the balcony door open all night to keep proper air flow  I was disappointed and wouldnt stay here again  We spent    minutes in the hallway calling the host because the keypad wouldnt work  Same at check out 
708197839,    I am waiting for a response to my email that I sent with pictures of all of my issues with the apartment 
584835736,Overall an ok space  The shower ran out of hot water after   minutes  and there were a few spiders in residence  Its a basement apartment though so thats probably to be expected  The previous guests left with the parking lot key fob so we couldnt park safely in the lot like we hoped  The hosts responded quickly but were unable to resolve the issue until our final night  We probably wouldnt stay here again  It would be a good idea to have more than one parking lot fob on site to avoid issues like we had   The address given is not shown anywhere on the building  you have to look closely at the screen by the door to be sure you u    re in the right place   Access to the parking lot that was advertised 
621467578,Dont stay there  
414048315,the building is clean and modern  the one and a half bathrooms were a pleasant surprise  the apartment has the feel of a hotel room  rather small and spare  the space met our needs at a reasonable price  thank you for a seamless stay  there were extra linens for the futon  but no extra blankets   it was basically just a hotel suite  small   it was fine  just not the most convenient we just werent impressed  we didnt spend much time there  but it was sparse and didnt feel comfortable 
627461356,nice stay  you were a great host and I appreciate the stay   the wifi didnt work  
412440224,You can expect a neat   tidy location  If I were to judge all rentals from Zencity by this apartment  Id be willing to rent every single time as long as its clean and dust free 
700614644,I do not recommend staying here  My experience was riddled with issues and frustration  and the host was rarely helpful  or timely  with his responses when I reached out for help      There were handprints all over the walls of the bedroom  and the furniture in the living dining room was extremely old  worn and dirty looking  It also smelled like chemicals   and not in the clean way      One of the windows in the living room is missing       with only paper taped over it  Additionally  none of the windows have screens   so they cant be opened   and guests are not allowed to adjust the thermostat on their own     TV is EXTREMELY slow  at times unwatchable  and you can only watch Netflix   no regular TV  The input was constantly disconnecting and or buffering due to slow internet  I also had to replace the batteries in all the remotes  which the host did not reimburse for or acknowledge when I reached out     There was a fire alarm in the unit chirping for THREE ENTIRE days  kept me up all   nights  too   It took the host multiple days and multiple reminders follow ups from me before it was fixed  I couldnt reach the fire alarm or find a ladder  otherwise I would have just done it myself     Lastly  neither of the front gates leading to the apartment building lock  This is dangerous  There were strange people homeless people wandering all around and through the entrance front alleyway during the night  It was also very loud   This was a disappointing and inaccurate experience  from top to bottom  In addition to the issues Ive listed above  one of the windows in the living room was missing  with only paper taped over it  and there were no screens on any of the windows  so they couldnt be opened  Guests do not have control of the temperature in the apartment either   you have to contact the host  who doesnt respond   n nThe TV is also EXTREMELY slow  to the point where it is unwatchable at times  and only offers the option to watch Netflix  no regular TV    I had to pay for and replace all the batteries in the remote controls  and even still  the TV was disconnecting  buffering the entire time   n nLastly  one of the fire alarms in the unit was chirping  for   ENTIRE days  kept me up all night  before someone came to fix it  There was very little to no communication from the host when I reached out  and I had to follow up with them MULTIPLE times  over multiple days  before it was fixed   The host was not helpful  nor timely  any of the times I reached out for help  which were multiple   Neither of the front gates leading to the apartment building lock  This is extremely dangerous  especially given the area  There were strange people homeless people wandering all around and through the entrance front alleyway during the night  It was also very loud 
625245065,When you stay at this place  Just know that the host will respond really quickly and they are there to help  However  the place is not the place that is on the photo  although nicely furnished  with the exception of the   seat sofa   I enjoyed the cleanliness of the linens in the bedrooms  The place had everything we needed during this pandemic time  so we stayed    The  surrounding community  to the apartment is not that great  Theres a park across the street filled with homeless people that camps there using drugs  leaving trash  and  using the bathroom everywhere  Itsnot a pretty site  Other than that  I will be back in St  Louis in July and unfortunately I won t book this place again  Just the area  was a bit much for me  Other than that I could live with the other things  The host was Amazing with a capital A  I just have to be honest  I really appreciate staying at your place  Although I have a few things that I was a little bit uncomfortable with  I still stayed because I didnt want to hassle you or myself  Thank you for being a prompt host   It wasnt the same place on the advertisement  However we  had a long flight and  didnt arrive until late after      p m Plus the host was very helpful in a timely manner   It was horrible  I had my teenage daughter with me and we witnessed people shooting drugs in the park just right across the street  There is tons of homeless around and so we had human feces at the tail end of our truck one morning with tissue  I wish I would have known the area  I would have never picked that location  Also the neighbor on the left side was very rude to us at first  Its not worth the value I paid 
428631482,The only thing I enjoyed about this property was the memory foam mattress  Other than that it was a total miss  Check in was very easy  And location was great for us  However  every night as we tried to fall asleep there was constitution sounds like hammering all throughout the night 
409386660,In general a nice place that was clean  in good condition with good communication with the host   It was unfortunate that the WiFi was down during my trip  I think the location could use some better general maintenance and those were some suggestions I gave to the host for improvement  Zencity  thanks for the stay at your place  It was very clean and a good comfortable place to stay  It was of course very unfortunate that the two things important to me that I asked about ahead of time WiFi and coffee were not available  I do appreciate the offer for a mifi on the last day and I understand its a bit out of your control for the WiFi  but it was important coming to Chicago working in IT needing the WiFi  I just ended up working longer hours at the office  In addition  I think you need a little more attention to general maintenance  Every single drawer in the bathroom and the TV stand were broken  Batteries were out in the remote  some light bulbs out  the wire routing was just kind of junky  some cheap falling apart furniture  understand some of these are petty  but they add up and wanted to give you an honest report so that if you do feel you want to improve for others  these are some areas for improvement   It was unfortunate timing that the internet was broken during my trip  Also a disappointment was my post inquiry  asking if coffee was stocked  which was yes  but there was only instant coffee supplied for the French press  
619710114,This place needed a deep clean  Kitchen utensils and appliances as well as cups and bowls had actual dirt and dust on them  Different layout than pictures   Completely different apt setup than anticipated  Pictures looked far better than actual space   furnishing and layout were different than advertised   Access to building was only available through key card  which we were not provided with or informed about  We got in by chance with another group  but wouldve been left out on the st if not because of the hosts unresponsiveness  Did not respond to messages  Better cleanliness and responsiveness from host 
611633882,Noise  The apartment itself  is quaint  check in is easy  location is good   except for the bar directly below  The music from the bar plays until   or   am every night without fail  and is unceasing  The situation needs to be dealt with  Its a bummer because without this major major drawback  this would be a nice place  Unless you plan on only sleeping from   am to    am every day  do not plan to stay here  You need to disclose the bar directly below the apartment as well as the noise  and add a white noise maker to help counter it   Apartment is located directly above a very loud bar  Description deliberately skirts this fact   See above  Situation is almost unlivable  Loud music at all hours  Not their fault  but their fault for not disclosing 
405211776,This host appears to be a property management company  If thats what youre looking for  then go for it  Otherwise  you might as well stay in a hotel  The hotel I and my father ended up having to book at   pm  due to the misrepresentation of sleeping arrangements in this apartment  was cheaper and had   queen beds and a large bathroom   This space was advertised to have sleeping space for     people  The real sleeping capacity is     people  if you share the bed  The  nd sleeping spot was advertised as a sofa bed but was just a broken couch  Not big enough for a grown adult   The host  Zencity  was unwilling to make up for their misrepresentation and did not refund  nor rehouse us for our stay in Chicago    Overall  the place was clean and quaint  The bathroom sink was updated but the bathroom itself was very small  The kitchen was nice and good enough for a short stay  If the sleeping arrangements would have been as stated  this would have been a nice space  However  false advertising and poor care by the host company  Zencity  left small margin for a good review   The photos project the place to be much bigger than reality   nThis apartment only sleeps a max of   ppl if they share the bed  The listing said      There was no sofa bed   With all of the fees and how small the bathroom is  it was cheaper and better quality to stay in a hotel 
609209647,The apartment was a great value and clean  but was above a bar which was very loud until   AM each night   I feel you should have disclosed it was above a bar that plays loud music until     am everyday   Problems with the lockbox  I would have appreciated full disclosure concerning the proximity to the bar 
572981534,I am sure this place will be amazing once renovations are complete  but I had the misfortune of coming  during a major renovation  There were a couple issues I needed which forced me to have to move locations  You may want to double check when booking to ensure renovations are complete  First before even booking I had asked about gym and being able to use it prior to arriving and they stated that it was in the building and I could use it any time  When I arrived I had to keep asking about where the gym was  then come to find out it was not available due to renovation  They also did not tell me they were going through a major renovation  which was too much to handle  The noise started about      am in  the morning and continued through the afternoon  I had to move apartment complexes because the renovation was right outside my room and they didnt have any other space available in the building  They said they would give me a refund if I booked with another location through AirBNB with them  which I did  but the refund was a fraction of the cost  I suppose I should have validated the refund amount prior to booking my new stay with ZenCity  The other place was further out  but at least I could rest well  Please next time try to be more accurate with your description and if doing renovations make sure you have disclosed that to the person reserving space  This was hugely disruptive for my business trip   I had asked about gym and being able to use it prior to arriving and they stated that it was in the building and I could use it any time  When I arrived I had to keep asking about where the gym was  then come to find out it was not available due to renovation  They also did not tell me they were going through a major renovation  which was too much to handle  I had to move locations  They said they would give me a refund if I booked with another location  which I did  but the refund was a fraction of the cost   The place was under major renovation and there were no clear signs to my room  I spent about    minutes walking around to find it  They were slow to respond to me and when they did it wasnt really answering my questions  I even posted a message complaining about the noise with the renovations and they send me a welcome email to check to see how my stay was  It was like they did not even read my message prior to emailing me  It was a descent location  there wasnt very much really close by  Super inexpensive  but that was probably due to the major renovation going on  I hope it is better once complete 
592164656,Watch for the final price as it was much more than originally listed on the final calculation before paying   The location is wonderful and the house is quite beautiful and spacious   Queen size beds are very comfortable   The heat floats upstairs so you will want to turn it down at night  Did not feel welcoming as signs listed reminders of being quiet and no smoking   Please note that on Saturday night the marijuana smell from next door was very  intense and wafted into the master bedroom   There was no soap in the soap dispensers anywhere downstairs   No instructions on how to operate the television   It would have been nice to have your suggestions of favorite diners and how where to pick up public transportation   Most of all was the price being listed so much lower than actual   The price should reflect the actual price on the dates   No soap in soap dispensers in kitchen  downstairs bathroom 
590797389,Do not try to change your dates  Marty will say   No Problem  Then Marty will say   just cancel your reservation and i will rebook you for the dates needed  Then marty will tell you that RIGHT AFTER you cancelled someone swooped in and took your dates  Sooo sorry  BUT dont worry  i have an inferior room for the SAME price  You booked a   bedroom  well  this one has one bedroom  and it costs      for   nights on AirBnB   however   its going to cost you good folks      for   nights  the cost of   bedrooms  just because i know you are in a hospital having cancer surgery and its probably incredibly inconvenient to find other more suitable accomodations with so little time now  Sigh  Marty  you little enterpriser you  Double charging for inferior accomodations is bad business  But having people cancel and then taking advantage of them is just grotesque  You should be ashamed of yourself for double charging me for an inferior room  If you were a good person you would have charged me the proper amount  especially after you made a mistake by not taking care of my reservation like we discussed  Im dying so i no longer mince words  Karma is real  The next time you get taken advantage of  i hope you think of me  May you get everything you deserve in       Marty      That we would be able to change our dates with ease  After being double charged for an inferior room  nothing was easy   Host told us he could accomodate switching our dates  but he instead had us cancel our reservation  then waited until it was booked by someone else before offering us an inferior room with one bedroom for the same price he booked us two bedrooms  When we looked up the room it was half of what he charged us  We were double charged for an inferior room   As i was having cancer surgery at the University of Chicago nearby  we had to stay near the hospital a week after   My    year old mother slept on a couch  I dont understand how Zen City is allowed to operate with such shady business tactics  If the host had not swindled us by pretending he could accomodate a date change  that he let someone else book after asking us to cancel our reservation  then offering us a one bedroom       for   nights room  but charging us      like we were still getting our   bedrooms  DOUBLE CHARGING US FOR AN INFERIOR ROOM  How is this allowed to occur  We would not have cancelled our reservation or asked to change the dates had we known Marty at Zen City would do that  If i hadnt been attached to    cords in the hospital i would have found other accomodations  but after having my torso opened up  i had no strength to fight the power  Nothing zen about zen city  I feel taken advantage of in my time of need frankly  Marty should be ashamed  there are things you dont do to the dying  Ripping them off surely has to be one of the unspoken rules 
590069736,Interior was nice and spacious  However  this apartment is directly above a bar thats open and playing music until   am on weeknights and   am weekends  If you like to go to bed in the quite or early this place is not for you   Right above a bar with loud music  Great area in town  not great above the bar
571849973,My experience was not amazing  but I am sure that yours could be  My problems with this particular listing were with security  the smartlock did not have batteries in it when I arrived and therefore was useless   There were no batteries in the apartment  otherwise I would have just resolved the issue myself  So I messaged through the app  due to it being Thanksgiving night I figured that they wouldnt be able to come out that night to fix the lock  which I understood   there was a deadbolt and I was able to safely spend the night  I took my stuff with me to work the following day since I couldnt secure it in the apartment until after they fixed my lock that day  a minor inconvenience  not something that would ruin a trip  They came on Black Friday  put batteries in and I came back to a lock that was not responsive  I attempted several times to put in the code and it would not accept it  It even set off an alarm  causing it to lock me out for five minutes from the panel and then reset and accepted the passcode that I had put in the same way every time  I messaged them and let them know about the issue  I was able to get in and secure the lock  slept  woke up  went to work and was able to lock the door behind me with the keypad  Came back from work and it was a repeat of the night before  I checked out the next morning as planned and only then did they offer to talk to me about the problem with the keypad    Additionally  they were very upfront about the fact that the building itself was still under construction but assured me that the apartment was ready to go  This was kinda true  The lock was clearly not ready to go and additionally there was a wall mount for a television  but no television  and a lamp that sat on the kitchen counter but was meant to go somewhere else because it was not near an outlet and uplugged  just chilling  There was also a water bottle filled with used paint water from when they painted  Furthermore  there was a trashcan in the closet the night I checked in  but after they came to put batteries in the lock  the trashcan mysteriously disappeared  All of these things would have been minor inconveniences and not earned a poor review from me  I am a reasonable person  But as a cumulative experience it was not great  I am sure that once they are finished with the building  it will be a nice place to stay  The bed was comfortable  there were plenty of dishes and flatware to use and space to lounge  But it was not a finished product and should not have been listed as a place to stay until it was checked for completion  I truly hope that you read and understand the comments that I submitted  I can tell that the furnishings are nice and that once the building is done this will be something that I am sure a lot of people will enjoy  I understood when I agreed to stay that the  common areas  were under construction but perhaps a quality check run should have been made to the apartment to ensure that the issues I mentioned were resolved  Particularly the lock  Best of luck in your future endeavors   While they were upfront about the building being brand new and   common areas   under construction they said that the room itself was   ready to go    A reasonable traveler would assume that the amenities listed and certainly the lock would be ready to go for someone to stay safely in their location  This was not the case  The smart lock did not even have batteries in it when I checked in   I messaged them to let them know that I was able to just walk in to the apartment and they were not able to come out  it was late on a holiday   I understood   but this should not even have been an issue to begin with  Additionally there was a lamp on the kitchen counter that was clearly meant to be placed somewhere but instead was placed on the counter not plugged in  Furthermore  the television was not in the apartment   there was the mount for it   but the television itself was not there  I understood the building itself was under construction when I agreed to stay   I did not realize however that the apartment was not truly ready   The directions to where this unit G  was located were not very clear and I spent a good ten minutes walking back and forth across the downstairs to attempt to find the location of the apartment  When I got there I was pretty positive I had to be in the wrong location because the door was already opened and not locked at all  The lock would not work and upon further inspection did not even have batteries in it  There were no batteries for me to put in the lock   otherwise I would have just fixed this issue myself  I messaged to let them know that this was an issue  There was a deadbolt that I was able to use to securely lock myself in for the night  However  when I went to work the next day I had to pack everything back up because there was no way to lock the apartment when I left   even though I was staying for a longer visit  They came the next day and put batteries in the lock   when I got back from work the lock would not accept the very long code that they had set  I tried multiple times until a little alarm went off  Then after five  minutes of waiting it let me back in  I had messaged to say there was a problem but by the time they got back to me I was able to get the lockpad to finally accept the code that I had been punching in since the beginning  The next night I had the same issue when I was coming back from work with the keypad not accepting the code   blaring the alarm   then accepting the code  even though I had put in the exact same code each time  They didnt contact me until AFTER I was gone to talk to them about the experience that I had with the lock  Even though it was a multi day issue  I understand that my trip was over the holiday weekend  but as a nurse I cannot help that I have to work on the holidays or the day after and require a place to stay  A security issue like the lock not working should have elicited a little bit more of a response  Like I said previously I understand someone not coming out at   PM on Thanksgiving night  But the future issues with the lock not working could have been looked into in a more timely fashion  Due to all of the issues with the listing   the lock not working  the unfinished nature of the apartment  the lack of timely communication about a security issue like the lock  I would say that it was not a great experience  This place had some very nice finishes where it was complete and it is obvious that this will be a nice place to stay once it is completely finished  But if the room wasnt ready  which it clearly was not as evidenced by the water bottle full of paint water in the sink  the random lamp on the counter  and the lack of a television and the lock not even having batteries in it  it should not have been advertised for a visit  Furthermore  when they came to install batteries in the lock   I was surprised to discover that they took the trashcan from the closet where it was stored  It was there the evening before and then randomly disappeared  I was happy I had taken my personal belongings with me in the morning  I am not a particularly picky person but all of this together was just a bit much  While it may be a nice place to stay in the future  it would take quite a bit to convince me to stay again when there are many other options in the area that have had seamless and pleasant experiences 
582207221,Our stay was very underwhelming  First I would like to say the customer service was great  the photos were pretty accurate  and the cost was reasonable  which is why I added a star  The frustration came on the first night when we realized we couldnt cool the apartment  The apartment has radiator heat  no central air  and the ac unit had been taken out   placed in the closet  The bedroom window was broken so we had to find a book to keep it open  still not enough air circulated  We ultimately moved the mattress into the living room and opened all of the windows  Although it helped a little  it still was not enjoyable  We were HOT every single night  Secondly  the shower had extremely low pressure once turned to  hot and we never had a hot shower  only warm water  The toilet also made loud disturbing noises through the night  Possibly a plumbing issue  Thirdly  the couch is absolutely horrible  The only television is in the living room  however dont expect to enjoy a comfortable watch in there on that couch  Lastly  if you want to actually land a decent park  you better be back around  p  maybe   Any time after that you can expect to walk a decent distance unless you want to pay for parking  After inquiring about it  I was under the impression that street parking would be less of the hassle it was  All in all the stay wasnt the worst  but it couldve been so much better  Just take notes of this review before you make a decision  Please be more honest about amenities and parking availability   No air conditioning as listed   Air conditioning  good water pressure hot water  and realistic parking expectations
580901909,This place is quiet and conveniently located in a nice neighborhood with lots of restaurants  It is relatively convenient to get to the Loop from the blue line  and a slightly longer walk to the Fulton Market neighborhood  The amenities are minimal inside the apartment  but it is safe and secure  We made due with the space  but it was pretty filthy when we got there  Most disturbing was the hair all over the bedding and towels  I am not sure whether it was an issue of where laundry is done or if the maid is not keeping an eye on her own hair while cleans  but it was very upsetting  The smell of the shower curtains was also incredibly unappealing and it was difficult to feel clean at any point during our stay  You were very responsive in your communication and we appreciated the convenience at check in  Thank you   The photos are generous as far as the cleanliness and size of the space  The space is VERY small   It was a little bit further than  steps  from shops and the metro  but still very conveniently located  It was affordable  but still a bit over priced for the lack of space and cleanliness  The water pressure in the shower was terrible  we had no control over the radiator  and the bed was very uncomfortable 
580393993,For the price you cant beat it Please fix the radiator in the bedrooms they hissed ALLLLLLLLL Night making it impossible to sleep other than that dishwasher was broke but we didnt need it  Size was a tad bit smaller than expected 
616042470,I I never received a key fob  Crumbs on counter  Had to wash dry the towels to get a wash cloth which there was only   of  Received checkout instructions after I was already gone  I came for a funeral there was so much going on i wanted to not have to think about the place im staying  I was embarrassed that i told my family to stay there   for my moms first airbnb experience to be like that  Never had a key fob for parking  I wanted my mom to get her own messages but they never added her to booking Only uses automated  Never responded to any issues Price was   times as high as my first time  Twice as high as my booking the week before with no explanation nothing going on in the city
618602674,Great place  bad neighbors  terrible host  Did not approve my change to reduce number of people staying which would have resulted in a refund  Zencity now refuses to honor this because the reservation has ended  During our stay  the permanent neighbors were very loud and the upstairs neighbors flooded their toilet which resulted in poo water literally raining from the ceiling  Zencity did not send someone to clean this up after we called to report the incident  In fact  they did not follow up at all after we reported it  The place was otherwise great  just under poor management  Overall happy with the space but very unhappy with the lack of communication on the part of your company  I am owed       for having only   people in the apartment and I will be reaching out to Airbnb about this and how the maintenance issue was handled  I requested the number of people on my reservation be changed as we had people back out  The change was never approved even though I messaged the host several times  before the stay and before the stay was over  I also messaged about safety and maintenance issues we dealt with during our stay and the host never responded 
591609228,This apartment is a decent value in nice proximity to Lincoln Square and the El  but I cant say Id recommend it  Not particularly clean and a lot of little issues with the amenities that make clear its not very well tended to  Overall its fine for a night or two  but if youre planning an extended stay in Chicago you should look elsewhere   The listing made this place seem much tidier and well put together than it was  Lots of weird issues that made it clear the apartment isn u    t very well maintained  including loose knobs in the doors  a missing piece of the sink handle  and a bit of molding for the floor that was totally loose   Communication was mostly fine  Only issue was that it took them a couple weeks to respond to my request to add an extra day to my reservation  The place is affordable  but Im still pretty confidant I could find a much better taken care of spot in the neighborhood for the same price 
590470777,The laundry is not free at all  anywhere  as the listing said that there is FREE or unfree laundry   The apartment was spotless  the only problem was that there was hair on the bed from someone before us  Unsure if it was not washed or if it did not come off from the washer  We had to wash the blanket ourselves  To be able to do laundry  you have to go to another building to do it  The card is     on top of a    fee to do the laundry in the main building  The dryers there also suck at drying  Besides that  it was clean  no concerns otherwise   Hyde Park is a somewhat decent neighborhood  Looks a bit unsafe but its decent  Its in walking distance of Whole Foods  restaurants  and gas stations   You can hear traffic next to the window at night  so if that is a concern for you  then I would not stay   The host was very nice and answered my question  Had to call twice though   ALSO parking is terrible  Absolutely terrible  If you dont show up by    youre going to be driving around the lot for a long while  There is no parking pass included for this stay  Hopefully that is something that comes about sooner or later  Parking is the most stressful thing to deal with at this place  so if you dont have patience for it  then stay somewhere that has accessible parking because even when you find a spot  its going to be a long walk in the cold   The TV has several watching options  as well as Netflix  so thats a plus   The mattress is firm  You will literally sweat ALL night with the thick blanket they provide  as well as the firm mattress which is not ideal  so bring your own comforter if you dont want to be hot and maybe lay something underneath you   Overall  it was a comfortable stay and Id recommend it if you dont mind all of the comments above   A BIT smaller than expected  Was unclear about it being a studio apartment   Called once  no answer  Called twice  answered 
586273846,There were a couple of issues with this listing that were purely cosmetic  a broken smoke detector that was never fixed though we reported it  blood stains and dirt on the comforter  and a severely clogged tub    But the dealbreaker was noise  Every morning other than Sunday and a Wednesday that fell on New Years Day during a week long stay  we were awakened by trash collection noises  dumpsters rolling over pavement  revving and beeping trucks  that began between      and      am and lasted between    minutes and an hour  This is because both sets of bedroom windows overlook the alley where trash collection  takes place  a fact not mentioned in the listing  In addition  the apartment is located directly above the buildings trash room  which dumpsters were rolled in and out of repeatedly  Though we reported this issue to the host and provided photo documentation of trash collection happening immediately below our bedroom window  they denied that trash collection was occurring     and suggested the problem was our  sensitivity to noise   Had there been mention of the alley and the trash noises in the listing  we would never have booked this Airbnb    In short  noisy  dark  and not super clean  Hosts denied the noise was a problem despite ample documentation and refused to give a partial refund for the disruption to our stay  Though the building and location are lovely  I would steer clear of this unit and perhaps ZenCity altogether  Your business model seems to be to fail to disclose crucial details about your listing  noise  and then deny there is a problem when guests complain  The reason I didnt respond to requests for further clarification about the other stuff  smoke detector  gross menstrual blood stains on a comforter  is that it was relatively nbd  but together with being awakened by truck beeping and dumpster rolling     days of our vacation  it made for a pretty shitty experience  Rest assured I will be escalating this to Airbnb and letting my many local friends  Im a native Hyde Parker  know never to rent from ZenCity   Every morning other than Sunday and a Wednesday that fell on New Year u    s day during a nearly week long stay  we were awakened by trash collection noises  dumpsters rolling over pavement  revving and beeping trucks  that began between      and      am and lasted between    minutes and an hour  This is because both sets of bedroom windows overlook the alley where trash collection  takes place u     a fact not mentioned in the listing  In addition  the apartment is located directly over the building trash space  which dumpsters were rolled in and out of repeatedly  Though we reported this to the host and provided photo documentation of trash collection happening immediately below our bedroom window  they denied that trash collection was occurring     and suggested the problem was our  u   csensitivity to noise  u   d Had there been mention of the alley and the trash noises in the listing  I would never have booked this Airbnb   In addition to the gross conditions in the bedroom and bathroom   which we might have ignored if not for the horrible morning noise   we reported a chirping smoke detector upon our arrival and were told a work order to fix it was submitted  However  the smoke detector remained dismantled and nonfunctional throughout our week long stay  Noisy  dark  and not super clean  Hosts denied the noise was a problem despite ample documentation and refused to give a partial refund for the disruption to our stay  Though the building and location are lovely  I would steer clear of this unit and perhaps ZenCity altogether 
577531086,Ive never had a problem with Airbnb before and Im sure this was a miscommunication that can be easily fixed  We were unable to get into the place  The instructions were clear and we followed them   they just didnt work  The key from the lockbox did not open the door of the house with the correct address  Not sure why  We tried multiple times and tried to get in touch with the host but it was late and cold so we never got to use the place  The pictures look great and Im sue it wouldve been a great stay if we were able to get in  Hey there  Im not sure what happened  Ive been using Airbnb since      and have never had an issue  Im sure this was a miscommunication but we were not able to get into the airbnb  We tried several times  We were able to retrieve the key from the lockbox but it was not opening  It was the right building as well  It was freezing so after    minutes of trying we gave up and went to my apartment  It was a bummer  Wish I couldve gotten in touch with you because the place looked great from the photos  Hope it can get fixed for the next person   We were unable to open and get into the accommodation   We were not able to get into the location 
563978116,WARNING  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL   Misleading description of this accommodation  This accommodation is above a pub and unbearable loud music is played till      am  We tried to sleep as we had long business days ahead of us  but the music was so loud that the floor was vibrating from the speakers and was impossible to relax or sleep   It was clear for us  we cannot stay in this apartment and be fully functional for our next business day s  Half an hour after we tried to go in the bed  around   pm  we booked another hotel  and left the apartment with our entire luggage  The other reasons we decided to leave this place was the cleanliness of the apartment   so unacceptable   the mid frame of the split window next to the oven was with a greasy black layer and full of black sponge pieces  looks like dead flies laying on it  I tried to sit on the coach before to go to the bed and watch TV  but it is an old piece of furniture  looks like collected from the street with unpleasant smell and broken springs  I could not sit more than   min before I felt the hurting pain on my bones from the broken springs  The ventilation fan on the ceiling  greasy and dirty as well  additionally was generating loud noises like tractor  which I stopped with the hope that it will reduce the noise in the apartment  The  nd bedroom door was with penetrated hole  THE BREATHING AIR IN THE APARTMENT WAS HEAVY AND STALE  I lost        CAD thanks to the hosts misleading information and in spite of proving them wrong  the host refuse to reimburse me at all  Here is the misleading description at the time of our booking that the hose word it like that     The home is just a short walk from the park and the lake and stones throw from number of bars  restaurants and entertainment venues    This   stones throw  is not the same as above the bar in one wooden ceiling distance  A child can even throw a stone at least    yards  Ironically at the time of our booking  the House rules    says   Quiet time after   pm  Please read it twice before you get burned as we did with this booking and Zencitys management company   Misleading description  nIt says       stone u    s throw from number of bars        BUT does not say that is above a bar and loud music run till     am  nIronically a rule of house    is    Quiet time after   pm   when the floor is vibrating from the pubs music underneath   The host nether responded to our request for additional person  The host did not admit the misleading and slippery description of the apartment  hide the information of loud music every night till      am and refused to reimburse me with         CAD for refusing to stay in their accommodation  Unlisted from AirBnB and save other people money and the frustration we had to go through 
562328973,Great location  close to many attractions  PLease add coffee maker  thank you   They gave inaccurate information about the number of beds and baths  The photos were not of the apartment  The messages came from different people and they did not all include accurate information  The responses were slow at times  Very slow  And there were not all the amenities in the kitchen  For example  no way to make coffee   Slow to respond  gave inaccurate information  It is owned by a company that does not put one person in charge of the listing  It was a last minute rental that must have just come open and they did not fully vet the place 
561429598,Not a good stay  We have used Air BnB frequently in the past   months  and had a really disappointing experience here  The space had glowing reviews for being clean  which we did not find to be the case  The building was shabby and had a very unpleasant smell  The heat was locked at     so we couldnt get the room to cool down making it impossible to sleep through the night  We also could not get the hot water to work  We left for a hotel after one evening   We didn u    t feel the photos accurately represented the space   The area surrounding was great but the building was not cracked up to what the description painted it to be  We paid far too much for such an unpleasant experience  We only stayed one night and ended up moving to a hotel because we were so uncomfortable in the space  Lost about      for a one night stay that was supposed to be a fun  relaxing getaway weekend 
555353754,Great location on a cute street and easy check in process  I was disappointed that the bathroom liner was moldy and that the unit had what was to me an overwhelming undesirable smell and feel of cleaning products   Unlike the picture  no shower curtain  Also coffee maker was broken   Would have been a much better value if the overwhelming smell had not been present  the bedroom had been dusted  the bathroom had a fresh liner and curtain  and the coffee maker had worked  At the price youre asking  you also might consider adding a nice touch like those snacks you mentioned in the listing  or simply something else to make the place more friendly 
554079618,This place is in an incredible location  but lacks basic comforts and wasnt very clean  The weird chemical smell reported in other reviews is definitely true and not just in the hallway  but actually inside the place  Also  someone entered the apartment on our last morning before the check out time which was a bit weird  If you are simply looking for a crash pad while exploring Chicago  its just fine  but there is nothing special about it besides the location  FYI if you do end up staying here  you can park for free about a half block away on Wood St   this house was bare bones had no supplies for cooking or general comforts  the record player was inoperable and furniture was cheap and uncomfortable  adding some more home y touches would help a lot

536412666,Zencity is picky about policies  so tread carefully and read the fine print  I wasnt able to stay at all bc of unforeseen circumstances that came up  so I had to cancel  I got a cleaning fee refund only  That is all the info I have to share and my experience with Zencity  and this location  Because of unfortunate circumstances  I would expect Zencity to be more accommodating and reasonable with resolving issues such as the one I had the day of check in  But  since I wasnt able to stay at all and had to leave bc of a member having a health emergency  I cant agree that Zencity is best at being understanding  A refund for a cleaning fee isnt enough  I expected a full refund since it wasnt my fault that this happened  But  since I got something in return  I cant say its all bad and deserves   stars   I can u    t say because I did not see the property   No parking is a big inconvenience Seems a bit expensive  the only value besides it being a nice place is the location 
536360294,If youre looking for a place thats cheap and not have high expectations then sure this is the place for it  wasnt happy with the place considering the water was shut off in the middle of my stay   Uncleaned bathroom and Im not even sure if the sheets were even switched from previous occupancy   did contact the manager about the situation and supposedly will get some credit which we will see    Should have known that something was not right with the bathroom when they had the shower covered  Well Im the middle of my stay the water was turned off and couldnt take a shower    This place needs some updating to be done   especially the bathroom   At one point I had no water in the shower  
656766909,I was not able to access the apartment from the front door because the key did not fit properly and the lock was loose  I then proceeded to speak to Zen City customer service representative  Marty  who was very cold  callus  condescending  and rude on the line    I explained the situation about not being able to get into the apartment  then he replied that we must not have been turning the key properly which is quite a jerk move to assume that adults are not able to place the key in the hole properly  and  it is very a ableist assumption    He then suggested that we go back downstairs   which the listing does not say that you must go up three flights of stairs to access the apartment  also  not ADA compliant  to look for the back up key  alas  there was no back up key when we went back to the lockboxes   As we  my friend and I  explained to Marty that there wasnt any back up key in any of the lockbox that he suggested  he accusatorially asked if we were sure that there were no key in the lockbox  He was extremely frustrating to work with     He finally suggest that we go to the back of the building to access the apartment  We couldnt figure out to get to the back of the apartment  So  while on the phone with Marty  we asked how to access the back of the apartment  in a very annoyed voice  he condescendingly told us that hes trying to help us and we need to listen to him    He explained that we needed to go through the common area of the building through the alley to access the back of the building  this is an alarming safety issue  walk up six     flight of stairs and didnt specify which back door to access  we tried the key for all of the four back doors and we were finally able to get in    Once  inside  I had asked Marty if we could get accommodated for another Airbnb that would be on another floor or another apartment  he stated  No   Then  I inquired why and he explicated thats they were fully booked  which was not true because we did not see anyone else in the building that we were in except for apartment  A  he was able to accommodate us  but refused    He then asked us for video evidence of us not getting into the apartment  we felt that he was being callus because we explicitly explained that we could not get into the front door due to the lock being not sturdy  He made us feel as if we were liars and that we were exaggerating on getting into the front door of apartment  A   Once  we were inside from the back door  we could NOT exit from the front door  a major SAFETY ISSUE just in case of a fire or other issues that could be unforeseeable   We highlighted to Marty that we could not exit the front door either  He then asked us again to send video proof of us not being able to exit the apartment  we took the video as well because we felt like he was accusing us of lying about not exiting the front door as well    It was extremely disheartening because we paid for the apartment in full and expected to have a great experience as well as good customer service without micro aggression  condescending behavior  and callus communication from the customer service representative  Marty    Moreover  the toilet was broken  but due to our very hostile conversation with Marty  the representative of Zen City  we decided that we would tell onsite maintenance staff   who were a supreme JOY  about the toilet not being functional    We were not compensated with a partial credit  we were not offered another place to accommodate us  nor did our initial concerns were rectified by Zen City    Zen City was very satisfied with taking our money and not doing anything to fix our safety concerns    Also  the apartment is extremely hot in the bedrooms  I had to purchase my own fan to not be sleeping in sweat for the days that we were there    Overall  I would suggest another apartment that is not  A with Zen City or go completely somewhere else that would have better customer service

534525784,The location is AMAZING and the space is great but our group of   found ourselves with no running water after a full day of working out and hours of walking around the city  We reached out to the host via call   times and messaged for help  We couldnt shower  drink water  or use the bathroom  We learned from neighbors that this is common for the building but had been especially bad the past month  We understand building issues are out of the hosts hands but there was never a response to the messages left  I followed up again on the Monday after the weekend trip explaining further and asking for a partial refund discount and still no response  You have a great location but communication was significantly lacking when it was needed most  I wanted to leave a good review but still didnt receive responses to my messages   Recommendations on parking  A heads up that it was on the  rd floor with no elevator would have been helpful  We were unsure of level of checkout expectations  We weren u    t sure how much to clean up and where we could toss the trash  We cleaned up what we could with the supplies we could find   When arriving i messaged for recommendations on where to park with no response  On our second day the group went to work out  walk around for   hours on a tour  and went back to shower before heading out for the evening  Only to return and find there was no running water  We couldnt shower  use the bathroom  or drink water  We called the host   times and messaged for a request for a call back  We received no response  I messaged the next day asking for a partial refund and still no response  I learned from a neighbor that this was a common issue with the building and it was usually resolved within   min to a hour but had been especially bad this last month  It is understandable that the host doesnt own the building but communication on typical timeline of resolution  apology for inconvenience  partial refund  or at minimum an acknowledgment of communication is expected  Running water and communication from the host 
530419563,Check in was standard  The rooms themselves are nice  But the bathtub was absolutely disgusting  It was full of water  the drain was clogged  and there was dirt sediment on the floor of the tub  The WiFi didnt work  At all  Multiple devices couldnt detect it  All in all  not worth the price they charged  Clean your bathtub  thats unacceptable   The WiFi did not work at all  Having a clean bathtub and working WiFi would have been nice  It made the stay very inhospitable

526344495,Hi  this is my first time giving a negative review on Airbnb     the listing said it has   queen beds and a sofa bed  after my complaint they change it   The sofa bed was NOT a sofa bed it was a regular sofa were if you are more than      or    feet you do not fit  which was our case   I asked about the possibility of getting an air mattress but did not have any answers about that so  you can imagine that having payed nearly    usd for a weekend we at least expected to be able to sleep    but I was offered an apology for the  confusion     seriously         The entrance to the building is full of spider webs and dirt  the stairs were really dirty and if you are allergic to cats you should be aware that they let some cat play on the stairs so there is also a  complicated  smell  There were also smaller spiderwebs inside the apartment    I would not recommend it at all  Definitely not worth    usd for a weekend  Definitely not what we expected   The amount of beds

523025555,First time ever I wasnt thrilled with the airbnb I booked  Location is great but we had issues finding it due to a discrepancy with the address  There was no welcome packet as the host had mentioned  Not perfectly clean  Just OK  Didnt like the feel of the place  We couldnt find the place because the address you sent was inaccurate  It is not located at    N Kingshighway Blvd  North side of town is   minutes away by car   Uber driver couldnt find the apartment because the message I received with address from host was inaccurate  The apartment is located on    Kingshighway Blvd   NOT    N Kingshighway Blvd

505615834,This location is within walking distance to the museum of Science and Industry  For many of the other attractions you would need to take Lyft or Uber  Not close to the train and although the bus is a few blocks away  its not safe to take at night   The apartment is simple  bedrooms nice size and we liked having our own bathrooms  Beds were comfortable   Some of the dish were put away dirty  and the utensils were minimal in the kitchen  however they did have a French Press   The white sofa in the living room did not look clean  and looked pretty worn   I was disappointed because we had   hosts and they were not quick to respond  Also  while we were gone  they had to shut off the water in the building and they did not tell us  We came home late at night wanting to take a shower and clean up  surprise  No water in bathrooms  and a little bit of cold water in the kitchen  The next day brown water came out of the pipes  but we eventually got it hot  and clear after we let it run a bit  Pretty disgusting  Plus it really gave us a late start the next day   This was my first Airbnb and I spent days searching and reading reviews and comparing prices  I was really looking forward to visiting Chicago and having a special trip with my daughter  Not what we were expecting  Although there were some nice things about your place  there were a few big issues we found disappointing  We liked having a washer and dryer  the beds were comfortable  bedrooms nice size and kitchen was okay  We also liked having our own bathrooms   Im glad there were only   of us  There were only   barstools  and a very small table to eat at   The kitchen had dirty dishes in the cabinet I had to wash before using  No forks  and the hands free soap dispenser in kitchen never did work  even with new batteries  What bothered me the most is the fact that the water had been turned off while we were gone one day  We came home about       pm  wanting to take showers and get cleaned up before going to bed  No water in our bathrooms  and only cold water in the kitchen   I had to email the host about it  I just gave up and went to bed  She sent me a response after I went to sleep  which woke me up  telling me there had been a leak somewhere and they had shut off the water  She told me to notify her in the morning if it wasnt back on   I had to turn the water on for awhile in AM  but it finally sputtered and eventually was hot  It was brown and disgusting coming out of the faucets  We had to run a complete washing cycle without clothes before we could run a load of laundry    This may not seem like much  but we really got a late start the next day because of all this   It was not close to any train station  The bus was not too far  but not safe to take at night  We had several locals tell us this  We spent a lot of   on Lyft And Uber   nThe reviews were not accurate about this   I was under the impression I would get a contact number of our host at check in  This did not happen  and we had to wait on email responses to questions and concerns  Very inconvenient when we didnt even have a fork to eat with in the kitchen  We had   people hosting I guess  I asked for a phone number and never got one  Although they did explain about the French press instead of a coffee maker  we had to wait quite awhile for someone to bring us forks for the kitchen  Also had to bring batteries for the soap dispenser which never did work  It said it was close and safe to use public transportation  Not close to any train  Bus unsafe at night  We spent a lot of   on Ubers  and Lyft getting around town   I specifically explained in a message before booking that we would not have a car  This was miscommunicated   It did have a nice view of Lake Michigan  Lower the price a bit since it is not close to public transportation 
503780622,The location was accurate  The host was not quick to respond  and there were not enough keys to get onto the building  I had to find an alternate way in  And the apartment was quite dirty in the kitchen and bathroom  I didnt feel totally comfortable in either of those rooms  Thankfully the floor  bed sheets  and towels were clean   There were supposed to be three keys but there were really only two  and so I had to figure out on my own how to get into the building  Had to go through back door   Only two of tree keys were available in the lockbox  There was no way for me to get in to the place based on instructions  I messaged the host and they did not message me back until after I found an alternate way to get in myself  Cleanliness  Clear instructions to enter  Working ceiling fan 
502521292,Id stay away from Zencity until their support processes get established   The instructions for getting the the rental were incorrect   The unit we rented was fine  though the AC had been turned off and it was hot as hell   but it took us an hour to find our apartment and the off hours support woman had no idea who we were and couldnt help us   Luckily we figured it out by exploring the building and found the unit we had rented  but it was a scary experience  Please do better on your instructions   Once I finally got a call from one of your employees  late Thursday night  he was also unsure of what to do   Luckily in the time we waited for support I was able to search the building and find the suite we rented   When I described the issue with the Zencity employee he told me that he saw what they had done wrong and he would make corrections   No apologies  he didnt seem very concerned about the problems we were having   AND MAKE SURE YOUR OFF HOURS SUPPORT STAFF HAS CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS AND INFORMATION ON PEOPLE WHO ARE STAYING AT YOUR PROPERTIES     The instructions that they provided were incorrect and we were not able to locate our suite   The instructions that Zencity provided were incorrect  and we were not able to find our suite   The Zencity support line was clueless and could not help us  The host was not available   They have an after hours  anything after     pm  service  but the woman we talked to was not familiar with how to help us and had no idea who to call   At one point she even told me that the address we had rented was not even listed as one of their locations  it was   For the price they are charging they need to have much better support 
501407524,Great building in great location  and a nicely laid out unit  During our stay  we experienced a bit of a fruit fly problem  though  and the air conditioner was not very effective    so Id think twice about staying here during a hot Chicago summer  But the building staff was very accommodating and the facilities  gym  lobby  were comfortable   I will say  I have misgivings about Zencitys blanket policy of discouraging families with children to stay in their units  Every posting indicates under house rules that their homes are  not suitable for children and infants   This was not our experience  we managed to bring our one year old after some frustrating back and forth with the company   Id encourage Zencity to rethink this    its a blatant example of discrimination based on family status and I find it very troubling   Advertised as   bathroom with dishwasher    neither was true   Inaccurate listing
497470868,Location is in a very nice part of town that is vibrant and up and coming  The  L  is about two blocks away and was very convenient  The amenities are modern and very accomodating  Unfortunately  during our stay the A C would not go below    F which was a big damper on our stay since it was summertime  As soon as I asked for a partial refund  the management company stopped all responses to my messages and I had to involve Airbnb to resolve the issues  Other issues is that one of the cabinets was not cleaned before our arrival and had a lot of a leftover trash from the previous guests  Theres also this running water noise at night that is quite loud if you are not a sound sleeper  Neither of these issues really bothered us  All in all  It was my first time staying at a place managed by a company and probably my last  to be honest   A  C is not effective in summer time  Room could not be cooled below    u  b F   The location is run by a management company it seems so I spoke to multiple during my stay  Most of the messages had a reasonable response time  However  my last message to the host where i asked for a partial refund was completely ignored  I had to file a dispute after our stay and based on airbnb policy  the host gets    hours to respond which they never did so i had to involve airbnb to resolve the issue 
572682151,Pros   Great location    Its located in Hyde Park with a ton of options close  Its also right next to a bus stop that can take you downtown   Home away from home   this has everything you need for a mini stay in an actual apartment  Great view from living room and bedroom plus the bed is comfy    Cons   Cleanliness   several reviewers said this place was sparkling clean but that was not the case for my stay  There was random hair around the common areas and food crud on the carpet  The microwave had food splatter in it and the fridge had leaked liquids in the bottom  There was even a used washcloth hanging on the shower pole when we arrived   All in all   this place is great to stay in  but Id definitely recommend some sort of cleaning crew in between guests to air the place out and make sure its actually clean for future stays  The location was great  The cleanliness was below sub par  I would recommend a cleaning crew between guests to make sure no used stuff is lying around from previous guests    On a smaller note   the record player was one of the reasons we chose this place  would have loved a response when I reported it broken or anytime other than an hour prior to check out  We alerted the host of broken electronics that were pictured and received no response  We never reached out again  Cleanliness  I had to buy Clorox wipes for the bathrooms  tables and appliances and wear shoes in the apt due to dirty carpet 
494575697,Decent but not great  Pictures are nicer than the actual place   Living room sofa dirty  Small lingering smell throughout    Great neighborhood though   Pictures make it look much nicer than it is  Decent but not up to par with photos  
488825132,Overall this apartment is in a pretty neutral convenient location  It is well advertised and the apartment looks exactly like the pictures  However the parking off premises is a HUGE inconvenience and can be a HUGE expense if you are leaving on and off the premises like we did  You literally have to ride around and hope to find nearby parking or you could end up blocks away   I will never stay at this location again because this was a nightmare and PURE nuisance with parking  Ive already addressed my issues with my experience at this location so I will not write them again  but the parking was insane       This description of the inconvenient parking is not clarified in full detail  I had to park insanely far distances every time I came back to the apartment complex or pay for parking in a garage down the street and walk   For the hassle and expense of parking  I think this place is NOT worth the cost
484378238,I stayed in this unit for a week  Pluses  Its in a great location  south facing with lovely views of the neighborhood  and Zencity management was terrific  check in was straightforward and my request for an additional fan was quickly met  Minuses  The apartment itself is very basic  If you picture youth hostel type furnishings  your expectations will be met  Water pressure in the kitchen is low  and hot water was in short supply when I stayed so I got used to cold showers  water is more of an issue with the age of the building than with Zencity per se   On the whole  a solid three stars out of five  Thanks for being super responsive to my requests  Check in and mgmt responses were the best Ive seen in any Airbnb host     Vintage   is a fair description  in the sense that this is an old building  I liked the building a lot and have no problem with things not being super updated  but the one issue that was consistently problematic was the water  The water pressure was low in the kitchen and bathroom  and the temperature was tepid at best  Zencity management was responsive and sympathetic  but they really couldnt do anything to fix it   Nicer furnishings with a couch that is comfortable to sit on and a second box unit AC in the bedroom would go a long way to making this a nicer place and one that is more in keeping with the price 
480878800,Photos are of a different apartment  so just know that what you see is not the same as the apartment itself  Furniture is similar though  Much fewer windows in the actual unit    Water pressure and water temperature were truly the worst part of this apartment  Either scorching hot or freezing cold  And the pressure was just ridiculous   I could spit water at a higher pressure    Only   stove burner works  no kitchen knives   Pictures are of an entirely different apartment  Similar furniture  but different  
479339807,Honestly I was immensely disappointed by this experience  I love Airbnb and have stayed at dozens of places across the US   both for work and fun  Ive never been so shocked by how horrible a place was compared to what it was advertised as and how much I paid for it  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE  There was a giant hole in the ceiling in the kitchen  Every single drawer in the entire place was peeling grossly   to the point where we wouldnt put anything in them  There were bugs in the whole apartment  Couch was different than in photos  nothing on the deck worked at all  Basically an empty shell of an apartment  Honestly the location is THE ONLY positive about this entire place  However  theyre totally wrong about free street parking   its all permit on that street from  pm  am   Couch was different than in photos  nothing on the deck worked at all  Basically an empty shell of an apartment   Communicated fine  Honestly the location is THE ONLY positive about this entire place  However  theyre totally wrong about free street parking   its all permit on that street from  pm  am  Honestly I was immensely disappointed by this experience  I love Airbnb and have stayed at dozens of places across the US   both for work and fun  Ive never been so shocked by how horrible a place was compared to what it was advertised as and how much I paid for it  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE 
478167098,The place is really well located and the apartment is really nice  They seem to coordinate with the landlord  so its nice that the door man is helpful and there an automatic check in  The bad part is that they are very slow to respond to text messages on the app and not particularly helpful on the phone  I tried checking in  but their machine didnt work because the cleaner was still in there  This was knowable and they could have warned me  Instead  no one responded to my texts and I waited in the dark for    minutes  pretty pissed off  Them the internet was broken  The cleaning lady told me this and apparently told them  They didnt care to check until I asked about it  Then they made me wait a day before even trying to fix it  It never worked during my stay  The place was nice and decoration great  But really you need to respond to text messages  Also when I called  the woman I talked to was pretty unfriendly  I would have expected am  Im sorry  Ill fix it  and instead I got an  Ill get back to you   which considering Id been texting with no response was not credible   The WiFi never worked the whole time I was there  The cleaning lady told me it was broken and told them but they didnt say a thing until I checked in  Then they told me to wait a day while rebooting the router again and again  They called the ISP on day    by which point the appointment want going to happen until the day after I left  This might have been out of their control  but given the show responses in other matters and the fact they never made this work  I am pretty disappointed   They made me wait in the lobby with no communication for    minutes  Especially given that these are professionals  they were pretty bad  I arrived early and asked if I could check in  They didnt respond for an hour and a half  which was annoying given that it was the middle of the day  but probably not the worst thing  So then I went at    as they said  and the key check it machine gave a nonsensical error  I texted several times and no response for    minutes  I called and the women in the phone wasnt particular nice  apologetic or helpful  The cleaning lady was still working and hasnt returned the key  which if someone had just told me would have been fine but instead I was in the dark  unable to get in and with no one responding  Really unprofessional  See above  Really poor at communicating  particularly when things werent bad 
477119331,Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this  Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this   Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this   Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this 
423633241,The apartment was very dirty and I had to do much of the cleaning myself  Overall the neighborhood was nice and the price was cheap  I feel that due to the condition of the house and the lack of cleanliness of the apartment  we should have the cleaning fee returned  as we did much of the cleaning ourselves  There were dirty washcloths in the bathtubs  stains and hair on the sheets and towels in the bedroom  the overall smell of the apartment was unsavory  the amount of crumbs and human nails that were found was appalling  and it seemed that the apartment hadnt been cleaned in quite a while  We were not informed of the construction that did not let us enter through the front doors and we could not find the side door access  When we saw the construction we contacted the host to get further instruction to enter the building but we had to wait in our car for a long time because the host did not answer and we did not know how to access the building 
627067457,Place had a cool view but the room itself had a weird smell the whole weekend  I messaged through the app about getting into the place and didnt get a response back  Had to call which is fine  Hot water doesnt last long  WiFi didnt work  And there is no rooftop like it said in the description at the time of writing this review  Place had a weird smell  WiFi didnt work  there was no rooftop  Didnt respond to me on the app 
465348226,Be honest  the room was spacious and beautiful  I love the room  but theres no elevator at all  I have to carry all my big luggages to the  rd floor  many stairs that huts and the building from outside looks very old even give me a hard time to find the entrance  But location was very good  Close to Lincoln park and many great restaurants and Walgreens and target and public buses to the center of downtown area  If you dont mind the stairs  it is still a very good place to stay  Dear Zencity  Thank You for making a beautiful clean room  but please do let people know that theres no elevators and be more helpful if give us a pic of the building with the entrance    Thanks  No elevator and I have to carry all my big luggages to the  rd floor   lot of stairs  That hurts  Very difficult to find the door to entry  I was stuck there over    minutes
464023993,I could write a novel here about my personal opinions about renting from Zencity and how this is      a business and not someones personal property that they take care of or have any pride of ownership in  But Ill try not to  This is simply a turn and burn facility that is looking to make money  Period  As a fellow host  I just expected much more care and cleanliness for the price    I would caution anyone deciding to stay here or any Zencity property and Ill just stick to the facts as to why          Found a dead cockroach in bedroom     Found little black hairs all over bathtub  which was eroding  and black hair in freezer     Floors wore filthy  do not walk barefoot in there     The fridge was disgusting with leftover food and what looked like fresh spilled kool aid stains everywhere    We complained  they came into the apartment while we were away WITHOUT OUR COSENT to  re clean   We returned to the same mess and kool aid stains  The only difference was now the place had a horrible smell of chemical cleaners  we couldnt breathe and had to open all windows and leave for quite a while     The water was BROWN coming out of the pipes when we initially turned on the bath water   awesome     The neighborhood is great  Whole Foods is walking distance and so is the lake    Best part about our stay was checking out   just not what we expected at all  attention to detail  cleanliness and care
620786591,The nest had a lock on it  I had to ask twice for the heater to be turned off before they finally unlocked it remotely  Someone unlocked and went into the apartment during the day  Im assuming cleaning people  and when I addressed this with Zencity  I got no reply  I left a day early due to personal reasons and once again reached out to Zencity stating that the apartment needed extra clean due to my line of work as a nurse  I was leaving the apartment    hrs before check out  cleaned surfaces I touched often with hospital grade disinfectant  and still got not a single response  My plan had always been to stay with Zencity for the duration of my time in St  Louis but the lack of communication is a huge issue along with SOMEONE HAVING ACCESS TO MY APARTMENT WHILE IM IN IT  Im very upset with how this company has treated me these last few stays  I will no longer be staying with you  Someone WALKED INTO MY APARTMENT when I addressed it with them no one responded 
463105552,During my time in this space  it worked well with my busy schedule for a weekend trip here in Chicago  Upon my arrival  I took it upon myself to look at the details of the space  Next thing I know  I see hair everywhere  On the floor  in the bed  in the shower  on the couch  Then I ran the shower and next thing you know it turns into a bath due to a hair clogged drained  The kitchenware was dirty  every single one  I had to clean anything I wanted to use  I changed the sheets that were first on the bed  just to find out the new sheets had hair in them too  The toilet had body fluids on the outside of the bowl and I knew the space hadnt been cleaned properly  There were stains on the linens and couch as well  My Overall satisfaction would increase if the space was thoroughly cleaned upon my arrival  The company tried to accommodate me by having someone to come and clean  but my stay was so short and due to my busy schedule I didnt feel comfortable leaving my belongings unattended for someone to come and clean  I was very disappointed with the cleanliness of this space during my stay because I actually unpacked hair on all of my clothes in my suitcase   During my time in this space  it worked well with my busy schedule  but my overall satisfaction would increase if the space was thoroughly cleaned upon my arrival  I was very disappointed with the cleanliness of this space   Not as clean as pictured  Stained linens and couch cushions   Thoroughly cleaned space  Simple Snacks and or bottled water for guest s  especially on weekends when the price increases  Guide of some sort for out of state guests to get an idea of what and where things are in the city 
460562388,Excellent communication throughout this stay and a very clean and well stocked apartment  It would be nice to know how much of the building we are allowed to access  such as the pool and gym  It would have also been nice if the A C actually worked and didnt just blow hot air  For that reason  we didnt sleep well in    degrees and that being the main point of an Airbnb  that is the reason for such a less than satisfactory review   If they fix this  which may be a recurring problem in this very old building  but interior renovated  the stay would have been great  Thank you for excellent communication throughout this stay  It would be nice to know how much of the building we are allowed to access  such as the pool and gym  It would have also been nice if the A C actually worked and didnt just blow hot air  For that reason  we didnt sleep well and that being the main point of an Airbnb  that is the reason for such a less than satisfactory review   A  C did not work  Less fees
460238714,The location was really nice and I loved hearing all the birds sing and seeing the leaves through the windows  There was lots of light in the apartment and many restaurants  shops  a Whole Foods and train station  nearby  A new sofa and rug is definitely in order  The bed linens were really nice and fresh and so were the towels  The extra blanket was stained unfortunately  The coffee maker and stove were dirty  Zencity was excellent in responding so politely and quickly to all messages  This feels like a place harkening back to college days  Only if you are okay with a little uncleanliness and get the very cheap rate would I recommend  The location was really nice and I loved hearing all the birds sing and seeing the leaves through the windows  There was lots of light and many amenities nearby  A new sofa and rug is definitely in order  The bed linens were really nice and fresh and so were the towels  The extra blanket was stained unfortunately  Thank you for responding so politely and quickly to all messages   Photos made the place look cleaner   A much cheaper rate  We paid the higher weekend rate 
457203751,Good communication  Check in easy enough  Small place  smaller than looks in the pictures   Wifi spotty  temp and water at all in the bathroom didnt work most of the time  Have an alternate place to shower if hygiene is important to you  Didnt think it was a good value for airbnb and suffocating for two or more people  said it all in my description  wasnt the best experience  sure a lot is not your fault but still disappointed overall   was definitely smaller than i expected  smallest bathroom i have ever seen in my life    X     feet  kitchen crazy small too  overall  just a lot smaller than i expected   borderline suffocating  nice photography but misleading to me about what the apartment was actually like   n nthe bathroom shower was lukewarm and the water either trickled or didnt work at all in the bathroom two of the days  i know this is a building problem  but was horrendous  couldnt shower two of the mornings i was there   the parking situation was awful  the website would not come up that was listed and parking cost about     a day and we had to walk a bit to get there  takes away any value of the stay  also  wasnt overly happy with the location  cost more than about any other airbnb ive stayed at and the worst overall experience  it was okay  but definitely wont stay here the next time im in st  louis 
452117610,The apartment was clean and the communication from the folks at zencity was quick  However  be prepared to pay     night to park in a hospital garage in walking distance  Bring your own coffee maker  there is a French press but no electric kettle   hdmi cord  to hook up a device if you want to watch anything else thats not on Netflix    and maybe some ear plugs for the AC unit  its very loud   The noise from the ambulances arriving at the hospitals is very loud as well and woke us up a few times   It would have been nice to have some extra homey touches that most air bnb ers expect  At the end of the day  the price per night  plus parking  does not reflect the true value of the stay  The communication from zencity staff was great but we were not impressed with what was provided for the value   The parking situation was not explicitly explained and we ended up spending more money than we had planned for this trip      extra   The place would have been a four star value if there were some extra amenities available  For example  a coffee maker  we had to bring ours from Memphis   an hdmi cord  we couldnt access amazon to watch or purchase what we wanted to watch and couldnt hook up our computer to the tv   and included parking  I have to imagine the tenants at the apartment complex dont pay for      night for parking  there must be a solution to this for Zencity guests  Especially at      night 
566246496,Unfortunately  I cant comment on the space  since I was not able to access the loft   I arrived and followed self check in instructions  but found no key in the lock box   I tried for over an hour to reach the host  via phone  supposed    hour urgent response line  and airbnb message  but after receiving no response  I ultimately had to make other plans  it was getting late  I had to be ready for early meetings    Hopefully  this was just a mistake on their part  but the communication went from great before my arrival to very slow and incomplete after things went wrong   I had to scramble to find alternative accommodations and am still working on getting a refund   I can say that the location seems to be convenient  near the convention center and restaurants    Please process refund grievance   No idea  aside from the lack of key where there should have been one   I can really only rate the check in here  since I wasnt able to access the apartment and  due to the late hour and a full schedule for the rest of my stay  moved to other accommodations after waiting more than an hour for a response to multiple messages by phone and over airbnb   Prior to this  the communication had been good  so I was surprised when I arrived to find no key in the lock box and no immediate response to my calls texts  The communication was great before my trip   However  this broke down when things started to go wrong with check in   I called the host phone number  and got to an automated messaging system   The system was strange  because it went back to the main menu once no matter which number option you pressed   Once I figured out that you have to go through the full system twice  I left two messages on the  urgent     hour message response system  and one on the regular help line hoping for a response   At the same time  I wrote to them via the airbnb messaging system   I arrived at   pm  and waited in the lobby until     before starting to look for a safe walking distance alternative place to stay   I stayed in the lobby for an additional     minutes doing this  while hoping to hear back from zencity   After moving on to a hotel so that I could use the facilities and get some sleep before early meetings  someone did finally reach out with an alternative code  via airbnb   they never called me back   but I had already gone to bed   So far    days after check in  I have only received one follow up message  telling me to cancel   Other requests for compensation have not be answered  nor has my grievance received a response  Would have been great  So far       for a very stressful  not at all zen  arrival for my first visit to St  Louis is not a good value   If the place is as advertised  would be great 
366898165,Comfort  Overall  I enjoy the Zencity experience  I think that this listing was poorly prepared for  but with some more attention in the cleaning department  this could have been a great experience   The internet settings listed on the wall did not match the internet settings located on the back of the television in the unit  causing minor confusion   I had questions for the host that went unanswered for days before being responded to  I attempted calling twice  and left messages  but was never responded to  Attention to detail from the cleaning staff  and the carpet extremely fuzzy and caught onto clothing  
422968996,solid place  maybe it was an anomaly  but from the moment I arrived I found hair      everywhere  on the table  in both bathrooms  in both showers  and unfortunately in my food that I cooked   Great kitchen imo   I wish I could have given   stars   my feedback for airbnb is that the way the review system works  I was hesitant to say anything during my stay because I was afraid they would try to nitpick me and say something negative   I left the place cleaner than when I arrived   which is not unusual for me   As for the location   I am happy with the Hyde Park area and the street its on is very safe   Parking can be tricky so I found a spot and did not leave for the    days I was there  sorry to say but there was just way too much hair every where on the table  in both showers on the ground in the bathroom in my food bummer because its a solid place also i would have described the keys differently small silver  large silver  gold   keys  small silver  large silver  gold keys the numbers on the keys were wearing off
555578085,Host not very responsive  WiFi wasnt working during the whole stay and there were no attempts to fix it from the host side  Clean  nice looking place  but if youre coming for business where you need internet consistently  probably best to pick somewhere else   WiFi did not work and host did not want to work to resolve the issues with it   If I didnt have to go to other places for wifi 
347130369,Dont expect reliable cleanliness or good customer service  Ive never had this situation in any other air bnb  but it makes me doubt the reliability   references to cleanliness  check in was fine My host was not helpful and instead was defensive when I said I was having a problem with the cleanliness of the rental   He offered no solution 
345235419,The kitchen is well equipped and Netflix is a nice touch  However  the missing bathroom door and less than desirable condition of the hallway was disappointing  The place itself is not bad if the bathroom door was installed  hole in bathroom floor fixed  and hallways maintained  The kitchen is well equipped and Netflix is a nice touch   Missing bathroom door   The keys were not labeled correctly  they were not as the instructions said  The pictures are deceiving  the missing bathroom door  the hole in the bathroom floor and dirty hallways made the visit less than ideal  The pictures look amazing and once you enter the building and get to the tiny little elevator and dirty hallway I was tempted to go back to a hotel  I understand the hallway and elevator are common areas but guests should be notified about their condition 
338098771,Theres nothing wrong with the place  per se  Though the check in is confusing and should be updated  and though parking is problematic  it was an OK experience overall  Nothing to outright complain about  However  heres the deal  When I book through AirBnB Im looking for some combination of superior experience  lower price  or the personal touch compared just getting an inexpensive hotel room down the road  This had none of these and was essentially a flop house with a  nice enough but nothing special  room  It certainly doesnt live up to the adjectives  vintage    boutique   or  renovated   The building itself is simply old and the room is on par with a contemporary dorm room at a small moderately funded liberal arts college  For         I would take the Hyatt and a free breakfast if I had to do it again  But     if you find yourself up the creek without a paddle in Hyde Park on a Wednesday night with a flight to catch in the morning  you will eventually get in the building  the room is clean  the bed was comfortable  and the ammenities were as advertized  I just recommend a less glitzy description   I would say there is little vintage of boutique about the arrangements  Those words conjure up quite a different sort of place   We couldnt access the photos and it took forever to find the key to get in  The instructions were OK up to  follow the side of the building until you come to a lockbox   It Would be better if you said   On the far end of the building  past the back entry is an alcove with a lockbox  or some such thing  The note regarding paper thin walls and floors was quite a bit off putting  again  unless it was advertized   Not for what you get in the room 
335990209,They manage many units so expect confusion and auto responses  And apparently key sets work for multiple units because arriving tenants were able to unlock our unit waking us up at  am  Not safe    Having multiple keys that access any unit is a safety hazard  We were mortified to have arriving tenants able to open our unit waking us up at  am  Thats really unacceptable   We were given pre arrival instructions to access a unit that was already occupied   The instructions lead to a key lockbox that already had the code dialed in and had no keys in it  We called and were given a new code for a different lockbox with keys for a different unit but found out that new unit was double boomed when the other tenants unlocked our door waking us up at  am leading us to understand that all of the keys work for any of the units which is most certainly a safety hazard  Responses seem mostly auto generated 
335576056,Wouldnt recommend this place  building is in good location  but the entrance and hallways are extremely old  dirty and uncomfortable  I chose this listing because of their location and amenities for my bussiness trip  there was no working internet connection  there for no working TV and the AC was broken  my first two days when the weather was warm  were unbearable inside the apartment   Slow response from the host  and when i called twice to complain  the person that was supposed to come over to fix the AC never showed up  I would never stay there again   There was no working internet connection   since this was a business trip  that was a major inconvenience  therefore there was no TV  and the AC wasnt working  and the firat   days  since the weather was warm  it was unbearable inside the apartment  The building hall is filthy and uncomfortable   The location was good  The building is extremely old and dirty  The unit itself is really old too  the furniture is nice  but in my experience the lack of advertised amenities made my stay really uncomfortable  Would not recommend   by far the worst experienceso far on Air BnB
332195580,the price is not matching the appartment  i paid too much  the photos made a good impression but the appartment is old and dusty  besides that its noisy  we left after only    min and i camcelled the booking  i also never got any response from Zenciry  definitly not recommandable   the appartment isnt luxurious or similar at all  the photos look much better then in real  its a tiny  noisy n dusty place  definitly no villa  as written at the entrance door  the price is way too much for what you get   checkin was easy and ok he never respondee nice neighbourhod but the building is very old and therefor noisy and dirty  too expensive  i paid over     dollar for   nights and expected a higher quality n comfort for that amount  the place is never worth that money 
331759351,Is really close to museums and planetariums Wasnt able to connect to the wifi  Didnt matter to us as we didnt need it  but it could be a problem for other people  Didnt really answer our questions  Had his own autoresponse for our enquires 
316631996,Beware of this listing  The shower did not work and the host did not come by or send anyone to check the problem  The host has continued to maintain falsehoods and misrepresentations about this event in email communications   The shower did not function  It produced either ice cold water from the city or boiling water from the buildings boiler  There was no mixing and no way to take a shower   The worst part of this experience was that the host did not respond to my complaint and that I had no way of contacting him except through once a day AIRBNB emails  The host did not come by or send anyone to check out my complaint  AIRBNB has also been unresponsive and resistant to my request for a     discount for my payment  A lodging with a non working shower and an irresponsible  elusive host is not a good value 
309110351,Positives  good location  size and space  natural lighting  bed linen and towels  Netflix   Negatives   dirty place with hair in bathrooms  dirty dishes in dishwasher  water filter in fridge overdue for replacement by    days  dead insects on floor  stains on stairs  broken slats of beds   You need to have a thorough audit of the property to do the needed repairs and maintenance  And also improve cleanliness  Also I suggest when there are problems you should call back rather than continuing to communicate via email   You need to have a thorough audit of the property to do the needed repairs  And also improve cleanliness  Also I suggest when there are problems you should call back rather than continuing to communicate via email    Host said cleaning was done when clearly there wasn u    t or at least no inspection or it was really poor quality   Since we had issues with the house I would have expected them to return call but instead communication was always through inbox  On the two occasions I called it was an answering service who had to ask for a lot of personal info which they should already know through the Airbnb site  I expected better cleanliness and quality for a super host 
305706460,     Plug in bathroom didnt work  Could have provided a parking pass 
305088132,This spot is fairly far from downtown and any L stops  But it is a cute spot in a lovely neighborhood  The space is NOT adequate for summer months due to issue with the electrical circuitry that the window AC unit is plugged into  But  it would likely be ok for cooler months  We had to move to another AirBNB due to this issue and had a lot of difficulty addressing this issue with the host    Photos of the space made it look better than it is  Space was fine  but shoddily put together and clearly needed better investment  Space has poor electrical circuitry than causes the kitchen light to be on when the AC window unit is on and you cannot turn off that light without turning off the AC    Hosts were difficult to communicate with and fairly unresponsive to our issue   Difficult to reach quick public transportation to downtown   This is a fine enough place for cooler months  but inadequate for the summer  
303600997,Slightly disappointed in this place which I really wanted to love  I have to agree with the other review that said that the communication is impersonal  as it seems you are dealing with an agency rather then an owner   There is absolutely no flexibility with early check in  we wanted to arrive at      and check in was    they were not able to do that  or late check out  even if there is no one coming in the next day  There is no help in storing luggage past check out time  On arrival there was a strong smell in the back room which seemed strange  As we stayed longer I also found bottle caps on the kitchen floor and a hair brush under the bed  It seems as though cleaning was done in a rush and no one thought to check  There was only one roll of toilet paper in the bathroom  and we bought more  A few days later I found some in a mechanical cleaning closet  but Im not sure as to why this wouldnt be stocked in the bathroom cabinet  There were four adults staying here and only one head sized mirror in the bathroom  makes it hard for more than one person to get ready at a time  We ended up buying a cheap full sized mirror to help us get ready for     Im not sure why this hasnt been done already  Again  the wifi only works in the back area of the house and is very hard to get connection in the lounge room and front bedroom  The location is a plus  very safe and lots of great cafes and bars around  The apartment itself is nice and laid out well  I wish that the communication with the host agency had of been better  it felt like you were just another number like at a hotel  I would be hesitant to rent with an agency based air bnb again following this experience    The living area looks a lot bigger than what it is   u   cqueen beds u   d one is very small I would think it is more likely a double bed  WiFi only works in certain parts of the house 
292262127,This place is very clean and functional but it IS NOT what it looks like in the pictures  Theres no washer and dryer  no marble counter tops  no tv in the bedroom  no luxury amenities as shown in the listing   Check in was very long  We didnt receive keys until   hours after checking in  This was my first airbnb so this wasnt a great experience   The record player  fresh sheets  towels  and comforters were a huge plus but I wouldnt book here again   This listing is NOT as described  The unit looks nothing like the pictures    The concierge did not have keys to give us upon arrival  It took   hours for us to receive keys  Host evaded the fact that the pictures that were shown did not match the actual unit  
276369295,Ill start off with the good  Apartment is in a good neighborhood  easy to locate and we found free street parking  For the most part  the size and cleanliness of the apartment were a      but when we went to use the glasses in the kitchen they were dirty   Apartment is small  but works for   people  The bad  the furniture  and there isnt much  was outrageously uncomfortable  The futon  had to have been an IKEA family special and in my opinion  needs to be replaced with an actual sofa as you feel every spring  This apartment does not have AC  but one window unit in the living room  When we arrive  on a    degree day  the unit has not been turned on  so the apartment was very warm  It finally cooled down as we left the following morning  All in all  apartment was ok  but would be great with a few changes  That futon has to go    It is so uncomfortable  In addition  the AC wasnt on when we arrive and it was very warm  Took hours to cool down   Lastly  glassware was put in cabinets dirty     Other than those few things  great location and good place    u   cWhile the photos represent the apartment  they can u    t possible represent the uncomfortably of the furniture   u   d   Cute neighborhood     Apartment is pretty barebones  No coffee for coffee pot  window AC unit in living room only  small  extremely uncomfortable  IKEA futon  Thank goodness we only stayed one night

159769196,If we could rate this half a star  we would due to multiple issues we had with our stay at Chriss residence  as well as the service with Chris as a host  The only positive is the neighborhood     The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price        per night   The building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that its in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator and freezer  as well as faulty hardware in the bathroom  We also noticed that the dishware was not properly cleaned and had yellow caked on residue from previous usage    Chris was extremely unprofessional  and needed to visit the residence multiple times during our stay which really made us feel uncomfortable  and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays  let alone hotel stays for comparable price points  There was a showing of the space scheduled during our stay  which was completely unacceptable  Chris also needed to retrieve a garment for a  supposedly  previous guest while we were staying  which also made no sense to us  Why couldnt these things be handled after our stay was finished     Furthermore  we had booked a stay at one of Chriss other listings which we had to unfortunately cancel due to a change of schedule in our business trip  The fact he was unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at the other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didnt settle well with us  Especially since we had booked a longer stay at his other listing    All in all  we are completely unsatisfied with Chris as a host  and even though the Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area  we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing    Unfortunately  we wont be able to provide you with a five star review due to multiple issues we had with our stay in your residence  as well as the service with you as a host     The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price  The building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that its in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator and freezer  as well as faulty hardware in the bathroom  We also noticed that the dishware was not properly cleaned and had yellow caked on residue from previous usage    We mentioned this to you during our stay  but the unprofessionalism of constantly needing to visit the residence during our stay really made us feel uncomfortable  and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays  let alone hotel stays for comparable price points  The need for you to schedule a showing of the space during our stay is completely unacceptable  And the need to retrieve a garment for a  supposedly  previous guest while we were staying there makes no sense to us  Why couldnt these things be handled after our stay was finished     Furthermore  the fact that you were unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at your other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didnt settle well with us  Frankly  it pissed us off  and we would have much rather have canceled the second reservation if we knew we wouldnt incur this ridiculous fee again  Especially since we had booked a longer stay at your other listing  You have every opportunity to refund this charge  AirBnB doesnt hold you to this  Weve already sent a refund request  yet we see that you are much more interested in taking advantage of funds from potential guests     All in all  we are completely unsatisfied with you as a host  and even though your Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area  we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  Additional comments   u   cThe building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that it u    s in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did   u   d    The retrieval of the keys was communicated very well  and it was easy to get into the building  however the elevator was broken and this was not communicated with us     Although in a great neighborhood  the apartment was overpriced and not of value  For the same price of the stay  we could have stayed in a hotel with clean linens  and an overall higher quality environment  
155112720,The apartment is located in a great location  I was able to walk to everything downtown  There were also a lot of good restaurants within blocks of the apartment  The apartment itself was charming and had plenty of space for   people  The WiFi and Netflix worked great  The only negatives of the apartment were the lack of some amenities such as wash clothes  dish towels  One of the bathrooms was very dirty  but luckily there are two and the other was cleaner    Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  
153995454,The location is great  but that was the best part about this place  Everything else was just ok  Lighting in the apartment was poor  No bedside tables  towels thrown in a pile in the closet  a fire alarm that kept beeping  being expected to be out of the apartment during specific times so that the property could be shown were all downfalls of this place   Major issues attempting to get keys out of the lockbox during check in   I dont think expecting us to be out of a place we are paying for so that the property can be shown is poor business   We felt like we had to be out of the property on Saturday Bc of the showing  and your email regarding it made it feel that way too   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  listing description  amenities  Additional comments   u   cNothing stated that its on the  th floor with no elevator  Fire alarm kept chirping  Towels in bathroom  second set of towels were just thrown in a pile in the closet  Questions cleanliness   u   d   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   Couldnt get the keys out of the lock box  Took us almost    minutes to do so  Ended up cutting my hand trying to get lock box to work  
150256451,Chris is great getting back to you and coordinating keys pick up  The area is one of the best of Chicago  The apartment was not very clean  sticky stain on kitchen floor and general dust   The feel of the apartment is like a motel  That is  you can tell that no one lives there permanently as the furniture is bit odd  the layout of the apartment is odd as well   Bottom line  it comes down to pricing  if you are getting a significant discount over hotel rates  then it is worth staying here for what you get     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos    Chris is great getting back to you and coordinating keys pick up  The area is one of the best of Chicago  The apartment was not very clean  sticky stain on kitchen floor and general dust   The feel of the apartment is like a motel  That is  you can tell t 
96588694,The Bad   Not clean  We had to clean up other peoples hair in the bathroom before we could use it  we were grossed out  There was hair and pee stains on the sheets  The walls  cabinets  and doors throughout are grimy with dirt and little spills here and there  I dont know how we can be charged a cleaning fee if it wasnt even cleaned for us  The Wifi doesnt work and it looks like other guests report the same  The location is right above a bar that plays music until  am  we didnt sleep much  We couldnt enjoy the views because there was construction going on which woke us up very early       The Good   Great location  There is a parking garage right across the street which was very convenient for our rental car  which you dont need  at all  parking is expensive  too   Divvy bikes were very accessible  right next to michigan avenue and all the restaurants and shops  Check in and out was fairly easy   The unit was larger than we expected    Would be nice to know theres construction going on so all the windows are blocked  Also  to know this is above a bar that plays music until  am ans that the walls are paper thin    Once you sent the written instructions  everything was good  I dont think there should ever be a youtube video  written instructions are the most accessible  especially if you dont have cell phone service   Good communication during check in but would have liked a response back to the message we sent after checking out   This is the most expensive weve ever paid for an airbnb and it was the dirtiest unit weve had  With the added cleaning fee  wed expect it to be clean for us  
94139776,Chris was very responsive and try to accommodate to my request the best he could  The building is in a prime location in Chicago   Note it is an old building and currently there is construction so the view from the windows are blocked with wood protection barriers   There is a faulty smell in the common areas of the building   The apartment is as described except for the bathroom  It could be cleaner and have better amenities   The building is old and right now the facade is under construction  There is a very bad smell in the common areas of the building    This is a great location in downtown Chicago   However  there are a lot of homeless people around and people smoking outside the building   When I arrive  almost at midnight  there were four people outside the building door which made me uncomfortable   It is a busy street  with restaurants and bars around   I do not feel very safe particularly at night  This is an expensive place  I believe due to the prime location in Chicago   However  I would expect a better living space   I recognize the building is old and Chris seems to be working on improving the apartment  but for the price  I would say it is less than I expected 
91424776,My trip to Chicago with my girlfriend was amazing  no thanks to Chriss apartment  All the great reviews  made picking Chriss apartment an easy decision  However  my girlfriend and I experienced nothing but issues  We had difficulty checking in  There was confusion over which unit we were in and both units were dirty  We were never provided clean sheets or towels in the three nights we stayed at Chriss apartment  The sheets were covered in little hairs and smelled bad  The towels were damp and smelled worse than the sheets  The floors were dirty and half the light bulbs did not work  Chris stated he would provide a gift card to a local restaurant for the check in ordeal  but a gift card was never provided  After check out Chris stated he would issue a     refund for the awful hospitality  but the refund was never issued  Airbnb did take it upon themselves to issue a one night refund due to the check in issues we faced  Chris did not even call to express his apologies   To future renters    bring your own towels and sheets     The kitchen and bathroom did not match the pictures in the listing  Please let me know if pictures are needed to confirm   Instructions provided for check in were inaccurate  Lock box combination provided did not open the lock box  When correct combination was provided  keys were not in the lock box  After calling several times and waiting over    minutes after our check in time  the keys were placed in the lock box by the people previously renting the apartment  Once we go to the room  the place was not cleaned  After speaking with Paul  Chriss assistance   he indicated we were given instructions to the wrong apartment  Instructions stated  th floor  but we were supposed to be on the  nd  Regardless  both units were uncleaned upon arrival   Paul was extremely helpful and understanding of our ordeal  however  it seemed like Chris did not care  He indicated he would provide a local restaurant gift card to compensate for the issues we faced at check in  Gift card was not provided  After check out  Chris stated he would issue a     refund  refund was not provided   The location was great  Close to everything we wanted to do  I had a terrible experience staying at Chriss apartment  Based on all the great reviews  I thought staying here was a no brainer  I was wrong  I had issues with checking in  Both units I was directed to were dirty  I was never provided clean towels or sheets  Several of the light bulbs were out  the refrigerator seemed to be dipping coolant  my white socks turned black within minutes of walking on the carpet  and the pictures of the kitchen and bathroom provided on the site did not match the unit I stayed in   Chris assured me he would provide a gift card to a local restaurant for the issues faced at check in  Gift card was never provided  Chris then stated he would provide a     refund for the issues with my stay  another promise broken  To future renters of Chriss apartment  please bring your own towels and sheets to be safe  If you forget  there are plenty of nearby stores to buy some 
618137059,Poor service  poor communication  dirty towels  horrible customer service  I think our experience warrants a discount and refund of partial funds for our stay  It was terrible  Late  Not told the place was ready until we arrived to pick up keys  Then lied to and told the cleaner was in route the clean   After waiting    minutes the cleaner had still not arrived  Following thru on the promises you make customers 
710264371,Parking was difficult at this particular location  But definitely safe an close to restaurants an the hospital 
615844503,The place was clean  comfortable  and conveniently located  Check in was easy  The only downside was that I was confused about how to access the gym and never got clarification from the host  This appears to be a big airbnb business  so might be a little less responsive to your needs than something run in a more personal way   I was never told how to access the onsite gym  I didnt know where it was or how to access it   The host was slow to respond about some issues and never responded about how to access the gym  In addition  the written information provided in the unit was general  describing how to use the heating ac system in any unit  The unit was very hot and It took me a while to find the heating control because it was in my mother in laws room 
403751562,Nice place little tight in space wise when in came to bathroom and bedroom space
668706993,There were multiple problems with the place and the host was either unresponsive or slow to respond 
624425202,Check in was difficult  the key access code given to us didnt work so after calling customer service we were given a backup key that didnt actually work  We were only able to get into our room because the door was just unlocked and because the key didnt work we could lock the door when we left  After a few phone calls with zencity  I was told someone should be at our room by   to deal with the issue but nobody came by until the next day  The place was clean and it looked just like the pictures though  Customer service was always very polite but it should be made sure that someone is able to get their keys when they arrive  There was no key available for us so we were given a replacement which didnt work and we were unable to lock the room when we left because of that 
613359193,Floor looks not cleaned for long long time  liquid spill markings in number of places over the laminated floor areas  white chalk like powder by the basebords  totally dirty all over the appartment  carpet in bedrooms not vaccumed  old spilled liquid residues in the fridge  glass or coffee cup rings on the countertop  old toothpaste markings on the bathroom sink area  dirty kitchen sink area  dirty utensils  Not sure if I want to stay in any units by Zencity  bc of the ignorance  I wrote a message to the host describing in details all cleaning issues troughout the appartment  received response that are sorry that the  cleaning crew missed few spots   The  few spots  is      sq ft area     I was asked to send pictures  which I did  but never received response  Clean place  Owner had a chance to send a cleaning crew and offer to clean it  Never offered to do so 
647413507,The toilet seats are old and filthy need to be replaced  Also  the unit was way too cold for the duration of our stay  Messages asking for the code to adjust the thermostat were completely ignored by the host  Never received a response to my message asking for the thermostat code  It was way too cold in the unit and you never had the decency to even respond to my message  Hopefully enough negative reviews put you in your place   Still haven u    t received a response asking for the thermostat code to adjust the AC  Entire stay was way too cold   Never responded to my message

621749970,Okay stay
624310809,Good luck we paid for a   night stay and were given wrong code to smartlock so couldnt even get in and had to find another place to stay at the last minute  When someone pays to stay in your units and they never even get in the door because the smartlock code doesnt work is beyond unacceptable especially when it costs even more money to find a different place to stay last minute since your host never resolved issue to get us into the rental   Not to mention still havent received response to getting refund  or even an apology   The code for smartlock was incorrect   Never even got access to the rental since the code for smartlock didnt work and never got help to rectify the situation from host  Paid for a   night stay we were never able to use  Being able to actually use and access the rented unit

619220055,I dont know where to start  I walked in the door  eyes heavy  legs stiff  with hopes of going straight to bed  However I choose my room  put down my bags  walk over to the bed  and I saw the most despicable thing on what was supposed to be a freshly made bed    A HAIR  I begin to inspect the rest of the room  long story short there were chips crumbs in the carpet  Also hair all over the rest of the bed  and might I add all the hair was a different color and texture  There was piss all over the bathroom floor  so I guess you could say this pissed me off  I made my boyfriend clean it up  he then got pissed off with me   While he cleaned the forsaken piss  I proceeded to inspect the rest of the apartment  I walk in the living room and youll never guess what I discovered   A HAIR  I also found more of what I presumed to be Doritos from the bed and dust bunnies  Luckily I found a candle under the sink to take away the OVERPOWERING miasma of what I believe to be marijuana   Needless to say the cleanliness of your establishment is why I declare this apartment highly inadequate  Signed  A Mad Black Woman   Her Pissed Off Mixed Boyfriend N A See cleanliness review above

620048275,Great location and stylish loft  Host was the disappointment  I had several issues no key fob to enter building after a certain time  a leak in the bedroom  etc and the host stopped responding to me  Your location was beautiful and well styled  I was very disappointed in the communication with whomever was hosting they just didnt care about my needs  There was no key fob which prevented me from leaving my air bnb after    I came to visit family and this severely impacted my time to connect  Also  there was a leak in my room over the bed since it was raining  I reached out to the host and they stop responding to me  
640605471,The issues began when we arrived and the checkin information was not only incorrect  but the key to our apartment was missing  As per our previous correspondence there were several issues with cleanliness when we arrived  The TV and internet also did not work  Hello  I am writing to request a     refund for my stay with you from Saturday the   th to Monday the   th  The issues began when we arrived and the checkin information was not only incorrect  but the key to our apartment was missing  As per our previous correspondence there were several issues with cleanliness when we arrived  The TV and internet also did not work which I assume was because there was no Eero in our apartment  I would be happy to further discuss these issues and provide more photos if necessary 
618603052,Zencitys booking process and communication were great  however  the cleanliness of this unit and building left a lot to be desired  Should be clean   no excuses Needs trashcan in the bathroom Lighting is very dim  hard for a female to get ready Not enough towels for   people for   days

627669491,The apartment is clean  and the view from the living room is immaculate at night  its close to the lake and a park and for the price its not bad   the couch is broke and the wi fi cuts in and out sometimes   And if your not from Chicago a couple blocks away your in the hood   You guys know the couch is broke and you try to just fix it   thats unacceptable  You should go and fix that ASAP considering thats really the only place you can actually be comfortable and watch TV since its only   in the whole apartment   Dont treat me like just money actually care about peoples experience Should of mentioned that this was near unsafe areas A couch that wasnt broken  real mattress on bed in one of the rooms 
619154004,Price  location and size of unit are great   Noisy tenants above unit though late at night  The price  location and size of unit were great   I would add a couple of comfortable chairs in living room and speak to neighbors above   Quiet time after    pm  Needed to call after not receiving an email and waited a couple of days  There really wasnt a bunch of furniture in the living room to hang for a bit   Also the upstairs neighbors were very loud with music and noise after   pm until wee hours 
636931536,Looked better online than in person  Before we even entered the building we had issues with parking  The directions from the company left out important details  The garage they instructed us to use was only open certain hours and when we arrived it was closed  There was an alternative entrance to the garage that we had found out about later  after we talked to someone who lived in the building  First thing we noticed when we walked in to the apartment was the smell of trash that did not go away our whole stay  The smell lingered throughout the whole apartment  Even after spraying a room refresher the smell did not go away    Second when we put our things down we saw what looked like pizza sauce on the table and we found a parking ticket from the previous month  Which iwas the first indication of the place not being cleaned prior to our arrival  Next while checking the beds for bedbugs we notice there were crumbs and hair on the sheets which means the sheets were not washed  Then we noticed the floors and rugs throughout the apartment also looked like they havent been vacuumed in awhile  There were other minor indicators of the place not being cleaned but these were the main ones  They pride themselves on keeping the property upto hotel standards but it was far from that    To top it off  after all of that  we couldnt even watch TV because it said too many people were using the account  They dont have regular TV they have Roku TV and I assume they use the same account for other rentals    Personal notes   We found the beds were way too stiff for our liking  We preferred sleeping on the couch    The curtains kept no light out so dont expect to sleep in    We noticed a monitoring device under the island  To us it was not that big of a deal but it would have been nice to know about   We were really looking forward to this place and saw all the great reviews  but I unfortunately we were extremely disappointed and would not recommend  The review well be leaving  Looked better online than in person  Before we even entered the building we had issues with parking  The directions from the company left out important details  The garage they instructed us to use was only open certain hours and when we arrived it was closed  There was an alternative entrance to the garage that we had found out about later  after we talked to someone who lived in the building  First thing we noticed when we walked in to the apartment was the smell of trash that did not go away our whole stay  The smell lingered throughout the whole apartment  Even after spraying a room refresher the smell did not go away    Second when we put our things down we saw what looked like pizza sauce on the table and we found a parking ticket from the previous month  Which iwas the first indication of the place not being cleaned prior to our arrival  Next while checking the beds for bedbugs we notice there were crumbs and hair on the sheets which means the sheets were not washed  Then we noticed the floors and rugs throughout the apartment also looked like they havent been vacuumed in awhile  There were other minor indicators of the place not being cleaned but these were the main ones  They pride themselves on keeping the property upto hotel standards but it was far from that    To top it off  after all of that  we couldnt even watch TV because it said too many people were using the account  They dont have regular TV they have Roku TV and I assume they use the same account for other rentals    Personal notes   We found the beds were way too stiff for our liking  We preferred sleeping on the couch    The curtains kept no light out so dont expect to sleep in    We noticed a monitoring device under the island  To us it was not that big of a deal but it would have been nice to know about   We were really looking forward to this place and saw all the great reviews  but I unfortunately we were extremely disappointed and would not recommend   Parking

455492311,Good location  Felt secure   With window air conditioning had to choose between it being hot or bright from the windows while sleeping  Need to provide more than two towels  Also  we had to choose between it being hot and stuffy with the curtains drawn covering the a c or bright light while sleeping as soon as the sun came up  We slept terribly all three nights  Was given two towels for three nights  Asked for more towels and was told we would get some  Never did 
710596076,Could have been cleaner n price to high for quality and too much traffic
615980698,Overall  the apartment was how we expected  Clean enough  with a few exceptions  French press that was in the cabinet was dirty  bathroom floor could have used a  sweeping   The supplies in the apartment are very bare  if youre expecting to make coffee in the morning  bring your own grounds  Theres no coffee maker also  it is a French press  The beds arent very comfortable and the water pressure is minimal  These are pretty minor issues that did not affect our stay drastically    The one problem we did have was checking in  While we were able to get into the building via the call box outside  once we found the apartment door   flights up  we could not find where to put in the code to open the door  I had messaged Zencity about this issue  and did not have a rely until the next morning  After maybe    minutes we finally realized the door handle had a touch screen  it is black   does not light up unless you touch it  and we were finally able to get in  If we had not figured this out  Im not sure what we would have done  as there was no way to contact the host immediately  that I know of  or saw in the instructions     The best place about this apartment was the location  We will probably stay someplace else in the future to see what other Airbnbs the neighborhood has to offer 
616998993,Location was fairly convenient  Overall decent budget wise  but there were a few hang ups to consider  Check in was a little tricky   and there were some things that about the place  i e  couch in the hallway  tricky parking  that were less than ideal  Just to keep that in mind  Our instructions came after we asked  and had already arrived  Getting in was really challenging 
591561684,Very stylish and great location but the building was under renovation  The unit was not as clean as I expect from Airbnbs  though the gated parking was appreciated  Host was unresponsive to a safety concern during stay which was unacceptable so I will not plan to stay again  You need to include in your listing that the building is under remodel  there was a lot of construction stuff in the hallways    The unit was unlocked when I arrived  which was more than concerning  I msgd to confirm this was intentional and received no response  Unacceptable    I also noticed the place was quite dirty  There were clean towels and  appeared  clean bedsheets and trash had been taken out  but the floors didnt look like theyd been cleaned in a month  There was also a musty smell  which I think was coming from the washer dryer closet  There were work boot prints on the floor  as well as visible dirt and hair  The bathroom rug had long black hair on it which stuck to my feet after my shower  certainly not from me as I have long red hair 
664440253,This place is average to bad stay  I expected more based on the pictures  First  it looked like it was half way cleaned  Floors dirty  big stain on rug  soap in shower  and sheets stunk BAD and were obviously NOT changed from the previous person that stayed  They let us pick our check in time and it was suppose to be   am so we planned on trip on this time  We got into town and was told we couldnt check in until  pm  Made us late to our event   The bed was suppose to be a queen and it wasnt  There was suppose to be a table to eat and there wasnt  No parking near building so made everything very difficult to get to  When we got there the code did not work and we got no response for help  Had to ask the building owner for help  Luckily  we only had to stay one night and it was sufficient enough for that but will not go back   Bed was not a queen size bed  way smaller   Passcode to get in didnt work  Didnt have a fast response  We were locked out for sometime  We were also told we could check in at   a so we left town to get there at that time got into town and found out we couldnt check in til  pm  Bad experience  Location near everything but no parking close made everything a challenge Better parking  Cleaner 
638181938,I got a full refund so there was resolution  However my husband and I were left scrambling to find a new place to stay when we were over     miles away from home  The place had not been cleaned and had traces of someone who had clearly just stayed there   dirty dishes in the dishwasher  unmade bed  towels on bathroom and bedroom floor  black curly hairs in the bathroom floor  crumbs on kitchen counter and stove top  blanket bunched up on the couch from where someone had been relaxing and left water stains on the glass top coffee table  Just a completely far cry from what we expected and a complete disappointment  Our money was refunded for the room  after a two hour hold on the phone  but truly ruined the other plans we had for the evening that we cannot get back  I will stick with what I know with commercial hotels  I got a full refund so there was resolution  However my husband and I were left scrambling to find a new place to stay when we were over     miles away from home  The place had not been cleaned and had traces of someone who had clearly just stayed there   dirty dishes in the dishwasher  unmade bed  towels on bathroom and bedroom floor  black curly hairs in the bathroom floor  crumbs on kitchen counter and stove top  blanket bunched up on the couch from where someone had been relaxing and left water stains on the glass top coffee table  Just a completely far cry from what we expected and a complete disappointment  Our money was refunded but truly ruined the other plans we had for the evening that we cannot get back 
623939793,There are a lot of stairs but gives a good workout   the shower handle is broken and after many reviews not fixed  The couch is broken and after many reviews not fixed  It is so dirty and nasty this couch  With all kinds of stains very gross  I was told the couch would be replaced after my stay but I get the feeling they tell all guests that because its still there after many reviews  The bathroom smelled like a sewer  I imagine because of the broken shower handle and the water keeps running continuously it creates a smell  My first night I went back home as the room wasnt as clean as they stated  I let them know late in the night and the next day they got back to me and offered to send over a cleaning lady  So they cleaned the room the second day  First day I wasted my money because I didnt stay because it was gross  I am happy that the host sent someone to clean it did make a big difference    Because of the nasty couch I went back home for my own sheets and comforter  There was hair on the white sheets of the made beds   it just all grossed me out  The space was a nice one  The train is very close by  It is LOUD all through the night and day  If you have a hard time sleeping with noise this isnt the place for you  With the couch replaced and the place cleaned   shower handle replaced not such a bad unit  If you can deal with the train  The shower handle needs to be replaced it has been noted in many reviews the dirty couch as well  Thank you for sending someone to clean the second day that did make a big difference for me  Over all wasnt a bad stay  I feel the only way to have the adjustments made is through the review as you guys didnt fix the issues reported so many times before  Thank you for hosting   I booked specifically because the listing spoke about how clean the unit was   because of the gross feeling I went home I brought my own sheets and comforter   Cleanliness I would have paid twice as much for super clean  Thats why I booked the room  Everything else was ok

616467131,Dont do it  Unclean   uncaring Management owner by the name of Marty  plus my wallet magically disappeared when I was the only   in my unit besides the house maid or whatever she calls herself  I am extremely disappointed  Maybe you should try hiring a new house maid or having someone inspect the properties personally bcuz both my units were not clean  I had  dust the hangers off along with cleaning out the microwaves  the refrigerators  the tubs and sweep the floors  Not   mention the bed sheets and pillow cases were filled with different types of hair so I didnt even sleep on the beds at either   of the units  The doorman even had to take the trash out bcuz it was left in the room  I also purposely placed seeds underthe chair in one unit and behind the table in the other and it wasnt cleaned  Its probably still there if you wana go and see for yourself bcuz I doubt she cleaned the rooms properly  Theres so much more than an unclean room that I endured   I will just say that I will not be renting anymore Zencity properties   also  I do not appreciate the way the man by the name of Marty didnt handle the situation I was in but I am sure you let everybody know   The cleanliness  The actual check in process was fiNe  it was walking into a used room and having   clean up after a late check in that was the problem  The doorman even gave me Clorox wipes   clean with  No response even after   days worth of voice mails  Location was cool if it was actually clean and the management owners werent so fraudulent
645256351,The unit was not as clean as we would have liked given the pandemic  We found hair of past residents all over the bathroom  in the drawers and the shower   as well as a used towel still hanging on the curtain rod  which was extremely off putting  Also  the units WiFi was very spotty   we ended up hotspotting our phones for most of the trip  Lastly  although we were worried at first at the proximity to the train stop  the noise did not bother us which was a pleasant surprise  We appreciate the effort you all made  but the units lack of cleaning was extremely off putting  especially given coronavirus   The unit was not as clean as the photos led us to believe  Also  the WiFi was not reliable   The host was responsive  however as mentioned above  no one came to clean after our complaint 
709393872,Dont trust the photos  The title and photos indicate there are laundry facilities in the apartment but there were none  Upon entering the space  I immediately knew it was not the space in the listing photos and I was very upset  Additionally  the power to the microwave would go out after about    seconds and the water temperature in the sink and shower would change dramatically in a short period of time  Additionally  because I had to buy things  coffee and laundry services  that I had thought would be included  change my meals because the microwave wasnt working  and because there is no on site parking  while it is in a good area the value is less than other similar options in the area  please ensure the listing photos actually match the apartment you are renting out  mine did not match and I am upset about this   The title and photos indicate there are laundry facilities in the apartment but there were none  Upon entering the space  I immediately knew it was not the space in the listing photos and I was very upset  Additionally  the power to the microwave would go out after about    seconds and the water temperature in the sink and shower would change dramatically in a short period of time  because I had to buy things  coffee and laundry services  that I had thought would be included  change my meals because the microwave wasnt working  and because there is no on site parking  the value is less than other similar options in the area
627817276,It was okay I would stay again 
624170159,Make sure your blanket  pillows and sheets are clean  Check under the bed and other places for old trash  and make sure they have a key fob for you  Because if you try to use the code after a certain time youll be locked out  Make sure house keeping checks all pillows  blankets and sheets after each checkout  as I have found most of what i listed to have stains from the previous visit  Also make sure the house is clean as i found another persons toiletries under a radiator and under the bed  Lastly get a replacement key fob as i was locked out the building after   and the kiosk was not working  and communication was very thin and took a while to get a response  And parking in the neighborhood is horrible  maybe you should invest in a parking space and include it in each persons stay 
703845535,Good location for CWE district and Barnes Jewish Hospital   Clothes washer in unit leaked and was an issue for me because it was an important amenity for choosing this place to stay as I was needing a place for extended stay close to Barnes   Clothes washer leaked  Broken light at bed head wall  sharp broken trim at bathroom step  electrical box pulled out of wall   Several days with nothing happening with solution to washer problem  then eventually still not fixed  Amenities not in working order  parking is an issue 
703760845,This studio would be ideal for short stays  The value is not the best for longer stays  with lack of long term parking unless you are able to reload the meter every   hours  The meter maids are literally so quick to write a parking ticket  It was hard for me as a night shift nurse  parking on the street during the day  It seems the host sometimes overlooks messages  so if you havent received a response within a reasonable length of time  shoot them another message  The response to my message hinting to have things fixed in the apartment didnt have the response I had hoped it would   the blinds were fixed after about a month and the shower head was still hanging out of the wall when I left  The rooftop access mentioned on the headline is actually at another building down the road  not at the actual building the unit is in  The rooftop access was a huge selling point for me to book  and it came as a disappointment when I found out it wasnt at the apartment building point  The bed was the best part of the stay   it was actually very comfortable  All in all  do your research and make sure this is the best option value wise  I felt like I overpaid   Photos  blinds missing slats  host fixed this issue about a month into stay   shower head dismantled from shower wall  never fixed  nAmenities  no rooftop access at unit building  was at another building down the street  Attempted to cut stay short due to issues mentioned above  but host never responded to my message asking to change reservation check out date until another message was sent regarding receiving mail    new netflix user named  Worst Airbnb Ever  however was added to the users on the netflix account that was signed in on the smart tv in unit  This was addressed with the host  who said that it was no one from the team that created this new user  However  it was not me either  The astonished faces of my coworkers were comical  when I told them I was paying       for a studio downtown  People at work told me they were paying roughly      less for a  br  ba mortgage just outside downtown 
625142563,Im sorry  but I wont be back and Im not picky by any means  Inconvenience all around  Everything should be given up front  WiFi  password  change of location  parking spot numbers  etc  if you do decide to change locations and someone gets there on time and has to wait til you find another place  something should be compensated   Made up  time for time missed  another day  etc   I dont feel like I got my moneys worth   I spent half my time writing the host  Upon arriving I was asked to change location because the room I booked was having problems  I feel like they do this all the time  Upon arriving I had to change location  my check in was at     I didnt get to get settle in until      pm Clear upfront instructions  WiFi password wasnt given Until asked for   parking spot number wasnt given until asked for  so someone could have towed my car    not to mention I was in someone elses spot 
651574025,The bnb wasnt as clean as i expected  dishes were questionable and the fridge looked horrendous  Parking was not easy at all  and the host described a paid parking situation  i understood there was free parking  it was an okay place to stay  im grateful i had a bed  but while i was there i just felt it was unclean  besides the room The bnb wasnt as clean as i expected  dishes were questionable and the fridge looked horrendous  Parking was not easy at all 
348035318,A great location  beautiful views  nice pool and hot tub  A better clean up and a few cozy or thoughtful touches prior to arrival regular coffee pot   the key was difficult to operate Great location and view  nice pool and hot tub   The apartment was extremely uncluttered  but almost to the point of being not comfy 
626826592,We were very disappointed to discover when we checked in that our apartment smelled strongly of cigarette and or marijuana smoke   We found the packaging for an air filter and  smoke trapping ashtray  in a kitchen cabinet   Putting   and   together  it was clear that a smoker had stayed there and Zencity had not bothered to clean apartment to get rid of the smell    We emailed the photos to Zencity but this website wont let me upload them to this review    We contacted Zencity by email and their first response was we should look under the kitchen sink for cleaning supplies   We replied that it was not our responsibility to clean the entire apartment  the carpeting and furniture to get rid of smoke odors   We eventually sent Zencity an email asking them to consider a     refund of our fees and their response has been   silence   We left the windows open day and night and that did reduce but not eliminate the odor   It also created other issues because the weather was rainy and variable and the apartment was often either too hot or too cold   And on   nights there were heavy drinkers and loud partying on the rooftop above us  so with open windows it was very loud   By the way  both doors to the rooftop have big signs that it was closed   The apartment itself was OK  but the customer service by Zencity was completely unsatisfactory   There was a prominent sign in the apartment that smoking is prohibited and a smoker may be charged an extra      cleaning fee   Obviously that was not enforced   I read that Zencity manages extended stay apartments in Chicago  Kansas City and St  Louis   Based on this experience  I would be very cautious renting a property managed by them  Your company needs to be more responsive to customers when there is a problem   Your customer service was very disappointing   You can read the chain of emails between me and your representatives   The apartment was not cleaned as described   See above   See above 
669413907,Booked this place because a friend came in from out of town  We saw how their listing stated they did ultra cleaning so it made us want to book it especially because this is during covid  This place was the opposite it was SO dirty  There was a hair ball in the toilet and hairs on the seat  When we checked the bed there were hairs too and the table had dirty marks on it  I contacted the host immediately with pictures too and did not receive a response until the next day  We wanted to use the dishes that night and when we grabbed a dish it was dripping with water  The stove had dirty marks too  I was surprised that the host did not respond to at least accommodate  After check out I requested a refund and they said they can assure me the place was clean and that it was discounted too much already so they couldnt  I contacted air bnb support after and told them my experience and they refunded me the cleaning fee thankfully  I wish I would have gotten refunded for the whole thing as the host did nothing to accommodate  This place is unsafe  Dont stay here trust the reviews  This was the worst experience especially having a friend come in from out of town I was embarrassed 
619445238,Nice area for downtown  The cleaning was not up to my liking or my significant others liking  We had to clean it ourselves to be      satisfied  The bathtub did not look dirty but once we cleaned it  It was dirty which was unfortunate because we love taking baths  The shower was amazing though  Everybody in the building was also extremely sweet  The elevator went down and the handle to get into the room did not work  I contacted the owner at      pm   I did not get a response until  am the next day  It says Zencity is     
627404246,FRAUDULENT LISTING    The address is on Pearson Street  around the corner from the Hermitage address  It is questionably connected to a different apartment building on Hermitage  but NOT the one on the listing  The questionable address that it is supposedly connected to has a porta potty in the front  with caution tape on the fence  and is in terrible shape     The photos do say that it is not exactly like the actual apartment because it is a new listing  Fine  But all the photos of windows show it is at an upper level  Which is true if it were in the correct address  Instead  it is direct from the sideway into the doorway  These are the apartments that get broken into in this neighborhood because theyre easy in and out    To add to the lack of safety  the door knob does not shut all the way  It was handmade drywall that didnt line up properly when they were trying to rehab the apartment  So the deadbolt works  but the door opens about an inch because the knob does not connect properly    It is connected to the remainder of the unfinished rehab apartments  which had THREE smoke detectors chirping  Unless the central air fan is on full blast it is every minute of that loud  low battery  chirp   I went in and tried to turn one off  but it still would not stop    Zencitys communication was terrible  I have transcripts to show for that  too    I HAVE PHOTOS DOCUMENTING EVERYTHING  I cannot speak for other listings  but either Zencity does not check their properties before they list them  or they are a fraudulent organization  Zencity  check your properties before you post them  If you are an honest company  and you sincerely did not check beforehand that it was a different building and address  then that is something you should look into in the future  If you do not care  I wonder if all of your listings are fraudulent  If you need proof that your company is representing a fraudulent listing  take a look at      W Pearson      N Hermitage  and     N Hermitage   The address is WRONG  They say it is     N Hermitage  It is      W Pearson  It is in NO WAY connected to     N Hermitage  It is connected to     N Hermitage      N Hermitage has a porta potty in front of the building  caution tape on the fence  and is in terrible shape   n nIt is not a second floor as the photos suggest  I know it says that it isnt exactly the pics because its a new place  but the multiple photos of windows suggest it is a second or third floor unit  First floor buildings are unsafe in that neighborhood   n nThe messages from host  when they actually responded  said it is connected to     which is FALSE  Either this company does not check their properties before posting them  or they are trying to get away with showing     as a nicer building than the one it actually is in   n nI have photos to prove this   I asked multiple times why it was a different address  no response  They did not respond until I went to the building to see it was  in fact  a different address and wrote them to tell them the door does not close all the way  It locks from the deadbolt  but the hand made drywall door frame is unacceptable  The doorknob itself does not close all the way  Even when locked with deadbolt  the door opens approximately   inch because the doorknob isnt lined up properly   When they finally did respond  the representative said they would send a  handyman  over and that never happened    Very disconcerting  Hours went by without hearing back from the host  When they did reply  it was false information  Listing address is a completely different building and street 
627349137,Thanks for hosting  Have blinds for the sake of peoples privacy  security needs to be updated anybody can just get in  have real cleaning personal that cares and takes there job seriously clean your units communicate with those that you are hosting   There werent any blinds in the kitchen and someone got into the building and knocked at my units door I called the police on May   rd to assist me  Having curtain or blinds in kitchen
708203918,Slow internet  had difficulties accessing building with intercom down  Parking was inconvenient  Had to leave my car in a paid lot all week  Be prepared to spend       per day on parking  High speed wireless wasnt accurate  I hD  mbps download speed all week  Very difficult running reports for work with such slow speeds   Intercom to check in to building wasnt working  Contacted zencity for help accessing building  they said they were working on the issue   and then never responded  I had to ask a random resident to let me into the building and swipe their fob to let me onto my floor  Zencity never responded to my issue not being able to get into the building 
420785666,The shower had very low pressure  Water only came out of half of the shower head  So showering felt more like a bird bath  I was informed    mins before check in that I would be staying in a unit different from what I reserved because of maintenance issues  It wasnt a huge deal but I would have prefered someone asking if I was okay with the changes first  Considering the cleaning fee and price I would have liked the bedding to look more presentable  I personally feel more comfortable sleeping in beds that appeal to sight  touch  and feel senses    But overall not bad   The location was very convenient  The shower had very low pressure  Water only came out of half of the shower head  So showering felt more like a bird bath  I was informed    mins before check in that I would be staying in a unit different from what I reserved because of maintenance issues  It wasnt a huge deal but I would have prefered someone asking if I was okay with the changes first  Considering the cleaning fee and price I would have liked the bedding to look more presentable  I personally feel more comfortable sleeping in beds that appeal to sight  touch  and feel senses    But overall not bad   The location was very convenient 
626809238,Great location and great unit for a good value  From my experience and that of other reviewers  the cleanliness can be hit or miss  Overall my stay was great with the exception of things being a bit dirty and no rooftop access  Great finishings in the unit  great neighborhood  good value   The rooftop deck was advertised in the listing but I was unable to access it with my key fob   Host had decent communication  however they offered to come by during the day to have a look at the leak and do a spot clean  and I dont think anyone ever came by  if they did I didnt hear anything about it and couldnt tell 
615825744,The apartment was nice  but different from the photos  The host was responsive during my stay except for the day of checkout  I had forgotten a travel bag on the bed and realized a few hours after checkout  The host did not check themselves for the bag  nor did they allow me back in the unit to grab the item myself  Instead they only told me the cleaning service didnt see my bag and that was it  Completely cut off  I was extremely disappointed  I enjoyed my stay even though the photos advertised a completely different apartment  What tanked the pleasantness was the fact that you would not allow me to check the room for my belongings that I forgot  Either the host or the cleaning service stole my belongings  I am highly disappointed by this and how the host became unresponsive after checkout day about my belongings  Did not respond when attempting to retrieve left behind items  Not helpful at all 
669420299,The pictures showed a larger place with a kitchen table and chairs  a full size couch and larger bed area  We got a tiny place with barley enough room to set up a pack n play for our   month old  No kitchen table  no chairs and the  couch  fits   person comfortably  I dont know how people get away with renting places with pictures to obviously another unit they are renting  Id update your pictures to the actual place you are renting  The pictures showed a larger place with a kitchen table and chairs  a full size couch and larger bed area  We got a tiny place with barley enough room to set up a pack n play for our   month old  I don u    t know how people get away with renting places with pictures to obviously another place   It would have been great if it was the place of the pictures that we booked
625264935,Location is great  The building itself had some issues during our stay  there were no lights in the stairways and we needed to use our phones to see   The unit itself was just okay  It left much to be desired as overall cleanliness was an issue for us   Amenities were there  but they were essentially not usable as they weren u    t clean  I couldn u    t clean anything because the sponge that was left was already used   Overall cleanliness would have made this a much better experience 
512754967,Meh  Beware  by the time all the service fees  taxes  etc were added up it was almost like going to a hotel where they change your sheets  The cancellation policy is pretty severe and they collected half in front and half   weeks prior to occupancy  Check they AC unit too   after waking up at   am several nights  we discovered that the AC was programmed to go to heat at    in the middle of the night  Grrrr     The location was pretty sweet  minutes from the tunnel to take you to the Promontory Walk and minutes to the Metra stop  Beds and bed sheets were comfortable  Sofa was the worse for wear   pretty dingy  The floors had a bit of sticky film  The views were nice but you had to peep out of the window  If you sat down  all you could see was sky  Windows   screens could have used a cleaning      What was frustrating was that I asked for extra towels and there were none  We asked for two fobs and keys instead of the one  so that we could go on our separate ways   if one wanted to go for a walk and the other for coffee but they said they only had one  so we always had to make our plans coordinate      The kitchenware was the utmost bare minimum  We were always washing dishes because there were only   cups    plates    spoons    forks    steak knives  no cutting knife  no paper towels  a tiny disposable towel  no cooking oil  For coffee they only provided a French Press  no coffee maker  Thats what they call luxury accommodations   Responses were a day and more late  Never helpful either except for the time I reported one wine glass had a crack in the base  Even then  it took several days for them to replace  I had asked for extra towels before hand  a tip from another user  but none was provided  It was a bit of a hassle to have been given one key and one fob  I asked for a second so that is one of us went walking  we didnt have to coordinate when to gain entry  It was also a bit of a hassle to have only   large spoons    small forks    small spoons  NO cutting knife  NO paper towel  one small disposable towel      plates and   cups  You had to keep washing what you used  The cooking utensils were pitiful as well  If you say youre a luxury condo  why the measly kitchenware  The sofa looked pretty dingy and worse for wear 
628805160,I never had a problem with this company  I just know it was so hot and the air didnt work  The place is super nice just wish the air worked  I just expected them to have air that work are at least rush to get it fixed
651002990,The hosting company Zencity has terrible customer service  I was not able to enter the rental on time and they did not give the rental a thorough cleaning between visits  The key was not even in the lock box upon my arrival  Considering COVID     they should have spent more than    minutes cleaning and sanitizing the space  Unprofessional 
652247956,It is sparsely furnished unit in a building that is located in a desolate part of downtown  If fit my budget but not ideal location to walk out and feel like you were in a downtown urban location   The photos are not of this unit   Different furniture  layout   Not only was it unclear for me   two other guests staying in other zencity units had the same issue with access upon arrival  Calling a hotline that requires you to leave a message and then wait for an email response is not responsive  Isolated area  Nothing around the building  Building is vacant and felt very desolate 
672710113,This place should have been perfect   great location  just enough room  good price  unfortunately  it wasnt    The place was just not clean and the water was shut off on the first night  this was not communicated to us  and then the water was brown the next morning making a shower impossible  We did purchase bottled water to drink because we didnt feel comfortable after seeing what was coming out of the pipes    I hope they are able to correct these issues because otherwise it would have been a good experience  If you are going to count on the doorperson to check in guests you need to have a way for the guest to contact the doorperson so they dont have to stand outside the building    You need to hire another cleaning company because this one is not doing a good job   I was very disappointed in the cleanliness   I can forgive a lot at places I am staying but not cleanliness    You should let your guests know before booking or at least at booking if the water to the unit is going to be shut off   At the very least a discount should be given for the time the water is shut off      It is really too bad because the location is perfect   The building is right next door to my daughters building and if my experience had been better I would be rebooking every couple of months   It wasnt clean and check in was not effortless   The doorperson at the building wouldnt acknowledge that I was waiting outside the building so I had to stand there until someone else walked into the building and went in with them  after explaining why I was doing it  not that I was trying to breach security    Then the doorperson was nasty to me and not at all helpful  Slow responding to one of my messages but eventually got back to me    They also did not communicate the fact the water was going to be turned off  If it had been cleaner   If I had access to laundry    If the water had not been turned off on my first night   If the water had not been brown the next morning and I could have taken a shower   If I didnt have to purchase bottled water to drink because I did not feel safe drinking the water after all the brown water 
621134080,Pretty big disappointment and a few inconveniences  Host wasnt as professional as I thought he would have been    always a different person replying as zencity so communication was somewhat confusing as well
621599641,Okay place  Have place cleaned correctly
621072318,This was an experience that started out fine and ended horribly     Price gouging   We booked the space for six nights  Though the keypad was giving us issues every time we tried to enter the apartment  we once waited       minutes for Zencity to change the code since the keypad wasnt working   we wanted to extend our stay   They refused to give us the new daily rate  which was about     cheaper for those same new dates that we wanted to extend into   They said that if we extended it wed have to keep our same rate because they couldnt change it for us   Annoyed and frustrated  we said fine because we didnt want to have to move and the place was nice enough   After going back and forth  they finally sent a modification that actually added an additional day on top of what we requested   We were flexible  so we didnt say anything because we were already pretty annoyed and wanted to not have a sour relationship with Zencity   RODENT  I E  MOUSE  and poor response   A little past the midway point of our stay  I saw a mouse in the kitchen go from under the oven to under the dishwasher  and later to the bathroom   Now   my partner is TERRIFIED of mice  Terrified   I immediately messaged Zencity  asked them during one call to send someone  they said they would   then asked them on a second call  three hours later  to send someone  they said they would    About four hours after that  around      hours in total  they sent someone who said he just got word an hour before his arrival   In the meantime  like any reasonable person  I had to find another Airbnb last minute  which ended up costing more than this location   Despite the fact that we found large holes throughout the apartment  laundry room and bathroom  and the door doesnt have a door guard  so anything can slide right in        all of which we documented  we were only refunded half of the money we paid for the remaining days of our stay after Zencity ignored our messages and started only communicating with Airbnb     It really started out as a promising trip  but my partner is still reeling from the experience  Im out of a few hundred bucks unexpectedly and I dont even know if Ill have a job in a month  I will NEVER rent a place managed by Zencity again  The space was nice until I found a mouse   I think you all should consider plugging up the holes around the space  laundry room area  bathroom  and put a door guard under the doors  The keypad didnt work for the first few tries  When we couldnt get into the apartment and when we found a mouse in the apartment  we experienced pretty slow responses  When I booked the place  you were charging     a day   When I tried to extend it  you all were booking it for     a day at the time and refused to give me that rate   I extended anyway because of COVID    to be nice   Then you extended for one day more than I wanted originally  But I said fine   Then I find a mouse    you wait over    hours to send someone  who told me when he got there that he had only gotten notice an hour before   and then you only give me half my money back for the remaining three days  which shouldve been an additional two days had you not extended my time    I had to find another place last minute  which resulted in me spending even more money that I intended  and I dont even know if Ill have a job in a month    
511719147,I reached out to the company  host  as our power was out for a majority of the stay  Was told that someone would come and never did  We ended up leaving the property before time  Because of this situation  the good looks and location were over shined  I reached out to the company  host  as our power was out for a majority of the stay  Was told that someone would come and never did  We ended up leaving the property before time  Because of this situation  the good looks and location were over shined 
619854562,Zencity   great units and extrememly poor customer support    Rented two places from them starting on           The rooms are really new and nice   Near the Country Club Plaza in KC   Underground parking  new units  nice building so a big thumbs up for that    Kitchen amenities are quite sparse though  so cooking isnt that easy   Maybe they expect you to eat out a lot since you are travelling   Rooms were spacious and beds nice    Customer support is atrocious  worst of any Airbnb I have stayed in by far   Had an issue in the first place  no shower curtain  and it was never addressed   We were told a shower curtain would be delivered and that did not happen   The second stay never happened due to the covid    issues   Trying toe communicate with zencity and get a reasonable refund has been an ordeal  with way too much time of mine utilized for this effort  Extremely poor customer service for an agency that runs multiple Airbnb units   Never stayed there   Just clicking to get through review  Due to the covid    outbreak my wife  who was going to stay in the unit from         decided to fly home   Her activities later that week were cancelled and she was afraid that flights home would be cancelled    She called the zencity contact number at noon and no response   I subsequently contacted zencity through the account and let them know we would not be using the reservation   Zencity offered a refund of          of unused nights  which was Tuesday   Wednesday    I attempted multiple times to contact zencity and could not get through and or left messages and they were not returned   I was asking for     of unused plus the cleaning fee         We never even checked into the room  so no cleaning would be necessary   Zencity then offered     which I accepted  as I want to end this ordeal    Very disappointed in the customer service of zencity and will not rent one of their spaces again 
624853784,I stayed for   days  I had some issues with Zen and the apartment  But I think it would be great for you  Perfect location and etc  I would have to say the community wasnt as nice to me  And I felt a lil unwelcome  The host were great communicators  They were in constant contact with me  Thank you Marty for your help  I would like to thank you for Airbnb  I really didnt like my experience  I think thats less on you and more me  But the space I was in was great  The only issues I had was check  in  the readiness of the apartment  and being called on for smoking on the balcony   The dryer isnt working properly   Check in to a whole  I was given the wrong instructions  Didnt like I had to go all the way outside to smoke  when I had a whole balcony   NOT YOUR FAULT 
622864247,After check out host asked me to pay     for a Pillow that had been drawn on  Which was not from me  Hi I agreed to pay it just to not have an issue then they came back asking for another     for the same reason which Im not about to pay 
670562219,Hard to find key and unit  Host not willing to work with me on refunding money for the reservation even though I didnt stay
623031249,This was a cute little place  But you definitely get what you pay for here    the parking sucks because you have to pay for it  The hallway to the room smells SO BAD  Like a dog kennel    but thats not the hosts fault  Its just a warning lol  The apartment is nice but make sure you know how to make french press coffee because there isnt a normal coffee maker here  Also  bring toilet paper  paper towels ect  because there was none when I stayed here  Everything else is great though if your looking for relaxing stay on a budget 
622515831,Few things need to b fixed in the loft but the space is great Loft is nice however kitchen faucet hot water drips out and the shower hot water last every bit annoy   minutes  Hot water ran for literally   minutes in the shower then turned cold and kitchen faucet hot water basically doesn u    t work 
621933981,I booked a one bedroom with elevator access  When I arrived at the building  elevator did not work   was stuck on  th floor    I tried to call zen city through the app but no one picked up  Finally someone responded to my message on the app and told me I can use the back door to access stairs to the  th floor  I declined this because I had a lot of luggage  They finally re booked a small studio with elevator access but when I asked for   back  ZenCity refused   so far   I have used ZenCity before but this experience was far below their standards   I booked a one bedroom with elevator access  When I arrived at the building  elevator did not work   was stuck on  th floor    I tried to call zen city through the app but no one picked up  Finally someone responded to my message on the app and told me I can use the back door to access stairs to the  th floor  I declined this because I had a lot of luggage  They finally re booked a small studio with elevator access but when I asked for   back  ZenCity refused   so far   I have used ZenCity before and this was very unprofessional in how I was treated   I booked a one bedroom with elevator access  When I arrived at the building  elevator did not work   was stuck on  th floor    I tried to call zen city through the app but no one picked up  Finally someone responded to my message on the app and told me I can use the back door to access stairs to the  th floor  I declined this because I had a lot of luggage  They finally re booked a small studio with elevator access but when I asked for   back  ZenCity refused   so far   
621937629,This place is cute st first glance however upon waking up at night to use the restroom  I discovered this place had roaches and these bugs were huge  One was in the bathroom and touched my toothbrush and i showed another in the bedroom  As you can imagine i was disgusted  I informed the host and sent photos but they did nothing  Also though it sys there is no parking on oremus  understand it really means that   There is NO place to park if staffing here   Honestly i feel like i deserve a refund  i wouldnt recommend staying here  I appreciate you letting me rent your space however im incredibly disappointed with how the ROACH  situation was handled  No one ever came to address the issue  I did Mohr sleep the next two nights after seeing bugs in the bathroom and bedroom  Very upset  There were bugs iight took   hrs after me notifying the host before i recieved a response  They were shooting outside the window  The entrance to the building isas nooottt rally accessible also street parking was almost nonexistent  Cute setup but not worth the bugs and headache 
652876085,We had difficulties with the checking in and out and the knobs but overall it was an ok stay  nice apartment  just need better instructions on how to get in and fix the knob  nice people 
619905216,Very gross and dirty  There were hairs all over the bathroom floor and the bathtub as well as the entire bed  sheets  comforter and pillows  You can tell they dont even clean it and only get away with it because the place is up to date so it looks clean and nice at first   This was during the corona virus outbreak too  very gross   Our fire alarm also went off every single time we used the oven  and continued to beep every minute for   whole days  Asked the front desk to look at it or try and fix it and they kept saying they would but never did  Other than the neglect and uncleanliness  the place was very accessible and had decent parking space nearby  Location was great too 
622907426,Zen city  Patch up mouse holes communicate with people at your property provided more sheets and towels and blankets  Never messaged or answered responded    hours later  Never responded had dangerous situation Being better hosts
629064232,Good luck in your search and always price check  Prices are not that great   A message was sent to me saying I overpaid     dollars for a airbnb in the Skyline building  when I tried to book the same place that week  it was not available and nothing was said or done about the money i paid    weeks later it was available  I really liked Zencity until the last   trips  A refund would be nice as I always followed the rules and kept the places clean  Thank you  When I asked about the overpaid refund  Same as above A refund or a free weeks stay 
648348727,This space is well curated and in a great location  The bed is comfy and the check in process is super easy  But besides that  pretty much everything else was a problem  Our  enhanced clean  unit had dusty surfaces  broken seals on the travel sized toiletries  part of a roll of toilet paper left from the previous tenant  among other minor cleanliness things that normally wouldnt be an issue but made us feel very unsafe about the cleanliness of the space in the midst of a pandemic  Along with this  there were several maintenance issues including missing bath drain plug  broken soap dispenser  missing light bulb  and even the entire right bedside table being ripped out of the wall with unsightly holes left in the wall and no temporary replacement table  We also received no response  within    hours  after sharing our concerns via direct message after we checked out  which is why this review is so bluntly honest  Again  the space was well curated and beautifully designed  but it seemed poorly kept up and not at all  enhanced clean   We were very thankful for our sleep space  but didnt feel safe or sanitary in the space until we cleaned it ourselves  We were so excited to stay here since its a great location and beautifully curated space  but it just seemed like the maintenance and or cleaning staff didnt put much thought or effort into maintaining the space or cleaning the space  At almost      per night with a certified  enhanced clean  we expected far better   There is a bathtub but no drain stop  so we couldn u    t take a bath  The soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken  There were two side tables and two side lamps in the bedroom in the photos  but when we arrived there was no light bulb in the right lamp and the bedside table was ripped out of the wall with unsightly holes in the wall and no temporary replacement   Did not respond to concerns communicated after we checked out  we were there from  am     am so we just problem solved when we ran into issues  
296846914,The place is perfect for two  thank you for the stay it was greatly appreciated
643368492,Great location  Needed a much  much better cleaning before my colleague and I arrived for our business trip  Zencity were very friendly  and wanted to help however they could  but responsivity was spotty  and we ended up leaving halfway through our trip  If this unit receives a deep cleaning  a couple repairs  and is maintained with more thorough cleanings between guests  then it will be a great place to stay  This unit has great potential  but needs serious attention first  Fix the hardwood floorings loose slats  Get more comfortable  less firm  mattresses  Fix the couch leg  Clean the AC units deeply  Clean everything deeply  Replace old kitchenware  Add more silverware  Repair the bathroom where fixtures used to be  Clean better between guests  Replace the shower curtain  Leave enough keys for each guest  or at least for each bedroom   The unit was as photographed  and the location was excellent  Its construction quality  furniture condition  and cleanliness were very disappointing  Ex  the flooring was so loose throughout most of the unit that it clattered noisily as hardwood slats slid under my feet  even when tiptoeing   We were only given   key  despite the unit being a   bedroom booked for business travel  It took several days to get a second key  which was rather inconvenient as my colleague and I had different schedules  Communications were relatively helpful and very friendly  but variable on promptness  For the price  the cleanliness should have been significantly better 
624151641,Terrible  Do not stay at this place or any Zencity location  The person renting out this place did not have the rights to the apartment as their lease had ended  As a result  we were kicked out a couple hours into the stay by the landlord and were not even issued a refund   The host did not have the right to rent out this unit and we were therefore forced to leave a couple hours into our stay  
563003543,Upon arrival to the Airbnb we noticed an extremely pungent smell  it had clearly been masked with some Febreeze or air freshener spray  we contacted the host and they sent someone in the next morning  However  after several messages back and forth we noticed we were communicating with three different people which made voicing our concerns difficult and it seemed dismissive because each person would just say  hope youre enjoying your stay  when we really werent  After sending someone to look at the place  they basically said nothing was wrong and left it at that  Im not sure if the smell was from the old furnace or just because the building itself was old  but their way of dealing with the issue wasnt great  The place itself was nice but the smell was pretty unbearable for most of the stay    The host then contacted me again and said they hoped I had a good stay and proceeded to ask that if I had any complaints to send it to his private feedback  I thought Id post it all here so everyone is aware  Multiple different people communicating with me which made it extremely frustrating to voice concerns 
664902188,Dont go with zencity  they failed to have the apartment cleaned when I arrived  The bed was slept in  dishes in the sink  trash in all the garbages and used toothpaste in the bathroom sink  Then on my last day of the stay a maintenance man unlocked the door and came in while I was sleeping at     am  They would not make it right  Its big corporate and you get the run around  Having the matinace man come in while I was asleep is horrible  If I had been a girl I would sue you for sexual harassment  Having a locked door open at      am out of your sleep in your underwear is not a good experience  All that after non cleaning   It u    s much much smaller than the pictures make it look   The key pad does work  It would be fine if they had better customer service 
625236828,The location is great with a nice view  It is in a posh building in Hyde Park with a nice restaurant which will deliver to your room  The room is sparse with no desk or kitchen table to eat at or work at   The unfortunate part is that the place was dirty  The fridge and light switches  which I personally wiped down   There were no paper towels  so I had to use my own wipes   But the worst was that the sheets were blood stained  Some of the stains had even soaked through to the mattress cover  It was evident that the staff had not changed the sheets  I had to change everything myself  because Zen city had no staff in the area to come over and take care of the problems    I was thoroughly grossed out and just wanted to get out of there  Then they overcharged me      for a one nights stay at a     place   Bad experience  Please clean your facilities   The washer  dryer is not in the unit  but on the same floor  down the hall   All went well  Responses okay cleanliness
671099284,Quiet Thanks for being a great host  Very thin walls  Was accused of smoking in room but made to feel that I was not allowed to step outside as often as I wanted to   She literally came in   no badge  asking to see if there is any smoking or damage because my tv was up too loud  at    volume   because she owns this and lives next door  Then she said She was going to kick me out early if she hears sees or smells me the rest of the time  This was Friday night   No smoking happened In the room and when I Call her she was wrong about that she said she had evidence somehow    
624418903,Would recommend Great customer service
623805944,Looks exactly like the pictures
624419813,Nice place with a nice view  but you could tell they didnt clean it to their best ability and the windows were glued shut so it was minimal ventilation 
651582618,Although the building staff was great  parking isnt great  the apartment was okay but very dirty  Comfy couch   bed though  Already spoke to Stuart about my issues 
624738362,Needed to be a little cleaner overall
628766673,I am always satisfied with Zencity   this last visit not so much   The amenities stated air conditioner  The unit didnt have an air conditioning unit or a thermostat with air   I was told I MAY be able to get an air unit the next day but no guarantee  I told them either get me an air unit  give me a new AirBNB or I needed a full refund  I was offered a new unit  that also didnt have air   After I cussed  sorry i had to  I was advised the maintenance man would be there the next day between   a  p  He came around   am the next morning  Luckily it was around  pm when I got there and its by the water so I was able to open the window and enjoy a really nice breeze that night
624222219,Cool place to stay 
624760808,It was pretty alright  Everything you need is right in the unit   Not really a loft  BUT it was still nice  
620936017,Overall  I ended up canceling  I was not a fan of the hosts communication and need there response to close out my stay  They only send auto messages  All else I cant really speak to  I didnt want to leave a review since I ended up cancelling but your response time on the cleaning fee refund and during my pre stay was terrible  Automated messages are not enough  Left   star for all else since I could not rank it properly  Once we resolve through the other process I can tell airbnb to unpublish if you want but I need COMMUNICATION  Very slow responses and trying to get cleaning fee refund since I didnt stay there
623307502,Read carefully All my food for that stay spoiled since I was in a hotel without a kitchen   No mention that there was a flight of stairs outside making it handicapped inaccessible   Told them I was NOT staying there apparently that wasnt enough to convince them 
667821001,Pros  location is awesome for the price  would be a great spot for anyone visiting DePaul  TONS of coffee shops restaurants within walking distance  cute neighborhood to stroll through and the nearby park is nice  The bar downstairs is decent  although on the young side  and they shut down at like       on the dot during weekdays  so you dont have to worry about being kept up all night  Check in was super easy  TV is big and there was a fire stick with Netflix etc  Decor was cute  felt like staying at a friends place in college  Both the beds and pillows were SUPER comfortable  the one in the front room is firm and the one in the back room is much softer  so you can Goldilocks it until you find one you like   Its managed by a company and they were super responsive to all my questions    Cons  felt like staying at a friends place in college  Place is pretty bare bones and could have been a teeny bit cleaner  but nothing that I wouldnt have expected for the affordability of it  With a few minor kinks worked out  Id stay there again  Hey guys  I really appreciate your great communication and the fact that someone came to get me off the balcony  although  someone probably should have double checked to make sure that the door didnt lock before they put a chair out there   Once you get the kinks worked out  itll be great  I really like all the furniture  Also  you should know that someone in the building  not the bar  was bumping bass music literally all night  it was on when I went to bed at midnight and then still when I woke up at  am and  am  It was the loudest in the back bedroom  so maybe ask whoever lives on the other side of that wall   Water pressure was so low that the shower was unusable and the internet went out multiple times  Would also really benefit from a coffee maker   Its a good location for the price but it needs a working shower and to be aired out from whatever that smell is 
647013691,location communication and free parking was awesome  Only thing  I was just very bothered by how dirty it was  There was a ton of dust on the fan  old cookies above the fridge in the cabinet  and the bedding was stained  It has blood stains and hair on it along with other random stains  Also by the windows was a used q tip  Super dirty  location communication and free parking was awesome  Only thing  I was just very bothered by how dirty it was  There was a ton of dust on the fan  old cookies above the fridge in the cabinet  and the bedding was stained  It has blood stains and hair on it along with other random stains  Also by the windows was a used q tip  Super dirty 
667517472,The location for this space is great  Also  it is a great spot to stay  Even though there are a lot of tenants around  I hardly knew it  quiet and reasonable rate for the space  I greatly appreciated the quick response in communication about the the wifi and television not  working properly  I was glad to get the tv working with the information that was sent but was sorely disappointed that the wifi never did work  This was frustrating  given that it was noted that wifi would be available   the wifi did not work the whole time I was there  I had to use my hotspot and used up all my data  and have to wait until October    to get the data back at my normal speed  
531069605,The room we booked was really nicely decorated and the bed was super comfortable  There is a record player  and a blutooth speaker as well as multiple phone chargers and some nice touches like an iron  ironing board  and blow dryer  The location is awesome  there is a really rad street corner bar right down the street  whole foods is a block away and basically any shopping or eating you could want to do in St  Louis is within a five minute walk or a       minute drive  Zencity staff  who book the room  were quick to communicate and check in was pretty seamless  The room we booked   R  does look over a parking lot and doesnt have a lot of privacy  especially at night when you want to have the curtains open  But you really cant beat this location or accommodation for the price  Thank you very much for your hospitality and for a great stay  The location was amazing and the room very cozy  Check in was seamless and the front desk staff was very nice and helpful  The reason I gave Zenicity   stars was because of the following     The bath tub was really gross  it had thick dark hair throughout the tub and a big hair ball in the drain catch  There was noticeable grime along the grout joints of the tub  it was clear it had not been cleaned     Zencity directly requested a   star review without asking how the stay was  To the best of your knowledge it could have not been good but youre still requesting a five star review  Best to just remind your guests to review you and not directly ask for   stars     Zencity requested     from me through the app because you suspected there were some stains on a wash cloth that would not come out  It seems as though that request was made before an attempt to actually wash the rag was made because it came only a few hours after check out  It was a wash rag my wife used to wash her makeup off  which she does at home with white rags so we know it would come out     it should really be noted that this is a  nd story room that over looks a parking lot and garage  the privacy is not so great because anyone standing in the parking lot or on the second story of the garage can look right in your windows  Otherwise it was a really great location and the accommodations were nice  we loved the decor and the fact you had things like blow dryer  iron  and lots of power outlets  Thank you 
661873370,Overall  we had a restful  relaxing stay in this luxury apartment   It sits on the   th floor  and commands a great view to the South  looking down Main Street   You will love it   We opted to pay the daily     entrance fee to the connected parking garage  and this made parking very convenient   And the white walls create a feeling of luxury and expansiveness   we loved this     In the spirit of total transparency  here are two significant actions items worth noting for the maintenance staff  and they are    the deadbolt did not function  and    there was no hot water in the far bathroom or kitchen    When staying at hotels  I have come to appreciate the blind deadbolt in all hotel doors  as this allows me to sleep a little better at night   The deadbolt does not function correctly in the front door  so I did not sleep  a little better       The strike plate is positioned      too low  and the bolt does not enter into the door jam   The door does lock  yes  but the deadbolt does not function     I debated fixing the plate myself with a Dremel tool  but my significant other advised me against it  P   The  nd item is the hot water   Yes there IS hot water in the bathroom closest to the front door  but no hot water in the far bathroom or kitchen    Notwithstanding the deadbolt and the hot water  we had a wonderful relaxing stay in this apartment    My advice to the next traveler is to check that these two items have been remedied  The apartment was beautiful   My only recommendation is to fix the hot water issue in the far bathroom and kitchen  and hire someone to fix the deadbolt  the strike plate needs to be enlarged at the top to receive the deadbolt    Other than those two items  our stay was very relaxing and we loved the apartment   Thank you     There was no hot water in the Southern bathroom  and the deadbolt was not functional   For guests who desire a working deadbolt on the main door  as most hotel have  this apartment did not provide that   See accuracy comment above 
527770471,Place is clean  basic  has sparse furniture and little charm  About what you would expect from a corporation short term rental  so it misses the coziness of Airbnbs where people actually rent their places out  If you are cool with that  then you will like it  Had to really try to use intercom to use automated system to get in  Had to contact host  did reply promptly  OK location  new building This is one of those Airbnb companies that set up apartments in drab  basic but clean style   cheap furniture  bed cracked when I sat on it   etc  This is fine  but honestly  I love Airbnb to see the beauty in what people put into their homes and guest spots  Again  it isnt an inaccurate description  but it should be out there that this property is strictly a basic rental only setup

641794828,Upon arrival at      we realized its coded to open at three  Then the cleaning crew arrived and said we would need to wait another       minutes  After already paying for parking we sat in the hall and waited  The construction from     everyday was also rather inconvenient and we were not notified about the noise prior to check in  It was chilly so we tried opening the windows and they came out of the frames  In totality it was worse than we expected  Upon arrival at      we realized its coded to open at three  Then the cleaning crew arrived and said we would need to wait another       minutes  After already paying for parking we sat in the hall and waited  The construction from     everyday was also rather inconvenient and we were not notified about the noise prior to check in  It was chilly so we tried opening the windows and they came out of the frames  In totality it was worse than we expected 
656417236,I loved the Hyde Park Neighborhood  I felt safe and there were plenty of shops and restaurants all in walking distance  However  the unit was not as cleaned as expected from the look of the pictures  The bedding didnt feel clean and the shower grout was not clean  Needs to be re caulked or cleaned throughly   The shower appeared to be clean  however the shower grout wasn u    t clean   The unit was not a clean as expected for the neighborhood its in 
707637285,Nice view
587896716,Overall stay was okay  Apartment was beautiful and just as described pictured  We had some issues regarding building security but hopefully they are addressed and not an issue for people who stay in the future  Overall stay was okay  Apartment was beautiful and just as described pictured  Still had some construction dust in the unit  When we arrived we accidentally transposed numbers of apartments and went to the wrong one  Entered code and were granted access to someone elses apartment  Both they and we were freaked out when we walked in on them  Definitely a concern that our code worked for both units  Construction workers woke us up at      AM wanting to install lights under cabinets  Arent we supposed to be made aware of people entering our apartment  There is no peep hole to see into the hallway and as two women staying alone in a new city  this is a major security issue  The superintendent of the building was extremely rude and said it needed to be done before the New Year even though we were not comfortable with two strange men entering our apartment  Fire alarm went off at      one morning and didnt turn off for    minutes  I understand the building is in the final stages of renovation  but the security issues are very disconcerting 
625980313,Our experience could have been a lot better  Unfortunately  the WiFi doesnt really work  We could not use the TV because the fire stick couldnt connect to the WiFi  The ceiling leaked when it rained and we didnt know until my girlfriend slipped on the water  Also  during our stay two men came in the apartment without any prior notice from Zencity to us  It was extremely scary because they walked in on one of us getting out the shower and one sleeping and we did not have clothes on  The second man came with two children to install something and again  walked right in with the access code  He also stated that The owner knew that he was coming to do the install  However  Zencity did not mention it to us  We were out of the place a lot because when we were there we slept with a chair under the door and took turns watching it be just to be safe  we didnt know who else has the code and might come in  We also received a noise complaint while we were sleeping  It was extremely crazy because my fianc e had just flown in  It was extremely difficult to find somewhere else to stay because a chunk of our money was tied up in this place and it was extremely short notice  Most places were booked  The experience wasnt horrible however  it definitely could have been better  There definitely should be communication with the guests about other people being able to just walk in when they feel like it  TV did not work  internet connection was very inconsistent which is why the TV did not work   I feel as though the communication stopped when I checked in because we were not aware of the two men being able to just walk in on us
650523880,Look elsewhere for decent accommodations  The place REEKED of cigarettes  even thought there is a non smoking policy  Our hair and clothes smelled like cigarettes after the first night  Going out and about smelling of cigarettes was awful   Sleeping in that was unpleasant  to say the least  We absolutely could not spend a second night at the apartment and found new accommodations the next day and checked out  We washed our cigarette smelling clothes ASAP  It was really gross   Sam and I are not ones to complain usually  but this had to be addressed  There were a variety of smaller issues  which are easily overlooked  considering the basic requirements of cleanliness are held up  However  this was not the case as the place was an ashtray  The apartment and its furniture were falling apart  The fridge leaked  The toilet did not flush  the shower took a solid    minutes to warm up  and the water pressure was very weak  Some other minor things  like the blinds were all convoluted and not attended to properly   All in all  The biggest issue was the reek of cigarette smoke that made our stay unbearable  besides the variety of falsely advertised amenities  Also  Zencitys reluctance to properly address the situation was disappointing    I contacted and explained our issues with the apartment to Zencity  First they offered alternative accommodation  but for another date  Which of course  visiting Chicago  we needed a place to sleep then and there  They initially charged us for the second night we did not stay  When I declined their offer and further explained the cause of our cancellation  Zencity went quiet and has not responded to my request for a refund  Ive tried to contact them for multiple days now   Spare yourself the headache  money  and unpleasant consequences of booking with Zencity and go with another Airbnb host  I wish I could leave a good review and not have had dealt with all this  The new place I booked is cheaper  in a great location  and is truly CLEAN and properly maintained  Hi Zencity   can somebody please get back to me regarding my stay and refund for checking out  Thanks   The place reeked of cigarettes  even thought there is a no smoking policy  The apartment and its furniture were falling apart  The bathroom had issues with the toilet  water heater and pressure   Responsive at first  and then not at all  when confronted with a complaint and the request to resolve a refund  Accurate description of expected environment 
650244876,There was no air conditioning in listing despite it being in the details  and when we messaged the host we never heard back  Its been    days since we sent a message and still no follow up  Overall it was a sort of decent stay but without air conditioning it was very unbearable  Decent location in the city but very hard to find parking  we had to find a garage like almost a    minute walk away  No air conditioning  Host never responded to messages Including air conditioning like listed
625326607,Better cleaning service would be a plus Had to get security to let me in the apt After the  rd day of waiting for a response I finally had to call host  I expected to enter a freshly cleaned apt  Instead I found trash in the corners of the livingroom and beneath the couch  Also I found hair upside the wall in the shower 
652351810,Air conditioning doesnt work and they didnt fix it the entire time we stayed there  It was very hot and we contacted host multiple times about this  They said they will send maintenance team but no one arrived to fix this  The place is not at all worth of the money  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE   They didnt let us know about the air conditioning issue  Fixing the addressed problems and being nice to the customers  
665157609,Super outdated building with weird strong smell  Elevator comes to an abrupt stop and feels like its going to break while youre inside of it  use the stairs instead  Tiny bathroom  can barely move in it  Not very clean  surfaces had fingerprints and were kind of greasy  Bathroom corners were piled with dirt and grime  Found bugs in kitchen while making food  Bed is extremely firm and uncomfortable  but the pillows were nice and soft  The comforter was nice as well  DISGUSTING piss mold smell when you turn on the heater  Sketchy place to stay in general  Photos were taken to make it look nicer than it really looks  beware  The building itself was very run down and had a weird smell that was so strong it gave me a migraine  The apartment building overall felt haunted and old with the creaky floors  dim lighting  elevator that jolted at every floor  etc  The bathroom was extremely tiny and we could hardly move in it  Bathroom corners and floorboards were piled with dirt and grime  We found bugs in the kitchen area while we were trying to prepare food  The bed is extremely firm and uncomfortable  DISGUSTING piss mold smell when you turn on the heater   The room we got wasn u    t exactly the one in the photos  Weren u    t aware that they were renting several units out and they u    d all be different  Misleading   Parking was absolutely atrocious and horrible  A little overpriced for what we got  Ive stayed in airbnbs that were cheaper and were nicer 
624530655,If you are looking for a location that is convenient to Forest Park  Central West end  and Barnes Hospital this would be a really good choice  The apartment was nicely decorated  and the bed was comfortable  Didnt really have any issues   concerns with the check in process  Unfortunately due to covid    the restaurants in the Central West end area were only able to offer carryout  If you like to walk  Forest Park right across the street is an ideal location  However  if you are a light sleeper or prefer to have a quiet setting  this may not be ideal for you  It sits right on Kingshighway  so the noise from traffic  including multiple emergency vehicles traveling to or from Barnes Hospital is quite loud  There are a few minor maintenance items the apartment could use  overall the apartment was clean and comfortable   As far as description  this location is very convenient to the Central West end  and close to Barnes Hospital  which is why I was there in the first place  I would include that this location in particular is right on Kingshighway and there is a lot of noise from traffic including emergency vehicles traveling to or from Barnes Hospital   I needed to extend my stay  and unfortunately initially the access code had changed on the door to the apartment  That was rectified fairly quickly  Initially  when I was trying to reserve The apartment I did not get a response  My son actually was able to handle it for me oh  that I should have been able to taking care of that myself  There are no concerns about the address  I think the price was fair  however the cleaning service fees taxes really raised the overall cost of my stay 
706730116,This location was great  And the lighting from the pool area makes the balcony pop  Really wish their check in process went smoother though  Really love your locations but the lack of response was disappointing  Especiallywith how to get in  I had to cal and wait on hold to get the instructions on how to enter the place  Never responded in app  Had to call them  The lack of response was disappointing  But it was a great rate 
632304466,This stay was disappointing   Wifi didn u    t work and host was unresponsive   The host forgot to approval my reservation after check in time 
650581504,Beware  its not whats described and the host does not exist  Please contact me  You over promised and under delivered  No key fob for two days  no washer  dryer for me to use as described  no pool no gym access 
521168271,The place is honestly just not clean  found used qtip  and very expensive  Opt for something else if at all possible  Just clean the place  The cleanliness and attention to details is simply not up to par  You can get a similar room in a private home at half the price 
630264148,Except a cozy stay  just be ready to ask a bunch of questions in regards to checking in 
700937828,No comment 
673523882,This apartment owned by Zencity is in a good location  and it is spatious   just as advertised  Check in is very simple  So is checkout  Once the apartment is cleaned  it is very nice  The view is pretty  Everything is provided for    The reason why my rating for this stay is lower than normal  however  is beacuse I had a very unpleasant and unfortunate experience while staying here  Specifically  when I checked in late at night  the apartment was very dirty  No one had cleaned  The bed sheets were unfolded and dirty  The bathroom was not cleaned  A wet towel was in the kitchen  Cleanliness is something that every user generally cares about when staying at a rental  Cleanliness is of paramount importance nowadays during a global pandemic  where we wish everything was desinfected due to fears of spread of the virus   After giving notice that the apartment was dirty  I was then moved to a different apartment owned by Zencity  and told to stay there until   pm the next day by phone  Unfortunately  there must have been some mistake communicating  as a man then came into my new apartment the next fay while I  a female  slept   This was extremely unnerving  and unsettling    Although I was later told vy Airbnbs support team that he was there for cleaning purposes  I was left very shaken  and frankly feeling unsafe during the rest of my stay  Perhaps this was a one time thing   but its something to consider in the future   Please note that Zencity did refund my cleaning fee  which I appreciated   They did not however offer to compensate for the additional expenses having to move to a different location  nor did they offer compensation for having someone come into my apartment while I slept   Having said this  I do commend the customer service at Zencity for quickly replying  and moving me to a different location for the night  They do answer quickly  and do try to help you out   On whether Id recommend this place for further stays I guess it really does depend  the place is nice  but Id certainly be afraid of this happening again  Perhaps  however  it was a one time thing  Hi   I wanted to let you know that I will leave an honest review of my stay  I have put up front the positive of the apartment  but had to be frank and candid about the situation that unfolded  I did however give credit to your communications team  and kept ir as neutral as possible  Happy to give further feedback as needed 
628802053,Our stay at this apartment was overall fine  The street lights shine right into the bedroom even with the big thick curtains  The specific room we stayed in was right next to an exit and it was loud when people would leave  There were no garbage bags throughout the apartment  mold starting to show in the bathtub  and several little bugs flying around  At some point during our stay I believe the breaker flipped which turned the lights off in the apartment  This wasnt noticed until morning so it wasnt a big deal  The place doesnt have a specific parking spot but plenty of parking around the complex  With all this in mind  it was a very smooth check in and checkout and we had a great time in KC 
711932454,I would not recommend this Airbnb for the following reasons     whole apartment smells of cigarettes    Shower curtain reeks of pee    Toilet was clogged when we arrived    Bedroom fan completely covered in dust    Wrong apartment  different from photos on Airbnb    Popsicle stick found on top ledge of shower    Wifi information was hard to find  It was not labeled  Apartment was a different one than shown in the pictures   Overall the experience was uncomfortable due to the uncleanliness  it not being the same apartment as listed  and the fact that the toilet was clogged when we arrived  I would not recommend staying at this Airbnb 
536440365,decent location  parking wasnt hard to find around property 
621153530,I will not personally ever recommend this place  Horrible experience  Very strict building to be in  No personal space  Room photos look smaller in person  If you want fresh air theres no windows that can be open in this room  Horrible security  Horrible property manager  Just save your time and headache away from this place 
625254886,Stay was what I expected  Location is great in terms of being close to Wash U  if you want to be there   Living space is quite small and walls are paper thin  I was able to hear conversations of next door neighbors  Check in was pretty smooth   Listing stated that it had a gym but the gym was closed and listing wasn u    t updated to reflect the closure         per month for a studio is steep 
652894783,Good location It was not difficult to contact host   There u    s a fireplace in the photo of the living room but in our place the living room looked completely different no fireplace  no bay window in LR  No big deal but it was picturing a different apartment  Being properly cleaned  especially during COVID     and better maintained  air conditioning   A coffee maker would be nice to have as well  This was my first experience with Airbnb so I wasnt sure what to expect  Not sure Ill do it again 
651610312,The rounds of clips  rapid gunfire  drive by shootings  screaming  sirens and murders went on all weekend long   The rounds of clips  rapid gunfire  drive by shootings  screaming  sirens and murders went on all weekend long  
561541264,The place is perfect and I was going to rate it   but in the end my experience soured as I forgot my laptop charger in there while leaving and in spite of multiple requests within an hour of leaving the place to locate it there was no response from the host  I understand its my fault to leave it and the host isnt liable but I would have appreciated any help to find it or a response on whether it was found 
624442734,Overall  a very well decorated place  Cozy and feels like home  Ive stayed in a Zencity air bnb before and it was an amazing experience  However  this time around not so much  This air bnb wasnt properly cleaned at all  Which is very disappointing considering were in a pandemic    No paper towels in the unit  Which was also frustrating because you have to dry your hands somehow after washing them    The padlock to our air bnb was also unresponsive the first night  Meaning  whenever we left we had to leave the door unlocked that night  Thankfully  we werent traveling with any valuables  The was an issue with my air bnbs padlock the first day  If the air bnb was clean and up to par  especially in a pandemic  and if the door was secured upon arrival 
633347480,i enjoy Zencity but this place i didnt like More clean towels and a new mattress it was uncomfortable and sunk in in the middle
700435530,This might get long winded so bear with me  The first thing youll encounter is that the check in instructions to get in arent accurate  Youll have to wait for someone to eventually leave for them to open the door to the hallway you need to get in to access the elevator  Once you overcome that hurdle  youll be let down when you walk into your room  The unit has a prominent smell of cigarette smoke  This is strictly a non smoking until so if you have health reasons or just want a smoke free room for comfort this place is probably not for you  If you are a smoker  you wont be the first to smoke here and will probably get away with it by the look at the response that I got when bringing up this issue  The rug had bread crumbs trash on it  The floors felt like there was a layer of grime on them  The comforter had a yellow stain on it  Speaking of stains  the bedroom and bathroom walls have stains that appear to be from bodily fluids  The shower floor was stained where one would typically stand while showering  Had to get one my hands and knees to scrub the shower floor so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out  Horrible water pressure in the shower by the way  The thermostat was locked so I couldnt make it colder than    degrees  After I contacted the host about this issue it took them two days to lower it to    degrees  By then I had figure out a way to make it cooler  just gotta be a little creative  Another annoying thing was that the light switch for the kitchen also controlled the outlet where the tv was connected to  So you could only watch tv with a huge glare on it  Another workout was found for this issue  Got one of the two extension cords behind the couch and connected it the outlet in the room and ran it under the door  Unplug the tv from the outlet and take the cord out of the plastic cable hider to have enough slack to connect it to the extension cord  Another inconvenience was that the key fob they provided at first didnt allow access to the parking lot or the roof  After the second day they did provide a secondary key that worked for everything but they didnt request permission when dropping it off and just helped themselves in  Even though we werent in the room at the time  its common courtesy to ask when entering the until like other hosts and handy men have  It felt like a violation of our privacy and made us feel uneasy  Other than that the location was good and the aesthetics of the renovations were nice  Please get rid of that awful smoke smell and do a deep cleaning  Update the check in instructions as well as the first key fob that was given since it doesnt give access to the parking lot or the rooftop  Change the stained comforter and clean repaint the stains on the walls  Give better access to the thermostat     degrees is horrible to sleep in   The description states that this is a non smoking unit but the place reeked of cigarette smoke   The instructions to get into the building were accurate but to get into the actual unit  were not  No way to get into the hallway without a key fob following the instructions provided by the host  Took    minutes for someone to be coming out for us the get in  Then the key fob did not open the gate to the parking lot nor to the rooftop  A second key fob was provided after the second day  which raised another concern  Someone when into the unit without authorization  In the past  when the host or a handyman had to get inside the unit permission was requested and only until I granted that permission would they come in  Common courtesy to ask for permission to go into the unit since for all intents and purposes I am in charge and responsible while I pay to stay here  This gave us a sense of having our privacy violated and honestly rubbed us the wrong way  Communication wasnt as fast or as helpful as most Airbnbs  When mentioning about the key fob not working to open the gate to the parking lot  a response wasnt received until someone went into the unit without authorization to drop off the second key fob  Noticed that while we were staying at this Airbnb the price to stay there decreased a bit  After having the complains and inconvenience we mentioned  a partial refund discount would have been appreciated 
626784282,Location was fine but keep in mind if you have a car  it will be a literal nightmare to find a parking spot  Space was average  you get what you pay for 
717225048,The bed wasnt comfortable  the wifi didnt work  and we had a hard time finding the lockbox with the key fob in it because the instructions were unclear The instructions to receive our key fob in lockbox C were unclear  The email said wed have pictures to reference but we never got a picture
700627799,Great stay  but the lack of privacy was a bit scary  All windows should have blinds  Great stay  but the lack of privacy was a bit scary  All windows should have blinds 
653220039,Not the best stay 
654329242,While the location and minimalist style were exactly what we were looking for we were surprised to find that there was a heavy smoke odor in the unit upon our arrival  We found that it was not as strong if we kept the AC off and the windows open  With temps in the   s during the day  we found ourselves feeling pretty uncomfortable from the heat  especially at night since it didnt cool off much  We reached out to Zencity right away with our concern but with a     hour response wait time we felt we lost our window of time to relocate before settling in  They did offer us a small discount on our stay to make up for some of the inconvenience which we appreciated  The shower drain was clogged and the toilet handle was broken which we reported to them as well  Other than these things the apartment was comfortable and we were glad to have a washer dryer in unit  Thank you for the stay  We struggled to feel comfortable  unfortunately  due to the smoke smell which became worse when we turned the air conditioning on  With the higher temps this week  we were left with some restless nights  While we would have liked to have canceled  we were short on time with our work schedule and were not able to find another option close by within our budget  We feel that if the description of the unit included that there was a smoke odor we would have not booked  We hope that it will be addressed for future renters  We also feel that the delay in responding on Monday affected our ability to make a decision to cancel and rebook somewhere else for the week as that was the day that we would have had the most time to do so  We appreciate the offer of a     discount  Please let us know how to proceed with that   Smoke odor 
624668351,Great little spot  nice quiet area close to everything  A little loud as its located by the front door and under the stairs in the basement  but still very enjoyable  Host was super awesome  I would definitely stay here again when im in this city  Enjoyed my stay  only critique I have would be to put a sign on the window behind the couch for people not to bang   knock on your window disturbing guest when they cant get in the front door or the box code is malfunctioning  Thanks again  The electronic keybox  check in was experiencing technical difficulties  but it was doing that for everyone trying to enter not just us  Because of this mishap I had random people knocking on the window all day   night hoping to get my attention  so they could gain entry  I finally made a little paper sign that said stop knocking call your HOST   it stopped lol   Missing Keyfob  so i couldnt access the parking lot   pretty much stayed inside the next day because I didnt want to fight with the electronic keybox  The host offered to bring another by  but it wasnt that big of a deal to me I was teleworking anyway  Overall really cool place  nice area  other than a few minor issues that are easily corrected  I would definitely stay there again  with earphones  
627317436,The unit is basic  Its spacious  There is no air  it is very hot  The temperature outside was in upper   s and lower   s and it was still hot  For this reason  I would not stay there again 
625414631,Very slow to respond to emails and app messages  took   days to get a reply  and no access to a contact telephone number to reach anyone  Even the door man couldnt reach the host     Bad plumbing but otherwise a great stay if you just want to have peace and no interruptions from the host or neighbors  Very slow to respond to emails and app messages  took   days to get a reply  and no access to a contact telephone number to reach anyone  Even the door man couldnt reach the host     Bad plumbing but otherwise a great stay if you just want to have peace and no interruptions from the host or neighbors  Very slow to respond to emails and app messages  took   days to get a reply  and no access to a contact telephone number to reach anyone  Even the door man couldnt reach the host     Bad plumbing but otherwise a great stay if you just want to have peace and no interruptions from the host or neighbors 
627090495,Overall place is very nice and cute my only issue was the pics had a balcony and there wasnt on and the refrigerator was kind of dirty other than that I loved it They need more up to date pics because I booked that Airbnb looking forward to having a balcony to sit out on and enjoy the nice weather  One the pics on the app there was a balcony but the studio didn u    t have one 
646749862,Pros  Great location  Cons  There was a listening  recording device hidden under the desk  No where in the listing does it mention it nor in the apartment  Floors look as if they have not been vacuumed in months  Head board had hand prints  Washer smelt of mildew  Could not park in the gated parking lot because the fob would not work  They brought me a new one and it still didnt work    Before you book on Airbnb check out the Zencity website  Rates are much cheaper and you shouldnt have to pay anything for a dirty and privacy invading space  My suggestion would be to remove the Alexa  any listen  recording devices from the home   hirer a true house keeper   Under the desk was an Alexa  Some sort of device that can easily listen in on conversations or whatever you may do in the air bnb  The concerning part was that it was hidden and NOT mentioned anywhere on the listing or in the apartment  I managed hotels for years privacy is a number one priority for guests  Shame on you   It was upsetting to see the cheaper rate on the  Zincity  website  Ultimately the privacy   cleanliness of the apartment made me feel that I shouldnt have had to pay the higher rate 
711694253,Was it worth the price  Id say so  Will it make everyone happy  No    Bring your own water  The tap water here is not good and there is no filtered water  They put in the post that paid street parking is available but there is a sign that says street parking is by permit only after      so we got a ticket  The doors slam surprisingly loud unless you turn the handle and scotch it closed gingerly  Different neighbors scream bloody murder or let their dog bark loudly every so often  There is a group of homeless people that hang out right outside of the building so just make sure you dont go down alone if youre uncomfortable with that  There is a big lack of toiletries  they left one single use  maybe double use   tiny  tiny bottle of shampoo  conditioner  and body wash for the   of us adults for the week we were here so not much attention to detail  I might have been able to just ask for more and get them delivered but I didnt ask because we brought our own anyway  The chair in the living room was obviously broken  There was something wrong with the heating units because no matter how low we set the temperature  the room got overly hot and dry quickly so we kept them off most of the time  The view was so nice  we had a corner apartment that had a park on both sides and the arch and city could be seen from one window    but the windows were really dirty so I would say it almost ruined the enjoyment we could have gotten from the good view we had  There was a severe lack of supplies in the kitchen  no coffee  no filters  no spices other than s p  a couple cooking tools  The comforter was unwashed because it had crusty red stuff on it  Im hoping that was just Cheetos  One pillow definitely had a dot of blood stain  There was a big lack of outlets in the bedrooms and the one outlet that was in a good place was broken  The building doesnt feel safe but the room made us happy overall  Good location and not any traffic nearby  could be due to less travel     Pretty much everything mentioned our group could look past and we overall liked the place and had a good time  I just wanted to warn anyone else of the possible vacation ruiners before they booked  There was no extra comforter in the closet but its no big deal  accidents happen  Was it worth the price  Id say so  Will it make everyone happy  No    Bring your own water  The tap water here is not good and there is no filtered water  They put in the post that paid street parking is available but there is a sign that says street parking is by permit only after      so we got a ticket  The doors slam surprisingly loud unless you turn the handle and scotch it closed gingerly  Different neighbors scream bloody murder or let their dog bark loudly every so often  There is a group of homeless people that hang out right outside of the building so just make sure you dont go down alone if youre uncomfortable with that  There is a big lack of toiletries  they left one single use  maybe double use   tiny  tiny bottle of shampoo  conditioner  and body wash for the   of us adults for the week we were here so not much attention to detail  I might have been able to just ask for more and get them delivered but I didnt ask because we brought our own anyway  The chair in the living room was obviously broken  There was something wrong with the heating units because no matter how low we set the temperature  the room got overly hot and dry quickly so we kept them off most of the time  The view was so nice  we had a corner apartment that had a park on both sides and the arch and city could be seen from one window    but the windows were really dirty so I would say it mostly ruined the enjoyment we could have gotten from the good view we had  There was a severe lack of supplies in the kitchen  no coffee  no filters  no spices other than s p  a couple cooking tools  The comforter was unwashed because it had crusty red stuff on it  Im hoping that was just Cheetos  One pillow definitely had a dot of blood stain  There was a big lack of outlets in the bedrooms and the one outlet that was in a good place was broken  The building doesnt feel safe but the room made us happy overall  Good location and not any traffic nearby  could be due to less travel     Pretty much everything mentioned our group could look past and we overall liked the place and had a good time  I just wanted to warn anyone else of the possible vacation ruiners before they booked 
624544419,Well I paid for my place little did I know they gave me wrong codes answered my text or my emails with automated responses and then at the very end they offered me     of my money back which I thought was a joke if I gave them     of their apartment back after renting it they would not have been very happy about that but since Im a great guest and I always leave my places in excellent condition  why would they think I would be happy with that offer
627041991,Great location and nice apt  The air never worked and it never was less than    in the apt at any time  They were hard to get timely replies  Will not stay here again due to the air issue  The apt was great but the air never worked  Was trying to get someone out there to check it out and it was nearly impossible to get timely replies  The temperature never dropped below    
627318602,Good place with a low price  Unfortunately during my stay the host was very slow to respond  and it seems as if they werent prepared for people to stay  Good location  but parking was pretty hard to find since its only street parking by the building 
625103791,Nice loft and great price  Issues trying to get in caused a bit of stress  luckily a tenant helped us get in  Everything was clean minus the bathroom  short curly hair all over the shower and floor  Location is great for downtown exploring   Needed a key fob to use the elevator and therefore couldnt get up to the room until we caught someone going up who lived there  Also  key pad to get in building didnt work  again had to wait on someone to come in so we could get in   See note above
633372971,Nice location  But a pain to check in and communication was not great 
627690827,Great location  Difficult Check in instructions  very hard bed and furniture  Clean and well equipped room  Loved then wine opener and creamer and coffee  Ultimately I couldnt get comfortable  There are screws on the bed that poke out on the right side  I really scraped my knee and the bed and sofa are very hard and firm   I was under the impression there was a person of contact  You have to figure out everything yourself  check yourself in using codes   Once you figure out the code to open the initial door the elevator doesnt let you up  Comfortable furniture
576177558,We chose this because of the very ideal location and price  Walking distance to several places and nice area at a nice price  a win win  right  Overall it was a good stay  but had a few issues   The first one was the description showcased a dedicated parking spot behind the building as we are a band on tour this was a big selling point to secure our van and music equipment  We arrived to a car already parked there and upon messaging were informed to park somewhere else in a paid lot  This was fine  but not what was expected  The next issue was the doors touchscreen keypad which we didnt realize was the keypad and tried the wrong door initially  made for a bit of a laugh even though it was      AM   Then we tried the correct door and the code didnt work even after multiple attempts  After messaging the host the code magically worked    Upon entering  the space looked like the photos albeit not quite as clean  Just seemed slightly dusty and not as pristine  but not a huge deal  Just a slight disappointment  but we got over it because it was overall nice and beds were all clean and we were tired  In the morning shower time saw us struggling with a showerhead that lacked pressure and only partially worked  Then when trying to do some work the wifi password didnt work   regardless of the device  I sent a message and the response was to use the WiFi we had been trying with the same password  I followed back with that it didnt work  no further help  Aside from those issues  everything else was great  The location was perfect for us walking around and a short walk to the CTA and etc  I would definitely not mind staying there again for the price and if I was not on tour concerned about parking  Overall good stay  but theres an issue with the WiFi  the door code not working right away  the seemingly included parking spot that isnt actually included  and the not fully functional shower head made for a not as ideal stay  Location and price are perfect though   WiFi is included but the password didnt work no matter what device and the only help was an auto reply stating the same password that didnt work  The listing also alludes to a dedicated parking space but upon arrival it was occupied and after messaging we were informed to find a pay to park lot instead  The cherry on top was the shower head lacking pressure and not working very well    Initially we tried the wrong door  completely our fault   but it wasnt clear the door had a touch screen keypad that went dark so wasnt very apparent to use  Upon entering the code very carefully several times it didnt work  We messaged the host and then mid messaging back and forth about the issue the door magically worked  It seems the code hadnt been activated or something along those lines  Communication was quick even at      am but some of the responses were auto reply type responses  Not a huge issue though and we had our issues resolved except for the WiFi  If all the amenities were included worked it would be flawless 
258647394,The place was very good and clean  Very accessible to nearby landmarks  They had all the necessary kitchen items and towels   Only two concerns      the new safety lock pin and gate pin could have been provided in a single email or within airbnb messages rather than sent separately   I understand the safety but when you provide the pin it could all be together  So we had this issue and had to reach him through message  however there was no response for atleast a few hours  Finally I figured out the other email which had the instructions to enter       the AC thermostat was making a loud noise all through the night every time it kickstarted   Otherwise it was a good stay and everyone in the family enjoyed  Beautiful home  Please take a look at the Ac  heaters thermostat noise which was very annoying all through the night   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  Additional comments   u   cAC   Hester thermostat u   d   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements  Additional comments   I wish all the pin details come in one email or in the airbnb messages itself   
710609375,It wasnt as clean as I expected  Other then that it was ok  It definitely was not what I expected as far as cleanliness  During COVID time there shouldnt have been anything on the floors  It led me to believe they didnt clean from last guest  The house was not how it looked on AirBNB 
624944548,This was my first time getting an Airbnb and I have to say for it to be the first time it did not go as well as it should especially since it was my birthday  The host was very dramatic and very paranoid about the amount of cars that were outside he acted as if there were cars covering the entire block and I had a huge gathering or party or something overall he was very strict  and it didnt help that he lived only   houses down  I have to say if I am going to do this again it will have to be a way more private and secluded area  My gmail account couldnt reply back  Was having issues communicating with the host 
714125531,They cancelled my reservation hours before I was supposedly to get there  They cited  maintenance issues   I asked what kind of maintenance issues they were and why they would take all five of the days that I had reserved  They had no answer  I had to settle for another place  as it was the last minute and I needed a place to stay  Very stressful and disappointing 
629714701,Location was good  Walkable to restaurants  starbucks and forest park  There was a constant party upstairs  we could Smell drugs in the hallway every night  We were not disturbed but a little hesitant to go out late   The place needs to be cleaned though  The ceiling fans were a dusty mess  We switched them on only to be showered with dust balls for a whole day  The hall bath shower sprayed water all over the bathroom so we had to clean the floors after every shower   The kitchen is NOT well equipped  The unit sleeps   and has only   dinner plates    coffee mugs and   salad plates  No serveware either  Because of the current situation we were trying not to eat out and had to buy paper products to make up for the lack of kitchen supplies   If a place can sleep     which we indicated on our reservation  there should be   dinner plates  mugs and all kitchen utensils  The kitchen was NOT well equipped    dinner plates and   coffee mugs was VERY inconvenient   nThe bedrooms had no curtains   the morning sun was so strong we could not sleep past   am  The windows in the living room was missing blinds   nThe hall bath shower was explosive     The water would splash all over the bathroom when one person showered so we were constantly cleaning the floor   Check in instructions said to look for a phone on the left of the first door  It on the right  We emailed to ask if they could come with some drapes to put on the windows and NO RESPONSE It needs to be cleaned and drapes installed
609264686,Thank you for hosting my friends and I  I loved the decor which was simple and modern  Everything we needed i e  towels  utensils  soap etc was there  It truly felt like a hotel stay  We had a small hiccup with the heater not working upon arrival but Chris was very responsive and sent someone right away to fix the problem  I will definitely come back    We found a lot of hair in the bed sheets and some stains as well  Made it very uneasy to sleep in  Other than that    everything was great 
629613866,Do not stay here  Entry box was broken and I couldnt get in  Host owner called me back two hours later and called me a fucken bitch because I was unhappy that I was locked out  I am   months pregnant and drove    hours to attend my sisters funeral only to be cussed out  lose money and not have anywhere to stay  I am devastated  Go out of business  This was listed as luxury  upscale  Instead the box was broken and I couldn u    t get into building   Box was broken  Called the owner host for access  Im  months pregnant and drove    hours for a funeral  Only to be called a fucken bitch when I called the host owner and was threatened by him as well  I ended up not having a place to stay during the trip  Owner was rude  irate and unorganized  Called me back hours later only to blame me for not accessing the unit  Called me a bitch and threatened me  Place is run down and entry box is broken  I took pictures so there is proof  I was never able to stay in the unit and lost money and had nowhere to stay for my sisters funeral 
653182904,     be aware it is next to a metro station  it is quiet enough where you cannot hear it  There needs to be an extensive cleaning before anyone is allowed to stay there  Covid isnt a joke  The cleaniness and condition was pathetic and dangerous with an  ongoing pandemic   Many of the photos showed furniture in good condition  When we arrived a chair was broken and hidden in the closet  We were also unaware the apartment was next to the train station   An attempt to contact hosts with some issues was met with no response during stay  Although they were responsive prior to check in and with a refund for a night  The quality and condition of furniture left a distaste  There were many knicks in the walls  There was dust on the books and magazines left by the nightstand  Dishes and utensils needed extra cleaning and replacing 
634036427,This place was loud and felt uncomfortable  There was constant noise from other apartments and the hallway  as well as from inside the apartment  creaky floorboards and loud thuds from the air conditioner  Our sleep was so interrupted that it aided us in leaving a few days early   The apartment was not clean or stable  The decor was very cheap  A lamp fell out of the wall randomly one morning   Strangely enough  theres a garbage disposal but no switch to turn it on in plain sight  we checked everywhere  even in cabinets    The washing machine and dryer had missing knobs  rendering it hard to use and understand    Jacuzzi tub was amazing  The highlight of our stay    Property manager randomly stopped by to check our water heater  It put us in a very uncomfortable situation to allow a man we didnt know  and had no knowledge of  come inside of the apartment  This was an issue never addressed by the host  despite me sending multiple messages about it    Overall  very unwelcoming stay  but had the basics  Beds were fine  we washed the sheets and pillowcases after immediately noticing an odd smell to them  Towels and washcloths being provided was a plus  Basic dishes and utensils also provided   Much of the decor was cheap  the lamp fell out of the wall on our third day there  The washer and dryer has knobs pulled off rendering it hard to use   The host was very slow to respond  I often had to send follow up messages for simple requests such as   Where could I put the trash   Two inquires of mine were never addressed

631541148,The stay itself was great  I love loved the living room decor and the kitchen  The kitchen wear was very suitable  I love to cook so it felt nice not being forced to order fast food  The apartment was close to everything I wanted to get to  I only left in my car once my entire stay  Other than that I didnt move my car   My only qualm about my stay was some cleanliness issues and repairs  That is the only reason I rated my stay so low  I truly wanted to give ZenCity a   star rating    All in all the living room and kitchen were to die for  Thats definitely where I spent most of my time  I also appreciated how quick their communication was  None of my answers went unnoticed  The apartment over all was very well put together  I loved the living room furniture  the kitchen and the pillows on the bed were amazing  however  I could not get over the bathrooms cleanliness and blinds off of the kitchen   The bathroom appeared to be clean  and unfortunately I didnt get a picture because when I walked in I immediately needed to use the restroom  but the toilet had dried urine all over it  There was urine splattered all over the seat as if it had been there for quite a while  no exaggeration  Also with everything going on in the world it made me question the rest of the cleanliness of the apartment   The blinds really need to be replaced  There were many missing and it made it very bright in the apartment and not the best privacy  It made walking past it as workers work across the way a little uneasy   The over all stay was okay  maybe a little better than okay  Im not certain Ill come back unless these issues are prohibited  Again it was a beautiful living area  I loved lovvvved how it was so close to everything I wanted to be close to and your communication was amazing   If youd like to reach out to me about further details from my stay please feel free to contact me   Kind regards  Dalvonda Better cleanliness  
627483199,This location is GORGEOUS  Truly stunning  well staged in a great building   However  getting into the building is a formidable challenge at best  If you arrive late on a weekend be prepared to park on the street if you can find parking as this location is downtown  You must then enter into a garage and then get keys from a box and then trek through an office building to correct elevator banks   The biggest issue was that our unit was DIRTY  I sent pictures and contacted someone and was told it would be cleaned and it never was  I was then told I could not have a refund on the cleaning fee as I had to clean Urine and fecal matter off both the toilets  change the sheets  clean the counter tops and after that I gave up  The showers were dirty  long hair everywhere  It was just dirty  point blank period   The fan in the guest bathroom never turned off and rattled like it was going to project itself out of the ceiling at any point    I received a text about the tv being too loud before the cleaning issue was addressed and thats unacceptable    The staff with Zencity was friendly  and one gentleman helped me with the key situation so I was appreciative of that  Im disappointed that no one came to clean while I was there  Nor is the cleaning fee being refunded as I had to clean myself    The space is stunning and worth the price  if it was clean  It was literally like Fort Knox getting into this building  Super secure but took Atleast    minutes initially due to difficult lockers
650624906,My initial experience was quiet pleasant  The apartment was nice and neat  The location was convenient as well  most restaurants were in the area  Checking in was easy and it was great using the gym in the unit  Unfortunately  the microwave was dirty which caused me to not use it at all and after a couple of days of staying there  Ive encountered another issue related to the cleanliness of the apartment  As a result  I no longer wanted to spend the rest of my stay there    I contacted the host immediately and left a couple of voicemail messages  It took about     hours for the host to return my calls  He was respectful and great as far as listening to my concerns  He assured me that he would have a cleaning crew come in and assess the situation  My guest and I were greatly accommodated with a new apartment for the night  However  I had   more days left to my visit and there was a lack of communication when it came to what the host planned for the rest of my stay as the apartment that I was allowed to stay in for the night was recently booked for the next couple of days    I admit that things happen that may be out of ones control   the host did the best he could given the circumstances  I received a refund for the remainder of my stay  the process was very smooth  The second apartment is similar to the first and it was clean and nice as well  I appreciate how great you were considering the circumstances 
672974944,The place was comfortable for one person not two and if your not from here its in a bad area The place was comfortable for one person not two The key was not in the box we had to go through a whole thing just to check in
659090502,There are better places in the area for the cost   It was not kept up like shown in the pictures   Overall OK   I wont book with Zencity again  but will go local  You need to send a worker in to fix things up  replace light bulbs  and do regular maintenance
634034966,great area and spacious loft 
629902673,While this place had a very cool vibe there were some issues that I feel people should know about  One of the toilets was clogged for   days   The plumber came the first day and said he had to have another plumber come to use a snake   Then I heard from no one for another day   I sent several messages to Zencity with no response for    hours or more   He finally came the third morning I was here and he had a plunger   no snake   He fixed the toilet in   minutes     There was a party on one night next door that was so loud I could not sleep   Loud music and loud bass with over       people   If you are looking for a relaxing  quiet place this is not the place   Zencity said they would call in a noise violation around midnight   The party ended around           am   The ad says black out blinds and drapes but the blinds are clearly not black out   There are black out draperies on some windows but not all of them   The tracks are there for all windows but it appears many have been removed and never replaced  The draperies are black out but the blinds are not   Clearly bright street lights come in these large windows at night and bright sun in the mornings      The place  while having a very cool vibe  has not been kept up very well in my opinion   There are lots of burnt out light bulbs and cracked mirrors on the bedroom closet doors and a broken chair    I did ask for a refund for a part of my   day stay there due to these issues and didnt ever get a response to that    This was only my second time using Airbnb and the experience was just ok   The ad says black out blinds and drapes but the blinds are clearly not black out and the blinds dont match   some being really cheap mini blinds   There are not draperies on every window just some    I was wondering why have them at all if they are not going to be on all windows  The tracks were there on each window so it appeared they had once been there and some had been removed  The drapery are black out but the blinds are not   Clearly bright street lights come in these large windows at night and bright sun in the mornings   One Toilet was clogged for   days   the cleaning person told me as I entered the space   The plumber came the first day and said he had to have another plumber come to use a snake   Then I heard from no one for   more day  including sending messages to Zencity with no response for    hours or more   He finally came the third morning I was here and he had a plunger   no snake   He fixed the toilet in   minutes   It didnt take long to fix so not sure why it took so long for him to get there the second time  If you are looking for a quiet place do not book this  There was a party on one night next door that was so loud I could not sleep   Loud music and loud bass with over       people  Zencity did say they would call into the management to report a noise violation once I called them around midnight   The noise finally died down around          am    Again  cool vibe but not sure about the host as they sometime responded but often were very slow in responding   waiting    hours for a response is too long in my opinion   I did ask for a refund of some of my money for all of these issues and never heard back from anyone about that 
624619388,Id recommend for the value Over all it was great just irritated about having to stand outside for    mins trying to figure out how to get in  And the smell was weird The speaker was broken so we could not get into the building  Even if it was working you need the key fob that is in the room to make the elevators work  A security fairs had to assist us  Thankfully he was there
713114362,Not bad    Cigarette smoke all throughout the apartment
634015917,Its mostly an OK place  but the WiFi was spotty when we were there and the bathroom door knob fell off from the outside and often trapped one of us in there until the other could fix the door from the other side   The bathroom door needs repairs as the knob falls off from the outside frequently  The person I picked up the key from didnt have my name on their list The bathroom door not being broken  also the WiFi was spotty and the place smelled like cigarettes
658523246,There were a  multitude of issues that werent addressed  First and foremost  this place is advertised with AC but that is not the case  The unit in the living room is so tiny  it doesnt even cool off the living room and attached kitchen adequately  When I brought this up  I was told by Zencity that they would have maintenance come and install at least   AC unit  if not   in the two bedrooms  The way the place is set up  the bedrooms are down a hallway from the living area   there is no way in hell this tiny unit would be able to cool the bedrooms  The towel rack was broken  They said maintenance would also fix that  MAINTENANCE NEVER CAME  We slept on the floor of the living room because the bedrooms were so hot  Which caused me to have neck and back pain  Its one thing to have an issue  its another to make promises and not deliver  They also said that there was a fan in the closet   there was no fan when we got home on Friday night  We found   blood stains on the rug and a used condom wrapper on the floor of one bedroom  We had issues checking in as there was no key to the building in the lockbox nor instructions on the alternate way of getting into the building  Also  after sleeping on the floor and picking up the comforter to clean up the space  it was filthy underneath  I dont think the floor has been vacuumed in some time which made me even more nervous because of covid  While they were timely in their responses to my concerns  none of them were actually fixed  Their solution was to let us leave on Saturday and get a small refund  not even     saying it didnt  seem like a good match   We were there for a funeral and did not have the time or the mental space to search for another place and move all of our things  This is the first time Ive had a negative experience with Airbnb  I still love Airbnb but definitely not this place  You need to get your stuff together  One problem after another  that you did not address  You made promises that were not kept  Im very disappointed   There is a tiny AC unit in the living room that was so small and weak  it did not even cool the living room and attached kitchen adequately  The way the space is set up  the two bedrooms are down the hall from the living room   there is NO WAY even a high end AC unit would be able to get to them  When I called about it  I was told that maintenance would come and install at least   unit  if not   in each of the bedrooms  Maintenance never came  I was told via messenger that there was a fan in the closet that we could certainly use and when I returned  there was no fan either  Maintenance did not come on Friday when we checked in nor Saturday  I did not sleep well either night as we slept on the floor   and in fact  had neck and back pain   There was no key to the building front door in the lockbox  There were detailed instructions on getting the key to getting in the front door to actually getting inside the unit  But there was no key to the front door  I re read the instructions a few times and finally called ZenCity  I was told the  code  to get into the building after waiting on hold and waiting in the heat outside  If their instructions were so detailed  why werent they updated in the instructions  They later told me that the last tenant  took the key   I dont believe that for a minute  Communication was good and somewhat timely but it was all lies  They promised maintenance would come with   AC units and would fix the towel rack  That never happened  Its one thing to have issues which can happen  its another to make promises and not deliver on said issues  Its completely unprofessional  If you advertise AC  then there should be adequate AC which there wasnt  Every host should be cleaning more than thoroughly with covid in the air  If there is a problem  fix it   they just made a bunch of empty promises  This was the worst Airbnb experience Ive ever had  Truly disappointed  The  solution  they had was attempt to kick us out on Saturday before our departing day of Sunday  saying  it wasnt a good fit   We were there for a funeral   there was no time or energy to look for a new place and move all of our things in between going to the wake and funeral  How about you just deliver on what you promise  I believe we should get a     refund for the problems we had   Airbnb was not helpful either 
631152930,This has the perfect location and view   Parking is a hassle but theres decent parking nearby   Theres water damage in the bathroom ceiling over the shower and ceiling pieces chipping away which was the only real damage in the unit   Overall I was pleased but it wasnt as high quality as I expected for where its located and how the pictures looked  I would have appreciated better communication about how I was charged after the fact   Ill always pay for anything that is my fault but I asked for a call and didnt get one   The space was very nice and simple  however not nearly as high quality as the photos portray   Before my stay the response time was fantastic  after the stay I was charged for dirty towels  which is what I thought the towels are for    and I asked to speak on the phone with someone and never was called   Also  I left my laptop and had to ask three times what time I could pick it up over a    hour time period I believe 
673434796,The good  bad and ugly  Location is great  the apt is run down and not stocked up at all  Listing says quiet time after   pm and yes  there is a bar downstairs bit its more of a club   Loud music banging the apt till  am almost every night  Good luck sleeping  Not bar downstairs  its a club  Goes almost   nights till  am  Good luck sleeping 
627129594,When arriving to the apartment I noticed the floors were very sticky so I took it upon myself to sweep and mop  The mop water came out brown  There was also hair that was not mine in the bed  This was disappointing since I had messaged the host requesting an early check in but was told no because the place needed to be cleaned but I arrived to a not clean place  Other than that it wasnt too bad 
633642886,The place was nice and clean but while checking in I had difficulties getting the key out the locke box   st the code didnt work  Then I call them and they provided me a new code then come to find out the key wasnt there and I was told the key will be in the room  the housekeeper had the key the whole time  Basically the whole check in time was really inconvenient and took time out of what I was there for   The number to the key box didnt work  Then the key wasnt in the key box  The whole time the housekeeper had it  The number to key box provided didnt work and key wasnt in there
635017522,Central to plaza and downtown   Parking may be an issue  If more than   adults are staying    key is not enough and certainly there should be   bath towels per person   Spot hero and the other parking app had no parking availability n parking was an issue     adults checked in on Friday only   bath towels and   key for the unit messages host but did not get a response until Monday  Host stated they would bring towels n key but never did   We had to go buy towels  Having bath towels
512688252,First the good  this house is in a great neighborhood   Lots of restaurants and things to do   The apartment also has three large bedrooms   However  the unit is not well maintained   First  the unit does not have its own internet router   The internet is taken from a business on the first floor  the unit is on the third floor    The reception was so weak we could not connect our devices   Even worse  the TV is on a sling  so the TV did not work because the internet did not work   Other problems  when we arrived the deadlock was exposed  in other words the steel plate was not installed  which I imagine is a security problem  though Im no expert   The overhead light did not work in the living room and a light was burned out in one of the living room   Maybe the worst is that the host simply did not respond when I pointed out the internet problem  I didnt even bother raising the other issues    Basically  this place had the potential to be great  but mismanagement made it a disappointment for me and my friends   This apartment does not have its own Internet   It uses it from a business located on the first floor  but the apartment was on the third floor  and the reception was terrible   The TV had sling  not cable  so the apartment was without internet and without cable the entire stay   We only got the code when I specifically asked a couple hours prior to check in  The host did not respond when I pointed out that there was no Internet and no cable  actually having the amenities posted 
653501835,Great location  Need some updating  Dear Zencity Team  as per my text messages  you should fix the apartment first  paint the walls  fix the oven  change the carpet to finish the strong smell of cigarette  and really deep clean it  The location is great and you guys have a great customer service  The apartment as is now  is damaging your business   The photos were not from the same apartment  There was a picture from a kitchen with white tiles and a kitchen table  The kitchen was brown and no table at all  The oven was not working   Location was great  When I arrived and was disappointed with the condition of the apartment  the staff from Zencity was very responsive and accommodating Pictures need to reflect the reality  The place needs to be deep cleaned  There is a strong smell of cigarette that the Zencity Team needs to fix it 
497590182,The location is amazing  Its so quiet and ducked off  Beautiful area and peaceful  Love love the place but beware of security alarm going off if you dont unlock it correctly or try to check and make sure its locked  More clear instructions on how to work the lock and securing the lock  Every single time we tried to step out or make sure the door was locked  the security alarm went off and would not go off no matter how many times we put in the code  Very annoying for us and probably other guest 
631841518,The apartment overall was nicely decorated   very minimalist  but all you need for a few day stay  Its in an apartment building so youre among other tenants  just an FYI   Check in was easy  You also have access to the apartment building amenities  which was a nice bonus  although they were a bit dated and dirty  mainly fitness center   Location was nice   right next to Forest Park and close to lots of restaurants and a Whole Foods  Here comes to bad   the place looked like it hadnt been cleaned  particularly vacuumed in weeks   The floors were covered in dust dirt hairs  especially gross in the bathroom   to the point where I had to whip out the vacuum they had stored in the closet and clean it myself the first night just to feel clean enough walking around  The apartment is a bit old  which is fine  but the bathroom could use a bit of a facelift renovation  We were in town briefly for a funeral and were not expecting needing anything too high end  but this even grossed out my husband  who isnt the cleanest of people  I also sent a message to the host before we even arrived asking a question and never heard back  Had it not been for the affordable price  I probably wouldnt have given it   stars   The place overall was nice upon first glance  nicely decorated in a minimalist style  The only thing that caught me off guard  aside from the cleanliness  was the bathroom that definitely needs a good upgrade   I sent a message to the host before we ever arrived and I never heard back  If the place has actually been thoroughly cleaned before we arrived 
635512070,Pending    Follow up contact was less than desirable 
671230159,Great location  Unfortunately there was a strong scent of smoke in the unit which was extremely hard to mask with candles  It was not pleasant to arrive to  The only thing that kept this from being better thank expected was the smell  When we entered on Thursday there was an intense smell of smoke  It was in every room and could smell it in the sheets  Seemed as though someone had been smoking in the unit prior to our arrival  We bought several candles on Friday to mask the scent for the weekend  The place fit our needs but the stench was unfortunate 
633015624,I would never suggest booking with this host  They are very dishonest and will not respond to legit concerns  Our place did not have lights in the bathroom for   days  They never came out to fix it  We had to use our phones as flashlights to shower  They told us that it was not an emergency  Who does that   There was only one set of towels for   adults  Our reservation got changed a day before we came into town  I tried reaching out to the host only to be ignored  They are very shady and I will never stay at their properties in the future  They ruined my first time in St  Louis  Also the photos that they post is all smoke and mirrors  The place is sooooo much smaller than the pictures depict  Cheaply made furniture and there was damage to the property as soon as we got there  The bathroom had a dirty tub and dried up poop stuck on the toilet  Renters Beware     You guys suck  You ruined me and my friends first visit to St  Louis  I will never be back  I hope you all are happy with my hard earned money  Businesses like yours will never prosper because all you care about is money and not the actual person  I saved up for months for this trip just to have it ruined  I hope you can sleep well at night knowing how you operate your business   Our booking got switched the day we came into town  This was not our original booking  They moved us from the heart of downtown to the   Hood    They would not respond to any messages about the mix up  We were forced to stay there because they only wanted to refund less than half of our money  I will definitely be contacting the Better Business Bureau about this host and Air B B   We had no lights in the bathroom for three days  They told us that it was not an emergency and that they wouldnt be able to fix it  We had to shower and get dressed using our phones as flashlights  I was hosting this trip for my friends  can you imagine how embarrassing this whole experience was    The placed us in a bad neighborhood  This was not the original listing that I signed up for  I paid almost      to stay   days in a cramped  dirty  dark apartment  I will never rent with Zencity again  I took so many pictures to back up what took place  I also have every screenshot from the constant contact that I tried to make with the host  Very unprofessional and dismissive 
712890974,My stay was ok  The kitchen in the apartment could have been cleaner but other than that no complaints   There were gnats in the apartment that were kind of annoying  Other than that the stay was ok   The space could have been cleaner thats pretty much the biggest feedback I would say 
607405331,This place has a lot of potential if they clean it up and get some better furnishings in it   The furniture thats in the picture isnt the same in some rooms   It needs a thorough cleaning  This was my first bad Airbnb experience  You have to do a better job at maintaining cleanliness  The furnishings need to be fixed and updated  This listing doesnt Have the same furnishings as the pictures   The places needs a thorough cleaning 
618135094,The room was awesome  Clean and set up nicely   It took some effort to get to the room   Horrible instructions to get into building and to the room   I had to have another tenant of the building let me into the building  Then the elevator doesnt work without the fob   which is waiting in the room so had to take steps to get to room  At checkout    am  I enter the hallway where a woman is waiting and asks if Im checking out   I said yes and she said she has that room now    Note   She is going into room that hasnt been cleaned between guests   This was my first air bnb experience   I dont know if Ill do it again  The place was awesome  I just wish the instructions  were clear as to how to get into the place  Also someone came into the room when I was getting ready to leave at checkout time   Apparently she had rented the room for that day   When I left she was out in the hall and asked   Are you checking out     I said yes   And thought well shes walking into someplace that hasnt been cleaned between guests   I would have left if I were her   This was my first time doing this and it wasnt the best overall experience  You can do better   loved the room though  The instructions said to punch the apt   into keypad inside front doors to get into building   This didnt work   Someone let me in   Then to get to the floor of apt the elevator wouldnt work without the fob so had to take steps to get to room   None of this was explained   One to room I punched in code  got in and the fob is there   It shouldnt be like this  No real issues here other than unclear instructions Location
585298417,Great spot for a weekend in STL in a walkable  cute neighborhood  The apartment was perfect but the building is still being renovated so there is debris in the hallways  Otherwise the apartment was nicely decorated and we enjoyed our stay  Also  we were woken by the fire alarm at     am and decided to leave for the airport early  as it took almost    minutes for the fire department to arrive  During our last morning  the fire alarm was triggered throughout the entire building at      am  It was going off for    minutes before we just decided to pack the car and leave a few hours earlier than anticipated  In addition  the hallways were littered with construction materials  The shower was also extremely low pressure and I had to pay     to have my hair washed at a local barber shop  Thank you for understanding  We still have yet to hear back from the host 
633121009,Nice location and spacious layout  The place reeked Id smoke  there were bottle caps on the balcony  ash on the bedside table  and a condom wrapper on the floor  I requested money back but have yet to hear back from Zencity  Going to report to Airbnb if I do not hear back soon 
634334623,Do not book  You will get a roulette of apartments none of which will be cleaned  Do yourself a favor  dont book with Zencity  Wow   This is not the unit I booked on air bnb  This is a false advertisement with no contact with the host what so ever  
642920476,great location in hyde park  very close to the lake  very large airbnb  it is a very old building  no central air but have window units  great easy check in  luckily we found decent street parking    only complaint is  there was no paper towel  we had to buy our own and there were ants coming from the window in the first bedroom and some in the kitchen  i found couple ants on the bed  we did not use the first bedroom  we ended up cleaning the kitchen and tried to clear up the ants in the first bedroom  i communicated with the host and no refund for the cleaning and the building manager did not come and talked to us 
653550309,There were several items of trash left behind from previous guests and a few dishes that were left unwashed  usually wouldnt be that big of a deal but I would expect proper sanitation during a global pandemic  The sound throughout the whole apartment is connected as well since the rooms arent completely divided and the echo makes EVERYTHING loud and clear  Wasnt a deal breaker either but it just wasnt what we were expecting and I wish that was more accurately described in the listing   We also chose this place specifically for wifi access and were unable to connect to the internet the entire stay  the hosts were also not super helpful with this and only responded to our concerns once our stay was already almost over  There was also no battery in the smoke detector which could potentially be a major safety concern  The code to access the building also didnt work      of the time which was really annoying  Other than this it was an okay place to stay  the location was great but maybe just get a hotel or look for a place that actually cares about their guests enjoyment and safety   The fact that rooms were not fully separated and sound throughout the entire apartment was connected was not mentioned in the description or accurately depicted in photos  Wifi was one of the main reasons we chose this listing however the internet didnt work our entire stay  
634255763,If you want to wait outside the unit for an hour and have soaking wet carpet that smells awful this is the place for you  The only thing that was good about this Airbnb was the kitchen  I suggest making sure everything actually works and smells nice in your units before giving them to visitors  Carpet was soaking wet and left an awful smell  and air conditioning did not work   Lock did not work to get into unit  Had to wait an hour to be switched to a different unit that seemed like they just cleaned while we were waiting  I would reccomend this place be listed at    
670210965,Unfortunately  we had a male use the key code we had to come into the house and as two sisters staying there  it was very unsettling  The next morning we also found cockroaches  If these two incidents were taken care of and prevented  then I would recommend this place but cannot until this is dealt with  We had a man break into the house using the same key code that you gave us  He came into the house and closed the door before we got over to the stairs and he let us know he was in the wrong house  While this seemed to be an innocent mistake  there have been people who use this approach to check to see if a house is a good place to come back to and burglarize  My sister and I did not feel safe in this house after that and its very concerning that someone else would have the same key code that we did to this place  I messaged you immediately and never heard a response which is also very disappointing   The next morning we also found cockroaches in the kitchen drawers  the brown banded ones  Im not sure why we would be paying an     cleaning fee  which Im sure each customer is paying and still find cockroaches in a house   Both of these were very disappointing because both of us were very excited to stay and were ready to book again until these two incidents occurred  Check in communication was great  I however did not get any response to my concerns about someone breaking into the house 
636859402,Great location Thanks for hosting 
651044591,The apartment is smelly   elevator is dirty   nasty   common area is just horrendous  Parking is difficult to find   street parking   I paid      for two horrible nights  Read the cleaning fee and parking accommodations before renting   not worth it   
638439132,The place was  decent  looks can be deceiving  Doors was off  Drain was clogged in bathroom  Paint job was not the best in apartment  Need better pool sticks  Chairs did not match height of kitchen table  If the place was a cheaper price it would be worth it  Everything in the home was working properly and looked as good as the pictures 
619226255,Shakey wife situations
714122670,Its a cool little apartment  location is within walking distance to a lot of stuff you can do in downtown KC  Not great in terms of responsiveness of host value we paid at the time      a night   bedroom fan and light remote didnt have a battery the whole vacation so we couldnt use the fan or light  even though we messaged the host on the first day  Also the garbage disposal didnt work at all and sink got backed up with normal use  That was the last afternoon we realized it  so a little more understandable as to why it wasnt fixed before we left  A little strange that none of the windows crack open  and the fire alarm seemed to be detached broken from the wall  Great location  cool building  just seems like the Zencity owners maybe havent really put in the time to make sure the place is consistently functioning  thanks for the weekend  had some hiccups but it ended up working out in the end Just for what we paid at the time      per night  but now its listed as     so not sure what happened there   it didnt end up being an experience quite worth the value of what we were paying for
704664912,This Airbnb was a very interesting concept  Its in a great location and is very charming  However  the instructions on how to get into the building are rather confusing and most of the dishes in the kitchen were dirty or still had food on them  so I had to rewash all of them before I could use them  The bathroom is super cute though and theres a good diner within walking distance from the place  so that was nice  The automated response never sent so I was on the phone with them right before I was supposed get on a plane and immediately go to the Airbnb  and the instructions were different on the photo they sent me than they were in the description they also sent  The guy on the phone was super nice though and very helpful for both times I called  So customer service was very good 
640223813,nice place but bring your own toilet paper  host is slow at responding or doesnt respond at all  place is hard to find 
640065843,It was ok A microwave and Netflix logged us out for to many users The bathroom could have been more updated and the floors were dirty
650182512,Do not rent from these people They are liars and deceivers  What they advertise is a lie  I have a medical condition which excludes me for the governor of wearing a mask I went into the building and was thrown out of the  building because I couldnt wear a mask  They did not tell me this  Nothing was open as they advertise it was  And they wanted to charge my account without my approval when I never stayed in the room  Beware there are plenty of places do not spend it with these people they will steal your money and will not give you a refund  Beware You are the worst place I have ever engaged  Your lies and your deception will catch up with you  Taking money from peoples accounts and lying to them is unacceptable and it will come back to you   They lied about everything they advertised nothing was open  Terrible just terrible just terribleTerrible No  These people lied about this place  False advertisement  I never stayed at the place and yet they still wanted to charge me on my credit card and I never authorized it  Dont stay with these people
703927121,The photos no longer accurately portray the current condition of this unit  There is a large patched hole in the wall behind the front door  there is an open golf ball sized hole to the left of the bed  the art hanging above the bed has cracked glass plastic  one of the Breuer chairs in the kitchen scraped a long  deep gash into the wall  The unit smelled so strongly of bleach we had to open both windows  turn on the kitchen and bathroom fans  and leave while it aired out  All   building entry doors did not work so we had to call twice to be let into our unit at the time of check in  The stovetop burners had sauce on them  and the silverware had food on them  If this all doesnt bother you  the location is great  right next to the Belmont stop of the blue line  and getting a Spothero lot will save you on a consistent parking space if you bring a car  Update your listing photos as they are not transparent of the homes current conditions  change your cleaning team so they dont poison anyone with bleach  and replace the broken art above the bed and patch the holes in the walls  The photos were not accurate at all  There was a recently patched hole in the wall behind the front door  the framed photo above the bed was cracked with broken glass or plastic  there was a huge tear  scrape in the wall from one of the Marcel Breuer chairs in the kitchen  and a hole in the wall to the left of the bed   All   gates to the buildings entry wouldnt open and I had to call the help line twice to enter at the time of check in I had to call twice to enter at the time of check in  I was on hold for a long time during the second call
651009021,Be very wary when booking your stay  Online description does not fit  Very rude and unhelpful  They will not assist you to make your stay comfortable especially during hard times No comment
718890036,Great spot in the city  but not the best place to stay  It was noisy with a dog upstairs and neighbors being loud  The place wasnt that clean and the internet was barely operable  This led to issues with the Roku TV that had been a selling point for us   The wifi was non existent and that led to the Roku being mostly useless  The reasons above 
634282975,This air bnb is not the nicest or prettiest air bnb  It looks like the pictures but when you get to the space youll realize it is actually much older than it seems in pictures  When we moved in there was no A C  That is a major problem as it was said in the description of the bnb that there was A C  It took days to even get a temporary fix on this problem and communication was very slow  They ended up providing two portable A C units  did not cool the whole house so we had to flip a coin every night for who would get A C   The living room temp unit they provided leaked so they provided a bucket and told us we had to dump it every day  This air bnb isnt the worst day but definitely not the best  If you only plan to be in your air bnb to sleep then go for it    The apartment does look very similar to the pictures but when you arrive you u    ll notice the apartment is much older than it appears in pictures  There was no A  C in the apartment when we moved in  although it said there was A  C on the amenities list when we booked  This was a major flaw that was not fixed during our stay  They provided a couple of temporary A  C units  One they provided leaked and they informed us we would have to dump the bucket of water that it leaked every day  This was the biggest issue in staying here and resulted in a very early termination of our stay   Sometimes responses would be slow which was unfortunate because we had a major A C problem and would have to call many times to receive a response  A C in the summer is definitely considered emergency maintenance but we had to wait days before we received even a temporary fix  They had no communication on when there would be an actual fix to the A C problem  Before you book here I would definitely call to make sure theres A C  You get what you pay for in this listing 
702996459,The home was nice but I think the photos are a bit deceiving  The home wasnt as clean as I expected and the heating system was broken  It was either extremely hot or extremely cold  Also  without an elevator the three floors is a bit unbearable with luggage   groceries 
636926663,This place is nice
604858757,The place is beautiful great area  Unfortunately just dirty all over  Just seems like the cleaning attention only focuses on the kitchen but the rest of the place was just dirty  Its sad because its great place
716286205,This place was nice just needs some small upgrades and more thorough cleaning  The neighbors kept banging on the wall saying the TV was too loud at  pm and the TV wasnt loud at all 
636931679,Make sure WiFi works before you check in  mine didnt work for a entire   night stay  Also be weary of a heavy smell in the bathroom from something unknown   No WiFi  dirty dishes were unexpected  also who would expect a stinky bathroom  Working WiFi and not a stench in the bathroom of mold or something dead
635154905,The smell in the hallway was disgusting  They need to figure out something else with the trash shoot  We will not be staying here again  The smell in the hallway was a huge deterrent  We will not be staying here again 
636920851,Kitchen utensils inside the drawer werent clean  The walls of the place is scuffed up  definitely needs a paint job  The bedroom had some dust and needed to be cleaned  It was frustrating because I was having trouble with my room and I was trying to get in contact with zencity  They took a long time to respond to messages and when I called they wouldnt answer  took a couple tries to get them on the phone  The best they could do was offer a     discount on the first two nights which I checked out about   days ago and havent received anything that states that will happen  Would recommend a faster response time and faster acceptance of booking time  I have waited over    hours of a response for a place I was trying to book in the next   hours I would have a check in 
641163310,DO NOT BOOK HERE   Host is unhelpful and apartment was not clean  This was the worst experience I have ever encountered on Airbnb   To add to my frustration I saw that multiple other guests had posted similar issues regarding cleanliness   I booked this at an advertised      night and was charged         night  Room was not clean Marty was evasive in his responses and unproductive in solving the problems Clean conditions  responsive host  amenities that demonstrated the host actually wanted their guest to feel comfortable   No detergent for the dishwasher or washing machine
633862646,The instructions are unclear  It took us about       mins to even set foot into the building and another    mins to get into our room  There is no on site parking so we ended up paying quite a bit for parking during our stay  There were only two out of the six elevators that led up to the Airbnb floor  which was not stated in the instructions  The hosts communication was a bit slow  We had to call them multiple times  in which they did not answer and responded late  Furthermore  when we had arrived  the showers had hair in the drains and there was no trash bags in the bathroom trash cans  The kitchen had a broken drawer that we were not made aware of  The host attempted to FINE us      in damages stating it was due to a stain in the carpet  which we did not see because it was located UNDER the coffee table  Given the state of cleanliness of the Airbnb  the cleaners lacked a thorough cleaning and attempted to fine us  There is no parking on premise so we ended up spending quite a bit on parking alone  The instructions were not clear and took us about       mins to set foot into the building  then another    mins because there were only two out of the   elevators that allowed for the guest to reach the Airbnb floors  We had to get help from the security desk  We contacted the host many times and it was pretty slow  We had to call multiple times which they did not pick up  but they would contact me later in the day  Beautiful view  just no parking 
641811922,Place needs work   Biggest positive is that its close to hospital  Front door hard to open   Paint chipping off wall   Kitchen only had one kitchen towel  no coffee pot  drawers were dirty Pictures staged the apartment very well   In reality  furniture was old  couch had stains
642893433,I love St louis  I left a decent rating but it was essentially a huge party building  There were young kids loud outside our door  Loud on the street  Left food in the hallways  It was abit uncomfortable going in and out of the building  Difficult entry process at first 
584871964,Pro    Great Location    Modern Apartment   Con    No flexibility with checkin time  its an automated system that unlocks the door at  PM    At one day the keypad to open the apartment door did not work and it was a big hustle to get in  I came from a run with sweaty clothes on and we had to search on google for a telephone number from the host which was not provided before     The washing machine does not work properly  keeps shutting off during the program and the laundry does not smell clean afterwards 
703901240,Not terrible  You get what you pay for  Wife was having some trouble getting to sleep one night because of the neighboring room playing EDM into the late night    Besides the fridge and dishwasher not being cleaned out  the toilet also did not work for the majority of the first day  I understand that these things happen  but it would have been nice to receive some sort of small refund  since the amenities were not working as advertised    If youre looking for a cheaper place to stay  and you dont mind the chance of having loud neighbors and lazy cleaners  Id say this is a good one to keep in mind   Overall  our   day stay wasnt the worst  Its somewhat functional  and the location is good  We just probably wont choose this one again  Maintenance guy said that he suspects the cleaners are flushing things down the toilet they arent suppose to  as this toilet problem is common   Considering the cleaners also didnt clean out the refrigerator or dishwasher  Id suggest you retrain or rehire your cleaners Didnt hear an update about the toilet being fixed for   hours  So I called again then someone came
621549634,Theres so much we enjoyed about this place   especially its location  the free in unit washer and dryer  and the clean sheets  amazing closets  smart TV  fast wifi  and a comfortable bed  Other than that  the place felt like a hotel  but not as crisp  There were dust bunnies in corners  leaking bath spigot  visibly dirty rug  and the stovetop hadnt been cleaned when we arrived    They didnt have kitchen amenities  so we had to purchase a knife and other essentials to cook meals    The floors are very very squeaky  and the walls are very very thin  so we heard our neighbors loud and clear  as well as people in the stairwells  mostly all day  every day  Night time wasnt too bad though  We had one issue with a loud neighbor  and it seemed like the host managed to tell them to turn down the music   We were here for a longer duration  so we had to order packages  and one got stolen from downstairs  kitchen amenities  cleaner appearance  insulated walls  v noisy  
644351806,Location is great
231309932,This is probably the worst place and the worst experience I have had in using Airbnb       I had to stood in freezing Chicago winter night for over half hour because the check in instruction does not work  He did not want to give the backup option until all the efforts he told me to try failed  including to warm up the lock by rubbing  breathe and banging it  Imagining doing all these after a long flight in the a freezing night of winter Chicago      Despite I told him that my phone with Airbnb app was going to battery out  please call me on the other phone  He stayed on Airbnb msg only  Luckily  my other phone just had data plan in  Otherwise  I might have to stand in the cold all night or arrange alternative       The interior room is not as clean as the picture  It is probably due to old units and poor house keeping  Some of the things on the wall  for example the intercom  is half falling  The hallway  stairway  and elevator are just unbearably dirty and scary  When I come back from work  I work late   I felt like in a horror movie       I regret booking with   weeks up front  He charges     of payment for all the rest night if I check out early  disregarding how many days ahead of the final check out date       On the last day  my meeting went longer because we need to surely wrap up some works  I missed the check out time by an hour and half  He charged additional fee right way when I arrived airport  I acknowledge that check out time is a a upfront rule  However  given a   weeks good deal for him  it is not unreasonable to expect him to have a bit grace   The check in incident and the shabby hallway  interior were bugging already  On top of that  despite a great deal for you with my two weeks stay  you want to charge additional for I missing the check out time  I will just return a straight frank host with frank honest comments     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements 
622155959,Wouldnt recommend this unit   AC is malfunctioning in bedroom and dust was so bad that I had to turn off both AC units   Literally got a sore throat from only staying inside unit during quarantine   And couldnt sleep with windows open by of downtown traffic noise Checked in about issues with ac unit and dust in heater   No response   Can not recommend this unit and contacting AirBNB for resolution
641165332,WARNING  For our entire stay the apartment flooded   There was a lot of water that was coming in from the walls and eventually went into the master bedroom and completely soaked the carpet to the point we couldnt walk on it  The hallway was filled with water  The host never once fixed the issue  They said they would get maintenance there and never did  We had to deal with the flooding and actually use our own towels to clean it up since there was not enough   The host is now ignoring my messages despite sending them proof of all the flooding  which they have known about since another guest stated it flooded during their stay as well  I would highly recommend staying somewhere else as this may flood during your stay as well   and the host is not in any rush to help fix it or make it right  It is clear they do not care about their guests safety satisfaction  Horrible experience  I will not be booking with ZenCity again  Instead of trying to make money  put your guests firsts  I have tried to be patient and kind to you throughout this experience and your company has done nothing but ignore the fact you allowed us to stay in a flooded apartment and did NOTHING to help us  You refuse to provide us a refund and ignore my messages  I will never rent from your company again  Host was not concerned at all about the flooding issue happening in our apartment during our stay   was told there was nothing we could do as the apartment hallway completely flooded as well as bedroom floor was soaking wet  Did not even provide extra towels as we had to use our own to clean it up  Never once sent maintenance and never once tried to refund us for all the issues  The host knew of flooding issues happening in the apartment from January and still has this place listed knowing it may flood when it rains 
637498555,Not the cleanest but it is in a great location  I am fairly clean person and would have expected a lot cleaner of the place  The walls had dirt markings and my feet were horribly dirty the minute I took off my socks  I would take time to clean the place thoroughly    You all had great communication  I couldnt get into the building due to the code not working and as soon s I messaged called you got back to me so quick and I greatly appreciate that   It says rooftop but there was kind of access to the roof  no furniture and would lockbehind you   It was just below our personal expectations of stating you have a rooftop and we felt an inaccurate description of location  
643999944,Pictures didnt match
640108989,A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet  A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet   A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet   When I communicated to the Host about the room they stopped replying  False Advertisement Not worth the stay 
622212332,Nice place  Neighbors were a little loud  but good stay overall 
449830730,It doesnt worth the price  I expected a better experience  The room smells wired  I dont mean bad but just cant stand the smell  The aeration is not good  The kitchen is small but enough to cook and dine  It takes   min drive and   min subway to the city center  The place is more like a hotel  and not homy enough  Considering the price I paid  I would not recommend this place  but if they give you price lower than       fees included   you can consider staying here 
662967752,Really love this area of St Louis In my past experiences with the host and unit  communication and service provided was great  Unfortunately the unit I was placed in on this trip was different than what was advertised and no one reached out to tell me about the change   This was a different unit than advertised  Similar but not the same  It was clean and stocked   I was unaware the unit was changed prior to arrival 
624437894,Nice place  bad experience this time around  Weve stayed here before and had a great experience  however this time wasnt so great  There were no sheets on the bed other than one bed sheet  no blankets or comforters  Didnt get a response to our request for blankets  Also  the sink literally fell through the counter as my girlfriend was cleaning dishes  Never seen that happen before in my life  They were supposed to send someone up to fix it our last night there but nobody ever came 
663373353,Great size and location  Walking distance to groceries and coffee  Perfect for a short trip  Front door was extremely difficult to unlock If it was properly cleaned and easy to lock unlock
656423302,The place has cleanliness issues and lacked amenities that the host said he would send later  but just false promises The smell was very off putting and a bad start to my trip but the hosts false promises really turned my mood off  I would expect a lot more professionalism for something like zencity  I would have been much more accommodating if the host just said that he couldnt provide anything and acknowledged the smell in the place  There was no oil and the kitchen lacked basic supplies even though it was listed that basic amenities were provided  Specifically no cooking oil and paper towels   The host said he would send airfreshner and oil but all false promises and nothing was delivered
622465106,They changed my Airbnb   hours before but wouldnt reply to my messages or questions regarding it  so I went ahead and went to the new Airbnb provided by them and it was dirty with hair everywhere and a pair or socks under the bed that wasnt mine   Lets me know it wasnt cleaned properly  I had multiple questions regarding my stay and they never replied even after they changed my Airbnb they didnt even respond  Not changing the Airbnb   hours before before check in  Actually respond to people thats paying money that have questions  Actually clean the place especially with the virus going around  
659659784,RODENT INFESTATION    UNCLEAN    UNSAFE    TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE    Mouse seen in the kitchen  Rodent traps already placed in the utility closet  Sticky floors  Dirty walls  Towels smelled like cigarette smoke  No salt  pepper  or cooking oil provided as advertised  I am still waiting for a call from management that I was told would happen  and my refund for staying in a rodent infested apartment Stopped responding to issue altogether Good location  Being clean and having described amenities would have helped
654315457,It was nice
661749717,Great location near lake and amenities   Very roomy unit   Furnishings a little sparse basic   Kitchen fine for reheating and storing leftovers but not equipped well for cooking   Mattress in master bedroom very soft needs replacing   kitchen supplies  Kitchen equipped for actual cooking OR something in write up to be clear it is set up for reheating and storing leftovers but not really cooking   Updating mattress in main bedroom   very used and sunken in uncomfortable
661173417,No WiFi the whole stay  Couldnt work  couldnt use Netflix or any streaming service  The apartment smelled like sewage every single night to the point we didnt even want to be in our room    However the location cannot be beat  Hoping for them that this just happened to be an off week   
449798583,This is in a great neighborhood and is a nice apartment  I would not stay there again though because the bedding  bed  and around the bed were disgusting  To be fair  I have OCD but it should be normal protocol for people to check for bedbugs when traveling  I saw what could be evidence of bedbugs  And the bedding was nasty  I had to go to Target and buy my own sheets  pillow  and comforter just for one night  Because there is no way I would risk bringing bedbugs home with me  Otherwise it was ok with plenty of room to yourself  easy to get in and out  The host was very receptive to my feedback  I think its a busy Airbnb so they may have a lot of turnover and I could have caught them at a time where they didnt do as good of a cleaning job as usual  Thank you  If the high cleaning fee was making the place clean  I didnt want to stay in a place that could have bedbugs but I had just driven    hours and was exhausted 
645461541,Let me first start by saying that i hadnt checked into my stay until       PM on July   st        and I checked in with a very pleasant woman    The walls themselves were dirty and we noticed the second we walked in  but we didnt pay much attention  When i walked into the bedroom the towels were dingy and hair hair in them  The shower curtain was yellow and orange  with hair in the shower as well  There were dirty handprints above the bed I was expected to sleep in  In The kitchen  the sponge was not replaced so I can only imagine how dirty the dishes were  In the unc leaned freezer  the ice tray was half full and look as if it was used as an ashtray or something   the previous occupants left   uncased beer  And the microwave was BARELY in working condition  There was a fist print in the refrigerator and the A C was not dusted  Immediately upon noticing all of these things  I contacted a Zencity rep through the Airbnb app and he had me send pictures and seemed as if he wanted to be helpful  It was going smooth until I was told that he  didnt understand what was wrong from the pictures that I sent  so I called  While on hold on the FIRST call  I walked downstairs to speak with the lady that I checked in with  but she was no longer there there was a young man and he was very helpful he provided me a different number  One that I hadnt called already  I got a little further this call  they told me they they would have a property manager call me  I ATTEMPTED to express my concerns with him   frustrated  YES  frantic  YES because it was very hard to even get to speak with him  He immediately cut me off and said  maam  maam   you need to calm down  and proceeded to tell me how he had complaints about me harassing and threatening door staff   which NEVER happened  Even after everything was settled I spoke with the gentleman who only gave me a phone number and was MORE than compassionate and understanding  the Property manager that I spoke with  Gary  told me that security was notified of these false allegations and that they were going to come up and  AND I QUOTE   DRAG me off the property  Im not sure if thats how they run their business but I want no parts and I dont want anyone else to have to encounter this unprofessional business    Not to mention the time i was lied to    When speaking with the Zencity rep through the AirBNB app  he told me that the room was cleaned THE DAY that I checked in            but the whiteboard posted had the date           on it      All in all AirBNB was extremely helpful in getting me my money back  he was friendly and responded to me in a very timely manner so that i wasnt without somewhere to stay my first night in Chicago  He even gave me a voucher for my next stay  So i was satisfied in the end 
661712765,If you like access to TV or internet  do not stay here   No TV and no internet after repeated conversations with Zencity   TV and internet are basic amenities that were not provided as advertised
719772540,So so
655606388,Overall a nice place  a few things that could be fixed but was worth the money  Over all a very nice place  There was so parts that were dirty  I did want you to know the couch had a cigarette burn in it  the coffee grinder was broken  the air was out  and the dryer didnt work  There was also a large amount of light bulbs out  Definitely a cool place and I dont regret staying there  I just suggest those fixes  They were pretty good with the communication  the air did go out right after we checked in witch was definitely a warm stay 
717894489,Be careful not to laugh or talk to loud  Youll be threatened with having the police called on you or terminating your stay Laughter should not warrant you threatening me with police presence and possibly terminating my stay  I also requested extra blankets  Ive yet to receive them 
703824569,We did not enjoy this stay  The apartment was decently clean and in a very convenient location for us  but check in was a nightmare  The apartment was also very bright  the curtains couldnt be closed without blocking the radiator and the window A C units  The apartment was bright and loud and we will not stay again  The apartment was incredibly loud and incredibly bright  It was concerning that the curtains were thick and long and went all the way to the floor in front of the radiator  The curtains were very hot all weekend and we could not move them   We also could not shut the curtains to keep the light out because we would block the A C  The toilet ran intermittently all night  the A C units were loud  the bedroom was bright all night and neither of us slept well although we are notoriously heavy sleepers   Additionally  when we arrived  every single window in the unit was UNLOCKED  For a unit on the second floor surrounded by a walk up roof  this was absolutely unacceptable   Checkin was an absolute nightmare  Our code did not work  setting off a loud beeping alarm after a certain amount of attempts  We were standing in the hallway  holding all our bags  and could not get into the unit  Fortunately  someone answered the phone quickly when we called  but we had to download an app and get everything set up ALL while still standing in the hallway  This was unprofessional and uncomfortable  It also appears this is a known issue  as I now realize previous reviews also said that checkin was awful   Housekeeping also busted in before checkout time with no warning and without knocking  This stay was      uncomfortable and we will not stay again  We thought we were getting a better place than it actually was  The photos looked much nicer than the actual unit 
659673466,Good place to leave your bags  but the air here is hot and stuffy  this place is not nearly as clean as it looked in the photos  other than that i guess its fine  but if you want a clean place  especially if one is going to charge you a     cleaning fee you would hope it would be cleaner  And the window unit was struggling to cool of the livingroom alone  the besroom has no window unit and no A C  not sure they actually cleaned it before either  tell tell signs like human hair in the clean bedding that was not mine  I have a buzz cut and this was long brunette hair    and bugs and crumbs made me wonder       It was not nearly as clean as the pictures  and also the main reason i picked it was because it looked   clean     The girl i checked in with didnt know what i was talking about until she called someone  You would thin for a    dollar cleaning fee the place would be clean  but between hair found in my bed among other things like roaches im not sure its getting much more than a once over 
447989700,To be honest  this was MY WORST AirBNB EXPERIENCE  I was completely shocked because I use AirBNB more than the typical hotel   Ive never experienced anything like this through AirBNB  For starters  check in was a little off  You had to go from one building to another just to retrieve the key  I was traveling with Uber   extra stops means more money paid  Im sure they are able to install a similar lockbox with check in keys in the actual building where the guest will be staying  Also  this listing needs more cookware for the kitchen  Being vegan  I make my own meals   would have had to buy a set of knives   other utensils if I decided to cook  My biggest issue was dealing with the unprofesional employees that I had to communicate with during my stay  They made my stay extremely stressful  Their responses were very slow which caused me to almost be in really bad position outside on the streets with no where to go   I had to threaten to leave a   star rating to get any assistance from a manager and the problems just continued even after I was gone  This is a long review but it isnt even HALF of what I experienced while being here  It all would be too long to describe in full  I did enjoy the speaker they had in the apartment  the location   the decor  Wouldnt stay with Zencity again   def wouldnt recommend to anyone else Check in was super inconvenient Poor customer service
593369405,Im glad there were two rooms because the front room has pigeons right outside the window and they are very loud  The walls are also paper thin and I could hear everything the person under me was doing  I feel that there are better spots in Chicago for the same price and I wont be staying here again  Also  if you are planning on having a car while staying here  you have to park   blocks away  Its a hassle because the gate to the alley is constantly being manually locked behind you  do you will end up having to walk all the way around the building  There is no parking  which is clearly stated in the listing  The nearby parking is confusing and Ive been to Chicago several times  I ended up getting a     ticket because each street only has one sign on it that is very small  If you stay here and are driving  park behind the building  two blocks down  The block right behind is permit parking only  Im glad there were two rooms because the front room has pigeons right outside the window and they are very loud  The walls are also paper thin and I could hear everything the person under me was doing  I feel that there are better spots in Chicago for the same price and I wont be staying here again 
661736974,   Room was not the room pictured   Had no hot water going into our  rd day of stay  Called  messaged  pretty much told to sit and wait until someone showed up 
446928741,It feels like a hotel  Its nice and modern  It doesnt feel homey in anyway    theres not a lot of soap in the bathroom  again its like a hotel  and theres nothing in the refrigerator  Theres no room for garbage either  This is the type of place youd stay for a night or two  Getting rid of that big lamp    its a hazard  Also adding more soap  shampoo  and stuff like that in the bathroom 
627373633,Place was nice  Couldnt figure out how to change the thermostat and  host was not very helpful  The screen on the thermostat was not turning on at all  Also couldnt figure out how to turn on the outside lights that were located on the patio  host did not respond at all about the lights  The location of the place was very nice  not too far from downtown or some nice restaurants 
701877239,The apartment appeared to be anew listing and was a nice size  decorated well and had easy access   Parking on street   blocks away and cleanliness issues are deal breakers   Wont stay again  This appeared to be a newly listed apartment   Parking and cleanliness issues are a deal breaker   Parking was listed as   Free   On premise   in the main description but also listed as    No on site parking   in the rules section   Actually  there is only on street parking   blocks away   There is a new electronic lock on the apartment door   It has a touch screen but only wakes up if you touch the bottom left corner  size      x          Touching the entire screen didnt work    Would have been much easier to find it with a short note on the door or with check in instructions   Also  check in instructions show to use the wooden stairs   These are in immediate need of replacement  Accepting the reservation took over    hours    A question concerning parking was only answered with check in codes   days later     I had to send   text messages and finally call for check in instructions  door codes and entry instructions when we got within   hour of arrival     The texts had no reply for   hours  Building number is very hard to see  due to vegetation  Issues listed above  Cleanliness  parking  timely response  Check in instructions 
671877024,You really get what you pay for  Me and my girlfriend were looking for a few days away and we found this for cheap  really the only issue we had was the toilet backing up and overflowing all over the bathroom and leaving the apartment smelling like sewage  There was nobody in the apartment to get help from  the phone number provided for the apartment did not connect  and the host took a while to respond when we were dealing with someone elses feces overflowing onto the floor  We were left without a bathroom for the majority of the day we were staying there because it smelled so bad   Everything inside the building was what was stated  however parking was a pain  as there is not metered parking around the building  its all     hour parking during the day   A toilet that did not overflow
662439756,So first of all let me just say the place is beautiful but it absolutely is not what they have shown in the pictures   The whole entire layout is different and it looks like theres a balcony but there is not  Second of all I got there and the air conditioning didnt work at all  I reached out to the host and they said they would contact maintenance and bring me fans  They also said they would give me a partial refund for my inconvenience  I NEVER RECEIVED EITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS  It was    degrees In Kansas City when I arrived  I was literally drenched in sweat before I even unpacked a single thing  In the beginning the host was very responsive and I truly thought I would get at least the fans and hopefully my  partial refund  that THEY suggested to give me  I honestly am so disappointed in the way they handled this situation because I have stayed in a different air bnb through Zencity and didnt have a single issue so I thought the experience would be great  Honestly  if they would have at least brought the fans I wouldnt be so upset  It was soooo not  They have been ignoring me ever since I checked out and have yet to give me my refund as promised  I do not understand why they handled this the way they did but I definitely wont be booking any more AirBnBs through these people  The location was great though  very close to everything but thats about it  You guys are so unprofessional for the way you handled my stay  No air conditioning  it never got fixed and you said you would bring me fans and give me a partial refund and I never received either of those things  I will be notifying Air BNB and figuring out how I can get my refund because this is absolutely ridiculous
718605787,You will love the location  Many restaurants and stores to explore just steps from the apartment  This is a beautiful apartment in a beautiful location  My only issue was the heat and then the electricity that blew  I used to live in St Louis county  I never knew the CWE was so nice  I wish we couldve stayed   No heat  The radiators need servicing  
674008633,Great place to stay if youre in town Great place  only issue was the bathroom room sink counter and tub    it was hair all over the counter like a man had shaved their before we arrived   it was invisible to the eye only way to know it was there was to wipe it   
635454218,Some deficiencies in home supplies at the apartment  bring extra toilet paper   but hopefully the hosts will address the issues we raised in our feedback  Nice cool room and very clean on arrival  Would recommend if youre not counting on any supplies listed for kitchen and bath  So we were pretty disappointed with several things during the visit  The place had a half roll of toilet paper and half roll of paper towels and when we ran out of toilet paper and emailed  the suggestion was to check under the sink  which wed already done  we checked everywhere    When we replied that there was no more  there was no response  We bought our own  Were sorry  but thats the very baseline of good hosting    In addition  only two towels were provided  and they didnt even match  One was a large bath towel  and the other was a quite small one  There should be matching towels  and extra towels   In terms of kitchen items provided  there is only a single flimsy fork and two spoons left on the house  If youre going to say you have them  wed suggest you replace the set   Lastly  the ice machine in the freezer is broken  and simply spewing water into the freezer  We were able to manually turn it off  but no ice  no extra ice tray  and no obvious way to fix the ice machine   So there are several ready improvements wed recommend your getting on top of door future guests   Also we had vehicles using our dedicated parking spot during our stay  which may be outside your control  but wanted to make you aware of it    Thanks  Andrew and Carmen No toilet paper or paper towels    Sent an email to them and they suggested checking under the sink but when we advised that there was no extra toilet paper we never got a response Extra toilet paper  extra paper towels  extra silverware  extra towels  two provided didnt even match 
717654965,The place was clean and comfortable enough  However  the people who met us at check in and check out werent wearing masks  It made me feel unsafe  because if people arent wearing masks  I wonder how closely the appropriate safety protocols are being followed in the place generally  People who met us at checkin and checkout werent wearing masks 
662952749,Apartment was different then listing and got water didnt work
658614424,Make sure that the unit your booking is the unit you are viewing in the advertising  Although the unit I did stay in was decent  it was not what I was looking for in a   day stay  Parking can be very tough  Its all on street and you have to look for the spare free parking other then that its all metered parking  Was a different unit then what was in picture  No washer and dryer in unit like pictures and laundry in basement didn u    t work  Locked out after first time leaving  Keypad stopped working  Took about   min to get anyone to respond  Then had to download an app to get into the keypad  Then app stopped working a day into the stay The pictures matched the unit I was put in
662410507,This was our  st First booking with Airbnb  Considering Covid   and the disclaimers stating additional cleaning will be done  That was Not the case  We had to use our Clorox cleaning wipes to clean the bathrooms  the kitchen  the refrigerator Ect  The floors were not clean  The rug wasnt vacuumed  There was a dirty air filter in the laundry room just sitting there for who knows how long  The corners of the bathrooms havent been cleaned in a longtime  There were chip bags under the beds  I reached out to Zencity provided pictures and they said theres nothing they can do  They charge a cleaning fee but the apartment wasnt cleaned for our stay  After several calls and emails they said they cant do anything  All I asked is to be refunded the cleaning fee  They refuse to make this right  I will Not be booking with this company again  Waiting for Stuart which is a supervisor to contact me back   This was our  st First booking with Airbnb  Considering Covid   and the disclaimers stating additional cleaning will be done  That was Not the case  We had to use our Clorox cleaning wipes to clean the bathrooms  the kitchen  the refrigerator  The floors were not clean  The rug wasn u    t vacuumed  There was a dirty air filter in the laundry room just sitting there  The corners of the bathrooms haven u    t been cleaned in a longtime  There were chip bags under the beds  I reached out to Zencity provided pictures and they said there u    s nothing they can do  They charge a cleaning fee but the apartment wasn u    t cleaned for our stay  After several calls and emails they said they can u    t do anything  All I asked is to be refunded the cleaning fee  They refuse to make this right  I will Not be booking with this company again   They blew me off by saying well investigate and get back to you  That never happened and they knew they werent going to help me  They even stalled so I cant even get help from Airbnb  This is not okay all  Just be honest with people  We spent over        for our   day stay  Honesty goes along way  You shouldnt waist peoples time
619430171,The place was a mess from the previous guests  Obviously the cleaners didnt come through  I contacted the host and didnt get a reply until I contacted air bnb directly  He assured me the cleaners would come the next day  we had to scramble to find a place to stay somewhere else the first night because there was no clean bedding or towels or detergent to wash them  In the morning he again did not reply to my messages about a refund for the first night or when I also asked what time the cleaners would be by because they still werent there by       pm  He didnt respond until I contacted air bnb directly again and they got me a new place to stay and a full refund  Air bnb came through and helped me out a lot but I can not say that for the host here
661296240,The apartment is a basement apartment where the bedroom window was left open  the window screen was up and was not able to be locked which is concerning   The apartment otherwise was fine  but I couldnt get past the safety concern with anyone being able to have access into the bedroom of this apartment   I left and stayed in a hotel but was still charged the price for the majority of the stay for my booking   which should not be the case as I left for safety concerns   The apartment is a basement apartment where the bedroom window was left open and was not able to be locked which is concerning   poor customer service when I had a safety concern with the host
657074158,Good value for last minute find  could be a little bit more well kept  cleaning wise   Other than that nice walk to the lake for morning swims  Nice coffee next door  Need a deep cleaner  Rug has crumbs  sheets had yellow spots  shower curtain had mold  dust in most common spaces  Front desk people didnt answer the phone
327931331,Great location The space was really neat and cozy  but I would suggest getting someone in to spray down the place To get rid of roaches  There was   baby roaches in the kitchen  small baby roaches usually indicate a bigger problem  It may not be your space in general thats infested but your neighbors might be  Possibly even previous guest brought them in 
701177315,The actual unit received was not the same as the picture   There was a flood in the unit during the stay   While the Zencity representative was very nice  no compensation was offered despite the major inconvenience of a serious flood and resulting smell   A discount should have been provided 
550907297,This apartment is a   bedroom  which implies there should be seating for at least   people   This apartment in fact has seating for   people  maybe       We had    people  and at times had to pull in seats for the kitchen  which definitely were not as comfortable  Also  the only coffee maker in the apartment is a French press   Although I love French press coffee  its not practical for an apartment that is for    people  This apartment is a   bedroom  which implies there should be seating for at least   people   This apartment in fact has seating for   people  maybe       We had    people  and at times had to pull in seats for the kitchen  which definitely were not as comfortable  Also  the only coffee maker in the apartment is a French press   Although I love French press coffee  its not practical for an apartment that is for    people 
610609883,Great location  so many eateries and bars close by but also a quick    min drive to downtown clubs  The place is a bit messy overall  it looked like it hadnt been deep cleaned  found other peoples stuff under the bed  This wasnt a huge issue because my group was out a lot during the day night  Also  there wasnt enough towels for my group of   and no detergent to be able to wash them  slight inconvenience  but overall good stay for the price  thank you for having us  we had a good overall experience  I suggest hiring cleaners to deep clean the place  it wouldve been nice to have extra towels or detergent to be able to wash them   Did not look like the pictures  The place was okay overall but we ran into the issue of not enough towels  no detergent to wash them  a bit messy just looked like it hasnt been cleaned 
662639849,Was not fully cleaned  Absolutely ridiculous to charge what they are charging to clean the place just to come into it already lived in  The place should be actually cleaned by a cleaning service if you want to charge  times the nights stay   Television sound did not work  The kitchen drawers fall when you pull them out   Door took a long time to figure out  Asked if there was early check in  no response  Tried to add a guest  no response 
274221206,This is a lovely unit and a great location   Our host was responsive to messages  though we did have some issues  There were not enough essential supplies  only   towels  not enough dishes and kitchenware  one bed was missing a blanket  for our group of seven adults and an infant  Also  apparently the tankless water heater had been set very low and we didnt know why we didnt have any hot water for showers and dish washing until we were provided with instructions for setting the correct temperature  These issues were resolved by the host the following afternoon  but it meant some of us didnt get showers the first morning and couldnt properly wash dishes and baby bottles  In addition  the blinds  which were operated electronically  didnt work and because of this  in the room with two sofabeds  streetlights kept us awake  Our host advised upon our arrival that the previous nights guests had created damage to the blinds as well as other areas of the unit  and that new ones had been ordered but would not be available during our stay  It would have been nice to have had a temporary covering to keep out the light  We were never able to get the television to work as it indicated that the account had not been activated  Most of the issues were resolved  with the exception of the TV  though the resolutions could have been more timely  The beds in the bedrooms were reported to be quite comfortable  the two sofa beds would be best for kids  I understand unexpected events can happen  and appreciate that our host was responsive to our messages  though a better initial supply of essentials that were to be included in the rental would have been appreciated      Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  Additional comments   u   cEssential household supplies that were to be included were insufficiently stocked for the number of guests   u   d   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions  Additional comments   Code to unit was provided early in the afternoon of check in even though Airbnb sent communications saying that the code would be provided three days in advance of the check in day    Great location  The room with the sofabeds had audible street noise all through the night 
195236496,It sort of feels like a model home  looks very nice  but not always functional  It also just seems incredibly new and designed entirely just to be an Airbnb  with price tags still on the pillows  Pros  Very modern and spacious  and great location if youre looking to hang at Douglas Park every day like we were  Filtered water in the fridge  dishwasher  washer and dryer  The beds feel GREAT  Cons  The TV never worked  and the wifi had to be restarted so didnt work the first day  Once it did  it was often slow and we just used data instead  The keurig was hit or miss  there is are exposed bulbs without shades  and there is no hand soap  The positioning of the windows is such that not a lot of light comes in during the day  The TV never worked for us  and you never replied to my comment about the fact that there should be a covering over the exposed bulbs in the second bedroom   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  
610579660,Upon arriving at the listing and getting settled  we noticed that leftover from previous guest were in the frog and freezer  The sheets were covered in hair and appeared unclean  Bathroom sink and mirrors were not clean  Mud was on steps and floor  Sticky fingerprints on the cups in the cabinet  It was late at night  after    pm   so not much could be done until the next day  After communicating with three different managers of the property  which was frustrating  the cleaning crew came back the next day and cleaned everything and changed the sheets  The steps leading from the front door up to the apartment are very steep corner steps with no handrail  Difficult to maneuver with luggage  Would not recommend for guests who are elderly or who have small children  Listing states its within walking distance to city attractions  and it is a little over a mile from Crown Plaza  but I would not recommend walking through the neighborhood  Thermostat would go down to     at      am  and the only way to adjust it was to manually change the temp  you couldnt change the schedule  so that was inconvenient since it was cold out and having to get out of bed to turn up the heat was not desirable    It was a nice space with good size bedrooms and two bathrooms  Kitchen had everything youd need to eat there  Beds were not the most comfortable  but fine for a couple of nights   States the listing is within walking distance of city attractions  The listing is a mile or more from attractions  AND you have to walk through a very rough neighborhood  I would not suggest doing so   n nAlso  description needs to state or show a picture of the very steep corner staircase that leads from front door up to apartment  Carrying luggage up is difficult  Installing a handrail would be very beneficial  Would not recommend for elderly guests or guests with small children   Will is listed as the host  When I had a complaint about the cleanliness of the space and messaged through the Air BnB app  Will was not the person to respond  When I messaged to ask if the cleaning crew was finished thoroughly cleaning the space  no one responded back to me  Finally found a phone number to contact Will  who informed me he was no longer the manager of the space but has sublet it to someone else  He did get in contact with one of the new managers who then contacted me  This person was a totally different person than who had messaged me on the app  So I had to explain myself three different times to three different people  which was very frustrating  Described as being close to city attractions  walking distance  in an up and coming neighborhood  While the listing is a little over a mile from places like Crown Plaza  it is not a neighborhood I would ever feel safe walking through  Cleanliness  Better area neighborhood 
492919137,I would not choose to stay here again  Upon arriving the directions were great describing where the lockbox was but  locating our room took a bit  A message about where the stairwell was located and that it was on the second floor would have been helpful  I read the reviews saying the place was very clean but  unfortunately I entered to find a studio apartment with no couch  as it was listed   a white comforter that was stained up quite a bit speckled with black curly hairs when pulling back the sheets  The bathroom also had black hairs in the shower to match  The coffee pot as described in amenities was a French press that had a broken plunger making it useless for coffee  I attempted to use the hair dryer that was provided in the bathroom as I didnt bring my own  I turned it on and it began to smoke  Thankfully my trip was short  I spent a total of   hrs here for a total of       I would have been better off sleeping in my car 
667562516,Decent place  good location  Near the el train so its pretty loud in the front bedroom throughout the night   Be sure to try the taco place downstairs  Maybe leave multiple keys or a backup  Its a two bedroom Airbnb and there is only one key  which makes it easy to forget the key in the apartment  We got locked out and had to be let in by a neighbor  and she mentioned that this has happened several times 
441075293,This was by far my worst AirBnB experience and I can only advise everybody else to not make the same mistake and book the apartment   The entire apartment was extremely unhygienic and dirty   there were hairs and even traces of food in both of the beds  In addition  the floor had obviously not been cleaned and the table in the living room was so dirty that we couldnt even put our things on it   When I informed Zencity about these issues  they did not take any action  regardless of the exorbitant price that we paid for the apartment  Once I brought attention to this problem again  they stopped replying at all  so dont except any cooperation or assistance from their side  Is that how you treat your customers   The final disappointed happened the day of our check out  We were supposed to leave at    am  However  Zencitys cleaning staff entered the apartment about half an hour earlier without a warning  At that time  I was coming right out of the shower  covered with nothing but a towel  I felt extremely violated in my privacy   All in all  our stay has been beyond terrible and I certainly cant recommend neither the apartment nor the host  I am still waiting to hear back from you 
667507820,very well cleaned and a good location  though the apartment has a bit more wear on than in the pictures  the space is much more beat up than it looks  the wifi listing was the wrong address but the correct password  
667567578,The location cant be beat  Right in the middle of everything  Walkable distance to lots of restaurants and stores  Parking was a pain and I would have appreciated a spot with the place because you end up having to walk each time you leave    There were some dirty glasses and a plate  along with some dirty spots on the comforter which was a bit disturbing    Overall  an adorable place in a great area  There were dirty glasses and a plate in the cabinet  The comforter had some dirty spots  Street parking was a nuisance  but was in the listing just hadnt seen it 
123294349,Super convenient location  right next to a starbucks and easy walk to close by restaurants  Whole foods nearby too  Michigan ave shopping is blocks away  Great price 
704655876,Something I Didnt Expect
635997055,The apartment is not bad  I felt safe the whole time I was there  It is convenient to many shops and restaurants  The mattress was super firm as were the pillows  That was tough to get comfortable with  I would just suggest responding to request would have made the stay more satisfying  Other than that I was fine  I mentioned my issue about cleanliness to the host and even sent pictures  However there was no response given  The cleanliness was a factor for me  I had to go to the grocery store and purchase cleaning supplies  just to return and clean the space for peace of mind 
508283324,The apartment shows signs of wear and tear  The wooden floor was creaking  The location is good and communication with owner was good  It fell short of expectations based on the pictures and description    apartment could be cleaned more thoroughly including outside stairs   a small investment could help it look and function better  more towels  fixing simple things  more kitchen utensils etc   fix the blinds remote  Quality of the apartment was not good  It was advertised as brand new but throughout the apartment there were things that needed fixing  The whole floor was creaking  the doors were creaking  The toilet in the bathroom was wobbly at the base  Kitchen faucet was not sturdy  Baseboards in the bathroom were dirty
660334756,If safety  cleanliness and communication is important to you I wouldnt suggest booking  Photos are deceiving  I left and canceled Not even knowing where I would go  But I knew I wasnt going to stay there  Please take the time to go to place and look around  Would you want your family Coming from out of town to stay here or experience  bad communication or for place to not be ready at time stated on booking  I suggest serious upgrade s including entry and inform people to be careful in this area  Cleaning is so important especially during this COVID   times and I m disappointed that this is Not top priority with your company   The photos in add don u    t show stains dirty window and the bad area  Thank  I asked for early check in since I was driving from out of town when i booked  Didnt get a response so I assumed it was alright  I was told I couldnt and place wouldnt be ready at the time stated I could check in  They would notify me  They didnt notify me at all Horrible at communicating  Question s asked at booking NOT answered  Even asked several times with no response i was told they would notify me when place was ready  Sat out front for        No response Area looks very unsafe  People around and going in and out of building  suspicious  looking  Dirty and not so neat looking surroundings  For the area and the looks of the place   dirty furniture and carpet  price was a little high  I expected  better 
310634719,The apartment that sleeps   was newly renovated   had great possibilities   We had a group of   staying here  Brian Host did great allowing us an early check  in as we all came in to Chicago for my sons wedding weekend   Brian informed me a couple hours prior to arrival that the some of the shades   a bedroom door had been ruined by guests the night before  He also told me later that a towel rack had been torn down by them    Brian said he tentatively fixed all those items but had to get special parts for all before they could be permanently fixed   Unfortunately  the towel rack wouldnt stay up  the door wouldnt shut   the windows in the common area didnt all have shades   Shortly after we all arrived we realized that there were only   place settings of dishes  cups  plates  cereal bowls   I sent my husband to the store to pick up some paper products to get us by   When he returned we realized there were no serving dishes or serving utensils   As we started to get ready for the rehearsal dinner  we found only   bath towels  no wash cloths     hand towel in the   bathrooms    I messaged Brian on this right away and reminded him we had   people staying there   Brian never responded       Later we also realized the only bed pillows were the ones in shams not pillow cases  For the   sofa beds we were only able to find   set of sheets  There were   pillows found but only   pillow case    It was bad enough that the towel rack  shades  door had been ruined but then not to have the necessary towels  linens   dishes was unacceptable for a unit that was available for up to   people   Then to have the host not acknowledge my message on the shortage of bath towels  washcloths   dishes was very unprofessional   It really makes me question the integrity of the host   I am very embarrassed that I asked special friends to stay with us at this Airbnb    Listed to sleep   people however we had   people in our group   There were only   bath towels provided    hand towel  no wash cloths for   bathrooms   There was only   coffee cups    plates     cereal bowls  No serving bowls  platters  utensils  pans  There were no dish towels only dish cloths were in a cupboard   Brian provided the code prior to an early check in request  And he informed me that the place was damaged by drunken guests the night before our stay was to begin  Though he said he tentatively attached the towel rack that had been ripped off the wall  it didnt stay attached   Brian didnt respond when I alerted him that we didnt have enough towels or dishes for the number of guests       though he listed the place was for up to   guests   I had informed Brian months ago that the   of us were coming into town for my sons wedding  Unbelievable that a host would not respond to apologize   personally deliver what was needed since we were already staying in a damaged apartment  
616391083,Horrible host  not worth the money for the smell  broken toilet and dirty sunken couch  Dont recommend zen city at all stay away  Overlooked and ignored my questions 
670582553,If youre looking for a cheap Airbnb this is the best for you
670538933,Parking is ridiculous took an hour to find a park  Plumbing was horrible  Toilet was clogged for almost   days of my   day stay Terrible plumbing  Very disgusting   embarrassing  I need a discount on my stay  Ive had the worst experience  Very small bed   uncomfortable  Took forever for host to find maintenance No parking   horrible Definitely not worth the money
717288295,Unsanitary bathroom and bedroom  Small and large hairs all over the shower  clearly not cleaned   Small and large hairs all over the linen  Not cleaned properly   Cleaning supplies found in the place were  fresheners   No laundry soap for the washer  Likely does not have proper cleaning supplies  ex laundry detergent  to clean between stays  Hot water for shower did not work well  Had to cancel stay    Host did let me retrieve forgotten item   Hot water in shower did not work  Poor insulation Had to get a full refund through Airbnb because owner was not willing to fulfill request  Hot water in shower did not work  Wanted us to clean  Very very unsanitary 
717152522,the price was attractive for   bed  BUT     the unit is in poor condition meaning  the sofa is broken and not practical to seat  bedroom pillows are suggy and old  no hangers cleaningness is on the bad side   over all good location easy to get in  but if Im paying tjis amount expected to get practical thing for my comfort   its annoying me to see that the sofa is completely broken  and NO one care   someone clean the home and notice it for sure  you need to update your unit  sofa is broken and not practical  bedroom pillows are old saggy and grows  missing blinds at guest bedroom  no hangers for clothes  cleaningness of unit is bad especially the floor was with guie spots and unit smell funky  had to buy refresher to unit and open windows   broken sofa  stools too  the quality and condition of unit is poor for the money i payed 
664884339,This apartment was okay   The location is about two miles away from the pin on the map  putting it closer to the Museum  not the hospital  which was why we chose this location    The cleaning was subpar  we found that the bathroom was noticeably less clean than it probably should have been and the rug in front of the TV seemed dirty   During COVID  this isnt what we were hoping for   Parking on the street was fine and they offer Netflix which was nice   The location  other than the incorrect pin was great  it just wasnt what we were looking for when we booked  I would highly recommend adjusting the pin on the map for the location of this listing   As well as taking extra care on cleaning during the COVID    situation   Communicating known damage of the facilities would have been preferred as well because adding a walk through to assess the apartment when we got there added additional stress to our stay   The location pin in the listing was approximately two miles away from the actual location  which was why we booked this specific listing   The communication was spotty   There were slow responses and not responding to very direct questions   There was also damage in the apartment  a damaged picture frame  a transition strip that was loose  that should have been previously communicated so we didnt have to feel like we needed to perform our own walk through just to feel comfortable  This location was pinned closer to the hospital  when it is much closer to the Museum   This wouldnt have normally been an issue  but the entire purpose of our stay was to be closer to the hospital 
573983639,Great location  Nicely appointed  Very comfortable and modern  beware of the construction that is currently going on  It starts very early in the morning and doesnt end until much later in the evening  It was the only thing that detracted from the place but its a big deal  It would behoove you to be a bit more specific in regard to the construction situation 
667081096,  
668104642,Nice place  quiet and clean   Poor rehab work and finishing  poor HVAc drainage contributing to organic growth  poor shower cleaning full of mildew and growth   Light switches dont operate logically  different rooms operate switches from other rooms and so on  very poor electrical work 
622087278,Perfect for traveling for work 
669164771,Communication response time VERY poor  Zero access to amenities   washer dryer gym  bathroom wasnt very clean  Bought my own cleaning supplies  Would not stay here again  Communication Nonexistent
614321879,I love staying here  However  with this particular unit  the key fob was missing  I reached out about that and the TV not working and got one replay saying they would try to get me a key fob soon and asked what was wrong with the tv and maybe they could help  When I emailed back what was wrong with the TV but I was more concerned with the key fob  I received no other communication  I adore this space and will continue staying here but I am very upset with the lack of communication  I am upset about this apartment  It was gorgeous but the lack of a response when I reached out is troublesome  Wrote multiple times about the missing key fob and also TV not working  No one responded back 
664059334,Good location  older home with very steep skinny steps so no older people should rent this location  Also old tub hard for my father in law to use  I already messaged him privately  Photos were not in accurate they were just very bright and made the place look newer and nicer than it was 
701831562,   Turn both locks clockwise   the door knob is fixed and wont ever turn from the outside  This took us some figuring  While this unit does not allow smoking  it has been smoked in previously and the smell of stale cigarettes was strong and permeated our clothing after staying there  The neighborhood is awesome and the kitchen is a little bare  no measuring cups  for instance  but there is a toaster and coffee pot   but has new appliances  The dishwasher wont run unless the switch on the wall is activated  Good place to stay if the price is right  but there are lots of  pretty thoughtful  college students around so things can get a little lively on the weekends  They neighbors were really friendly and helpful when we had issues unlocking the door of the unit and the neighborhood is great  The floors throughout the building are incredibly loud  you can hear every movement in the upstairs unit   Perhaps this is already priced into the unit  but it certainly wasnt obvious when we were booking  Also  the light fixture in the main  living  room would not full illuminate on our last day   it could be the lightbulbs  as they would glow slightly but never fully light up    Thanks for letting us stay at your place    Again  the unit has been smoked in and there are holes in the floors   While the host sent instructions on the lock box location  which were helpful  We found  as others had described in their reviews  that working the lots on the door took some insight and understanding  both locks require the key to be turned clockwise and the knob is fixed from the outside   which was frustrating  We figured it out  but it took about    minutes and several conversations with other tenants at      am  A guide book in the unit would be very helpful  There are idiosynchrasies to the unit that took effort to figure out   including that fact that the dishwasher is only activated when a switch in the kitchen is turned to  on   Chiefly  not being smoked in  With cleaning fee included  one could stay at a decent hotel downtown for a similar price and not smell like smoke 
711263783, 
636863009,Good for overnight stay  nothing more then overnight  Very hotel like  make sure to bring all your own supplies  soap  toothpaste etc   and extra towels   Glad we had our lawn chairs in the car to sit on the balcony as there were no seats  coffee table No soap No paper towels    roll of tp Understandable that guests provide  there own things  But every airbnb i have stayed at has had soad  toothpaste  condiments  Just something to consider
705945239,The location is the best part of the apartment  Its a nice street well illuminated close to bars and restaurants  The bathroom however is the worst part of the apartment  The rest of the apartment is okay   The photos are taken to show a nice bathroom  When we arrived the bathroom was not as portrayed as in the pictures  It was older  uglier and dirty   The rest of the apartment was okay   I had booked an apartment for one day and then cancelled and booked another apartment for a week  I thought I was booking with  another host but it was the same person  They provided me with the wrong address and caused some confusion in the beginning but nothing too upsetting with checkin  The host took a little while to help us understand what was happening  see problems above  but then responded quickly  The location is perfect but this was not a pleasant stay and not worth my money 
707116688,    clean  great location  spacious        fridge door  toilet seat  microwave  and dishwasher broken in rental  Radiator in one bathroom leaking water  Trash in hallway  Smoke detector in hallway beeped the entire stay  Significant stains on couch and chair in living room  We were quite disappointed in rental  Fridge door  microwave  and dishwasher broken in rental  Radiator in bathroom leaking water  Trash in hallway  Smoke detector in hallway beeped the entire stay  Significant stains on couch and chair in living room   Broken amenities   Did not respond when I asked a question about heat  Fridge door  microwave  and dishwasher broken in rental  Radiator in bathroom leaking water  Trash in hallway  Smoke detector in hallway beeped the entire stay  Significant stains on couch and chair in living room 
672163291,AirBnB ers  please beware of this apartment  If your intention is to stay at a place that is clean this is not the place to stay  The bed linens were infested with hair from previous occupants  not just the one before us  but throughout the existence of this air bnb   They also smelled of body odor  The bathrooms were DIRTY with stains and hairs  It seemed as if the counter tops had not even been wiped down  There was an awful stench throughout the apartment  almost of sewage   The walls and baseboards are dirty and full of dust  The overall condition of the apartment is filthy and not worth a penny of your money  The views through the  very tall  windows are inaccessible if youre below    but beautiful if you meet the height requirement just be careful  you might inhale a dead bug from the windowsill s  that was never wiped away  The host does not respond quickly  The location is great  but the apartment is not worth the location  Inaccurate description of the cleanliness of the apartment   The photos depicted a clean space but that is not at all what my family and I walked in to   Delayed responses Accuracy of description and cleanliness of the space
660246068,Booked for two nights   stayed less than an hour due to  critters  as he calls it on the pillow  I was told to cancel my booking which would result in me receiving none of my money back for a place I didnt even stay in  Besides the bugs the place is beautiful 
700419721,Dont stay here  Its not like the pictures Re evaluate the units door  Its broken and anyone could have gotten into that elevator and up to the room levels and kicked it in   In the inner city and there was so description of that  Photos looked much more modern and cleaner than the place was  The amenities listed were there  like a microwave and a fully loaded kitchen  We couldn u    t even make ramen noodles   I feel like we shouldve been told that we would be more downtown  I almost got my purse stolen a block away  For it to be what I expected  More modern and secure  The door was wiggly because it was broken 
706577184,Check in a little complicated  Place was clean over all good stay  But there is no gym on location and the pool closes at  pm which is very misleading   Was told Id get a discount because of that and havnt revived one  The man I spoke to said I would be getting a discount and I dont see that  There u    s no gym  And the pool closes at  pm  
659124602,Great view and location but needs deep cleaned badly  I had to send in many pictures of uncleanliness  The sheets in one of the bedrooms had pubic and strands of hair on them  Upon arrival  we were forces to wash the linen to both of the beds  sweep floors  and clean spider webs from the walls and window ceilings  Lots of scuff marks on the walls  The location and scenery outdoors were amazing  Unfortunately  the place needs some deep cleaning and a new couch  The couch is filthy and we had to place a comforter on it before sitting on it  It was disgusting 
639071985,The room number is incorrect  on the directions  Couldnt find room  WiFi didnt work causing me to miss a meeting which really tainted my experience here  Clean nice room  Gave us a late checkout which was nice  The room number is incorrect  on your directions  WiFi didnt work 
668694845,Clean quaint apartment in the Pilsen area  parking was a challenge in that area but overall my stay was nice Your place is very nice  however I would suggest that you add more appliances such as an electric coffee pot  Also  maybe offer more towels as well  It would be nice if another television was in the home as well  There was a small mishap in the building  but it was handled immediately  Overall my stay was nice and I would stay there again
668780514,The best part about this place is the location  Its close to everything  Bed was comfy and the kitchen was nice    we used it to make a great dinner  The living room area is not as pristine as the photos show  some holes and scuffs on the walls   but its a decent spot for the right price   There were more holes    scuffs than portrayed in the photos  Seemed like there was still work being done to renovate  A maintenance person also tried to come during our stay without notice from the host  
653885905,Make sure you take pictures of things look suspicious to ensure you dont get charge for anything you didnt do Not trying to charge me for a smoking fee when I did nothing of the sort
633653625,Dont expect much
717300131,Do not rent from them   I was giving crappy check in instructions then asked cancel with the print of full refund only to be scammed       You wrong for not giving me my   back knowing I never stepped foot on your place but its ok because nothing good will come your way for scamming me        Wasn u    t replying right away  Check in didnt work   days straight   The host had me to cancel stating Id get my full refund only to then not agree to give it back   I never stepped foot inside here  still did not get my   back   I had to call more then once to get response   No parking Horrible host money hungry 
721595008,enjoyable stay but not the best amenities parking was difficult
717719008,Th hey had damages to the apartment and blamed me for it and the host kept messaging about a party and there was only me and my sisters there  He disturbed us the entire time  I was bothered all night about things already discussed before the booking  The couch and chairs were broken
716305574,The stay was okay  was able to find parking and food options were abundant  for a  quick staycation  We had a difficult time accessing keys to unit but representative was both responsive and patient  Space is also bigger than photos which was exciting   Bring cookware  mixing bowls spices measuring cups  if you decide to cook  Overall decent stay for price  The stay was okay  my bf actually went earlier than I did and had a fairly difficult time accessing entry  More specifically the key lock  he actually had the cops called on him as he struggled to get in the unit  After talking to a representative  Jacqueline my bf was able to figure out what to do so kudos to her  She was v understanding and patient through it all  During our stay  My bf and I stayed in and cooked and it wouldve been nice to have more table space and cookware  mixing bowls  spices  measuring cups   It also wouldve been helpful to have disinfecting spray wipes as there was some dirt spots  I also had an incident with the closet door  Not sure how it happened as the door opened and shut perfectly fine  it actually fell on my head while I was looking through my suitcase  thank you for being understanding  Overall it was a decent stay 
627469989,Not bad place  Thought it was a little bigger  Went in the middle of a riot but over all  Its a pretty decent place We called zencity and told about our issue and they told us they cant do anything about it We was in the middle of the riot downtown in st  Louis tried to call and let some one know  Nobody even got back with me  We didnt stay out second night and had to going somewhere else to sleep
437443289,Great location   convenient for Lincoln Park  Old Town and the L to get into the city Hi  The apartment location is really good  The challenges we had were a lot of the light switches didnt work and there were cleanliness issues in the main bathroom and kitchen  Also  when taking a bath there seemed to be a slight leak which we couldnt work out where it was coming from  With respect to the shower   because there was only   shower curtain  water tended to get everywhere   would be easy to buy a second shower curtain and also maybe replace the shower head  Bathroom and kitchen need updating 
610540497,Unsafe practices  other people had access to my unit  belongings were moved and an item stolen    Stay at your own risk  Your company utilizes unsafe business practices and seems to care very little about guest safety 
700221443,The floors creak very loudly   The walls are thin but theres not a lot of foot traffic on the same floor    They missed a few areas when cleaning before our arrival  but nothing major    The location is great and you can walk everywhere  The street is very noisy  even at night  Theres a fantastic bar right next to the entrance  Baileys Range    Last time I stayed  I had no issues with parking  This time  the meters closed  I didnt know they could do that   and I had to park a block away in a garage  which I then lost my car in  There were prints on the window and some surfaces 
707117156,It was very nice  there was no mention of the unit not having central AC  but wasnt an issue after some windows were opened  The oven and a few dishes were dirty though  They might need new cleaning team 
635467869,Zencitys communication was great and she was able to accommodate an early check in  The kitchen is equipped with a lot of things  The only thing that my girlfriend and I didnt really like was the  cleaning   In consideration whats going on in the world right now  the apartment was not that clean  especially the bathroom  The ceiling seems to be molding from the top which is really unpleasant 
546537587,The location of this apartment is nice if you want to spend time in Hyde Park  Getting to downtown Chicago is fairly easy on the buses or the Metra  The apartment is very large and clean  but the common spaces are not cozy or comfortable  We only had two people  and there is very little seating to relax in or hang out  and what is there is very uncomfortable  The beds were very comfortable  The communication around the experience with the flooding was minimal  If it were my place  I wouldve responded immediately  and shown up at the door with towels in hand  The beds were comfortable  but the rest of the furniture left a lot to be desired  It was incredibly uncomfortable to sit on the couch  The place is huge  but the lack of furniture made it hard to enjoy the space 
719460988,Great location  STOP   No heat for   days except for a on bedroom space heart   Freezing   Workers can two different times   Could not fix first time night  Finally got it working the  rd day but left the work mess    Loud clanging radiators all through the night  like a bunch of spoons rolling around in a dryer  that were trying to work but didnt  Unbearably loud   Arrived to dirty dishwasher  soiled living room furniture  toilets that take two flushes to get  residue  down the chute  door knobs coming off    I mean  yes the location is great but this entire experience has been more than disappointing  This place was NOT ready to rent   no heat  old apartment  
546371550,Would not stay again  Marijuana smell  bad smelling water  dirty building  Thanks for great communication  See what you are trying to do with the place  needs a lot of work  Would suggest having a discussion with the neighbors regarding hallway areas  Money would have been better spent on hotel 
564308120,The heating didnt work in this place  Not a good situation to be in when its winter in Chicago  They did bring in a space heater to try to heat the place  but it was still below    degrees in the apartment  They brought in extra heaters after I notified them it was still cold  I do appreciate the good communication from them  but it was still not an ideal situation   Heater didnt work 
544220463,the good  great location and overall quiet the bad no parking spots ever stairs very steep smells like old sheets very old and polyester bed not good and i believe the neighbors downstairs smoke the ugly  mold on the bathroom  sofa its very dirty  air conditioner unit not working  windows very dirty  its just not what zen city use to offer  not worth the      my    cents  the bathroom has mold and the curtain shower is very dirty with scum the towel handle bar was broken the air conditioner unit its broken and the sofa has stains all over  the sheets are made of polyester and they get extremely hot
574801448,Overall the place was nice and had an excellent location  but there were several little problems which really irked us  It was difficult to find the room  we had super noisy neighbours  who I believe are also airbnb guests   and WiFi dropped out very frequently  We werent supplied with a bin and when we messaged to rectify this  they said theyd drop one off but didnt  Biggest thing that annoyed us was the cleanliness   if you are charging a     cleaning fee  already ridiculously high   I expect the place to be absolutely spotless  There was dust all over the windowsills and around the skirting boards in the bathroom  as well as fingerprints on the walls and mirror  The carpet hadnt been properly vacuumed and I stepped on a screw  IF these problems are acknowledged and rectified  I would recommend this place  You wrote to go to ground floor when the elevator actually says basement level  Some signage when on that floor wouldve been useful as we had no idea  We didnt have a bin  asked for one and then they just never brought one over  Very unimpressed  Cleaning fee was ridiculous
653551484,needs to be cleaned and ready to move in
585383888,They are ok parking is veryhard to find   Missing washer dryer and dishwasher broken  
661870535,Good place   Just no hot water all weekend No hot water at all
669134716,This place was not cleaned at all prior to me arriving  Floor was dirty and sticky  The entire place was dirty  Had it been cleaned  There was a quiet time but the entire building was loud 
551838714,Ok  Smell was irritating   Media was better than expected 
112773271,Great neighborhood  average apartment  close to everything and value for the price  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  Additional comments   u   cThere was quite a bit of noise at night from other tenants   u   d   The lack of a deadbolt was very disconcerting and I did have to block the door at night to make sure it closed     
544215359,This apartment is in a great location and is very affordable  however it is not clean and is falling apart at the seams  There was mold and mildew everywhere  The refrigerator was covered in something that resembled vomit  The bathroom sink wouldnt drain and was leaking from its base  The curtain rods and bathroom rods were falling off the walls  probably due to the moisture causing the mold  The owner dismissed my concerns and said the appliances were just old  Old and dirty are two completely different things 
717986524,Checked in very late after driving    hours  still couldnt find it in me to stay  Absolute filth  The lockbox was jammed  instructions complex  parking was scarce  neighborhood sketch  but the icing on the shit cake was the condo itself  Floors have never been mopped  carpets had NEVER been vacuumed  Toilet had pee in it and wouldnt flush  It felt like someone had left their dirty house unexpectedly and then we checked in  The tv was on  couch was clearly recently slept on  dirty laundry in the bedrooms  Trash in the cans and they had the nerve to leave one piece of paper on the paper towel roll as decoration  AVOID THIS PLACE   
105457520,For this area  the cost of the apartment was a great value  I stayed in Chicago for a short time and wasnt planning on spending a lot of time in a hotel  which was double the price   so it was great for what I needed  Check out was the best  simple and easy  However  the building IS under construction   the construction started right outside the window at  am  on the weekdays  that was not ideal  Also  there is a fire station nearby    if youre not a heavy sleeper  some earplugs would be good to have     
301170327,Place is alright  Its in Obamas former neighbourhood and his former place is not too far away  The place was okay with Netflix and a working kitchen  Bathroom door was a bit squeaky  Also on the day of check out there was no possibility of keeping our luggage  With a serviced apartment I would have expected something differently  so we had to figure out an alternative  Otherwise the place is quite okay 
584747833,Got locked out of airbnb  they resolved it later then expected 
104844919,The apartment was an overal letdown  The listing was advertised to have things like a gym and laundry room  Both were currently not available for guests  There were no curtains in the bedroom with bright lampposts in front of the window  Little things such as the internet password were no where to be found  meaning I had to contact the host  Upstairs and downstairs neighbours are loud  amplified in with an older building  The apartment was not particularly clean  especially the bathrooms  Chris tried to help where he could  Curtains were fixed and he was very responsive  However  it didnt chance the fact that I checked into a hotel after a number of nights  Not a place I would recommend if youre planning to stay for a couple of weeks for business    Limited number of photos do not give a good overall impression of the apartment  Amenities were not there as advertised    House manual of some sort would be useful  Especially if internet is down as was in my case   Chris was quick in his responses  Location is great  It is a main road through downtown so can be busy throughout the night  
196270320,Ubicacion excelente  La Tv no andaba  Anfitrion no va a recibirte  las llaves te las da de manera muy compleja  dentro de una motocicleta con un codigo   le pedi por favor que me ayude ya que estoy embarazada y se nego  No vino a recibirme ni al momento de irme  y luego me acus  de haber roto una cafetera   Demasiado caluroso para pasar    grados  el apartamento no tiene aire y son dos pisos por escalera  en mi estado y SOLA fue muy complejo    u   cLa tv no andaba u   d  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions  entering the home  Additional comments   Estoy embarazada y ni siquiera vino   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements  Additional comments   Instrucciones complejas   
72338679,The location of this one bedroom flat was terrific  close by the  Red Line  subway   high end shopping  Water Tower Place  is nearby     s of bars and restaurants of all sorts are also right around the corner  Rush Street    The apartment was clean  everything worked   My stay was on a Sunday evening and I could hear music coming from outside  a bar nearby  But it didnt last past       PM or so       To summarize  this is the perfect place for the location  but amenities were non existent  no information about the wifi connections such as in a  welcome book of instructions to the flat  were to be found  I had to call to find out the password  and the outside scaffolding on the building Im sure will not be up forever          
543341573,I really wanted to give them a    but because of the issue I had  I have to get them at       Everything everything was actor about the listing  I really like the place in a way Its set up  Now I never saw a washer and dryer on the premises like the listing said  I parked on the premises and I dont think I took anybody so I cuz I park in the same spot every night and there are still several open spots  Its a nice happening area  You can walk two different things  The apartment is about   to    minutes away from the arch  The mattress was amazing   Cons  Theres a the hospital the next quarter so you here and see ambulances all night long  They dont have someone else there and buy for emergencies after hours  I had issues with the tub backing up so I wasnt able to take a bath  Keep an emergency crew on hand for after hour or weekend issues  Test to make sure the everything in the harm is working properly 
718098013,Really wish it was a better experience for my first interaction with Zencity   The pictures implicated that the room was a lot bigger 
542543046,The apartment was in a good location and our stay was okay   The furniture looked nice but the beds were uncomfortable   The host directly asked me to leave a   star review and then tried to charge me for a broken mirror that was damaged before we arrived   I dont think I would stay at a Zencity place again  Messaged me asking for a   star review but then submitted a false claim for damage through Airbnb  The place looked nice but the beds and couches were uncomfortable and the rate I paid was quite high 
717715230,I would not recommend this company or property to anyone  Horrible holiday trip for the amount of money I spent  One issue after another with no response from any member of management  Pictures are deceiving  waste of time and money for my daughter and I   There was one towel  it actually had shampoo and conditioner  There was no working lights in bedroom or working ceiling fan  The bed sheets were a wrinkled mess  There was no extra pillows  sheets or even an extra blanket  The pictures clearly were better than in actuality    I called several times to let management know about problems and I was very unhappy with room  I was told he was in a meeting  which apparently lasted the entire day  This was a terrible night that got worse in the am  To begin my holiday stay I was welcomed by an elevator that did not allow me to use it so I end up waking seven flights of stairs to my room  This continues as trip is still in progress  Several people were and called with no response except manager was in a meeting  I tried to reach out to remedy the issues and find a new place however no one has responded to my emails or calls  It is very inconvenient to deal with all the issues when a large amount of money was paid  Tried to enjoy a holiday trip  instead Im stuck here till I checkout  I wouldnt recommend Zencity  unfortunately I didnt research the properties or the company 
435872809,Pros     Building has an elevator    Quiet most of the time  after   PM really quiet    Apartment has most amenities  stove top and oven  big fridge  iron and ironing table    Close to Target and CVS Pharmacy  Some restaurants nearby  Also close to Mccormick center     min drive away    Apartment is big  with   bathrooms    Cons    Apartment was really dirty  there was dirt and hair everywhere  even on the walls  Really never saw such a dirty apartment  The windows were almost opaque with grime  Also it smelled quite bad  The bathtub was dirty and the drain was clogged     Interior is really  really old  by the way  old does not necessarily mean vintage  with dirty carpets  dirty couch  dirty windows and cracked walls  Most doors did not close shut    I had heat in the apartment for   days out of    Due to the cold temperature in the apartment  I caught a cold    Lack of toiletries  only shampoo and shower gel were present    The lock on the entrance door is quite flimsy  would not leave valuables inside unattended   The apartment has very old  not vintage   decaying furnishings  Cracks everywhere  doors were not closing shut  There was no soap at the sink or bathtub  Bathtub had a clogged drain  Had to  buy soap  Draino and Lysol  to clean the bathtub    Cleaning  toiletries  proper heating and refurbishing 
203830343,I was disappointed with this accommodation  The apartment was not clean and smelled like smoke  We booked for two days  but only stayed for one  We stayed the second night at a hotel  The listing said the apartment slept three people  but there was only one blanket so my friend and I shared the bed and the blanket  Great location   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  Additional comments   We were unable to get in touch with the host on the day we checked in      Very expensive for what it was   
644345103,Nice view  has laundry if youre planning on staying a long time  It is a bit of a hassle to constantly have to be let in by the door man  who were very nice  but its more inconvenient than a hotel  There was never a pool and there is not a pool according to the front desk so thats a bit outrageous that it is in the description  Netflix didnt work even after reset  Strangely placed lamp caused me to injure my head when I got up in the middle of the night  right by the bed   Please be careful I would hate someone to injure themselves worse or better yet remove that lamp  Bathroom tub had hairs in it from another person  Just get a hotel  Netflix didnt work  logged out tried to reset and they would not give me the password Better off just getting a hotel at that price
573615052,This place was NOT what I expected  The pictures make it look newer than what it really is  The apartment could use a upgrade ESPECIALLY the bathroom  the tub was peeling   The only new thing in this apartment was the bedroom and living room floor  This place had a very unpleasant odor  Im not sure what it was but you should definitely consider a new house keeper and plug ins  This place had the bare minimum just a heads up  You might want to bring your own towel and washcloth  they only provided   of each  I do NOT use the same cloth on my face that Ive used to wash my body  No full body mirror only the bathroom  This place almost seems like a college dorm  Im being honest it wasnt what I expected  I booked based usually based on the reviews and this was inaccurate  Parking is HORRIBLE  The only   positive things about this place was the view of Lake Michigan  its definitely a safe place  and the location was close to food spots  Other than that I wasnt satisfied  Ive stayed in much better Airbnbs in the past  I hope you take a lot of these issues into consideration to help avoid complaints  Please consider a apartment upgrade  not just the floor  I was very unsatisfied but I had no choice but to stay  Thank God it wasnt for my entire trip  Never again    The number on the building DID not match what the email said  Very misleading   Again the place was hard to find  When giving out the address you should say the regent towers and give the actual numbers on the outside of the building which was different  That entire block was the      block so Im not sure where exactly you got the      from  And i never receive a welcome kit Not at that block is numbered in the     s and the building is called regent tower or something like that  Thats what you should tell people  I have no idea where you all got      from but i never saw those numbers If people were honest with their reviews and the host  This place had the bare minimum  horrible parking  hard to find  a odor  and it needs a full upgrade not just the floor  ESPECIALLY THE BATHROOM  
432693929,Student type well located functional building Try significantly upgrading LR furniture and accurately represent the property in the listing  Location is great   I think the description should say it is a well situated old building that is student style living  Also the couch and LR table legs are broken  and the couch cannot really be used as a bed  Better furniture  Less student noise   we had students screaming until midnight
432371105,My husband  son  and I stayed in this apartment for over a week  while our St  Louis home was on the market  We were looking for a cozy place to relax in the heart of the city to unwind  We felt the apartment is most suitable for individuals or families who need quick access to the nearby hospitals  and who are less bothered by the helicopter landings and ongoing noise of emergency responders  Though the interior is modern  the building is dated without central heating and air  and lacks a strong WIFI signal  which affected our ability to work from the apartment and to relax with the Smart TV  The kitchen was stocked with the bare minimum  four coffee mugs and settings for three people  We felt it lacked basic necessities  such as a towel and a mixing bowl  It would have helped to have a list of emergency numbers  directions for trash and recycling  info on parking  nearby activities  among other things   We felt the apartment was not adequately stocked for a two bedroom with three people  who stayed for more than a week  There were only four coffee cups  glasses  plates  and bowls  which meant we had to continually hand wash  We didnt find a kitchen towel and had to use pots and pans to make a simple salad   Wifi signal was weak and intermittent  which affected the Smart TV and caused it to go on and off  signal was almost non existent in the back bedrooms  We also found the hanging storage in the closet didnt fit for our winter clothes and was not enough for an extended stay  again for three people  Additional hangers might have helped  The fitted sheets dont fit properly on the bed  and easily come off  so that you are left sleeping on a plastic mattress  An information sheet regarding parking  trash   recycling  emergency contacts  etc  would also be helpful   I asked to change the booking to an earlier date and didnt receive a response  The location is as described  but its proximity next to the hospital   great for patients and students   makes it quite noisy and difficult to sleep with helicopter landings and emergency responders  I should have been more aware of this in booking this location  The ventilation system   window units   are loud and either blow too much air or do not circulate the air when turned down  When we tried to manage with them off  the air was stale and with the windows open  the street noise was a problem  Though the apartment has been updated  the building is dated and does not support modern amenities  such as central air  ceiling fans for ventilation and quality wi fi  I felt the price was high based on the quality of the building  The power strip that was nailed to the back of an end table fell off  We felt that the owner had provided the bare minimum to equip the apartment 
709780708,Super annoying    if we put Music in that tv she was text me   min later       we cant even Watch a movie in peace          that place is nice just not clean we had to clean myself to feel Good      
569753789,Positives   Excellent part of the city  full amenities  good communication   Negatives   Old building  could hear people through the walls   Overall  we enjoyed our stay but believe we have had better value during previous AirBnB experiences  Overpriced
435869528,I did not have a good experience with Zencity  Upon my arrival to the apartment I found the back door facing the alleyway partially open and unlocked  Unable to figure out the locking mechanism I called for assistance  The call center could not help me  Between that and the extremely noisy neighbor I opted to stay elsewhere that night   They suggested different fixes throughout the day the next day  all of which I had tried  until their last suggestion was something new and actually worked to fix the door   My main concern was that Zencity never sent someone to check on the issue and seemed unable to do so even if they had wanted to   The inability to respond to guest issues and emergencies will be why I will most likely not stay with Zencity in the future  The biggest issue with my stay was that I was unable to lock the back door my first night  The apartment was easily accessible from the back alley  The people I called were unable to help me resolve the issue so for my safety I was forced to spend the night elsewhere  spending an extra      at the only available hotel in the vicinity  Over the course of the next day they were able to find someone who knew how to operate the unusual lock  In the future please be sure to have your cleaning staff secure the door or leave instructions for guests on how to do so as the lock is not intuitive  Responsive but not located in the area so unable too assist with any issues  Also did not know who to contact to give me assistance with issues 
709762523,Really enjoyed  staying at the steelyard  The location is great  liked having a gym  rooms were quiet from noise from neighbors  and Internet was fast  Had an issue with the blue tooth door  to no ones fault  those things can happen  but ZenCity was very difficult to deal with for service  Long hold times     min   multiple times during the stay while being locked out of the apartment  They arent local so the site ended up being responsible to offer a solution  Customer service is not very friendly or understanding 
551683574,  Took a while to figure out to use key pad  Even though it was very simple in the end  Two days before we came I had to email and call to get the codes to get in  Earlier communication  About the keys would have been better so I wasnt worried I would be stranded  Make it more homey  less sterile 
594047139,Location is great  but they did not clean properly before we got there  They also let us into the room late as well  But overall  it wasnt the worst  Upon arrival  the room looked very nice but when I went to inspect the bedroom there were a lot of black hairs all over the bed  and red stains on the pillow case and comforter  It looked like blood staining  There were also scuffs all over the walls of the entire place  and inside of the closet of the bedroom were lots of weird staining on the walls  Overall  the bedroom needed to be cleaned much better  I dont think they washed the sheets and comforter at all  There was also leftover food in the fridge from the last people who stayed there  I expected it to be spotless  especially after being denied an early check in so that they could  properly clean   So  that was a bit disappointing  But the location was nice and the building workers were very kind  For the location  and the cleanliness  it should be at a lower price per night 
593367997,Nice place 
640535502,Very flexible with providing us a new place since the previous renters ruined the original place we booked  The fire alarm was dying so beeped every two minutes for five hours until we resorted to pulling the battery out so we could sleep since maintenance never came 
712679782,Apartment felt bare and a little unclean   If youre looking for cozy  this is not it   If youre looking for a relatively large apartment in a very good Lincoln Park location  this may be it 
721700503,Cool place to stay  great location but we had some issues with clean environment but they had great service and helped worked it all out 
583325465,Overall this truly is a really beautiful place to stay  But there were a handful of things that didnt work properly that we really  really wish had  I feel like this place has potential to be an even higher value with the following   Ensure kitchenware is truly clean before allowing a new tenant to come in  Oil on cookware is unappealing  Also you should look into putting oven mitts in the space   Bathroom  just invest in some bathroom spray for after poops and a full size shampoo  conditioner   body wash  It wont be much more expensive than buying all the tiny single use ones and makes it feel much homier and less like a cold hotel  Also  the toilet was installed improperly on the spring and therefore lurches every time you sit down  Id get that checked out  Also recommend two ply toilet paper and paper towels  The rest of the place is so plush and nice  dont cut corners on these simple and easy amenities   Not sure if its just because its a basement unit but the WiFi does NOT consistently work  Cuts out and boots you off consistently  This is something I had asked about before so it really shouldnt have been a problem  but it was  If the basement has a hard time holding onto WiFi  invest in an extender  Nothing worse than needing to get work done and not being able to do it from your Airbnb   It was not evident to me from the listing that it was an underground unit  There are windows lining the top of the walls that go to the street  Black out curtains were great in the bedroom  I suggest them for living room as well  Had someone stop and look in  crouch  while we were inside and not clothed    The door connected to the parking lot did not lock  fob access  and it took   ish days to actually lock after we complained  Did not make us feel safe as one night when we left  we noticed a man in the lot checking cars for valuables to steal    Safety is a huge priority  This is why we werent keen on soulard originally but the door shouldve been locked  I believe it was due to construction  but it still should be secure      of the time   Should really make an effort to make it transparent in the listing that theres currently construction    especially since this affects doors being left unlocked  noise during the day  and the place being generally littered with flecks  dust  construction bits  etc  Also dog poop all over the front entrance carpet the first two days    its so important to keep the place clean  And dust free or at least be transparent that there will be dust for asthmatics    The water in the shower does not stay cold for long  I would try to find a way to fix this  Impossible for two people to take subsequent showers  We showered together to keep the water hot long enough but thats not everyones situation   Washer does not drain water  This can be a real stick in the mud if youre trying to wash your clothes and get somewhere   issue wasnt resolved during our stay sadly  We had to wring out our wet  dirty clothes  hand wash  and then hang all over the shower to get them to dry  Thats a basic amenity I was disappointed we did not have for our stay during the very busy holidays    Vent is exceptionally loud and the apartment for some reason will not change temperature quickly  Our thermostat was at    most the time and no matter how much we tinkered with the settings  we couldnt get it down to a more comfortable temperature   Finally  its an underground unit and there must be access somewhere as there are ants around in the kitchen      Overall it is literally a beautiful space  The kitchen is gorgeous  The bed is SO comfortable  Its aesthetically so pleasing  But if you want to make it a true value  please address those issues      On a positive note  if you are looking for a visually pleasing place to stay and dont need very reliable WiFi or washing machine  the rest of this is pretty okay to deal with  The listing isnt one of the most expensive in the area and you have to take that into account  The TV will buffer from time to time but the kitchen appliances work and I cannot express how comfortable the bed is  If you can deal with a very minor inconveniences  the main safety issue of the door is now fixed   and a big of construction  Id stay here again  Unfortunately  it didnt quite suit all our needs and I think if some of these issues get addressed  it could be a fantastic spot    Overall this truly is a really beautiful place to stay  But there were a handful of things that didnt work properly that we really  really wish had  Im just dropping by privately to leave some constructive criticism  I feel like this place has potential to be an even higher value with the following   Ensure kitchenware is truly clean before allowing a new tenant to come in  Oil on cookware is unappealing  Also you should look into putting oven mitts in the space   Bathroom  just invest in some bathroom spray for after poops and a full size shampoo  conditioner   body wash  It wont be much more expensive than buying all the tiny single use ones and makes it feel much homier and less like a cold hotel  Also  the toilet was installed improperly on the spring and therefore lurches every time you sit down  Id get that checked out  Also recommend two ply toilet paper and paper towels  The rest of the place is so plush and nice  dont cut corners on these simple and easy amenities   Not sure if its just because its a basement unit but the WiFi does NOT consistently work  Cuts out and boots you off consistently  This is something I had asked about before so it really shouldnt have been a problem  but it was  If the basement has a hard time holding onto WiFi  invest in an extender  Nothing worse than needing to get work done and not being able to do it from your Airbnb    Black out curtains were great in the bedroom  I suggest them for living room as well  Had someone stop and look in  crouch  while we were inside and not clothed    The door connected to the lot took   ish days to actually lock  Did not make us feel safe as one night when we left  we noticed a man in the lot checking cars for valuables to steal    Safety is a huge priority  This is

outside  Also no solutions offered during our   night stay for WiFi it washer issue  Basement listing and wish that were more obvious  There are several touches that couldve made it a better value  Including clean amenities  working WiFi and dishwasher  locked doors  properly installed toilet  etc  very nice place but just leaving some constructive criticism 
413624553,I hate to write negative reviews and I pretty much never do  but I was really disappointed in my stay at this apartment and it negatively affected my experience in Chicago     The unit was run down     I felt unsafe in the unit  I am a small     person  and I could have easily kicked the door down i e  the bolt lock on the door wouldnt have actually prevented someone from breaking into the unit     The bathroom sink and bathroom tub didnt have a steady water stream coming out of them  It was difficult to shower or use the bathroom sink because of this     By far  the worst thing about this unit was that it was extremely cold  There is no way to adjust the AC  The unit is run off of three radiators  One in the living room  bedroom and bathroom  The bathroom and bedroom ones worked  but were still too cold for me  The living room radiator was obviously damaged i e  it had duck tape and water dripping from it into a pot  The living room stayed at a low    degree temperature the entire time  I had to scurry between the bedroom and the bathroom in order to minimize my time in the cold kitchen living room  I did message the host about it and they didnt indicate that there was any way for me to control the unit  Overall  Im really disappointed because I decided to pay more money to stay in this unit in comparison to some of the surrounding units because I thought that I was ensuring there wouldnt be issues with my stay   The house manual says   Feel free to adjust the AC temp to your liking     there was no way to control the AC from the apartment  The living room radiator was clearly damaged  The living room was in the low    degrees my entire stay  I asked the host about AC control and they said I jut needed to wait for the radiator to turn on   There were issues with the heater that were unresolved This place was priced higher relative to the other places to stay in the surrounding area  I chose to pay a higher price thinking that the ZenCity apartment would be much better than the others 
510209041,Its a really nice space with wonderful shops and restaurants nearby   AC wasn u    t working  
413518084,The Good   Apartment was in a great location in Hyde Park  I was visiting UChicago and it was an easy walk to campus  with several restaurants  cafes  and a drug store also nearby  Accessing the apartment was easy  with clear instructions and a lockbox in place  Zencity was prompt and helpful with communication throughout the process  and was quick to answer any questions or concerns I might have  The apartment was well stocked with amenities  including an iron  a steamer  a lint roller  extra towels  etc  It is well sized for one or two individuals with a small gas stove  a full sized refrigerator  and a small breakfast nook  I enjoyed the low key decorating style    The Bad   Water pressure in the bathroom wasnt great I usually ended up washing my hands in the bathtub because the waterflow in the sink was frustratingly slow  There was some hair around the bathtub and toilet  which didnt bother me  but I can imagine other future guests may be particular about that  As other reviewers have noted  the lighting in the main room is unusual the kitchen lights need to be on to use the outlets on the far side of the apartment  which is where the television is located  This wasnt a problem for me  but again  I can imagine other guests wanting to be able to watch television without the lights on or wanting to watch TV right before they go to sleep    The Ugly   My phone charger and headphones inexplicably went missing on my second day here   The room came stocked with a phone charger  and a charitable explanation would be that someone came in while I was gone to retrieve that charger and accidentally mistook my charger for that one  It is also POSSIBLE that I may have put my headphones in my pocket and subsequently lost them outside of the apartment  I think this is the most likely explanation for how both items ended up missing   A less charitable explanation would be that someone deliberately took two items that were placed right inside the door of my room      I spoke with the Zencity management about this  and they assured me that no one on their crew came into my room while I was staying there  And I can understand how ridiculous this sounds from their perspective  if someone told me that his phone charger went missing  I would assume he had misplaced it and it was somewhere in his bag  or hed left it in the bathroom  or left it at Starbucks or something  But I am clinically OCD about my stuff  I rarely misplace things  let alone lose them  and I spent several hours scouring the apartment  unpacking my luggage over and over again  and even sorting through the trash can multiple times in an effort to find these items  I am quite confident that I do not have these items  and I am genuinely perplexed as to how they went missing  It seems unlikely that anyone on a cleaning crew or a landlord with an extra key would take the time to come into my room and take these two small things  But any other possible explanations I can think of a burglary with no signs of forced entry  A previously unknown occasion of sleepwalking where I took these items outside the apartment  seem even more far fetched   I dont mean to be throwing around reckless accusations  I chose this apartment because it was well reviewed  and it sounds like most guests have had a really positive time staying here  But this was my experience  I left feeling uncomfortable and unnerved that someone had gone through my stuff  This is the first time when using Airbnb in which I feel like my trust has been violated  and while I dont think it was prompted by any personal animus again  I think the most likely explanation is that someone came into my room and took my phone charger by mistake I would not stay here again 
439232297,Just need a parking spot
717933019,Wonderful location  Very tight space  efficient for   person staying there and if youre just there to shower and sleep  Tight space and not enough room for   people staying  The building is old so expect some sewage issues  but the unit is nice and as clean as it can be in an old building 
409759483,the location and price are both great  and the check in process is straightforward  my first issue is that the radiators in the apartment have covers on them with clutter on top  denying access to the control valves  thereby making the whole apartment hotter than    degrees the whole time  when I contacted the host about it they said there were control valves on the bottom of the radiators  however this was not true  the only valves were blocked by metal covers and clutter  the second issue was that the host scheduled maintenance repairs in the bathroom during the time that I paid for to stay there  expecting me to let the workers in and watch them while they did the repairs  I dont pay to be a housesitter and ensure repairs are done when I book an Airbnb    the place being so hot the whole time with no solution aside from keeping all the windows open made the experience much less enjoyable than it should have been  but it was a nice place otherwise  they were good about responding in a timely manner  however the responses didnt provide proper help  their radiators have covers over them that prevented access to the control valves  and the covers have random clutter on them preventing them from being opened  they told me the valves were accessible from the bottom  however this was not the case  as a result  the entire place was well over    degrees the entire stay  making it extremely uncomfortable 
631234728,Love this place  Id stay again G  unit needs attention on the ceiling areas  because the hole in the bathroom ceiling with water splashing on you everytime your in there was a bit much  I love staying with you guys but  that experience I wasnt happy with  Broking screen on front door camera If the ceiling in the restroom wasnt broken and water didnt splash on me every time I used the restroom
626319708,This was my first time to KC and was really looking forward to going to my girlfriends hometown  The view was absolutely amazing  But checking in was a hassle  The code to the lockbox was incorrect so had to call management to issue us a new box  When we opened that box we got a key  but had no key fob to open the doors     luckily a couple who was staying there to was able to let us in with them  Having to open multiple lock boxes just to get a key and key fob was ridiculous  We arrived at          minutes before check in  and we did not have our key and keyfob until   PM  We get upstairs and are shocked with how dirty the place was  there was food on the cabinets  hair in the shower and on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed  We asked if we could check in early and were told that wouldnt happen because they needed to clean the place  They obviously didnt or did a HORRIBLE job at it  There were no trash bags in the unit either  Ive stayed with other companies like VRBO or Homeaway  this was my first Airbnb experience and other than the view  it was absolutely horrendous  My girlfriend and I slept on the couch the entire visit since there was hair on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed   Private   This was my first time to KC and was really looking forward to going to my girlfriends hometown  The view was absolutely amazing  But checking in was a hassle  The code to the lockbox was incorrect so had to call management to issue us a new box  When we opened that box we got a key  but had no key fob to open the doors     luckily a couple who was staying there to was able to let us in with them  Having to open multiple lock boxes just to get a key and key fob was ridiculous  We arrived at          minutes before check in  and we did not have our key and keyfob until   PM  We get upstairs and are shocked with how dirty the place was  there was food on the cabinets  hair in the shower and on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed  We asked if we could check in early and were told that wouldnt happen because they needed to clean the place  They obviously didnt or did a HORRIBLE job at it  There were no trash bags in the unit either  Ive stayed with other companies like VRBO or Homeaway  this was my first Airbnb experience and other than the view  it was absolutely horrendous  My girlfriend and I slept on the couch the entire visit since there was hair on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed  
452637202,This location was great and it a huge and spacious apartment  However  the cleanliness of the apartment was very lack luster  We had to clean the floors of the apartment as there was still dust and pet hair     on the floor   The bathroom was a little difficult to maneuver with the claw bathtub  There is no proper way to absorb or drain liquid that inevitably gets out of the bathtub   and we had to take a mop to the floor every night   Check in instructions  Host didnt respond and they were still cleaning past check in It had very unclean flooring  After their cleaning crew left   we had to sweep and mop as there was still a lot of pet hair     on the floors and some black stuff
412079359,WiFi didnt work the whole time I was there  The mattress is completely broken in  my back still hurts from   nights of restless sleep  Theres a barking dog next door and also a loud crashing sound  Ice machine  at least once an hour  No extra blankets for the    degree Chicago weather  Thank you trying to have people fix the WiFi for me but Im not tech savvy and did I that I could on multiple devices to try and figure it out  Please replace the mattress for people with back problems  Theres a barking dog next door and also a loud crashing sound  Ice machine  at least once an hour  No extra blankets for the    degree weather  WiFi wasn u    t working the entire time I was there  The mattress is totally broken in  I kept sinking towards the middle  My back still hurts from   nights of restless sleep  Front desk didnt know who Zencity was  Insisted I show them a reservation which I was scared to do because Zencity told me explicitly not to mention Airbnb  Didnt feel good to be put in a situation like that Although the WiFi was out I had people trying to solve it ASAP which was appreciated  Even though it didnt amount to the WiFi getting fixed
622641093,By all means did not have a bad experience  was just frustrating that the wifi wasnt very good and that we had better results when we connected the smart tv to my hotspot on my phone instead of the wifi provided  Also got zero responses when asking for suggestions on how to fix it which was a little irritating but all in all id say its worth a weekend getaway  Responses were great at first but then all of a sudden got no responses whatsoever when we were having trouble with the wifi  Had to resort to using the hotspot on my phone to connect to the smart tv which worked better than the actual wifi provided 
631158984,The place was okay  We were barely there  Had a funny smell 
702586477,Great location  large park  groceries and restaurants around  Gym downstairs and terrace on the roof  stuff responded promptly    However  quite expensive and   the sink was clogged upon arrival  slit above the conditioner  it took several days to turn the heating on   the impression was negative   Good for those who are traveling for treatment in barns Jewish hospital   Photos show you new apartment  however it u    s much used already  Quite expensive but   the sink was clogged upon arrival  slit above the conditioner  it took several days to turn the heating on
622529890,Place was listed as non smoking  Terrible smoke smell and cigarette butts in this apartment  Bed sheets stained  Hair in bathroom sink  Leftover food in refrigerator which stunk  Reached out twice  no resolve was ever offered  Very disappointed  Will never stay with Zencity again  Asked for partial refund  no response  Reached out to host twice to explain situation of place smelling  like smoke  First response was  okay  thanks for letting me know    no resolve  Second time I contacted host  no response 
162615592,Cool space to crash in  comfortable bed  Warehouse atmosphere means more noise so better for people who dont mind a slightly less private experience  Noise machine   portable AC were a plus   Hey Chris  I really appreciated how quickly you responded to my question and the ease of check in check out  Also  the bed was very comfortable   I gave   stars instead of   because the space is really cool but has SO much more potential  Ive spent lots of time in warehouses   artist spaces and there a few things that could make the place more inviting  touching up the holes in the walls   repaint  if the walls were a neutral color they wouldnt be noticeable   could even look cool  The extension cords running across the floor were a bummer   I ended up rerouting some chords to not trip  Also  the outlet that the ball shaped light was plugged into was out   The noise pollution was mentioned in in the listing but since the bed is directly underneath your neighbors living area there was cigarette smoke all night  too  This can be helped if you moved the bed to another wall or down the wall  This would help solve some of the lack of outlets near the bed too  Dust   slight odor in the bathroom was unfortunate   I took a broom and knocked down a bunch of cobwebs   Your space really is awesome  just not as inviting as I had hoped  Wish you the best of luck in the future   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  
646727621,Great place 
479941797,Trash place no parking 
400631648,Easy check in  excellent amenities  poor customer service  When I reached out about debris on the floors  their response was that I should vacuum it up  When I reached out about there being no wifi  their response was that the codes are at the bottom of the router  they werent   But the apartment is just as advertised  with a lovely partial view of the lake  and if you have trouble  reach out to Airbnb support to have them mediate 
575870985,This place was very nice  The only issues I had were that the WiFi never worked the entirety of my stay  thus making the Roku TV in the living room useless  I did not contact them about this because I figured I could fix it myself by connecting disconnecting the tv to the WiFi  Also  I had accidentally left two items there and had contacted host to ask if I could go back into the apartment to get my belongings  and they never answered  Its been a week or so and still no reply  They hadnt had too many issues replying to me prior  besides it was a little late of a response at times  Regardless  I would likely stay here again 
408149084,Needs better window coverings   Area is just ok  Overall good and good beds and clean  Need better window dressing Ok area Ok  needs black out Curtins  Rooms are way too bright
400313894,Experience was OK  Location was fine  relative to UChicago  Plenty of space in the apartment  Bedroom door and bathroom door didnt close properly  however  Couch was worn in and pretty uncomfortable  Very average experience  but given the other reviews expected much more   I was left expecting more  space was good  but far from expectations  lock box didnt work properly  still made it in but had to use Cleaners keys  where the lockbox was unlocked  raising security concerns 
368296100,This apartment is ideally located as the neighborhood is wonderful  Please note that parking is difficult to find and in most cases is not free  The apartment is very spacious and comfortable  In addition to my other comments  This property appeared not to be owned by an individual  When I got to the residence not only did I struggle to find parking  the keys were not in the lockbox  I sent a message via the app but then I also called to get a call center who didnt really show any empathy that there were no keys in the lock box  The agent said that she would make it an urgent message but couldnt say when someone would call me back  In the meantime  Chris responded and asked me to try the backup lockbox which was also empty  He then asked me to try the cleaners box which had multiple sets of keys  I am guessing that they own multiple apartments in this building   One set of keys allowed me to get into my designated apartment  Please note that ALL   lockbox combinations were set to just one number difference than the actual combination  This did NOT give me a very safe feeling  I realize that the owner of this listing may not have control over the initial area when entering the building and the staircase but it was disgusting and left a bad impression  When you are paying a cleaning fee you expect the areas to be clean   Listing says wifi not included and confirmed that it was included  The listing says free street parking  This is not exactly true as it is only free for part from like midnight to   am   This property appeared not to be owned by an individual  When I got to the residence not only did I struggle to find parking  the keys were not in the lockbox  I sent a message via the app but then I also called to get a call center who didnt really show any empathy that there were no keys in the lock box  The agent said that she would make it an urgent message but couldnt say when someone would call me back  In the meantime  Chris responded and asked me to try the backup lockbox which was also empty  He then asked me to try the cleaners box which had multiple sets of keys  I am guessing that they own multiple apartments in this building   One set of keys allowed me to get into my designated apartment  Please note that ALL   lockbox combinations were set to just one number difference than the actual combination  This did NOT give me a very safe feeling  Once I got in I confirmed with Chris and he JUST offered me an apology  I wouldnt consider this good customer service  See Check In comments  Please see my comments in the other areas 
659202120,The place was nice inside and it had a great view  However  trying to communicate with the host was very difficult  I left some keys on accident and it was quite difficult to get ahold of them  Also when checking in  it was difficult to find the correct location 
366454782,There were several issues during my stay  Upon entry there was a harsh odor in addition to the smell of cigarettes  Additionally  the linens were stained  the tub was clogged and would not drain  and the bathroom sink was not working properly either  They were however pretty responsive and did their best to fix the tub  not the odor   Overall  made the best of it but would not stay again nor recommend  There were several issues during my stay  Upon entry there was a harsh odor in addition to the smell of cigarettes  Additionally  the linens were stained  the tub was clogged and would not drain  and the bathroom sink was not working properly either  They were however pretty responsive and did their best to fix the tub  not the odor   If it had been throughly cleaned before guests arrived 
666867196,I have stayed with Zencity now a handful of times  hoping the experience would eventually get better since the properties are so beautiful  It becomes obvious that their customer service is ran by an automated response system   you very rarely get to talk to an actual person  There have been occasions where Ive actually called instead of messaging   never actually spoke to a person  On all of my stays but one  I have received the check in information as much as   hours after the check in time  As well as checking into an apartment only to realize that its a completely different home than advertised without the promised amenities  I advise you to save the time   hassle  For very similar pricing you can find equally if not better listings in the area  Stay away from Zencity  You can find better deals staying at hotel in the same area
651000975,Other than water leak and mildew ell it was an ok place to stay Spend a lot of time cleaning up water and trying not to fall when you walk out of the room onto the vinyl floor Wet carpet  kids would walk from the carpet area and end up slipping and fell a couple times
360463138,My stay was good it was nice and cozy I just honestly think they shouldnt charge for a cleaning fee if it is not going to be clean when you arrive  My stay was great I just think It could have been more cleaner   The cleanness  
632600899,This was worst experience with Airbnb  The bed had hair all over I asked for new sheets and even those  looked nasty     there were no pots or pans to cook with no even a dish towel     no paper towels in the kitchen      there was no dish soap or dish towel to clean off the couple plates they had        I would like a full refund because this was just the worst really  If the bed was clean 
717165877,They monitor you its scary actually
672142128,This is a well traveled very busy location  If you like constant action then this is the place for you  It is not meant for children and families or a quiet retreat  Very loud location
652242490,In my opinion this unit was not in rentable condition but not all bad  Good  location  beds  linens  size  furnishings  Bad  Not very clean  mold in bedroom  ceiling fan not installed correctly and fell from  ceiling  shower drain clogged  This unit was not In rentable condition  Should spend some time and attention on this unit  Cleaner  things not broken  This was more like a college dorm room apartment than a place for a professional to stay  Terrible smell in the common areas of the building the place needs more attention 
456842639,Good location  Place was smaller than expected  No internet during whole stay  Thanks for hosting   There was no internet access  and no tv service   The internet connection was not working and despite of contacting the host about the issue  the problem was not resolve during our   day stay  We had no tv access either because it work using internet   The host responded to my messages but their responses were not helpful  The price was to high for the place 
512611304,Place was fine Lock box didnt properly lock
702750719,This was our first time staying at an air bnb so we didnt know what to expect so we went with the info on the host site  We arrived early booking site issue  we added flight info arriving at   am and after trying the code in the rain for about    min we called the host  They had the arrival time at     we are in st louis with nothing to do until  pm straight off a place with luggage   glad we had a rental car because if you uber or lyft we would have been stuck outside for all that time  We booked our stay in advance and when we arrived check in process was difficult  for someone who has never used intercom and lockbox systems before the directions were unclear  Finally at about     we get to check in  Place was large but basic  If you are looking for luxary or all the amenenties this is not the place for you  Alot of space   small full cheap bed but it does have a ton of closet space and   bathrooms  No jacuzzi  No parking  No Pool  No smoking  We booked ahead of time and when we got there there was   towels in the whole place for   people for   days  Take you own everything  If you are a smoker this place is not for you way to much to have to go through to get in and out  Also the biggest disasspointment it says by the arch and shows pic of the arch all lit up  THE ARCH IS NO WHERE IN SITE FROM THIS PLACE  I would have booked a different place where we would see the arch  Over all we will book again with airbnb   when i booked i booked beacuse it says at the arch and also shows pic at the arch and the arch was not even close by and you cant see it from any level of this place there is literally nothing just a place to sleep  np jacuzzi no pool  cant smoke  no parking   check in time was off we had to wait in the rain  the key was not in the proper place we couldnt check in on time  there was no clear insrtuctions on how to get in step by step we stayed for   days they had   towel in there per person  not acceptable  the reservation is made well in advance and it they dont provide it needs to state that
449510025,Well designed place  super close to area restaurants and bars  Host is not weary of charging full price for anything that is perceived as damaged 
567464766,The elevators were  down for most of our stay  Checkout with all our heavy luggage and   flights of stairs and a Health condition is no joke  Having to go up and down flights of stairs a few times to add to the parking meter really sucked   The floorboards creak insanely loud all over the place  But it seems to be this way in the whole bdg  not just this unit    Bathtub was dirty and bathroom countertop was not really clean  They offered to send a housekeeper but it was hours later so we didnt oblige  Cute simple decor  Great location  But I wont stay here again for the price with these issues  Non working elevator made transporting several heavy luggage up and downstairs very difficult  Clean bathroom and working elevator  Less creaky floors 
616445798,Hosts were hard to reach  Had a bad key that only worked half the time Bad key  wouldnt open door Hosts were hard to reach didnt respond
434804845,I would have forgiven several thigs and given a five star review because the bedroom was nice  but they tried to charge me      for some cheap chair I never touched   Room was nice but building was a little run down and sketchy overall  Told me I couldnt check in early because the space needed to be cleaned    then the bathroom wasnt clean  Quick to response until I refused to pay      for a cheap particle board chair I didnt use strange part of town would have given five starts anyway if they didnt try to charge me      for a chair I didnt break
591599892,The place looks great in the pictures but it is the complete opposite  The place is dirty and smells like there is a gas leak in there  The couch and carpet in the living room are filthy  The bathroom was partly clean  the sink was nasty   The bed sheets were full of stains and long hair  The place gives you a good impression in the pics but its the complete opposite  The price might seem good but trust me    its not worth it  I stayed there   days and it was a bad experience  I just moved to another Airbnb   miles away for the same night rate and its super amazing  Also the parking is if you get lucky to find a spot 
431173110,One bedroom flat in building with college dorm vibe  Not the most tasteful art on the walls    of   windows in the unit open and the radiator doesnt turn off 
580442055,Nice place  Decently clean Overall the place was really nice and clean  However it smelled awful or weed  which didnt go away  and there was black hair on the shower wall  Also  poop in the toilet        Dolman St   Cleaner
645306829,I was very surprised at how filthy the place was  the host were very slow about fixing the issue and sending people to clean the mess  Its cheap though so you get what you pay for but hopefully they fix the issue as soon as possible  other than that it wouldve been perfect  very nice spot in a good location  please just take care of your cleaning people so they take better care of your business  invest in candles  always keep the air blowing even if no one is there  house cleaner never came  it wasnt urgent to fix my issue  i couldve paid for a hotel and atleast had housekeeping come asap or gotten a new room  but overall good concept 
669935197,I would NOT recommend this apartment to anyone  I was looking for a modern cozy apartment  but this was anything but that  The apartment did NOT look like the pictures that were posted  It was outdated and misrepresented  According  to Zencity the place recently underwent a renovation which is why the pictures differ from actual apartment  However  the said  renovations  made the apartment look worse  The apartment was not clean to my satisfaction  The apartment window seals were dirty and the blinds were COVERED with dust  The toilet was broken  I have a video  and a light was blew out in the bathroom  The apartment is located in CWE  loved that  but they are doing construction  Construction workers wake you up at the crack of dawn  if youre in to that kind of thing   GO FOR IT   The people who represented Zencity were anything  but helpful  They were snippy and rude  You can see them argue with customers in the review comments under other postings  You can count on that they ARENT going to do the right thing by their customers  All they can offer you are excuses and insincere apologies  Do not book with Zencity   If you are looking to rent here RUN     A total catfish  This apartment looks NOTHING like the pictures  which the exception of the sheets on the bed  Next to the cleanliness  THIS WAS MY BIGGEST CONCERN  They lure you in with a modern look  but the apartment has anything but that  I u    m unable to upload pics of the actual apartment  When I notified Zencity of my concern they stated the apartment had recent renovations  I thought renovations where supposed to make spaces look better   not worse  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE      Zencity is RUDE and unapologetic  As you can see on other posts they like to argue with their customers and point the finger  No responsibility  Location is not horrible because it is in the CWE  but they are doing construction and you can here it every morning at the crack of dawn  If you are looking for a getaway to get rest   dont stay here  The apartment looking as host presented in photos 
420786026,A few of the lights were burnt out or dim and the tub wasnt super clean but the location was peaceful and price was okay 
249742301,No the value for the stay pay Over all thank you  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  listing description   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions 
722178615,Meh but still nice The place was a bit messy and had crumbs all over and scribbles like kids were there before everything els for the value though was great  Parking  Housing projects
612010563,My stay was nice  check in was super easy and quick  the apartment was alright   cant beat the price  EXCEPT for a couple things  the minute i walked in the apartment it had a really unpleasant smell  so i bought some air freshner   helped a lil bit    the bathroom couldve been cleaner  no biggie  the bed sheets and towels had stains on them but they looked washed    you should get new ones    Other than that it was a quiet place to stay  OH and nice view  Thank you for allowing me to be a guest 
700265059,Honestly a great Airbnb in a beautiful are  alittle far from the airport and from the tourist spots but still a great deal  My only problem was the rude staff and waiting hours to check in just to be told  people have lunch breaks you know 
646349974,Good location  decent value  decent amenities  but it just was not very clean  You need a new cleaning company 
569800514,This is my first poor experience with Airbnb  it was a mess from the beginning  The toilet leaked dirty water into the floor  there was exposed wiring  the shower didnt drain  The host was extremely responsive and sent maintenance out to correct the issues in a reasonable amount of time  but not being able to use the shower or toilet for periods of time  shower out of service for over    hours   shouldnt happen in any place you stay  Its a great location building and these issues should now be corrected   Other notes   I didnt realize until after booking that there is no parking available  so be prepared to pay to park or have to park a block away as street parking is limited    The wifi is very very weak  we had to hot spot our phones to even stream a youtube video   Listed as workspace friendly  but the wifi was too poor to work from home  They also claim to have basic amenities to cook  but there wasnt even salt and pepper available  
366406089,The apartment was pretty good  comfortable space  However  when there were issues brought up the host neglected  very slow responses  The radiator leaked and a couple drawers were broken in the kitchen  the remote was also missing  The key was a bit hard to fit in the front door The host would take at least five hours on average to respond to problems that I brought up
673950074,Nice studio apartment  just small  Clean  easy access
628942484,Overall the places and value of this company are great but the people skills we ran into were well below average  Sneaky practices and bad support teams locally  First place was amazing  The second was going well and then the lady ruined it 
361837593,Nice place for price  Based on pictures i thought that this location would be a bit larger but i made do with what i had   The place was kind of cold at night  Heat really didnt blow out had to use oven to warm up apartment 
361538535,Nice and clean as always
609276587,The place is exactly what is pictured and is in a great location on the West Side of St  Louis  We had issues with gaining access to the unit because it has an automatic security lock that doesnt match up with the door frame correctly  The place was amazing and had a wonderful aesthetic  It was in the perfect location for us and we enjoyed our stay for the most part  The thing that ruined it was the fact that the security lock on the door was not lined up with the door frame which caused major issues with locking and unlocking  I was concerned about parking my car in the side lot because the spots were numbered  Usually that means that each tenant is assigned a spot number  but I couldnt find a spot number in their check in information so I was worried I parked in someone elses spot  After I asked the host they promptly responded that I could park in any spot  We called and left a message with Zencity about the fact that our unique access code wasnt working to unlock the door to the unit  We left all of our information as well as what issues we were experiencing and we were never called back  Fortunately after struggling with the door for quite some time we figured out that the lock doesnt line up correctly with the door frame  So after you enter the access code you have to pull on the handle then turn the handle and push in quickly in order to get the door to open 
358024837,okay  but couch not very good for sleeping living room floor lamp seemed to not work  lightbulb   listed as sleeping    but my daughter found the couch pretty uncomfortable 
622519297,Late responses  which caused me to have    mins to figure out another place to stay and not be charged for a late fee Wasnt able to find out if I could extendend until   mins before check out very inconvenient considering I have a lot of stuff  But the place was nice and safe
355750534,the place was very clean and they had lots of extra things that u may sometimes forget when packing   the host was great as far as communication but there was a stench in the building like bad plumbing  The sofa in the apartment was  very uncomfortable otherwise the stay was great   
592716261,Overall the location was great  but hallway flooding and broken locks on the window made us feel unsafe  Issues were addressed and improvements were made 
422211073,Finding parking was a hassle  The place overall was cute and nice to stay at for the night  Some areas were a bit messy  but it smelled fresh  If you stay here  it does get pretty hot  Be sure to keep the windows open and the ceiling fan on  The area was nice and quiet  No loud neighbors 
646408838,Overall  I was very disappointed in my stay here and would not stay again unless some things were improved     Ill say the good things first  Zencitys communication   customer service was great   They got back to texts in about    minutes every time   Also  this is  or at least could be  a beautiful apartment   location  It is right along the L train which is great for access to the city but does cause some noise and people waiting for the train can see right in the windows so theres also its no privacy   Shades that open from the bottom would be nice so you can still see the horizon but block commuters view    That said  theres A LOT to improve at this location  It seems like it hasnt really been up kept and really needs some love to make it better   FOR EXAMPLE    there was mold growing visibly on the bathroom ceiling  both bedside lamps were very broken and not very useable   half the light bulbs burnt out    there was hair on the floor upon arrival  very gross     the throw rug under the bed was very grimy  the garbage was broken  not much privacy from L commuters   and the kitchen sink kept backing up     Honestly  I expected more from Zencity and was disappointed   It ended being a good stay but could have been far better   I hope things can be improved and to stay again if so  It is a beautiful location and I think Zencity has the potential to do better  Hi   thanks for your quick replies   Your communication was great   That said  I think theres a lot to improve at this location   It is a beautiful unit and can be great but seems like it hasnt really been up kept and really needs some love to make it better    E g   mold in the bathroom  two broken bedside lamps  half the light bulbs burnt out  hair on the floor upon arrival  grimy carpet  etc     I expected more from Zencity and was disappointed   It ended being a good stay but could have been far better   I hope to stay with you again and dont mean to insult you all  I just want to be honest to help improve things   Thanks again   hope youre well    Sincerely  James
351689495,Unit very basic and lacking in warmth   very bare bones  hanging  closet  a joke  Total lack of atmosphere  Poor shower head  Information lacking on use of TV 
608827715,The apartment itself was nice with a good location  but the bathroom and kitchen werent very clean which was frustrating  There was a used washcloth and leftover shampoo left in the shower  and almost all of the dishes we used had to be washed first because they were very dirty  Im not sure why the cleaning fee was      We couldnt park our car at the house because the person befor us took the key with them and they didnt tell us until we called them and they didnt have a replacement key  so we couldnt use the parking  Other than that it was fine though We were unable to find the key card for the parking lot  After searching for a long time  we finally called to ask and they said the person before us must have taken it with them  so we should park on the street  It ended up working out but it was frustrating The apartment was really dirty  considering we payed a    dollar cleaning fee  There were dirty rags and used shampoo bottles left in the shower  the mirror was dirty  there were dirty pots  pans  and silverware put back in the drawers without being washed
629102362,This apartment was cute and I love the decor but there were a couple of things wrong with the apartment and the trains omg Not being near the train we couldnt watch tv or sleep
555294053,The location was great but we ended up getting locked out of our loft for some reason that no one cannot explain  The host blaimed the loft manager for the locks they left on but also said it was not the first time it happened  We had to pay a locksmith to break in the lock so we can get in  I think its horrible that we did not get a refund for paying the locksmith  We waited for almost   hours with   babies just for the host  to tell us he couldnt let us in  He promised a refund for the Saturday night but I asked about it He ignored my messages and this wont be the end of it  We also tried to get our clothes back that we left in the dryer  and he only responded back one time and after that we heard nothing back  I tried calling and no answer nor call back  So now we are also stuck with no refund or our clothes back  Get your stuff in order and more organized  Im sorry this had to go this route but I refuse to let it be unnoticed I think its horrible that we did not get a refund for paying the locksmith  We waited for almost   hours with   babies just for your company to tell us you couldnt let us in  You ignored my messages and this wont be the end of it  We also tried to get our clothes back and you only responded back one time and after that we heard nothing back  I tried calling and no answer nor call back  Get your stuff in order and more organized  Im sorry this had to go this route but I refuse to let it be unnoticed Got locked out room  was stuck outside for almost   hours with my wife and       year old then WE had to pay      to a locksman to break in the loft because the  handyman  the host sent had no idea how to get us in  And they refused to refund us or pay us back When we asked about our refund to pay us back to get inside theyre loft they did not respond back AT ALL and we forgot clothes in the dryer and tried to set something up to get them but they only responded once and after that would not respond anymore so we are stuck without those clothes
607419303,The stay was a slight mess with a late check in due to the cleaning crew getting to the apartment the same time we arrived  we actually helped the cleaning crew clean an hour after leaving to give them time to clean   the place had been smoked in by the guest prior to our stay  speaking to multiple ZenCity agents with little response using the AirBnB app  the WiFi was slow and information listed in regards to name of network were incorrect and the cleaning crew walking into the apartment while we were sleeping which was very alarming  The location was great for us and the actual property was clean  Everyone has off days and plans dont always go as planned so we tried to be understanding  The cleaning crew did have their work cut out for them and they apologized  The stay started off rough but while there the bed was comfy and the kitchen was great  The stay was a slight mess with a late check in due to the cleaning crew getting to the apartment the same time we arrived  we actually helped the cleaning crew clean an hour after leaving to give them time to clean   the place had been smoked in by the guest prior to our stay  speaking to multiple ZenCity agents with little response using the AirBnB app  the WiFi was slow and information listed in regards to name of network were incorrect and the cleaning crew walking into the apartment while we were sleeping which was very alarming  The location was great for us and the actual property was clean  Everyone has off days and plans dont always go as planned so we tried to be understanding  The cleaning crew did have their work cut out for them and they apologized  The stay started off rough but while there the bed was comfy and the kitchen was great 
342447167,Very clean apartment in neighborhood brimming with character  Rapid response time from host  Ran into a few major issues that were quickly resolved after communicating with the host  While we sincerely appreciated the overall cleanliness of the apartment and ease of check in  we feel negatively towards our experience because of the wrongful request of         post check out  Resolution was swift  but we will not be back  Great neighborhood and located next to promontory point  offering unparalleled views of the city and Lake Michigan  Approx     mins away  in car  from city center 
611321709,If you want to be harassed every time you walk into the building this is the place for you 
340687713,Clean and simple studio apartment for reasonable cost and in close proximity to University of Chicagos campus   I realize this is totally unforeseen  but the water throughout the apartment was not working in the morning which was bad timing since I needed to get ready for an interview later that morning and it didn u    t come back on before I checked out  
342356539,Good enough Hyde Park location  Very small unit  Walkable during daylight hours  Some funky body wash or something in the shower  Not at all clear if this was intentional or left from a previous guest  Didnt know there were   different buildings with the same street number  Key fob works for both buildings  Although there is a parking lot on site you cant park there  There were however a few undesirable looking people doing major automotive repairs in the lot  Nice enough neighborhood for Hyde Park 
599986191,alright place  slow responses
332608349,The location and proximity to UChicago is the best feature   The place was a bit smaller than anticipated  particularly the kitchen and living area  
479055850,I would recommend just dont forget your key cause your not gonna be helped out It was great other than the whole getting locked out and not being helped thing  I got locked out of the apartment at a little after    am in the morning  I had to call twice before I got in touch with someone and once I did she said that she would put it down as in emergency  Four hours later I still hadnt heard from them at all  Finally someone living in the apartment let me in and I was able to get back in my room but it was no help from them
329780280,If you are looking for a place with little character or a non lived in feeling then this place will be good  In trading charm for sterility  it could be a bit cleaner in some places   but generally it was fine  just not what I was looking for   In terms of cleanliness  I definitely was underwhelmed due to the shower and linen situation   I didnt feel terribly safe at night walking from parking lot back to the apartment  Also   definitely street parking is a problem 
456459231,if you want to go to an airbnb with an unresponsive host then this will be a perfect place  The heat was pumping on when it was    degrees out  We tried turning it off multiple times and contacting the host but never heard back  If someone contacts you about an issue please do your job and respond back in a prompt fashion  We had contacted multiple times about the heat not being able to turn off  I also had messaged about the sheets being dirty 
629060251,Great location with easy check in  Was a little dissapointed in overall appearance  Lots of marks on the walls throughout the whole unit and very large  old water damage above the bathroom door 
628922820,Good location Not a great space if youre not a fan of roaches Still waiting on a response for a refund  I had to leave after being there only a couple hours because there was a huge cockroach in the bathroom
545572806,The photographer should get an Academy Award for Photographers  We DO NOT recommend this place   Stayed in AirBNBs all over the world and NEVER been in anyplace so gross   Staircase is really dirty and the mold spores are palatable  Once in the apartment  the smell is ok  not great  but ok  The furnishings are very sparse  No dressers on which to put jewelry   change   you know  a spot to empty your pocket contents  Do not look under the sink cabinets   YIKES   They offered an insta pot water heater  a french press  and the remnants of a bag of coffee which we had no idea how long it had been in the cabinet and whose hands had been in the bag   it is flu season  ya know  No ice trays  but a     used bag of ice   again  flu season   They did bring a fresh bag of coffee and   ice trays on day   of our   day stay   No salt  pepper  sugar or sweetener  Two mirrors over the   bath sinks   be sure what you pack will look good  cause there is no chance to check before going out   unless you can get your reflection in the TV  Tub is a safety hazard   Big climb into the claw footed tub with nothing to hold onto   Take care not to trip on the too  long curtain  Also  be very careful about the coffee table   it is concave and will swallow  whatever you set on the edge   go for the center to be safe  Linens and towels were fine  mini toiletries ok  bed was good  location was great  communication was very good and they were very nice  Not much  zen  from Zencity  tho  My advice   keep looking  As you know  we were much less than impressed  You can read my review   Sorry   gotta be honest  For what it was  it was too expensive  I guess we paid for the location  but wed have rather stayed in a different neighborhood under better conditions 
348654242,                                                                                                                                                                                        
310474972,nice place perfect location   Chris nothing new to say  I am so sorry  wish you work the things i told you out  Anyway you where very cool as always thank you  limpieza  falta limpieza y detalles de los elementos de la casa
308032596,if u   fussy   this place is not   u   electricity very funky  that ac kitchen light and bedside light issue should have been fixed before u rented   kitchen cabinets outside and in need cleaning  no shades on windows means u wake up as soon as sun rises  no stores nearby so a nice touch would have been coffee available  water pressure terrible in bathroom and no hooks to hang clothes  bathtub narrow and curved  I fell the first time I used it  u need to put something down  I almost broke a bone  bathroom floor rug  could be cleaner  hallways smell awful    only bed is shown    
304465243,Place wasnt super clean  but location is great and check in was smooth 
303513121,Very nice place  Although be aware that there is only ONE small window a c unit placed in the living room  If you are planning on staying here in warmer months be prepared to sleep on the floor in the living room by the window unit just to stay SLIGHTLY cooler throughout the night as the bedroom is way too hot   Only one small window a  c unit in the living room  Bedroom was too hot  Both had to sleep on the floor in the living room and even then  still sweated   
710620726,NA Get better housekeeping Cracks in the walls  area rug was dirty  and shelves were not placed 
339453438,This is a nice place to rent if you are ok with bare basics  The neighborhood was safe  Downtown is one bus ride to and from so its easy to get around from this location  The host doesnt set up the apartment very nicely so be prepared to bring everything you need  The dishes were dirty and the toilet seat and kitchen counters needed to be wiped down  This space is REALLY tiny  Looks way bigger on the photos but its basically a room with a bed  a mini kitchen that is fully functional  and a bathroom  Its super cute though  The last air bnb I sated in had new toiletries and she stocked the fridge with some waters and juice  It would have been nice to have a note and a little more amenities especially for the price  Also was disappointed with the size of the place and the cleanliness   The pictures make the space look A LOT bigger than it actually is 
628349360,This guy accused me of all kinds of stuff that wasnt true tried to blame me for his broken window and accused me of absurd things then wanted to request more money from me    for the maid to have to wash a few dishes when I was rushed out with people knocking at the door at       I paid a cleaning fee once and would have cleaned the few dishes had I not been rushed out at           I dont know if hes just hurting for money or what his deal is but I was shocked and appalled
714710387,Feels more like a hospital setting   the space is extremely small
337530589,La unidad es muy comoda en muy buena ubicaci n   el lugar por fuera es un poco viejo pero muy c modo  lo  nico malo fue que al llegar al self check in a las   am nuestras llaves no estaban y al recibir el duplicado hab a gente en nuestra unidad tardaron   hora para darnos otra unidad  La unidad es muy buena  tiene todo lo que se necesita lo malo solo fue el error que cometieron al tener a otras personas en la unidad que nos correspond a y hacernos esperar a esas horas de la madrugada  sugiero un poco m s cuidado con las reservaciones  fuera de eso todo excelente   La TV nunca funciono  el internet si estuvo muy bien  igual como la comodidad y limpieza   Al llegar a las   am en el self check in no estaba la llave y cuando nos pasaron el duplicado hab a gente en nuestra unidad completamente desagradable esa noche  despu s de   hora nos ofrecieron otra unidad para pasar la noche  Tardaron   hora para resolvernos lo de la unidad que ya estaba ocupada por otras personas 
285431100,Pleasure visiting to Chicago nice apartment    Thank you for everything   It was a pleasure staying at your place         
284590070,The apartment is a house of cards  Items to look cool  but nothing readibly usable  The soulless apartment and careless reponses  appears to be a company that bought the building and made it as cheap as possible while trying to still mimic Airbnbs    u   cHouse of cards  A tv that wasnt even plugged in  just there to look like an apartment  Coffee bean to look cool but no way to make coffee  Apartment temperature kept getting wirelessly changed throughout the day after we kept trying to set it    It was    u   d   Completely careless aboit questions  Felt like they just wanted to get rid of you  One of many instances  i asked them about parking for the weekend and they answered as simple as there is hourly parking    Sent mr a message as soon as i left that i have    Soulless house of cards  A company that bought a building and tried to make as much as possible without doing a single thing  
283302904,It was a nice place just like the pictures I only wish it was bigger   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  size of home   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions 
643701772,Place is very modern and nice  pictures are accurate  my only issue was no hot water  the A C didnt blow as cold as Id like  and the bathroom hadnt been cleaned  if those things are corrected this place has great potential  Place is very modern and nice  pictures are accurate  my only issue was no hot water  the A C didnt blow as cold as Id like  and the bathroom hadnt been cleaned  if those things are corrected this place has great potential 
331432337,We enjoyed our overall stay  but a lack of kitchen amenities was very frustrating  for example  only a single wine glass  no spatula  no salt and pepper  and so forth   Nevertheless  the excellent location and beautiful nighttime view made up for these negative points  I would highly recommend this location for a short visit to Chicago  We enjoyed the stay overall  but the lack of kitchen amenities was frustrating  Nevertheless  the excellent location and beautiful nighttime view made up for these negative points   The kitchen amenities were minimal  only a single wine glass  no spatula  not salt and pepper  and so forth   
330577984,The place was clean although the neighborhood was a bit tougher than we would thought  Also a bit difficult to find but we were navigating at night  Very communicative host  though  Directions to check in were difficult to follow 
629115223,Unreliable WiFi   not the cleanest bathroom  Ok for the price  I had to wait in the lobby for    minutes because the previous renter had not returned their keys by   pm  Could not get ahold of host when I had no WiFi 
708541466,Our stay at Zencity was very short lived  Upon entering the apartment  the tables  toilets  walls and flooring were not clean  The whole place smelled horrible because the dishwasher was full of water and dishes  We had to leave right after when checked in related to the poor conditions  Although we did have great and expeditious responses from customer service  we still were not fully refunded what we originally paid  I would not consider renting from zencity in the future  I wanted to say thank for your quick response and customer service  but this apartment really needs some upkeep and deep cleaning performed before it is rented out again  I am also upset that I lost one night on my refund  But I was pleased with the quick responses from Marty   The photos made the place look clean and upscale  When in reality  it was the complete opposite   It was absolutely not worth the listed price 
244464967,Its was a cool place   u   cTv was broken  u   d 
722206578,Hopefully the cleanliness of he apartment was just an oversight and the cleaning lady forgot  I tried to communicate my issue with you all before leaving a review that might hurt your business  but I had no reply   Parking was uncovered and farther than parking on street in front  We had a snow days before my stay and my spot was not shoveled and very icy   wrote my complaints to host and never heard back a dirty apartment is worth   to me
719767361,The apartment was almost all clean   outside of the bathroom tub which was cleaned within    hours  and was nicely decorated  It was in a nice location  The issue is really with the customer service  A company hosts this Airbnb and so we expected to interact with customer service representatives who were efficient  professional  and pleasant  Unfortunately  we did not have that experience at all  We attempted to extend the Airbnb by   day  The day was available on Airbnb and we figured there would not be any issues in extending  We attempted to extend   days prior to our check out date and did not receive any correspondence from the company until the day we were supposed to check out  They called us in the afternoon and told us there were folks waiting outside to clean and asked us whether we were going to check out  I tried to explain that we had requested an extension  The representative said that despite that   business days had past  their team of representatives had failed to see the request  They also said that they saw it today and attempted to approve it but because they saw it after   am they could not approve it  They said  your only option is to pay an additional    for the remaining day  They did not express any empathy or understanding or acknowledge their negligence and lack of responsiveness  Eventually  the customer service representative became rude and quite patronizing over the phone  even trying to give me unsolicited advice about how I should go about things in the future  We decided to go ahead and leave    All things considered  could we have reminded the customer service representatives that there was an outstanding request  sure  But  thats not our job as a customer  I expect that the customer service and their team can manage their work without their customers needing to intervene  I was disappointed to see that for Zencity  that is not the case  Code to get in was complicated  long  and not correct  Took us about    minutes to be able to get in  Zencity waited two days to respond about the extension  Truly  they never did respond to the request  they just called to say that somebody was at the apartment to clean it  They never gave check out instructions and never replied to our extension request to deny or approve  It was very unclear what was happening  The customer service rep told me that nobody even looked at the request until the day we ended up having to leave  Neither of the two days that passed were holidays or weekends  Both were business days  Ultimately their negligence caused a lot of miscommunication  Their customer service over the phone was terrible  Condescending  patronizing  and unhelpful  They do not take responsibility for their actions  The apartment is great and the price is good  but the customer service experience is awful 
650186116,I recommend it Everything was nice except the shower that wasnt clean  Thanks
311173223,We moved out after night   of a planned   night stay due to cleanliness and maintenance issues  Situation made good by Airbnb after only a small refund offered by the host     Property was still being serviced when we arrived to check in
624742483,You need to buy a new couch   VERY uncomfortable to the point where you really cant even lay on it       I had to buy my own cushions with a board underneath to make it bearable   
618693237,Its a beautiful place  I just advise you to inspect carefully that its cleaned  I called a few times and was not able to get in contact with my host  It went to voicemail several times before reaching someone  It was pertinent to speak with someone because the door codes didnt not work upon arrival  Better cleaning      
713923430,Not the best communication from this management company  Cleanliness issues  Better to go with privately run airbnbs  We werent told that we would have to pay for parking Did not give us check in instructions the day before until I asked  Said we couldnt check in   hr early because someone booked it for one night last min so they had to clean but the board in the condo clearly states the last cleaning was a week before our arrival
475717858,Rooms were much more basic than expected especially considering the price   Carpet and couch were very musty looking  wood was scratched up throughout the place and basic things like side tables didnt exist  Overall was quite disappointed especially since its managed by a management company    Had an old and tired feel  Ended up moving my family out early  Rooms were much more basic than expected especially considering the price   Carpet and couch were very musty looking  wood was scratched up through the place and basic things like side tables didnt exist  Overall was quite disappointed especially since its managed by a management company  Super old and tired feel 
652317201,Nice location and very spacious  No complete privacy due to soft loft build  We enjoyed our stay for the most part  Not as clean as we wouldve liked  Entire place had an odor and so did the couch

344408147,There was a terrifying domestic disturbance in the apartment next door  The police came and diffused the situation but according to the other neighbor  this happens all the time  There was no WiFi and the  owner  of the Airbnb told us several times the WiFI was fixed when it wasnt  This is the problem with these Airbnbs that are one of many owned by the same company  The actual owner lives far away from the property and has several people who work for them  making it near impossible to get issues resolved  Thanks for nothing   Zen City   The host gave us inaccurate information over and over again

144817165,Centrally located  basic accommodation  The toilet runs a lot and the handle is about to fall off  The place had kind of a funky smell to it  Other than that   great location and really appreciated the easy check in    u   cLess well lit than I expected   living room was dark    hours a day  u   d   Seemed overpriced for what it was  We could have gotten a hotel in the area for less than we paid for the Air BnB 
714710499,Everything was great expect I found things in the house from the last person  and my car got broken into as well Car broken into
405687885,Beautiful view  love the minimalist home and the huge windows  What a beautiful place  Clean cozy cute homey place  The only think I didnt like about this is that they are very strict and do not allow late checkout which I think is an unreasonable expectation  Late check out  Being strict on check out time is unreasonable 
703021061,The place was great  I suggest bringing your own bed sheets and covers because they were stained but besides that the views were amazing  Make sure you figure out your own parking  I suggest getting Parking app its works for only  hrs at a time til  pm thats when parking is free  The bedding was stained and the place wasnt properly cleaned whoever Jasmin is she didnt clean well  The fans were dirty I felt a little uneasy because of it  Every thing was accurate ish I wish the zen city page would have made it clear that the balcony was shared by everyone but it u    s was okay  
621548115,Very clean home 
666423624,Its was pretty small but it was a decent stay  Thanks
97415912,I found the handoff didnt work  I was running as fast as I could to a work dinner and the key handoff didnt workout  the key wasnt there I had to reach out to the rental place   There was really no proactive engagement at all   Location was acceptable but I think overpriced   Communication is difficult   Shower photos would be a big improvement     As Chris knows  the handoff didnt workout  Many layers of communication w  different parties makes direct communication difficult   
77883367,The apartment was comfortable and in a great area  River North is a centrally located neighborhood   It had the necessary basics  it is not a primary residence home  Collin was easily contactable when the directions on Airbnb lead us to the incorrect address         
68373222,Collin was a terrific host  easy to communicate with and responded promptly to questions and requests  The apartment is pretty much as pictured but you do have to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom so is probably best suited for a couple or single person  Amazing location        
672646083,The apartment looks exactly like the pictures  The only cons was the odd smell in the basement living room that never went away and there are not curtains on the large windows which people can look in  The owner responds fast and gave us a extra key  There is parking best to find it in the morning  it was great space for the two of us
571832075,An odd place to stay  Felt very bare with not much on the walls and an odd style which seemed like they valued the look of he furniture vs  the actual comfort  Check was easy and no direct need to communicate with the host  Location has good access to the L  Random  but all the light switches and toilet were rather low to the ground  Just a note for taller individuals  Could have been better with more things on the walls  Felt very bare   Not sure what was up with this place  but everything was set up for a human of a smaller stature   Check in was easy and instructions were clear  Never communicated  But also didnt need to  Location was good  For the feel and dynamic of this place  I did not think this was a good value  Couch was terribly uncomfortable to sit on 
568563880,Advise not to park in the U  Car got broken into  Advise future costumers not to park in the U  Ask the front desk what the U is  Its about    ft from the residences  My car got broken into window shattered and belongings stolen while parked on the premises of the residence which is the U 
578436508,Nice place to stay at  Clean  Close location to everything   Visitor policy with additional fees needs to be in the description  Along with information that there is only Netflix tv access unless you have personal log in information to  listed  certain Roku tv apps  Heat is basically  one  setting only or doesn u    t work well  
520617078,Great location but nonstreet parking is at least   blocks away  AC is window units only  Loud window units  Shower and bathroom floor are a slip hazard  A great place for a family of three  young couple  or single adult less than     I dont know who the personnel serve in the lobby  but I do know it wasnt me  After the checkin experience  I felt very uncomfortable asking anything  The last question I asked was where the I could do my laundry  The person at the lobby desk was unresponsive first and inaccurately answered when I had to repeat the question  A resident nearby corrected her and helped me   Parking was four blocks away  Window AC had to be on entire stay to keep rooms comfortable  Personnel in lobby were not customer oriented and I felt as though I was doing them a favor by not asking a question  
710962860,This place was the worst AirBnB experience I have ever had  The people are not communicative and do not try to help  I highly recommend not renting from this company  Wifi bad  place unclean  tv broken  support unhelpful        Wifi horrible  appliances bad  can hear everyone outside and above you  Horrible took weeks to respond to emails and when talking over the phone people who said they would come out to fix an issue never did  The only good part of the listing Find another spot
556041791,We were pretty disappointed in limited ability to watch live TV  We were reduced to watching Sunday Night Football on our cell phones  even though it airs on NBC and should be easily available  The most frustrating part of that is that we subscribe to a streaming TV service and could easily have just added that app on the Roku and signed in to our own account  and of course log out   remove the app when done   but the the Roku has been locked down and requires a pin to add any new apps  Have stayed at multiple vaca rentals and have never come across this issue before  During the heating season  youd need some really great earplugs to be able to sleep through the tea kettle shrieking noise that the radiators create all night  Between that and the creaky  saggy mattress and the fact that it was hotter than hades  we fought for every minute of sleep that we got  The cost is reasonable  just not sure if its reasonable enough given some pretty big flaws  On the upside  the place is very nicely located in Hyde Park and very walkable to lots of great restaurants and the U of C campus   hospitals  Building seems pretty safe   secure  and check in was very easy  Was disappointed in limited ability to watch live TV  We were reduced to watching Sunday Night Football on our cell phones  even though it airs on NBC and should be easily available  During the heating season  youd need some really great earplugs to be able to sleep through the tea kettle shrieking noise that the radiators create all night  Between that and the creaky  saggy mattress  we fought for every minute of sleep that we got  The cost is reasonable  just not sure if its reasonable enough given some pretty big flaws  On the upside  the place is very nicely located in Hyde Park and very walkable to lots of great restaurants and the U of C campus   hospitals  Building seems pretty safe   secure  and check in was very easy 
517767840,The place was ok  it wasnt as updated as I would have liked but it was clean  enough space for everyone  a safe secure building  and the neighborhood was quiet and safe  I would book here again  The host was good with reaching out and sending emails to check on us  The place can be a bit more updated  The beds wear very uncomfortable 
709223829,Good location Details of how to get to the apt inside the building was very confusing Wasnt able to control temperature  no wine opener available  hot water ran out very quickly in shower  WiFi took a while to figure out
593690139,Honestly very disappointed  The space is as pictured and would make for a lovely stay if I didnt have to listen to the so sound of construction in be the building from early morning to late evening   I wouldnt be so upset if I had been told it was a possibility  but that didnt happen  Also instructions on finding the back units were all kinds of wrong  Wont be back  the space the hassel  I am very disappointed with this place  Sounds of construction every morning  construction materials everywhere  Not a pleasant experience at all  Directions for check in were incorrect 
591211251,Awesome unit with great amenities and location   The only warning I have if you stay is a business trip I would not recommend  the internet didnt work had to utilize my hot spot off my phone  You have a serious internet issue   Internet was non existing 
280621026,This apartment is located well within the small downtown of Hyde Park  There are a few cafes and restaurants close by with a Target around the corner for convenience    When my wife and I were first contacted by Chris we felt a bit misled since the apartment we stayed in is on the first floor  but this is not described anywhere  The only piece of info to indicate this is a photo of the balcony which seems to be more than a story up  but its in fact just a couple feet off the ground  As we are not very familiar with this city we would rather have been above the first floor  so this indication would be important for future guests   Within    minutes of arriving we heard noise on the room adjacent and one above us  I gave it some time  but then contacted Chris when nothing changed  He responded that he has never had problems with noise  and was regretful that we are experiencing it  Peace and quiet are extremely important to me  and I did not find that here  I understand that in the city youll hear people outside police cars  but there was little of that here  Constant banging from above and beside us  We could actually listen to conversations from people in both of these apartments  Ive honestly never been to an Air BnB  or even hotel rather  that has been this loud   Aside from those issues the apartment was very clean  All the appliances were working except for the water and ice dispenser on the fridge which isnt a huge deal  Plenty of hot water  and good water pressure from the shower  A small addition that l enjoyed was the automatic soap dispensers in the bathroom and kitchen    All in all the stay was okay  but the noise really ruined it for us  The only bright side is that it kept us out of the apartment most of the day night  and forced us to enjoy the sights of Chicago   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  listing description  size of home   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements 
671874978,Didnt recieve key fob so wasnt able to check out any amenities  Slow response from host
579371207,Zencity Corp was quick to respond to any issues  but each message was from a different person at the corporation and some messages werent transmitted through their management structure  When I checked in  the staff told me that when I checked out  I should leave the key on the table  I did this  and the next day woke up to an email that they were trying to charge me     dollars for not returning the key  Zencity Corp owns a lot of convenient airbnbs in the area  but I wouldnt stay with them again after this  Attempted to charge     dollars for me not returning the key  although I left it exactly where they asked me to 
658050724,This place was horrible  Its a crumby apartment  but what made it insufferable was that it was filled with a stench of cigarette smoke  We were forced to leave and contacted the host to receive a refund  but the host had still not responded  I am requesting that you immediately issue us a refund Refund requested but no response
279754433,This is a really nice apartment building with friendly concierge staff at the main entry  The location is amazing with a beautiful view and its easy to walk to the store or the train  The apartment was not clean when I arrived and there was no flexibility on an early check in  due to the apartment getting cleaned   Chris was responsive as far as my issues but I dont think Id stay here again due to the issues that I had and some never being fixed   The television services didnt work and after letting the host know repeatedly   the issue was never fixed  
506402720,Would not stay here again  sadly  Room was small if adequate  but halls and common spaces were dingy  hot  and smelly  Put simply  This feels like a former dorm because it is  Details like pungent and persistent cleaning products  cheap pillows  and loud appliances made the place more photogenic than it was comfortable  That and a string of errors  Key not there upon arrival  misdirected maintenance visit  and internet down after first day  Zencity team was very responsive and polite  but this place is not ready for prime time  and certainly not worth the high price relative to location   This is my first negative Airbnb review  apologies   Please do not use existing cleaning product  It reeks of cheap chemicals  forced me to vacate room for long stretches  and never went away over the course of entire visit  and Im not particularly sensitive to smell     Also note that fridge  even when unused and seemingly on a low setting  roars idly  both unpleasantly noisy and energy inefficient    Last  pillows are about the cheapest you can find  Lumpy  synthetic  insubstantial   Sorry to sound negative  I travel a ton  and use Airbnb constantly  but this is my first non five star review   Common areas not well represented  Key not available upon arrival Too pricey given quality  location
460636760,A  I couldn u    t find the lockbox I had to wait outside for an hour  I think I shouldnt have to pay a cleaning fee if I have to go in cleaning thing like the bathroom and other spaces
503591948,After I could not get a key out of the automatic lock box at the property  I was without a place to sleep for almost    hours overnight  The property Managers access code for their lock box was incorrect on the initial email and the subsequent code sent failed to open the key repository     After numerous phone calls to an answering service and only a single message sent by the Airbnb app  I was finally granted a refund from Airbnb  The number supplied to Airbnb and on their website does not go to any actual employee of the company but a answering service    The property Management company of these apartments is disconnected from the St Louis area  after having stayed in a property in the same facility that you manage I was looking forward to staying here again  Your communication and technical facilities are lacking   The messages from the host did not help in this situation   When finally contacted about the key box not being accessible and me being locked out for the first day of my trip  a non apology was sent   They stated as if the lock box   seemed   not to work   The property Managers failed to ensure I could enter the property  I had only   hours sleep in a terrible motel before heading to work  The property Manager only responded once during my support request overnight  After the information they gave me was ineffective  they didnt respond again until almost   hours later  Their support line after      p m  is a message taking service  nothing more  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me 
503259970,Great view  but not very comfortable for the price  Great location  decent space  but compares poorly to a hotel room in terms of amenities for the price   We didnt reach out while there because we were simply too busy   Should mention that there is no dresser  one poor futon in LR  one dining room chair for the LR  one lightbulb in LR  no instructions for TV and trash  no recycling container  Two teaspoons in service for eight  no bathmat for slippery bathtub  etc   No info booklet
609259613,If you are going to stay here  know that there are lots of dogs  some of which howl very loudly   and parking is very scarce       min walk   But the view was amazing  bed and couch were very cozy  but we did find a few crumbs on the living room carpet   WiFi password was incorrect  and parking was unclear  Dogs are very allowed AND loud in the building  Less noise  Cleanliness  closer parking
573248366,Nice place     only complaint is it is still under construction and the noise starts early Let guests know they will be encountering construction noise early in the morning   Still a construction site     work on all sides of the place started before   
622466879,awesome check in  nice entertainment provided  some pics can be misleading for studio   bedrooms but overall i would continue to book here photos were misleading   listed as   bedroom and not a studio  Barely any kitchen accessories  no kitchen vent when cooking  boxed in environment  Check in is never an issue with zencity  ive been successful with you all before this is just a misleading listing so my expectations were set high due to the previous stay i had before this one 
492789098,For the money this place was appointed with the bare minimums      the description says the bed was a queen  pretty sure it was a full  regardless it was not comfortable    The blinds were all bent and since the place it literally one one room it did not provide much privacy from the pool courtyard and sunlight poured in in the morning    There was only a French press for coffee  and no one told us to bring our own coffee    I have stayed in several Airbnbs and that seems like a standard  along with maybe some bottled water   There was none of either    There was loud banging in the rooms near us until about   pm   There were no instructions on using the TV and Direct TV   And their  Welcome Kit  they said we would receive on check in was literally a broken cardboard  box with a key in it    Also plan on paying additional for parking   We used Spot Hero App and the parking structure attached cost us     a night    Also would have been nice had they explained that there was a parking structure attached  had to figure all that out on our own  even after asking about parking  Oh and the elevators made terrible shaking and grinding noises    Honestly I wouldnt stay here again  We were pretty disappointed with the space    While it was clean  the bed was I believe a full  not a queen  very uncomfortable    No coffee  bare minimum appointments    Blinds in windows are broken and bent not keeping our morning light or providing privacy from pool  courtyard in the room   Don u    t think it was a queen  pretty sure it was a full   No extras at all     bare minimum for experience  not even a coffee maker  French press but no one told us to bring our own coffee   loud banging all night in room  bent broken blinds that did not keep light out 
631169213,Photos are accurate  I hope your stay is better than mine was  Missing key  Cheaper
616799829,Overall  the experience was just okay  After we arrived  we were welcomed by the maid telling us that she had just gotten there and needed time to clean the place  We arrived a few minutes after the said check in time  so we were not early  This essentially messed up all plans  as we were only visiting for a few days and had a tight itinerary  We were then told that there is a fob to get in out of the parking lot  This was one of the main reasons we chose this place  as the location was right around an unsettling area  We were told the guests before us took the fob home  and that they would get us a new one  We never got one  or word that they were working on it  Finally  when we got to the room the second time  we were immediately sweating  as the thermostat was  locked at    degrees  The thermostat and temperature was an issue the entire stay  Would not come back again  or recommend this stay  Dont say that check in is at  pm if the room will not be ready  cleaned  and available at  pm  Wasnt allowed to check in when it says  never got our parking fob  etc 
555441561,We booked this condo based on the location and the photos   It was very run down  with mold in several places   We had to purchase cheap sandals to wear in the bathroom   Would not stay here again   The photos make the condo look very nice  it is not  
660638539,No one deserves to get money robed from them  If you agree dont book with zencity  They are thieves  This small unit is next to a unit occupied by a full time tenant of the building  If you lucky enough you will hear punk rock  screamo  and tribal music blaring all night with one one to turn to help for but knocking on a stranger door who gets in fights with his party guest alot   lol  People coming and going all night  dogs barking  horns honking  Drag racing and cruising on the street out the bedroom window   Not safe cops always rolling around  Save yourself days of trouble trying to get a refund  This is not a pretty looking part of downtown  smoke stacks right out front billowing smelly fumes all day and night  The hosting company does not respond personally everything is automated by a  rd party add on service  You will not experience that if you stay with a real human in a real house with a real host  You are booking a motel  I brought it to their attention that the listing was      misleading the guy confirmed I was at the right address and right unit  He told me there was no where to transfer me then hung up and blocked my number I wasnt on the phone for more than   seconds before he hung up  The photos are  brightened with photoshop  There was rotten take out food in the refrigerator with a receipt dated             I booked           The towels are stiff and old  Calling the number listed again the next day because Airbnb told me to reach out one more time  He said if I called again he would take my security deposit wow  Please do not stay with this  company  not even if your desperate
458949544,Perfect location  smaller than expected  much too expensive for what you get  We paid over      for   nights on a space that is now listed at     night  Dusty everywhere  bathroom was moldy and extremely small  The AC unit does not cool the whole place and you cant have the AC on and watch tv at the same time  The host was quick to respond that was cool  and Hyde Park is so beautiful with so much fun stuff to do 
711896229,This was a very nice place in a great location  I really dont like to give negative reviews so Ill put this info in a private note  Certain items really need attention  The kitchen and baths were not cleaned thoroughly and that was especially a concern because of Covid      The tub needed a better cleaner product  The toilet was dirty inside  Given that the place looked recently renovated I would not have expected the tub to look like there was old residue  We had to wipe down all the surfaces in the kitchen and baths  The microwave was also dirty inside  The kitchen trash can was soiled and there was no trash liners  The cleaning service came back the next day and serviced the property  I really appreciated that since it was thanksgiving   I could tell that the floors were not properly cleaned because there was debris in the corners in the bedroom and kitchen area  This is a very nice place but needs a bit more attention to detail related to cleaning  There did not seem to be enhanced cleaning protocols  The door locks were being changed when we arrived  We had to wait a bit before entering Long wait times on hold when we called about gaining access This was a very nice place  recently renovated  and the location was great  Our biggest concern was the cleanliness
470897825,This place is just ok   it was much older and in worse shape than the photographs showed  Bathroom was very dark   The doorman at the key pick up place was somewhat unhelpful and made me feel like  it was inconvenient that I was there  Also said I should have printed out the confirmation of reservation  not just have it on my phone  well it was in Hyde Park     its not an area you feel safe going back to when it gets dark  bed was terrible  Pillows were thin and old  Place just smelled old and a bit damp   Window air conditioning was not really adequate to cool space 
623540729,Clean place in a nice area  There is a rodent behind the fridge that comes out 
635434920,The floors are disgusting  you can tell they didnt Mop or sweep before us   There was bugs everywhere  the ac barley worked  PLENTY of things were broken like no doorknobs   shower was messed up  the doors barley closed   Nothings was wiped down  This place has a lot of potential with the area it is sadly its not taken care of

587885468,I think this apartment would be best for business travelers   Not ideal for holiday travel or light sleepers  Hi Zencity There are a few things that lead me to believe the apartment wasnt quite user ready      the address was not correct   I arrived very late after dark so this gave me a bit of anxiety when checking in      it was very very cold in the apartment and it took quite a while for the temperature to rise   the hot water runs out VERY QUICKLY   My boyfriend took a very quick shower and i was not able to finish my shower afterwards before the hot water ran out      I arrived very late and so went to bed with intentions of sleeping in   Please note this trip was for personal vacation holiday travel   Because of the construction in the building  the fire alarm in the complex went off around      am   It was VERY cold outside and I had to sit in the car until about      when the fire department was able to turn off the alarms    very loud construction noise continued the first morning until around   am   For a business trip this would have been fine but I was very unhappy about the noise because my plan was to have a relaxed vacation with lots of sleep    some how water is escaping the shower stall and runs all over the bathroom floor   I have a photo of where the water seems to be coming from   Thursday morning there were construction workers doing electrical work in a closet just across the hall from the apartment door   The actual work did not create much noise at all BUT They had a boombox radio on very loud   That is very inconsiderate     constantly finding hair on the floors and couch was very unpleasant      I kept my gym clothes on the floor in the closet   When retreating them I found layers of saw dust all over my clothes because the baseboards had never been wiped off from the renovations     I really didnt like that the apartment unit door does not meet the floor   There is a pretty wide space at least an inch between the floor and the door for cold air  noise  and if any pests or rodents are in the building they now have easy access to your apartment     Lastly   I would have liked to know in advance that this until was in the basement of the complex and also a corner garden until where all the windows are facing high foot traffic areas  It could be a nice   star rental but these details prevented me from having a seamless  relaxing stay   More than happy to discuss if you have any other questions   Confirmation said address was        Actual address is        There is no      on Dolman   Also would prefer to know in advance that unit was a basement unit where all windows faced high foot traffic areas  
719158773,The value for this location was awesome  The communication was pretty bad  Check in instructions came later than check in and the number to call was unresponsive most of the time  They should fire the cleaning company as there was dirt and food from the previous guests  and we had to clean more before we were able to get comfortable 
246882693,The place was not clean  very dusty floor  on the day of my arrival   the host had it cleaned the next day on my request   I was not given a key needed for entering the gym   pool and my request for the key was ignored    I was asked to lie to the neighbors   management that Im a certain local corporate guest  not an Airbnb guest    Check in was not convenient  Nobody was at the property to hand me the key   I was asked to go somewhere to find it  This can be very bad if you are arriving at night   hauling a luggage    If you dont care about these issues  it is a very nice property in great location   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable 
246890119,My trip started well yet ended unpleasantly  Chris is responsive via email  The unit gets good natural light and the minimalist decor is nice  But when I got locked out of the unit  he was no help  I asked him to provide a number to maintenance and he didnt  Luckily someone saw me helpless and standing in the hallway for over an hour and told me whom to call  The building maintenance staff had to drill and remove the lock  but they finally let me in  I was locked out for over two hours  I prefer to leave more positive reviews  but I want to be honest and help others so that you dont have my same experience  I feel that leaving this negative review may result in my receiving a negative review from the host  But I am ok with this because my review may help other potential guests  I prefer to be honest and transparent  The much longer version is below  The positives  The unit has so much natural light  The unit is a corner unit so there are lots of windows  The units minimalist decor is nice too  Chris was responsive via email  When I told him about a mildew like odor in the unit  he sent three people to check on the odor  However  none of them were able to fix it  The area rug in the bedroom reeked of the mildew smell  so I folded it and placed it in the closet  I decided to check out early because the odor was too strong  Even one of his staff confirmed the foul odor  Chris let me me check out after    am  which I appreciated  When I told him that I wanted a refund for the remaining nights  he messaged me   I am happy to refund you the remaining portion of your stay  however  I ask that you leave a positive review  I have hosted many guests here and have not had an odor issue before  If that is acceptable to you  I will have Airbnb cancel the remaining portion of your stay and issue the refund   I found this odd because reviews should be honest  And I responded that I would leave an honest review  I previously emailed Chris that the key to the unit wasnt working properly to unlock the deadbolt  And guess what  I ended up getting locked out of the unit right before I checked out  In desperation  I emailed him repeatedly and asked for a number to his staff or maintenance  He would not provide any phone number and his response was to jimmy the lock  Chris did not offer any support beyond jimmying and playing with the lock  After finally finding a phone number to the building manager  two maintenance staff drilled and removed the lock from the door  Luckily  this happened during the daytime  What if this happened at night  I mightve been stranded  Chris never emailed to see if I got in  I do not see myself renting    Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  Additional comments   host emailed me but did not help when I was locked out      my experience was not good    
246492116,I booked Chris place to stay at for a very short trip to Chicago to look for a place to live as I am moving for a new job  Check in was very easy and the place was clean and as pictured  We arrived quite late and went to bed  The next day we awoke to find no hot water in the shower  it was   deg outside  but hot water in the sink   Myself and traveling companion could not shower  thankfully we were just going to look at condos  I notified Chris who said maintenance would come to investigate   He did check in with me in the afternoon to ask if the situation had been remedied  but we had not returned to the apartment to be able to verify this  We were gone from the apt from    am  midnight  When we returned  we still no hot water at all  sink or shower now  at this time and I notified Chris about this   We were still unable to shower so again had to meet with our real estate agent unshowered   still    deg outside     I did not hear from him until we were ready to check out  when he did allow us to leave our luggage for   hours  free of charge     While Chris reacting to our issue calling maintenance  the problem was not fixed and his communication of was a bit delayed on this  He was regretful for the issue  but did not offer any partial refund or to stay in another of his apartments in the complex which we not rented  as we could see in this on Airbnb   He also then said we scratched very inexpensive plastic chairs in his apartment  which we didnt even use while there and charged us for these  which was an insult after not being able to shower for   days      I know mechanical things happen and they are out of control the property owner  he dealt with our issue initially in an appropriate manner but the end result was unsatisfactory  Thankfully this trip as not for a job interview or an important even where being unshowered x  days would have been less an appropriate     I also am aware that people all over the world take cold showers  but I have a medical condition where I should not get cold and it was only    degrees wind chill in Chicago at the time    u   cNot really vintage u   d 
197992207,Clean apartment that looks just like the pictures  Communication with Chris before during my stay was great  However  the apartment is located right next to a train station and nine commuter train tracks  so even with the windows closed  you will hear the constant sound of trains  bells  and horns starting early in the morning  Hey Chris  Great apartment except the sound of trains is a major issue  I would not have stayed there had I known how loud they would have been in the apartment   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  Additional comments   u   cChris fails to mention the constant sound of trains in his posting  u   d    The apartment is right next to the train station and   commuter train tracks  
715918707,Great place and location  Best value for the location    Pictures are a true reflection on space  Lovely place and location  just needs deep cleaning on areas that are easily overlooked like behind doors and behind bathroom sinks  Host never attendent to my concerns however host was great at emailing back   But not correcting issues brought up 
581666437,The location was great  I would recommend this Airbnb if you are looking for a long or short stay  Thank you for hosting us  The location is great and the apartment was decorated well  Since I stayed for a week and Had to use public laundromat since the washer didnt work  Everything else was pretty good  Washer didn u    t work  I notified them and they were quick to respond back  Everything else was pretty good 
238450899,nice freshly repainted airbnb appartment  perfect location when visiting students at UChicago  downtown Hyde park  good size  BUT The third guest  who pays  sleeps on a sofa  NOT a sofabed   the mattress is very uncomfortable  and there are no linens or towels for this guest  when I asked  linens and towels were delivered the next day only  at  pm  Kind of too late  Too bad  because the location is great   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  Additional comments   u   cthe sofa bed could not be unfolded  the mattress was really bad  and there was no linen or towel for the person sleeping on the sofa for   h u   d  
626530179,I love It here I always stay here  great location and cool amenities  Thanks I always enjoy my stay  there was a few things that arent usually an issue  The bed linen was full of hair and makeup  the toilet rim could have been cleaned better as well  and there was a comforter outside the front door from my arrival until I left  It just seems as it was a rush cleaning job  Thanks Just make sure linens are cleaned properly and things are not left out of place 
522170953,A few Pros and Cons  PROS  Amazing location     minute walk to cute restaurants and bars  cute apartment  super comfortable bed  quick responses from Zencity  apartment lobby staff were so nice and helpful    CONS  Shower was dirty and didnt drain  Had long black hairs on the shower wall and tub floor  Stood in   inches of water while I showered  When I brought it up to Zencity they said  thanks for your feedback  well inform the cleaning service  and never apologized   Parking was not ideal and was not described accurately in the listing  The listing states  no on site parking   What it doesnt list is that your options are street parking or garage parking  Street parking is impossible to find and is not always free  We NEVER found street parking  Garage parking is     per night  So  be prepared to pay for your parking  Guests should know this before booking  and it was pretty deceiving on the listing  When I brought this up to Zencity  they said that they do state  free parking is available off site  but they will work on making it more clear in the listing   Know that finding free parking is about like finding a winning lottery ticket  so  although it may be  available   you probably wont find it   OVERALL  Parking and shower aside  we really did love our stay  The location is top notch and the apartment was really nice  However  Im not sure wed stay here again   Apartment and location was exactly as described  but the parking situation is extremely deceiving and is not described well at all  It simply says   no on site parking    But what this means is you either have to find street parking  which is very difficult and isnt always free  or park in a nearby garage  which will cost you     per night  They should prepare their guests for this expense  and they do not   Communication was good and fast  just not very apologetic when problems were brought up  Parking
512836952,Good location  but wasnt clean and didnt have a deck as mentioned   just an unsafe  unfinished tar roof with no furniture   There was no deck  This is my biggest problem  because its the reason I booked this apartment  There was an unsafe fire escape and an unsafe  unfinished rooftop covered in tar with no railings  There was no deck  and again both locations were very unsafe and were not usable   Truth about the listing  deck  and clean 
508959172,I have never had a poor experience with Airbnb but I was less than thrilled with this property  even as a place to stay and sleep  less than   hrs while driving through  Upon arriving around   p the place was      the window air conditioner was off  and I was greeted by a cockroach the size of my hand in the bathroom  The bedroom door was broken off the hinges  unable to close and the bedroom fan had a very thick layer of dust on it so I could not turn it on   On the surface the place looked decent enough but it was very grimey on baseboards  visibly under bathroom tub  bathroom window ledge moldy and crumbling  The couch was also broken and very uncomfortable   If this was what I was expecting and priced much lower  no more than     it would have been fine but I was upset by the misrepresentation through pictures and for the cost I could have just stayed in a hotel off the highway which I did the night before and was much more comfortable  The check in was easy and the location   availability of street parking was great but the property mgmt  should be doing a much better job maintaining the property  We were not thrilled with things being broken and extremely dirty   especially bedroom fan  You are overcharging and misrepresenting your rental for what it is  Would not stay at or recommend your properties   The place is depicted as clean and minimalist  minimalist it is  clean or comfortable it was not  Surface level it looked OK but felt very grimey  Bedroom door also broken off hinges  unable to close  Couch was broken  caving in  very uncomfortable   I would have felt OK staying here if it was no more than      I could have stayed in a clean hotel for the cost of this place and recommended that fir others 
502490967,The Bed was comfortable and the location is nice  but the dishwasher didnt work  the Electric water boiler didnt work  and the Extra linens were dirty  There also wasnt enough dishware for four people  For the price  we expected these amenities to be available  For      a night the dishwasher should work  the hot water boiler should work  and the extra linen should be clean

573624066,Alright if you want a clean and comfortable place for a night or two  The faucet in the bathroom washbasin leaks even after both taps are fully shut  There is a bad tobacco odor in the place coming from the vents or the cabinets in the kitchen  Also sounds from the other parts of th building are heard particularly loudly and are disturbing  Otherwise the place is good  clean  peaceful and the communication was easy  reliable and quick  A bit complicated   involves picking up a key at one place and then walking elsewhere to use it  Not an ideal procedure to follow in the cold  after dark There should be pictures of the outdoor too on the AirBnB app so that we get a better idea of the neighborhood  It was quite deserted and spooky  Easier check in  no tobacco odor in the room

573591562,This apartment was in a great location for my trip to the University of Chicago and close to some cute restaurants in Hyde Park  Its in an older building that is nicely updated  but there were some minor maintenance quirks in the apartment itself  The pictures reflect the space accurately  except that there isnt great lighting in the apartment  and since its getting dark at       it was pretty dark most of the time I was there  This place had all my basic needs covered for my stay  but didnt feel especially cozy  Hi there  The apartment was convenient and nice but I rated it three stars because I found it a bit depressing with the low light and sparse furniture  Some better lighting would go a long way 
626439223,The  host  that message you  dont speak proper english  It smells like weed everywhere  Too loud at night because of people throwing parties  The  step by step  instructions were shit  I even messaged you guys for help  because what I was told was incorrect  Then whomever responded back to me  said that it was my fault  You guys need to learn proper english  A few minute drive to downtown  that was nice and handy 
702339977,It is a very nice space and felt safe in the building  Yet  the listing shows   bedrooms and I was only able to use    There is mold all in the closet in one of the bedrooms  and you can feel a difference in the air quality  I ended up sharing a bed with my other traveler  If the mold issue is taken care of  I would give   stars all around  There is mold in the bedroom   Was only able to use   instead of   bedrooms from the mold  
215597328,Many of the previous reports are correct but some points  this is a business with rental apartments and not a real Airbnb     No books of instructions so I couldnt work TV   and when I informed Chris he just said sorry   didnt bring it    You are actually facing multiple train rails  loudy    Close neighborhood not interesting nor feels good to walk around    Kitchen dirty with no essentials   salt  knife   Overall disappointing  I am sure Airbnb didnt mean for this impersonal attitude It was very insulting for you not to react to the fact that I had no explanation book   no way to work tv You were notified   but did nothing about it  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  amenities  Additional comments   u   cNo real working tv nor video  u   d   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements  host unreachable  Additional comments   The doorman didnt find right key    A bit off center   feels like your sitting over train station  
672965074,DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY   I hope this review will save EVERYONE from ever having to deal with what we endured on what was supposed to be a fun family getaway  I have NEVER taken the time to write a review  but this experience was so unbelievably awful  that I wont waste the opportunity to help warn others about this terrible company    We purchased a unit that specifically  listed it had   queen beds to accommodate our family  Zen City posted a listing for a unit with exactly that in an area that was relatively close to the things we wanted to see and do in downtown St Louis  so we purchased the unit   As soon as we get to the unit  we knew something was wrong  The first thing we noticed was that the place was absolutely filthy  Hair and dirt EVERYWHERE  So what does that hefty  cleaning fee  they charge go towards I wonder  Certainly not CLEANING THE UNIT   So  right off the bat  that was disgusting    Next thing we noticed was that we didnt have the   queen beds we were supposed to have  We got in late  but we contacted the host right away to tell them these things  They ended up trying to go into the listing and CHANGING THE LISTING  to the unit they had put us in  Luckily  we still had pictures of the original listing we purchased and our confirmation email showing everything we were supposed to have    This company repeatedly try to put the blame on us saying several times  Oh  I see how you could have been confused  and  Sorry  you must have overlooked and bought a different listing   after we kept providing proof of what we originally purchased   As you may have already guessed  this host refused make the situation right  hung up on us  and told us to go through AirBnB  So  we did  AirBnB immediately saw right through this deceitful company  They saw that they tried to update the listing AFTER we initially contacted them  as well as the lies they told through the messenger  We ended up receiving a FULL REFUND  and immediately got our belongings out of that nasty dump and went to a nearby hotel  where we were able to salvage the rest of our trip    Of course  this company will do anything other than accept responsibility and be accountable for their deceitful actions  so Im sure we received a delusional review in response to this one  reminds me of a    year old child throwing a tantrum screaming  I know you are  but what am I       However  if this review can save ANYONE from having to deal with this God awful company  then taking the time to write this review will have been well worth it   DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST    Please stop messaging us through AirBnB messenger  You act like a little twelve year old who is so insecure that they feel like they have to have the last word  You lied  You got caught  Be an adult and own it   This host deceivingly posted pictures of a different unit with different accommodations  only to get caught and try to deny it  AirBnB saw right through their lies and issued us a full refund  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST   We were given a completely different unit than we purchased  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  They do nothing but lie  even when they are caught red handed  Thankfully  AirBnB saw right through them and issued us a full refund  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  Regardless of where the location is  this company is ran by horrible human beings  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  After getting a FULL REFUND from AirBnB due to the outright lying and deception of Zen City  we found much better value at a hotel nearby that didnt have hair and dirt al over the floor  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST 
210470491,Chriss place is a mixed bag  Some things are great   the fresh linen and comfy bed and the natural light but other things are a little lackluster   The noise from other rooms and the greasy crockery  If youre a tea drinker  you wont love it here  Theres no kettle  and milk is a few blocks away  Best suited to coffee drinkers and people on a budget  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  wifi  
585374831,Nice place   a bit spartan  very clean  great kitchen  but heating issues and communication issues  For some reason  the text messages sent by Zencity were arriving in partial form   At the beginning  for check in   there was e mail backup for the missing messages  so it wasnt a major issue   However  when we arrived on a fairly warm day  the temperature in the apartment was    degrees   We looked for instructions on how to adjust the heating  couldnt find them  turned the thermostat up to    but there was no change in temperature   The next morning  the outdoor temperature had started to drop and the interior temperature was    degrees   I asked for guidance from Zencity by both SMS and e mail   I provided an alternate  U S   phone for messages and also an alternate e mail address   I received no communication to either  of these options   On Monday at      PM a partial message arrived on my Mexican phone from Zencity    Hi Colleen   Sorry to hear it may be a      Then  at      PM   Zencity   Hi  Colleen  Just checking in   were you      I replied to the partial message at      PM    Yes trying to get in touch about the heating   Its down to    degrees   Please help   Urgent   Thanks   E mail  please   Anyway  the issue was never resolved and we spent some chilly days and nights there  Working heat that guests can adjust 
585158276,The worst place to stay ever  when I read the reviews for this place I was comfortable but then when I got there I was shocked  The host wasnt helpful when you ask about places around the apartment  The apartment was super small and different from the pictures that were provided  The most problem that I faced is I cant adjust the AC temp  It was extremely hot and when I talked to the host he said just open the windows and itll be fine  Also  he lied to me by saying you can adjust that and it took him two days to say that theres no way to completely to turn on the A C control since its building controlled Even if you open the window theres a lot of noise from the train and the cars outside  Theres no parking spot close to the apartment  The elevator smells like Marijuana everyday  I was uncomfortable the entire trip  Gives a wrong information
583332284,Overall  the host was very responsive in a timely manner  The location is not ideal  despite it being    minutes  by transit  from downtown  There is also the loud sound of the subway passing by every     minutes which gets really annoying at night time  The heat in the unit was wishy washy  sometimes it would get too hot and other times  it was freezing  its also locked to a range so you can only change it so much   The host entered the apartment  while we werent there  without informing us which wasnt appreciated either  The neighbourhood was quiet but it felt a little too quiet  In general  would suggest to look for a unit closer to downtown  Please communicate clearly to guests when you will be entering and leaving apartment for our safety and security  Please be prepared for guests  ie  laundry  as I did ask prior to the trip  No Location
428066867,Decent stay Other than paying for the batteries  the bed and the dirty tub  we had a nice stay  Host said they would respond and help me with issues  Host never responded to issues until after I checked out  Host did not communicate to my concerns until after I checked out For so much money per night we were given a broken bed frame  a dirty tub  and had to go spend our own money on batteries for the TV
401057031,The best part about this unit is the location   You can easily walk to shopping  restaurants  and markets   The linens and towels were clean and the bed was comfortable   Unfortunately  this unit is more worn down that the pictures imply   Also  the unit is hot and stuffy even with valves closed and the window open   If we took longer than a   minute shower  there was standing water in the tub   The heater in the bathroom makes the space awkward and you have to be careful getting out of the tub so you dont burn yourself on the heater  if its on    One last issue is that the Netfix would start to load but get stuck  for several hours  at     
565709605,The place was clean and the host was communicative  However  the apartment has a VERY strong scent and it caused me to get a headache  The apartment is also much smaller than it looks in photos  The toilet didnt work very well  Also theres no color anywhere in the apartment  its completely black and white  After the sun went down it sort of felt like a prison  Not a homey environment at all  The smell was very off putting  It smelled so strong that it caused a headache  We had to put the scent sticks outside the room during our stay  Also  a bit of color would have been nice  the entire place is black and white and it felt kind of like a prison   Much smaller than the photos made it seem  
429040485,The apartment building is beautiful and the rooms are cute  So close to many shops and eateries  Great if youre a foodie like we are  The architecture is so unique as well  the elevator especially very old fashioned with sliding gate to close   You do hear slamming doors people in halls and the light from the hall under your door all night but otherwise great for budget travelers     Our apartment wasnt cleaned properly and reaching out to Zencity was pointless because  they werent management     Maybe other rooms were better  ours wasnt  The whole time we were there the light didnt work for the main room  This building was beautiful but cleanness was that to be desired  Sending photos and saying how paying extra for the cleaning charge when it was not is not right  I just got automated responses from you as well as one that said you cant do anything because youre not management of the building     Not even trying to make things right for us  Our light in the apartment also didnt work and we didnt even bother mentioning it to you because you didnt care about our other concern  I really think its funny you ask for a   star rating when you definately  did not even give any courtesy of a   star treatment  They didnt help when inquiring about dirtiness of the room  Just sent an automated message ignoring the issue  The price is great for being in an area so close to many restaurants  parks and shops   Its a very unique old building  nice architecture 
562999205,Great location  clean  comfortable   Wifi did not work properly even after attempting to reset  Was very frustrating to not have wifi for   days while staying there     Key pad to access the room key did not work properly  Had to wait an hour to get in contact with someone    who only called me after I reached out separately to Air BnB since the direct phone to Zencity did not work  Hard to get in contact via phone initially  Though did later respond to messages  
721091014,As a fair warning  just look elsewhere  My rental unit was not adequately prepared though my reservation was made well in advance  The bed sheets and pillow cases were lined with all sorts of hair   short and long  I literally bought sheets to change those with because it was very unhygienic  Additionally  the bathroom has hairs  of various contributors  posted all over the walls as if it hadnt been cleaned in weeks  My biggest issue is that the listing and check in clearly states access to a key fob for use of the multiple entrances of the building  Upon checking in  this wasnt available  When I asked when it would be I was told  maybe tomorrow    This was a very unprofessional response  I never got a key fob and had to resort to screaming the building access code outside the single intercom access door in the middle of Chicago when it was    degrees outside  When I brought these issues up to Zencity and asked for financial compensation  it was blatantly ignored by their support staff  Stay else where if you value amenities like cleanliness and a functioning key  I would suggest really focusing on cleanliness and accuracy of your check in instructions  Also  ZC support representatives could be better versed in dealing with these types of issues because the support was not beneficial at all  Also make sure youre providing whats listed in your listings   I e  a key fob  I booked a unit that was to be clean and provided a key fob   I did not have this in my experience   I was provided no key fob for getting into the building though clearly listed in the listing itself and check in instructions  I wouldve much rather stayed else where  Zen city lacks the ability to effectively facilitate their own guests  Will make sure to not stay with Zen City in the future and warn other renters 
624084536,Not what I expected
620546676,Very cute and cozy  The bed was so so comfy  The only issue was there was a really bad smell coming from the kitchen  I think it was the disposal  and I had to message host three times about it with little response  Trying to find the dumpster for garbage was a little difficult as well  But theres a Whole Foods right outside the building which was super convenient  I think I would stay here again
671620427,There was a dog barking a few doors down that kept me up  as well as the marijuana smell in the hallway  Furniture was not secured at all 
334963472,Room was very clean and well put together  There was no AC unit  room was very warm our whole stay  Even after asking how to control the AC we were told the unit was taken out because of the weather changing but it was    degrees outside  The room smelled like gas from the stove even when turned off  Checking in was quite confusing trying to navigate through the building  Parking was a bit stressful  Very nice room  but a very poorly ran establishment   Wasn u    t told there wouldn u    t be air conditioning  room was very warm  Keys labeled wrong  very confusing navigating around the building  did not mention parking at all and where to park over night
334674906,I dont think they would want to hear my critique This has burned me off to Airbnb  not sure if I would use this service again   Not my idea of a luxury apartment  for the price fresh toiletries should have been provided  fresh bar of soap   body wash at least  also extra towels would have been nice   Lots of noise from trains  kind of a transitional neighborhood  close to El which was convenient Could have stayed in a hotel for the price  also no welcome kit when we got there  just keys on the counter  Would have liked a more user friendly coffee pot  not familiar with a French press   no instructions provided  Also opened bag of coffee in fridge  who knows how long that was there as other food was obviously spoiled 
467582627,Clean  good location  on trend  but very spartan   No welcome letter  no local info   No welcome touches at all  not even a bottle of water in fridge on arrival for a third floor walk up   We certainly could have used that   If youre renting this one bring your own coffee and salt and pepper  Too pricey for what you offered   Only the most basic kitchen items  you didnt even supply salt and pepper   I expected more and while we will be back to chicago we will not be staying with you  Had issue with locking system  communication was handled by a call center  not really any location based help   Luckily  we were able to adjust batteries and get it to work   Never did find out if any maintenance staff stopped to check it out 
464391781,Nice place nice area Thanks for allowing our stay at your place
442122365,Very cool building  Public parking available but scarce  About    minutes to downtown with your vehicle  Please clean the bathroom tile  The only reason being how unclean the bathroom floor tile is 
456455146,The apartment is clean and stocked with amenities   Hopefully once they fix the fan in the bedroom and the taps on the rads  it will be a very pleasant place to stay    The bathroom is a little small but at least its clean   Its about a         Uber to downtown    It seems like a very safe and friendly neighbourhood     Do NOT go to cafe    down the street   They have mice running around    I did have a great time in Chicago and luckily was able to spend time outside of the apartment    There were just a lot of little things that caused me to not enjoy it        The place was a cute little apartment but for the price  I think it could use a few minor upgrades   Bathroom was very small  And the shower wasn u    t the most pleasant   Hard to find parking close by to in pack the car  L There is also a gated parking area beside the building   If the gate is open  DO NOT pull in  the gate will close and there is no way of getting out until the next person comes or goes  Didnt give me straight direct answers on my questions and didnt seem to care about my complaints About a       dollar Uber to down town  There was issues with heating cooling the fan in the bedroom was to noisy and the rads would shut off   The bathroom is very very tight  And if the rad is on  be very careful  It is so close to the toilet and shower that I burned myself on it twice 
713131467,The entire place was filthy when we arrived  Dirty in every way  Honestly the worst Airbnb experience Ive had as far as cleanliness and attention to detail goes  Very disappointed in the lack of cleanliness especially since this listed indicated it was an  enhanced clean  unit  We did appreciate the proximity to SLCH and to groceries and restaurants  We rented the unit for the purpose of me taking our youngest to her appointments over multiple days at SLCH and for a change of scenery for our family of five  The unit was much too small  but we made the most of our togetherness  One of the highlights for us was enjoying the rooftop decks  Nice views  The entire place was filthy when we arrived  Dirty in every way  Honestly the worst Airbnb experience Ive had as far as cleanliness and attention to detail goes  Very disappointed in the lack of cleanliness especially since this listed indicated it was an  enhanced clean  unit   The unit appeared much  much larger in photos   Too dirty to be a great value 
428684836,First time using a airbnb so my husband were very excited  The apartment was easy to locate and directions to get inside were very detailed and helpful  Unfortunately when we entered the apartment I could tell it was not newly cleaned  Dust balls on the floor in the hallway and in the living room  Our sheets in the bedroom had stains on them and hair  I tried to communicate this with the host but with no response to this problem  Our stay was not what we expected and hoped for at all  Thank you for opening up your home to us  It was our first airbnb experience and unfortunately it wasnt the best  My suggestion would be to make sure the apartment is truly cleaned before allowing new guest to stay  When I emailed the host about the lack of cleanliness and not having the information to wifi code  they only responded to the later part of my email which was about the wifi code  So that lets me know you read the whole email but only choose to respond to what you wanted to Parking pass  Parking was very difficult
710283398,Its not super fancy  however it is a great price for the area   The photos werent of that Appartment but instead of a similar Appartment   You can tell by comparing the layout   The door was left wide open to the Appartment   It was odd and made us worried someone might be hiding inside  It seemed like it was going to be a nicer part of town however some of the neighbors were sketchy   The people in the room across the hall kept throwing parties and arguing late in too the night   The last two nights in particular we were woken up by a screaming match they were having at around    am   Both times it lasted until a little before noon which then lead to loud make up sex  It was a fair price for what we got   We knew going in it was way cheaper then what were planning on spending   So despite there being some issues  it should be expected with the low price tag 
538434735,Not as great as other reviews or photos make it out to be  keep expectations low on this  Wasnt cleaned very carefully  which makes the cleaning fee applied a little shady  Dont try to park nearby either  its a headache  Photo made it seem like better quality than it was  Cleaning fee should guarantee the place is spotless
538414983,I have stayed at AirBnb locations across the globe and this is one of the worst experiences I have had  Terrible check in on an unlit street  extremely dirty  hair everywhere  All over the sheets pillows  towels  shower  sink   and loud  The walls are paper thin overlooking a train station and but the biggest issue is the other tenants   The instructions guide you up   flights of stairs  NEVER MIND there is an elevator  Accesible from the side entrance or if you walk to the  st floor from the entrance they instruct you to use   Worst check in experience Ive ever had  Dark unlit street a block away from the actual location of the airbnb  The code given for the lockbox did  not work  Had to get a code for a backup lockbox  Code given for lock box did not work  called  phone number provided was answering machine  left a message no one called back  messaged on Airbnb app finally got a message back  Good neighborhood but literally on the train tracks  Very noisy 
585345392,Our Zencity apartment had obviously had recent construction inside and no one had cleaned up after or even bothered to put a plate over the light switch or the finish back up around the door   We also found crumbs under the couch cushion as well as a condom wrapper and small trash under the sofa and bed  They offered to clean up when we complained but I think the apartment should have been ready BEFORE we arrived  Make sure to have apartments fully ready before future guests come   We will not be staying with Zencity again    times my messages were not answered or answered late  Cleanliness and it was obvious they had rushed to open the place   Hallways a mess and unfinished 
638500601,Tbh it really could have been better  Im sorry about the sheets  My period came unexpectedly and I didnt know what to do  Otherwise cleaning walls needs done swept and mopped properly and the kitchen cabinets needed washed bad  We arrived early which was on us but even waiting   hours and we were told that it would be ready at   pm they still hadnt came in to clean anything  I asked about early check in was ok we couldnt but the for it to not be ready at check in time was ridiculous

625986401,Whatever you guy think about renting this apartment DONT  You will regret it I promise you the pictures are misleading they have a washer dryer in the bedroom the room is small and it doesnt even work right   The kitchen is dirty as well   dishes   cups   dirty frying pans mouses running around the apartment  my son is   years old and he was scared to come out of the bedroom  spiders everywhere with spiderweb all around the place and the WiFi wasnt working   I wrote all of this to the host and he never got back to me   I was in   other apartments from Airbnb and never had a issue but lets put it like this I felt like was stuck in a hell hole for    days  Very bad experience    Very bad experience you could of at least got back to me about the mouse and WiFi my son was scared to come out of the bedroom  Washer and dryer was in the bedroom     cups   dishes   very dirty frying pans    The back bathroom no cold water only very hot burning water   The walls were very dirty I was very disappointed in the apartment   In my opinion Airbnb shouldn u    t not have this apartment on your website    I texted   times about the mouses and there was no WiFi in the house and he never got back to me The place had to be cleaner and if hes doesnt have Certain stuff like in the kitchen dont say you have them   Say that the WASHER  DRYER ARE IN THE BEDROOM      
623176654,Small space but everything you need and close to everything in Westport  Would not recommend if you like to sleep in  it is very bright in the morning  There should be a higher standard of cleanliness  Higher standard of cleanliness 
623543599,They are always great  We love zencity You guys are always great thanks for having us
627710445,Its a cool place The key pad to get in the front door didnt work  When i called to ask the front desk to buzz me in the lady gave me an attitude  I didnt like that  It took me almost    minutes just to check in  I was told that i broke something that was already broke when i got there and i was told that i threw a party which i didnt 
669634973,Nice place  but could use some touch up paint  Kitchen cabinets are somewhat sticky  Could use some degreasing  Thanks for the stay  Place could use paint touch up and cabinets some degreasing  Touch ups mentioned above
610964685,First poor review Ive ever written  The place was accurately described in regards to location and how to get to the apartment  but I cannot help but be disgusted by the fact that the shower had miniature soaps that had already been opened up  the toilet was full of somebody elses pubic hair  and there is no working WiFi in this apartment as advertised   No WIFI  OPENED soap 
711318534,Nice location  clean place  some minor damages in the unit not included in the pictures  Door kept breaking and repair man had to come   times to fix  Water pressure went away half way through  Besides these minor issues  good stay with a nice apartment set up
601481898,The apartment was not clean  The bed sheets had multiple long strands everywhere and the sheets were wrinkled as if somebody had just slept in it  Somebody pooped and left it there so the bathroom smelled  There were multiple stains on the couch and the sink was not clean either  The host still has not responded for my request for a refund a week later  We had to find another hotel room at      am  This will be my last time using Air bnb as when you do request a refund  they dont allow you to request the full amount  I would like a complete refund please  I called the host when we arrived to let them know and I sent a message to her my money back and have not received a response 
721568611,We enjoyed the unit  building and location   However  the unit listing stated the amenities that were with the unit  and those were not provided  Even after the Zen City host said they would be provided  they were not and basic amenities were not provided until late on the third and last day we were there  As such  the description listing cannot be relied upon  What any of us want from a short getaway is to be able to spend time with our family  not needing to go to the drug store to get basic items the unit was described to have and needing to look at our phone repeatedly through the weekend to message and respond to the host  Very troubling that your last host told me the tiny refund he gave expired after a few hours because he didnt want to babysit me  What in the world does that mean   The listing stated the basic amenities are provided including the bathroom amenities  However  there were none  No bath soap even  no shampoo   n nI messaged the Zen City host who said she will send it over so we didn u    t go to a drug store to buy   However  no amenities were provided even the next day  not even bath soap  The new Zen City the next day told me he didn u    t want to babysit us  What in the world does that mean   A condescending and passive aggressive young man  he on the one hand would say rude things then thank us for our patience  Bath soap arrived late afternoon on the third and last day   There are so many beautiful options in Chicago  go for another host   Zen City responded to our messages but did not resolve what should have been a basic issue  with one of the hosts being condescending  While it was during the holidays  this should be expected as a time of increased use of airbnb units  The listing stated the amenities that would be provided and they were not provided  nor were they provided until late our last day   This wasted time and took time away from the respite we needed   Key FOB to common areas did not work so we couldnt access   it was the last night so it wasnt worth the time to try to address given the time already expended with Zen City just to get bath soap 
614249615,The actual apartment itself is great   very well designed  clean  and had all of the amenities  In terms of location  it is situated in a cute area with some restaurants and a coffee shop just up the street  Attractions were definitely a drive away but only     mins  The only bad thing is that there was very loud construction going on  am  pm in the room above us  and Zencity was unwilling to refund any of our stay  It may be something you inquire about before booking  Hi   there was incredibly loud construction  am  pm during our stay  I know you may not have been able to control it  but you can control compensating your guests who were essentially unable to be in the apartment during the day  Thankfully sightseeing took us out of the apartment a lot  But when we came back to rest or were woken up by power saws and hammering  it was unpleasant  Had to message multiple times about an issue 
618084014,If you dont mind hearing every single passing car and loud fire trucks w sirens on keeping you up all night then perhaps this is the place for you  I didnt get any sleep staying at this place   Additionally  it seems that there are two people working at zencity that didnt communicate  so between that and slow responding in general  it wasnt a great stay  My girlfriend and I were confined to a full sized bed      However  the     grand apartments are otherwise extremely luxurious and very clean  Right next to a fire station  THE FIRE TRUCKS KEPT US UP ALL NIGHT    Extremely high cleaning fee of    
592213464,Location was convenient  apartment was furnished well for a weekend stay  however   if you are staying here during the winter either the heat doesnt work or was broken during my stay   uncomfortably cold in the apartment the whole time at      My only issues were the excessive crumbs etc in living room   kitchen and then no response on the heat  Either the heat was broken or doesnt work   if it doesnt work it would be nice to know that before staying there in the winter   it was snowing during my stay and very cold  Making the inside temperature of the apartment very uncomfortable at      Host was quick to respond at the beginning  but when I asked about how to use the thermostat I never got a response  It was     in the apartment 
606670582,Upon arrival there was a pile of dirty sheets on the living room floor and the TV and all lights were on  After a   hour flight with a toddler  this was the last think we expected  Zencity simply forgot to clean the place  When we called  no apology was given and we had to grab sheets from another unit and do laundry of some of the existing sheets  Nobody came for an exceptional cleaning  the cleaner came the next day for a mediocre cleaning job  and we had to shower in dirty bathrooms  hairs on the floors  in bathtubs and toilets   Quite unfortunate as the place is nicely located with a great view  Also  no reply was received regarding our request on reimbursement of the cleaning aand service fees  As a result  I do not recommend Zencitys services  Unfortunately we cannot say we enjoyed our stay and will not be able to recommend your services to friends   In the kitchen many utensils were missing and not enough for   adults   Nobody available to come and clean on the evening of our arrival  Partial apologies or reimbursement of cleaning fees  Being sensitive to our reimbursement request on the cleaning fee and service fee 
722383215,Overall this was not somewhere that I would rent again  I did see that this property management company has other properties that Im sure are nice but this one is not one of them  The master bedroom bathroom toilet did not work and maintenance never came to fix it  Even though it was a very low cost an easy repair  The couch in the living room was not the one pictured and the couch in the apartment was unstable and did not feel comfortable at all   And the temperature in the apartment was very hard to keep consistent  I asked for a small refund because of the issue in the master bedroom bathroom  The repair to the toilet was an extremely easy one and it didnt happen  The fact that I ended up having to use the bathroom in the other room was an inconvenience and a disappointment to me as a new visitor to St  Louis  And the couch in the living room was unstable and not the one pictured  I had issues with the keypad on the apt front door  It was a timely process to enter the apt 
615812141,First impression is great  Great location  description is accurate  We had to buy earplugs to sleep  Hope you get the master bedroom light figured out   Might add another chair or couch in the living room  It appears responses only happen during the week  not weekends  Getting a nights rest  We had to purchase earplugs for all of us 
709646175,Zencity runs many places in the Central West area   unfortunately  this ends up meaning the level of care doesnt always match the expectation the photos give off    Some Basics were missing  sink catcher missing  no garbage disposal   Trashcan was broken  also the radiator woke me up every morning at  am with very loud noises it made  The level of comfort of this AirBnB is low  ZenCity needs to step it up and stop skimping on small touches that make the difference in stay  you need to add more Basics to the place  sink catcher  Trashcan is broken  also the radiator woke me up every morning at  am with very loud noises it made 
721937215,The place itself was nice except it was not clean  The rug and floor was not vacuumed  The check in was horrible  The key fob to get into the building did not work multiple times and when they tried to get us other keys from lock boxes  there were no keys there  The problem was never resolved  The key fob to get into the building didnt work and was never fixed during the stay  They tried to have us access   different keys and non were actually there  Completely ridiculous and we were told they were going to call security and they never did
720122761,Check in instructions werent clear  Cant even get in the side door they say to go into where the lock boxes are  Theres a man and a woman at the main door that youre forced to enter without choice  whom dont wear masks  and harass everyone that passes through the front door to access their units  Unit was missing key amenities and the host became Unresponsive and ghosted us when we reached out to them  Bring your own TV of you wanna watch TV at all   There isnt a remote for the TV and its human proofed without any buttons  as they expect you to watch a blue screen in Spanish language your entire stay  They pay the service fee which is  To help Airbnb run smoothly and to cover the costs of the products and services we provide  like      customer support  we charge a service fee when a booking is confirmed     Yet because they pay the service fee  you dont get the support you need for the issues that you are faced with when renting from them  Also  if you do choose to take the risk of renting from them     TAKE PICTURES OF EVERYTHING WHEN YOU ENTER THE UNIT and WHEN YOU LEAVE  My final thoughts       Everything Zen   I dont think so      Key amenities werent available upon checking or for the entire remainder of my stay  Host was Unresponsiveness and ghosted me after receiving payment   The instructions werent clear and it took a good while to figure it out  also there is a man and woman who stand at a desk to the entry way of the main door   they question every person on where their staying why their there  where they parked and just basically anything and everything THAT ISNT THEIR BUSINESS  Host was Unresponsive which has lead to unresolved trip issues  location is sub par and for the price I think parking should be included  Not worth a dime
718073042,Although the place was nice and had a great view and location  everything else just seemed to be a little off  Parking wasnt as available as they made it seem as only   hr street parking or paid     a day garage parking is available but only before  pm  Also not sure if the apartment we got had been cleaned between guests as we found it pretty messy with hair and trash from previous guests  The door and the heating and air system were also very difficult to use and we had a hard time getting help with these things which caused us to cut our stay short  Please keep these things in mind while booking here     No off street parking was really available all spots were two hour parking only and then the garage parking provided was closed after  pm and charges     per day and if you leave and come back there are additional charges  Door and heating were very difficult to use and it was hard reaching host and when we did get them they were not helpful Any issues I had they didnt take seriously to help me resolve them to the point that I stopped trying and ended my stay early
720076330,This was one of the most difficult experiences that I have ever had while using Airbnb services  The check in process was a bit difficult due to me being provided a code that didnt give me access to the building  It took me   min to contact them multiple times and to finally get a physical key fob to get inside   The description states that it offers free parking space and thats one of the reasons why I chose this location  but once I arrived to check in  I was told that the previous guest lost the parking pass and I would have to pay for my own parking during my   day stay  I asked for a reimbursement  which they agreed to but I have still have received nothing and it has been WEEKS  I have reached out and have no gotten a response   The apartment that I stayed in had a messed up door   I ended up being locked out of the apartment for   hours while I waited for someone to come out and fix it  once he let me into the apartment I was told that I would need a whole new lock for the door since it was so messed up  Another guy was sent out and it took him   hours of banging  drilling  and cursing at the door to get it fixed  Chipping away at my peace and privacy during my stay  I explained this to the host and I have not heard anything back   I will never stay here again   thats for sure  In the description  it listed that there was a free parking space that would be available  After I arrive for me   day trip  I was told that there wasn u    t a parking pass due to the previous guest losing it  I was told that I would have to pay for my own parking for   days and that they would reimburse me  They have not been returning any of my messages and have yet to reimburse me  I spent    minutes trying to get into the building  The code that I was given  was not working and I had to call multiple times to get assistance During my stay communication was fine  Since my stay  there has been little to no communication in regards to reimbursing me and resolving the issues that I was having while I stayed at the location
616994299,You get what you pay for  Great location for a cheap price 
616497164,Please be responsive to people request for change  especially since the requests are not extraordinary
640229639,You can expect that one of your guests wont be able to shut their bedroom door because the door is laying on the closet because it was knocked off of the hinges  You can also expect there will only be one bar chair to sit at the island and two chairs are so low that your chin will probably touch the top of the table  Wifi didnt work  You can also expect any concerns or issues you may run across you have to deal with yourself because the host is unresponsive   I had   guests for this   bedroom air bnb   guests traveling from Minnesota  I checked in before my guests arrived and one of the bedroom doors were completely off the hinges laying on the closet  So now one of my traveling guests don u    t have privacy to shut their paid for bedroom door  I expect to see what was advertised in this listing and that wasn u    t the case  The pool table was filthy the sticks were broken  One bar chair for island the rest of the chairs are short so don u    t expect to sit there with your guests  Mediocre for the price  Update photos for this listing   The host or Air Bnb never responded to the place smelling like cigarettes or the broken bedroom door laying on the closet  Horrible experience overall 
222406570,The place is big and nice and has a good potential  We did have some problems though  to start with a problem getting into the apartment  The caretaker  not owner  was unwilling to come and assist when the key box was not working  After     hours we got in as the owner picked us up  Sheets were dirty and floors needed vacuuming  This was fixed though rather fast after we pointed it out  The kitchen was nice and modern but missed many amenities and cooking equipment  broken glassware   one wine glass  no wine opener etc  The apartment is missing chars so not all can sit around the dining table and eat  Bed covers and towels were too few  Although it cannot be expected we could not get   hour extension on checkout   All in all we did have a good time at the place but a lot of time and trouble went with the issues that needed to be solved  Again the apartment is nice  newly renovated etc but currently not worth the high price  The place could become really nice with smoother checkin  fixing the lack of amenities  kitchen items  chairs  towels  bed covers to mention some   In the current condition though we didnt feel it was worth the money   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  Additional comments   u   cMissing kitchen items  chairs  towels  bed covers to mention some  u   d   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   Could not get into home  Keybox was broken and the caretaker was hesitant to come and let us in  We were stuck in the cold for a good half hour and continued to a another place waiting another hour before we could get in    Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  check in arrangements   Location ok  Not fantastic    The place was generally nice and big but expensive considering the missing amenities and trouble with checkin  cleanines  missing bed covers and towels

721988090,From my experience I would say Zencity is a terrible property manager and I would not use them again  I was notified   minutes before my check in that the housekeeper took the keys out of town and they didnt know when she would be back  It was extremely disappointing and I was left scrambling to find a place last minute  To top it off they offered me a stay somewhere of half the value or a refund for half of what I paid for the air bnb  All in all I felt like I got scammed and I will be fighting for a full refund In my opinion there needs to be some major restructuring of how zen city manages properties  it was unacceptable to be notified   minutes before check in that I wouldnt be able to stay there and was left scrambling to find somewhere to say  The air bnb I was offered was significantly less than the one i booked meaning I would lose money then they tried to offer me half of a refund when I never even stepped foot on the property  I refused to cancel my reservation because this was in no way my fault nor did I have anything to do with why I couldnt stay there  Whoever is in charge of making sure check in will go smoothly needs to be notifying guests at least    hours in advance so they can make other arrangements  This whole situation was just absolutely unacceptable and I felt like I got scammed   Again I wouldn u    t know because I was informed   minutes before check in I wouldn u    t be able to stay there  I was told   minutes before check in that there was a  lock issue  and was offered a place to stay that was less than what I paid for the original place I booked when I asked what the lock issue was they said the housekeeper took the keys out of town They waited until   minutes before I was supposed to check in to tell me they didnt have the keys to the room because the housekeeper took them out of town  Then took even longer to try and come up with a half assed solution All I know is what the parking lot looks like Not good if I paid over      and couldnt even stay there 
719773589,Upon arriving at the location in Stl  my host did not send me check in instructions  After calling them it took another    minutes for them to find my information  As I enter the room the Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone would come to help with the alarm  They Completely failed to take care of it   so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in          would not recommend  this location or host  Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in   This is absolutely ridiculous that I have to go through so much to get a refund for such an awful stay  I will continue to reach out and request my money back   Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in   Host did not send me check in  instructions  Took    minutes in the cold outdoors foe them to figure it out Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in 
352634586,Very clean  Tv upstairs doesnt work and theres barely any utensils in the kitchen making it close to impossible to cook due to the lack of dishes and pots and pans
711265552,This place is very clean and has an unbeatable location   However  it is in the basement so you can smell food cooking in other apartments  You can also hear a lot of doors slam and people waking because it is on the ground floor    I was not able to adjust the temperature in the apartment without contacting the host  which was a major inconvenience to me    In the bathroom the basic amenities are provided but there is not enough shampoo  or conditioner and you will need to bring or buy your own  The hand soap was not useful because it had been watered down  The toilet also wobbles when you sit on it  It would have made the experience better to be able to adjust the temperature in the place  Some clearer instructions on how to locate G  would be helpful  too 
589118215,The unit was spacious and looked like the pictures  The beds were really comfortable and I had a great time playing pool 
425187857,Overall attention to detail as far as cleanliness was not there  with stains on the bed  towel linens  rug  and food left in the sink  I would recommend bringing your own blankets towels  pillows  But  street parking was easy to find  parking was easy to find Cleanliness
722837985,For the price it is a good option  You get what you pay for  In my honest opinion dont expect more than the bare minimum  The unit had great layout and decor and was in a great location  The parking and entry were inconvenience  The overall cleanliness was to be desired as well  It wasnt bad but it wasnt good  Just okay  It is understandable that they might be closed due to restrictions but dont advertise amenities that are not available pool gym  The unit was not  obsessively clean   As well as the key fob situation being a major inconvenience  Parking was fine during the week but I image it would be hard to find during the weekends  I would suggest buying a spot in the garage if possible because people like the safety aspect as well as just convince   All the amenities are advertised gym  pool  However all of those amenities are closed  guessing due to COVID    restrictions  Which is fine  Advertising something that isn u    t available is a little misleading   Check in went through smoothly  All the information provided was accurate  That biggest problem was that the keep fob provided for entry was not the right key fob at all  confirmed by apartment manager   As I said we were still able to come and go  But having a fob promised and then to not have one was very inconvenient as entry to the unit or the elevator requires a voice activated code every time  Communication was fast  The lady I talked to apologized for the inconvenience for the key fob and  put in a request  for another  However  comparing our situation with previous reviews  this has been a reoccurring issue  And a fob was never provided by the end of our stay  The location was in a good spot in the Power and Light district  Plenty of restaurants and attractions not far  The biggest problem was parking was not provided  Metered parking is available but I would think the company would just pay a little extra for a spot in the apartment garage  I think for the price of what we paid      a night   We got what we paid for  A nice layout and location with cleanliness  parking  amenities and convenience to be desired 
631539043,A THIS IS A SCAM     DONT STAY HERE   It was VERY dirty  there was HAIR in the bathroom all over  Dirt  dust  and crumbs in the kitchen   on the floor   in kitchen chairs and more  The pillows were dirty  The microwave door was broken  The futon was broken  held up by pieces not meant for the futon and it was also very dirty  I sent a message and they offered to clean the space  but instead I asked for my some of my money back as this was not what I was not an accurate representation of what I was paying for  I took videos  which they asked for when they offered to clean  which should have been done according to a signed note on the wall  They never responded until check out asking me for a good review  Maybe   hrs later they sent me a message requesting      for damage for microwave  stained table that was stained when I arrived  and a broken drawer tv set  which was destroyed in the picture they sent to me but it was not destroyed when I left   This is a SCAM A THIS IS A SCAM     DONT STAY HERE   It was VERY dirty  there was HAIR in the bathroom all over  Dirt  dust  and crumbs in the kitchen   on the floor   in kitchen chairs and more  The pillows were dirty  The microwave door was broken  The futon was broken  held up by pieces not meant for the futon and it was also very dirty  I sent a message and they offered to clean the space  but instead I asked for my some of my money back as this was not what I was not an accurate representation of what I was paying for  I took videos  which they asked for when they offered to clean  which should have been done according to a signed note on the wall  They never responded until check out asking me for a good review  Maybe   hrs later they sent me a message requesting      for damage for microwave  stained table that was stained when I arrived  and a broken drawer tv set  which was destroyed in the picture they sent to me but it was not destroyed when I left 
494125006,Great location  Cleanliness needs a lot of work  Im extremely disappointed by lack of cleaning  The amount of dirt   debris is unacceptable 
514654604,Its ok  I appreciate you guys letting me use the place but the price point was really high for a uncomfortable stay  I liked the place and wished the amenities worked  The tub jets didnt work and the faucet handles are messed up  The door to the back patio was jammed and someone had to come fix it  The ac was the biggest problem and made my stay very uncomfortable  It was    degrees in the house and opening the windows only helped so much  Again I like the place and would give it another shot if everything was working 
617280915,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival  This is an automated posting 
330437261,spacious place in hyde park with washer and dryer in unit  There were several attempts of maintenance people trying to come in by knocking on my door  There was no prior notice and at least   times people knocked in the morning trying to come in and fix something  It might have not been Zencitys fault  since the maintenance came from the building management apparently  But it certainly interrupted my stay and felt like an invasion of privacy given that the main door is glass  and the person knocking was able to immediately see me  I would have expected Zencity to be in top if their maintenance schedule and let guests know   Other than that friendly and quick responses 
717452288,Good location  nice apartment  Its time to deep clean the rugs and the whole apartment 
551956934,This place was not very clean when we arrived and there were other guests in our airbnb when we arrived  The host was nice  but the space was not as expected and had barely any supplies such as plates  silver ware  cups  cooking necessities  etc   The description said there were all the essentials and then some  There were not enough dishes  only   frying pans to cook with  nothing to clean up at all  not enough pillows  blankets  sheets   The listing said Apt A  but the building said Apt     There were also people in our airbnb when we arrived  They were renting another listing of his and the code worked for both  Eventually he responded  but he was very slow at responding to any questions  Having a cleaner place with more amenities such as plates  cups  baking dishes  silver ware  serving bowls  etc  etc 
217984273,Overall nice area and nice apartment condo  Few  extra  amenities for the price and when compared to other Air BnBs although  basic  essentials were provided  soap  towels  linen   although the soap was not refilled prior to stay  No cable but WiFi was provided  I did not use the WiFi but other guests did and stated the WiFi was slow  My first Airbnb was experience  for the money I would stay in a hotel  just my opinion   Did not respond on day of check in when called on both phone numbers  Better instructions on how to unlock and lock main door    Your guest had some issues with the check in process  unclear instructions  host didnt respond  Additional comments   Requested early check in because flight landed   hours early  never got a response and was stuck in the Chicago cold until after  pm  Called host   times with no response    Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host didnt respond  Additional comments   Did not respond to calls on day of check in     Few amenities compared to other places  Nice area 
592724122,Great location and a good price  Perfect for a weekend in KC  Thanks for the stay  You made it very easy   but you definitely should look into your cleaning crew    I think they partly forgot our unit  Thanks 
713103476,Everything was dirty and I didnt feel very safe  I cancelled the reservation and got a refund  I even found chewed gum in the bedroom  The host wanted to charge me and rent the space out the very next night  which is against zencitys claimed policy of having a gap between guests to clean the place  They have awful business practices  I wont be booking with them again  This place was disgusting  have better business practices   pictures looked the same  it wasnt advertised as a garden unit   easy enough to check in  the number combination was generic enough that I wasnt sure it had been changed and I didnt feel comfortable  After contacting the host to say I was cancelling my reservation because the whole place was a mess  air bnb got back to me way before the host did  and the host only offered to change the sheets so Id keep my reservation  He also wanted to charge me for an extra night so that he could rent the place out again that night  even though zencity says they have a gap between stays to professionally clean their places  Close to work  where I needed to go  was not told it was a garden unit  The location was creepy and not  well lit  This place was so gross I cancelled my week long reservation the next day  If I knew to call air bnb that night to complain  I wouldnt have spent any time there 
712403188,It expect the unexpected  The furniture was torn apart and there were plenty of stains and burned spots on the couches and carpet  The neighborhood is very nice and the house was clean but the furniture was all in bad shape  The bed frames are missing pieces which cause the bed to be uncomfortable and not leveled  The dining room chairs legs are all weak there for you cant sit down and eat at the dinning table  Also the couches were dirty  I couldnt have a sit  Last but not least the weather had dropped to below    and I wasnt able to adjust the temperature of the house  It was very cold   The dining room chairs are broken  the legs on the chairs are very weak  It caused my sister to hurt herself  The master bedroom bedroom frame is also broken  The bed isnt leveled  Last but not least the couches were dirty and plenty stains and the coffee table was broken aswell   The coffee table was extremely weak   It was very cold in each night inside the house and the host has a lock on the thermostat  The host took hours to respond back to me when I mentioned the fact Almost every piece of furniture has dirt and burn stains   The most important funter
708176193,Perfect location and was in the middle of a lot of great shops  The look of the apartment was beautiful the open windows allowed a lot of natural light in and the space was very nice  as well as the kitchen  Unfortunately there was a lot of little problems that were very unpleasant  The worst was the four flights of steps you have to climb back and forth to get to the place itself  The walk up to the stairs was awful and the hallways smelled and were really dirty  The shower had barely any water pressure and the head fell off the second I tried to turn it  and it wouldnt stop running  The thermostat is not controllable so we were either freezing or hot  The majority of the windows did not stay open and they almost slammed down on our hands a couples times  only two actually stay open  Theres a very loud train right across from the apartment so thats all youll here every    minutes  The floors creaked everywhere you walked and the walls are thin so you have to be quiet the whole time  The room without the window is literally suffocating  trying to sleep in there was extremely difficult there was no ventilation and was very hard to breathe in  even with the door open  Fix the shower head and do something with the second room theres no ventilation it was very suffocating sleeping inside there  and fix the windows because it almost slammed twice or didnt even pull up at all   The view was misleading  
715748715,It is spacious  has a nice tv and living room setup  and the kitchen has a lot of gadgets  However  I had a few sleepless nights  The radiator is not working correctly  About every     hours it starts a clanking noise that is indescribably loud  It certainly woke me up every few hours   The maintenance person had a look and confirmed that it needs to be repaired  Im sure he will repair it but it was not done so while I was there   Moving on to the bathroom  I lived in a similar building down the street a few years back  Both were old hotels which still contain the same bathtub  doors  door knobs and bathroom tile when it was first opened  A previous owner painted over the subway tiles on the wall in this place  as well as the porcelain bathtub  It looks awful and feels grimy  Also the doorknob fell off on the inside  trapping my wife in the bathroom for a bit before I was awoken and able to let her out  The maintenance man fixed that  The last thing to mention is that you can hear the pulley system of the elevator from the bedroom very clearly  The elevator shaft is next to the interior bedroom wall  so whenever it is in use  it causes a loud noise to occur   Ive stayed with zen city before and the places are usually much higher quality   The listing says there is a washer and dryer  There is not  The listing said the bathroom was new   It is at least    years old with the original tub and knobs from when it was first opened as a hotel 
713123626,Upon arrival there was a strong smoke odor  which I requested one of the other guests staying to bring a febreeze bottle with her  While scanning the loft I went to the bedroom which there was only one light in on the nightstand and the giant beautiful mirror had a huge crack in it  When going into the bathroom I noticed a huge hole next to the toilet that looked like it had been busted open and attempted to be  semi repaired  and the hand soap dispenser was broken  There was also no tv remote in the living room  Overall it was a beautiful and convenient place if it would have been kept up with because there was dust everywhere and it was very spacious  The real kicker is that today I revived a fee for  smoke smell  and I am now being charged for a problem they displayed  none of our guests even smoke   There was a huge hole next to the bathroom in the hall next to the toilet that had looked like it had been broken from a previous person that stayed there  There also was a huge crack in the mirror in the far bedroom  Lighting was very terrible  and there was no remote for the tv   Got a message after staying saying we had a smoker with us when I arrived the entire place smelled of smoke and we had no smokers with us  The description was not accurate at all  and for      I could have rented a loft that didnt cause my allergies to flair up due to the smoke smell 
637442768,I liked the location and the gym  The unit itself was nice  Id recommend staying in one of the other units in the building though  I like the building and the unit itself but we did not have a great experience due to various reasons      The code to use the door is unnecessarily long    digits is too long for anyone to remember  Make the code shorter so I dont have to pull my phone out and look it up everyone I want to go in the door      There was mouse in our unit  We stayed for a week and we saw the mouse multiple times      Due to the location of the unit in the building  essentially you cant use the windows unless you want to look at dogs pooping  mounds of dog poop  or cigarette butts     The unit smelled like smoke  Not sure where it was coming from  either the person who lives above the unit or the people who use the dog park   It wasnt pleasant      The fire alarm went off in the middle of the nights due to someone having a party      Someone from  maintenance  knocked and was about to enter our unit without us opening the door  We didnt know this was going to happen and it was very uncomfortable  I understand maintenance needs to happen but it could have waited until we were gone or we could have been notified      There werent enough toiletries for our entire stay  We had to go out and buy toilet paper      There was something in the freezer left behind that wasnt ours  It was gross  The code didnt work at first  Support was helpful though  Its a bit ridiculous that we arrived at      but couldnt actually use the code until   pm  We had to sit a wait for   min 
626686714,Excellent location  it wasnt clean at all  other then that  it was pretty decent     Cleanliness was off  everything else was alright 
594393498,Again  Zencity has not disappointed  Youll love their units  Great properties  Great prices  Book today  Great safe property  but this unit may need more care and upkeep with the age of the building  Better heating  and possibly cooling  units would probably help the overall stay    In addition  I would have maintenance for Zencity check the door lock  The door was very hard to open and close on this unit  The door appeared more older and worn  The central west end is a beautiful area in St  Louis  but units and property can be older and in need of updating    Overall good stay besides these things 
709497713,I was satisfied with my stay They were prompt to respond for the most part but a few times I had a bit of a wait I just thought it should have been a bit cheaper
709470047,Everything was good within  but felt a bit unsafe at night due to the neighbors Felt a bit unsafe at night
671163717,Unit is a bit old and needs a refresh but the location is great  Fix up the unit a bit  It is pretty tired  The unit did not have hand soap read at each sink  the kitchen faucet leaked and is very difficult to use  the cookware was not clean  carpet was worn and dingy  Overall the apartment was tired 
411212925,a Dejaron las llaves equivocadas  no tenia la llave de la puerta del edificio
598652125,This place has good value for your money  Nice area  Close walking distance to subway system Turntable does not work  What are records there for   Bathroom on main floor does not flush  Base molding on floor missing on left side of fridge  Wifi signal weak  Movies on netflix on tv were blotchy because of this and would interrupt now and then  Toilet seat in main bath is very worn out and flaking 
598225829,Zencity was responsive      with all our  concerns  The apartment had a peculiar bad smell when you enter but otherwise everything was as shown in pictures and per description  Heads up   couch in the living room isnt comfortable 
572951991,First off I felt like I was catfished lol Even though the pictures were NOT of the apartment I walked into  it was gorgeous  however I was settled for leather furniture  because I was traveling with a baby  and the brick wall  However it was again  gorgeous and clean and OMG  The bed was to die for  super comfy  The first day my door wouldnt lock but they came out the next morning and fixed it  Whoever was responding  I think Marty  HE WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC Downfalls however is that we were downtown and the windows did not close properly nor did they lock so literally anyone on the street walking by couldve opened it and slipped right in  St Louis is dangerous so that was very uncomfortable  especially when I had to yell at people walking past because they kept peeking through the window due to there being   windows but only one was covered with a blind  I knew they were doing maintenance on the building so I was very patient  This am a mouse ran into the bathroom of the apartment  Im sure it didnt live there because it immediately ran back out and I didnt see it again  Also  construction Im sure played a role in that  Even though I had some issues  whoever Marty is  he literally answered EVERY VOICE CALL   made me believe he was on top of EVERYTHING  His customer service freakin rocks  The only reason I would come back to ZenCity is because he made me feel like he actually cared and fixed everything right away  Thanks for the stay ZenCity   Thank you for being super attentive to my needs while I stayed in the apartment 
400594828,I  was scammed out of my money and a great experience  I would NEVER suggest anyone to utilize an Air Bnb if this will The result  I was NEVER acknowledged or apologized too in regards to this inconvenience  Im NOT sure if this company  or the host is racist  Im very upset and disappointed  Ive NEVER beeen treated like this before in my entire life   I am not refunded my money In a situation in which I contacted the host during the stay to Report a problem that was was never resolved during the stay   He never apologize or acknowledged the misrepresentation and lack of concern of Zencity end  This unacceptable   Proper preparation prevents poor performance  Never again Before you all scam others Out of a great experience  the lesser you can do is provide dish washing soap and heating in unit  When a guest contacts you in regards to this  atleast respond  Proper preparation prevents poor performance  Zencity performed and represented poorly  Never again will I book with Air Bnb or through Zencity again
590762586,I was going to over look how dirty this place was just because the bed was so amazingly comfortable and the tv in the living room had Netflix  After getting locked out for an hour on our second day  and not having the WiFi work for almost the entire time we were there I realized this place is crap  There were short curly black hairs in the dirty bathtub  The dishes put away in the cupboards were dirty  The kitchen counters were sticky  I will never stay here again It was really disappointing to pay a     cleaning fee and find the place so dirty  The dishes in the cupboards werent clean  The kitchen counters were sticky  The bathtub had hairs in it  short  curly hairs  and a ring around it  The internet also did not work after our first day there  Getting locked out for an hour was really unfortunate too  I could not be more unhappy with the service you provided and I will tell my friends and family never to book anything with you
589592718,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
588448936,Blood on the sheets and bathroom was filthy it was never cleaned before me and my   yr old got there  Just nasty I paid a cleaning fee just to have to clean up soon as I got in the door and buy blankets  I feel I should have been refunded my cleaning fee No parking at all If it was clean
576874464,If Im honest  you really get what you pay for  I guess I cant complain much because it was a cheap stay  but still  If I were to ever stay here again it would be like super last minute  It was too cold to figure out the transportation via bus or train  but the stores were convenient in walking distance  Disappointing enough  it wasnt close to a lot of things within the city  Lyft was expensive  so I tried to save by requesting the shared rides  Anyway  when I arrived to pickup my key my name wasnt on the reservation  The front desk attendant had to call around for help  The hallway smelled like an old folks home and cigarettes the whole time  The kitchen  including the dishes were not clean which is odd since they charge a cleaning fee  The side of the stove came off while I was cooking  The bathroom was not cleaned as well  the tub and toilet was dirty  The water pressure when using hot water was low in the kitchen and bathroom  The shower made a squeaking noice while the shower ran  The bed was extremely uncomfortable to sleep in  It was so hot in the apartment at night  go figure with the weather that I had to sleep with a window open  Unfortunately  the window wouldnt stay open in the bedroom so I had to prop it open  I thought there would be an actual guide book like most Airbnbs but that wasnt the case  But again  you get what you pay for  My name wasnt on the reservation  More like automated responses than an actual live person 
571860734,First things first  the pictures of the apartment on the post is not the one you will get  We arrived at      PM  had a very long flight  however this is no hot water  no hot shower  Contact the host at      PM  and got reply the next morning at     AM  I dont blame the late reply because it was late in the night when I found out there is completely no hot water   The next morning my colleague told me her bed is very dirty l  lots of black and brown particles   Also I noticed there are hairs on the towel  After   hours waiting  The host sent a building manager to check hot water   and confirm there is completely no hot water in the shower  In the kitchen he was letting the water running about half an hour and start to feeling some temperature  The most ridiculous thing is  the host charge us     cleaning fee  He was doing nothing but wasting our time  There is no compensation for our time  the miss led pictures of hosts post  the awful experience of our stay    I have notice this is a so called professional management company  under its name of Zencity there are several airbnb properties    I will defiantly be caution and  wake away 
571080702,Conveniently located walking distance to many great eating and drinking spots and a short ride to downtown Chicago and all it has to offer  The bedding was fantastic  Thank you for providing a convenient place for us to stay   One suggestion I have to enhance the arrangement is to provide hooks or bars to hang wet towels after showering  either on the back of the bedroom doors or the bathroom door  I would also really have appreciated a manual that outlined things like check out procedures  and how to control the thermostat  or how to trouble shoot wi fi issues   Some things were included in the e mails exchanged  however I only had my phone to access e mail and i twas cumbersome to ferret out the information   An in house manual would have made things so much easier for me    Thank you  Best regards  Laura
559108536,With all the   star reviews  I was expecting something a little nicer  but it was the place was fine  There were little things that on their own wouldnt have bothered me much  but as a whole didnt add up to all the rave reviews I saw from other visitors  I thought maybe it was just me  but the two friends that stayed with me agreed    The place is worn a bit  which is fine  but some things could be fixed     clogged soap dispensers in the bathroom kitchen    toilet not fully bolted down    found a Starbucks lid on the floor by the couch    a  wookie  of hair on the rug   lumpy pillows in the front bedroom   Also  I left something of value  my fault  I know  on the couch and have been reaching out to management continuously to try to get an answer     My first message wasnt responded to  and when I wrote a second they said the housekeeper didnt report finding anything     I asked them if they could please reach out and ask the housekeeper  which they said they would  but its been two days and still no response   This is the longest review Ive ever left for an Airbnb  so I guess to summarize I would not stay here again 
557291874,Nice neighborhood and decent unit  but building had issues with heat and plumbing during the stay  Communication with owner was prompt  but issues were not addressed quickly   Will consider other units with them again  as it could have been the building itself  Per my emails during my stay  the unit had issues with the heating system that made the first two nights unbearable to sleep  Also  the bathroom sink continued to be clogged during the entire stay  requiring me to brush my teeth in the kitchen sink 
556480833,The bathtub was severely clogged and the issue was not addressed during our   day stay  The water was taking hours to drain and we did not have a proper shower  The communication from the hosts side was some generic messages apologizing for the inconvenience  The first time the issue was raised in our text conversation  the person who replied didnt even spend time to read my whole text  failed to acknowledge the issue and wished us a pleasant stay  I realize that we arrived on a Saturday and the maintenance of the building was not going to address the issue until Monday  but this is clearly a concern for the host   If the issue with the bathtub had not happened  the experience would have been great  Nevertheless  the professionalism of a host shows when mishaps happen  From our interactions with Zencity we experienced automated generic responses  inability to address our issue in time and failure to provide a satisfactory compensation for the inconvenience  I have had maintenance issues during a stay in the past and have always tried to solve it in private with the host when the host is responsive and sincerely concerned  This time  Zencitys responses showed that they dont care enough for the experience of their clients  If the issue with the bathtub had not happened  the experience would have been great  I believe that the professionalism of a host is seen when mishaps happen  From our interactions with your company we experienced automated and generic responses  inability to address our issue on time and lack of resolution to properly compensate our inconvenience  In matter of fact  I have not yet received any response to the last messages I sent  Too late to respond to an issue we faced  Have not responded at all after we left the apartment  On the expensive side
554566999,Its a fine place but I wouldnt recommend it  Ended up letting them change me over to another spot they had in Pilsen and that was better but having to deal with everything made it more of a headache than the work trip needed to be  They allowed maintenance men into the apartment who then locked me out of the Airbnb  They didnt have a key on site for that specific lock and it took over   hours for them to get someone to let me in  Laundry needs to be in the apartment  the back stairs shouldnt have anyone going up and down them  Communication could have been better  I allowed them to change my Airbnb and they were kind about that but in the future I wouldnt go with them 
550909088,This has a really comfortable bed and if you like your room warm to go to bed then this is the place for you  You cannot control the heat and it was very warm  There wasnt coffee maker but a coffee press  They did have a blow dryer which I appreciated  They had shampoo and conditioner as well and that was nice  The neighborhood location is super close to a lot of places to eat and shop  Can I just say first off that the bed was super comfortable  The down comforter and the all cotton sheets were amazing  The sleep would have been better if it wasnt so dang hot in there  It felt like in the   s  The radiators were in the off position and the heat just kept coming  We had windows open but it only cooled off so much  Tried to turn on the a c  But it was fighting with the heat that was coming out  Finally just put extra sheets over the radiators to kind of trap the heat  Dont know if that was safe but it did help  Very frustrating  An actual coffee maker would have helped make the morning better  They are not that expensive  A Mr  Coffee is like    dollars  Wrote to host about an issue with the heat offering suggestions that were not possible An actual coffee maker instead of a coffee press  Not that expensive to get       mr coffee in there 
548019043,Great location  Wonderful communication from the host  Easy check in  Super clean apartment with fantastic amenities  However its worth noting that the combination of paper thin walls mixed with strange and ambient noises from apartment neighbors made for difficulty sleeping  If youre out on the town late at night or are a heavy sleeper than this is the spot for you  Great location and a super clean apartment  Easy check in  Everything about this place was perfect on paper   My husband and I were so excited to stay here but unfortunately ended up leaving just before midnight due to incredibly loud neighbors and very thin walls  We could hear the entire movie tv show that then turned into some sort of automated machine gun sound  maybe playing COD   that never stopped  The usual sound of busy city street is expected in a location like this but the sounds coming from this apartment were next level awful  I realize that loud neighbors are somewhat out of your control as a Airbnb host but it did ruin the whole experience for us 
532884461,The location and decor are perfect  but that is it  When I arrived for the first time  the door had been left open and unsecured  and the host was indifferent  I ended up going to a hotel for the night for safety concerns  and they assured me it would be check and locked by the next day  Unfortunately when I came back the next evening  it was still unlocked  What is more  they had changed the code and it took hours to get a response so that I could leave and gain re entry  As if this wasnt enough  the shower is disgusting and does not drain  There was hair left in the in from a previous guest upon my arrival  and I quickly saw why  It literally took over    hours for the water to drain from a   minute shower  and all five minutes of that were spent in standing  dirty water  If you can see past these things  its great  but safety and cleanliness are literally my top two priorities  When I arrived late in the evening on my check in day  the door was opened to the condo  I was traveling by myself  and did not feel comfortable going in  It turned into an hours long hassle with Airbnb and the host  and ended in me going to a hotel as I did not feel safe in staying in a location that had been left unsecured  What it more  the host told Airbnb they had spoken with me and resolved the issue to try to get out of losing payment for the night and to force me to stay there  and it was totally fabricated  I was assured the condo would be checked before I came back the next day  but the door was left unlocked  again  They had changed the code in the meantime  and it took me hours to get a response for the new code so that I could access  The whole experience made me never want to use Airbnb again  especially on a work trip where the added headache was so inconvenient  A functional shower and safe entry 
532389391,Spacious apartment in convenient location but could have been cleaner  Also rather noisy  background noise from the  L  train to be expected but disruptively loud A C unit  hallway noise  and very creaky floors were not expected  The apartment was spacious but definitely would have felt more homey if it had been a tad cleaner  The dishes not being clean and the bed having hair on it were off putting for sure  Most frustrating was the amount of time necessary to fix the beeping smoke alarm in the hallway  This combined with the  very  loud A C that knocks loudly when turning both on and off made it difficult to get a good nights rest  I would also recommend different rugs as the ones in the bedroom   living room leave fibers everywhere and get all over socks  etc  Instructions sent ahead of time were great  Just wish we could have confirmed that the physical keys are not really needed and that the intercom door key code option would continue to work beyond check in before arriving at the apt  Responses were fine  but perhaps ineffective to have multiple people answering within the same thread  I think some things got lost because of this 
620108028,Good stay
519993626,I wouldnt stay here again  First  I arrived around   pm  As I was settling in  I realized that there were no bath towels in the unit  Two washcloths and a hand towel   thats it  I usually shower at night because I have to wake up quite early  so this was a huge inconvenience off the bat  I contacted the host immediately  and they said they had someone in the building who could do a load of laundry and drop towels off later in the evening  which would have been around    pm   past the time I needed to be in bed  I waited until    pm  but no towels arrived  Frustrating beyond belief  What kind of Airbnb doesnt have towels waiting for you    To make matters worse  as I resigned myself to the fact that I wasnt going to be getting the towels before morning  I found a dead cockroach on the bathroom floor  At this point  I considered gathering my things and finding another place to stay  but I was too tired  so I just went to bed  The next morning  I went to the kitchen to make tea and noticed that the cabinets were covered in grease  There were also dishes in the dishwasher that I couldnt tell were clean or dirty  On top of that  the floors of the unit hadnt been thoroughly swept or vacuumed  and I found little pieces of hair in the bed linens as I was making the bed  Overall  the lack of cleanliness in this unit made me feel uneasy both nights of my stay  On a positive note  the door staff were super friendly  and the location was great  Just be mindful of parking as others have noted 
490217002,Im not really sure what to say but this was probably my worst Airbnb experience  When I arrived  I was surprised to discover that there wasnt any central air conditioning  I know that Chicago is the Windy City and that high temperatures arent the norm  but given that there was a heat advisory the week of my trip  it made for some miserable and sweaty nights  Though the host did his best to accommodate my needs by providing fans  it just wasnt enough  If there was an a c unit in the bedroom that wouldve been helpful  but unfortunately  there is only one in the living room  I also thought that this property is overpriced and that the pictures are a bit deceiving  I was underwhelmed upon arrival  I also was really disappointed in the couch  It was pretty uncomfortable  Overall  I was disappointed  However  I do think this would be a cool place to stay in the cooler months  Its a really fun area  Thank you so much for trying to accommodate my needs by providing two fans upon request  However  given how hot it was in Chicago during my visit  it made for a pretty unpleasant stay  I honestly was surprised that there wasnt any central air or at least an air conditioning unit in the bedroom  I slept in the living room the last night of my stay  which might of been a good solution if the couch cushion were so worn  Also  I felt as though your listing was a bit deceitful  You dont disclose the lack of central air and even cover up the a c unit with a curtain  If I had none this in the beginning  especially since I have asthma  I would not have made this reservation  Overall  I was pretty disappointed  Furniture and Central Air Conditioning
489343789,The place was acceptable the views were great  The A C was ok but not great  The bathroom had peeling paint on the ceiling and the light fixtures were rusted  My wife slipped and fell in the Bathtub that had no mat or anti slip coating or grab bars  Once we reported this and that she broke a rib  the host abandoned us  For those who follow us  we bought a mat for the tub so no one else would experience the same humiliation  We had no help once we reported the problem  We will not reccomend or rent from this group again  When we had a problem you abandoned us  We had a problem and once we let them know all communication stopped 
483503910,Where to start  I will preface this long honest review with the fact that we travel and use Airbnb a few times a year  so Im very aware of a good stay  When we arrived our space had not been fully cleaned  There was trash and scum on the night stands  brown gross spots on the comforter  black marks on the sheets  hair EVERYWHERE on the sheets and pillows  the floor had clearly not been vacuumed or picked up  there was a stretchy band from a new item in plain sight and crumbs all over the rug   I have photos  but will spare you  We called Zencity and they sent the cleaners back to clean again  However  it took the cleaners an hour to arrive  Everyone was very nice and courteous from Zencity  so   star on communication  but just an annoying experience as the entire ordeal took our afternoon of a very short stay   Aside from that  parking is absolutely ridiculous  Other reviews said it was no big deal  It was a very big deal to us  All that is available is street parking  metered  and a few free spaces  Most of which are always full as this street is lined with other apartments  so everyone is looking for a space to park  We were frustrated EVERY time we tried to park  There is a parking lot for this building  but permit only  Im confused as to why zencity doesnt have a permit for their guests to park  One car per room  It was just beyond annoying to try to find parking and then when you did  walk from wherever you managed to get a spot and then all the way around the building to the entrance  If youre looking for convenience  run away  There IS a cute street of a few restaurants a few blocks away  but thats the only convenient factor this place has going for it    The place itself is well decorated with modern touches  Just wish it had been clean  The AC units are in the windows  so you have to maneuver the curtains just right to try and block light for sleep  Theres also not a TV in the bedroom  not a big deal  just not noted anywhere incase its important to you  I really wanted to love this space  but we just didnt  Decor is awesome  but it wasnt clean and I cant give stars for that  The parking is also awful  A suggestion would be get a permit space so your guests can park in the lot  Id even pay more for that  Parking is absolutely ridiculous  Other reviews said it was no big deal  It was a very big deal to us  All that is available is street parking  metered  and a few free spaces  Most of which are always full as this street is lined with other apartments  so everyone is looking for a space to park  We were frustrated EVERY time we tried to park  There is a parking lot for this building  but permit only  Im confused as to why zencity doesnt have a permit for their guests to park  Lack of parking and convenience devalued this space for us 
481975249,Upon arrival  we were greeted with two persistent alarms beeping  It turned out to be the carbon monoxide detectors  I immediately alerted the host and they said they would contact maintenance to check it out  In the meantime  we unplugged and reset them  That seemed to do the trick and the beeping stopped    at least for a while    Later that night     we plugged them back in and went to bed  No beeping until  am when we were startled out of sleep   We could not get the carbon monoxide alarms to stop  It wasnt until we opened up all the windows and turned on all the fans that the alarms would finally stop  unplugging and resetting didnt do anything   Needless to say  we had a pretty fit full night of sleep   I messaged the host again  explaining that the carbon monoxide detectors went off again  They said they were sorry for the inconvenience and that maybe the maintenance crew couldnt make it out because on the holiday  I then went on to explain in detail what happened that night and added   Also  alarming   it appears that all of the smoke detectors are dead  and missing in some rooms    No response from the host  other than asking me to give them a   star review    Wow  Unresponsive when I mentioned that there was a more serious issue with the carbon monoxide detectors and dead and missing smoke detectors  More comfortable living room furniture  dressers  full set of dishes and glassware  ie only one wine glass   one ceiling fan in living room is broken  nonworking smoke detectors  an obvious carbon monoxide issue   
480832069,The place is fine  decorated well and in a nice area  But it smells very bad  check in was very difficult and you may be accused of taking random things from the room that the cleaning person decides have gone missing and charged for them later  We called Zencity customer service to help us with check in to get into the building and they couldnt even help  We just had to wait    minutes until someone came by willing to open the door for us  The check in gave us a keypad code for the door to the apartment  but the whole apartment building was locked and we were supposed to have a FOB available to unlock the building  The door is not manned at all times to let people in  Wouldve been great  until the host told us the cleaning person reported iPhone docks missing that were not in the apartment at all to our knowledge and tried to charge us nearly      There are way too many factors to accuse guests of taking some random object from a place  especially when they werent there in the first place 
479196514,I will start off saying its a great location in Hyde Park  Easy check in with a lock box  The building is old and has a lot of charm  with older buildings they run hot  Something to keep in mind for summer travelers  The small AC unit was not left on but did eventually cool the studio apartment  The location was perfect for us and overall it satisfied our needs for a short weekend but we liked staying at the other Zencity locations in Hyde Park  We love that Zencity has so many locations in Hyde Park  Unfortunately  this wasnt our favorite spot  We arrived on a hot day  It would have been nice had the AC been left on for our arrival  When we checked in the room was very very hot and took several hours too cool  Something to keep in mind for summer visitors  It made a bad first impression  The cleanliness of the bathroom  hair in sink and tub  and also the bedding didnt seem that clean  small hairs and stains   We tried the TV this morning and it didnt work  Had internet connection issues   Overall a great location  old charm but a few things could have been better 
476678832,The apartment was as listed   It is in a lovely neighborhood that we felt safe to walk to a nearby park and grocery store    We however had a few small issues   The unit only has one small window air conditioner in the living room area so we were a bit too hot in the bedroom   the water pressure was very low and seemed to not get very hot and the coffee pot was broken   I reported the broken pot and did get an apology a couple hours later and was told they would be sure and get a new one for the next guests   I feel the cleanliness of the kitchen could have been better  We were disappointed in the broken coffee maker and felt like maybe the kitchen wasnt properly cleaned or that would have been noticed   Also  I would suggest a measuring cup  hot pads and a smaller size pot with a lid as somethings that would be helpful in the kitchen   As far as the air conditioner  that could be an oversight of mine   as I dont recall whether or not the listing described it as a window unit or not  We really loved the neighbor hood and had positive interactions with the locals as we walked to  the  nearby park and stores  If there was air conditioning throughout and the water pressure was better
476591037,It was okay   Not very clean  Clean sheets and clean place
470900221,Great location   check in and out was effortless   nice outdoor space  Only issues  the back door lock was confounding to say the least    adults could not figure out how to lock unlock consistently until day    The space was a bit dated and needed some cosmetic maintenance  Wed stay there again  but not for the price 
470767218,I made it clear that there were three of us  all adults  arriving  yet it turned out that only one queen sized bed was available and there was no couch  This meant that we had to go all the way to the city center to purchase a sleeping bag the day of our arrival  after the fatigue of a    hour flight   This was not the service I had expected after paying such a high price   I made it clear that there were three adults arriving  yet it turned out that only one queen sized bed was available and there was no couch  This meant that we had to go all the way to the city center to purchase a sleeping bag the day of our arrival  after a    hour flight   This was not the service I had expected after paying such a high price  
467582162,WiFi router is in another apartment  I can barely get WiFi signal in bedroom for my laptop and my cell phone just cant receive signal at all  Please fix WiFi and just get a router for every apartment  I can barely get WiFi signal in bedroom for my laptop and my cell phone just cant receive signal at all 
467580755,Were not really sure what happened with the door when we were trying to check in  It seemed as if it was locked and when we called for help  the host didnt have any sense of urgency for our problem  We ended up waiting outside for about    to    minutes until a resident of the apartment opened it for us  The place looks exactly the way it does in the pictures  We found that the linens and pillows had stains and little hairs on them  Im guessing they came from the previous guests  which may suggest the sheets hadnt been washed before our arrival  The shower liner in the bath tub is a little moldy and so is the window in the shower  the knob is also a bit messed up  If you want your water to be hot you have to turn it to the cold side and if you want it to be cold you have to turn it to the hot side  Overall  even with the minor problems we had  our stay was great  It was a beautiful little neighborhood and we were able to walk to most places we wanted to go to  Overall  even with the minor problems we had  our stay was great  It was a beautiful little neighborhood and we were able to walk to most places we wanted to go to  Were not really sure what happened with the door when we were trying to check in  but we dont blame that on you  we just wouldve liked better communication and more urgency to help us with the problem  A big thing Id suggest is to keep those linens and pillows clean  stain free and hair free  Also  I apologize if we didnt leave the place in great shape  I did my best to clean it up  My boyfriend didnt believe that it was our duty to do that and waited to the last second to get up and get his things together  and then dragged me out the door around        I hope I did alright and please consider my suggestions  Take care  For some reason  the front door was locked  which according to the host was unusual  We stood outside for a good    to    minutes until a resident opened the door for us and we called the host about   times to help us  but they didnt give much instruction on what to do  Better communication when we were locked out and clean sheets would have made our stay perfect 
367835287,This is a   floor    bedroom   and a half bath unit with a large outdoor patio area  This is NOT a fully furnished unit being occupied by current tenants like you would expect from an air bnb  instead  this is a bare bone unit furnished only to the extent of a hotel that is being rented out by some sort of rental company solely for profit  For starters  the unit smelled strongly of cleaning products upon entering  and somehow smelled strongly of cigarette odour upstairs  we messaged right away asking them why this unit smells of smoke despite it being a non smoking unit  and they responded saying that it is a non smoking unit  That was their only response  Obviously the last renters smoked in it and Zencity tried to cover it up with Fabuloso  which was obvious thats all they did  What good is the      cleaning fee if you smoke if the owners dont even use it to make the extra effort   Any way  this place is up on air bnb purely for the profit of ZenCity  The only amenities are towels pillows cups  bowls  and plates  and some Pert shampoo and  Mountain Fresh  body wash  Its very obvious they invested the least they could in this place  Good luck drying your hair because there is no hair dryer  and good luck making coffee because there is no coffee maker  just a French press in the kitchen with all the stickers and tags still in it  clearly not used or cleaned  I couldnt even wash it because there wasnt even a sponge to clean it lol  I asked my boyfriend  how am I supposed to clean this   And he responded  with the      cleaning fee  which was pretty funny  The place isnt finished with patches in the ceiling and exposed wires in the closets  Would only be perfect for parties  which are not allowed without incurring an extra      fee  Wouldnt recommend this place for a couples night or even a family travelling unless you want to bring your whole house with you  Take your      a night and get a nice hotel or a real air bnb  The idea of renting an air bnb is to rent a fully furnished apartment that is currently occupied by people that leave you access to all amenities that anyone living in a nice apartment would actually have to share  not a bare bone unit furnished only to the extent of a hotel that strongly smells of cleaning product and  somehow  cigarettes  Great for a party  which is not allowed  not great for sleeping   people  upstairs bedrooms heard lots of strange noises including what sounded like people entering the front door multiple times  unsure why that was 
561513050,Its a decent space thats close to everything  Its missing small things that become inconvenient    the host is accessible and responds quickly  Thanks for the accommodations  I really recommend that you have someone live in the space to complete it  Its missing so many small things like a place to hang your towel in the shower  directions for the television  a coffee pot with coffee available  trash cans in the room  better lighting in the bedroom  the bulb needs to be replaced and many other small things    the odor is a serious issue to live with   
364483903,Overall my stay was good  The location can not be beat  You are close to everything  However  the one major issue I had was the cleanliness of the apartment  You are charged a cleaning fee in addition to the room charge which is totally fine except that I expected to walk into a clean apartment  Instead I walked in to find the floors in the kitchen had clearly not been cleaned and there had clearly been something spilled  The bathroom floors were covered with hair  The bed linens and blanket were covered with all different hairs and when I brought this to the hosts attention I was assured that they were clean but that there were extras in the closet if I wished to use them  I pulled them out only to find there were a bunch of big yellow stains on them and again  more hair  Overall I enjoyed my stay  I just wish that it would have been thoroughly cleaned before my arrival especially since there is specifically a cleaning fee  You are charged a cleaning fee when you book which is totally understandable but if Im paying for a cleaning fee I expect the place to Actually have been thoroughly cleaned when I arrive 
551698970,Located in a    story apartment complex across the street from Forest Park  Easy check in and great location  Space is unspectacular but nice  No central heat and air  but window units    Unfortunately  Zencity  the managing firm  failed to respond when I contacted them about an issue with Netflix and HBO not working due to too many users  likely spread same account over multiple properties   This was an amenity they really promoted    It was not clearly discussed in the AirBnB ad or the check in instructions  but there is no on site parking provided  The garage is for apartment residents only  You either have to park in the designated lot   blocks away for     night or get lucky with metered street parking in a busy area  This came as quite a surprise when we checked in  Overall  the place was an okay value  Would definitely stay in this area again but would stay away from a Zencity property 
362546015,Not recommend  The host would be so unresponsive and  irresponsible when you encounter some problem even though it is not your fault  In my case  he just told me to call the building technician  which was not free  when I was locked out  because I got no key on check in and  the two locks on the door both work  Now the host still ignores my request for the reimbursement of the stupid money I paid   Last issue   the Wifi is not so stable and fast even after being restarted  We did not get the fob to the main entrance when we checked and no one sent it to us after we notified the host The host is so irresponsible  Firstly  he did not inform us that there were two locks for the door which both worked well  When we were locked out because of the door knob lock  he just told us to call the building maintenance and did not send us the key  In the end  we had to pay eighty dollars to the technician for sending us the key  Ironically  he sent two of his men to disable the door knob lock the next day and finally gave me the fob but still did not admit that it was totally his faut 
361859848,This apartment is beautiful  comfortable and in an amazing location  This was the first time I went with a more luxurious Airbnb option and spent quite a bit over my budget  It would have been a dream and totally worth it if our car didnt get towed        when parked on the street immediately in front of the apt  we have photos of the street signs making no suggestion that we couldnt park there and the parking machines were not accepting payment because it was a Sunday evening   I almost missed my flight because my partners car was at the tow yard on Christmas Day  Zencity should absolutely give warnings and advice or guidance for parking  It was a huge blow financially  Otherwise everything would have been amazing  Amazing place  Beautifully kept  HUGE disappointment that our car got towed the morning we were checking out  I suggest zencity warn guests about that and give some guidance beforehand  Our car got towed from what seemed to be an open street spot directly in front of the apt building  We took photos of the parking signs that gave no hint that we couldnt park there overnight  There were no instructions  suggestions  warnings or tips for parking by the owners of the apartment unit  We had to pay      the next morning and I almost missed my flight home  It was Christmas Eve  Huge bummer  I dont blame Airbnb or zencity but I absolutely think zencity should offer tips and support for parking  A parking option or suggestion 
535544411,The location cannot be beat and the apartment is nice  Its very sparse with few of the necessary items including eating utensils and a coffee pot  There is no onsite parking  no instructions about how to use anything  Ive stayed in many places that were not corporately owned and received better  how to  manuals and guidance to the area  There is only   spoon in the apartment  No extra light bulbs or towels  We were very disappointed with the cleanliness and the lack of concern for actually helping us have a good experience while we were there  There were no instructions on how to make coffee with the coffee press or the hot water pot  There were no instructions about the television  We struggled just to find local news  There were no instructions on where to park off site  or where to shop 
668105669,This is fine for the price  but definitely not the level of hospitality I am used to with Airbnb  When we checked in  no bath towels had been provided  The host sent some over eventually but we were out and they were left on the hallway floor   kind of unsanitary  The kitchen was only partially stocked  only   spoon    bowls  etc    definitely not what I would consider a fully stocked kitchen  The location was ok  no one in the building wore masks in the hallways or elevators and one night someone was running through the hall and stairs screaming late in the night  It could have been worse  but I wouldnt stay with this host again  No welcome page with instructions  missing towels in the apartment 
358224193,Dont expect communication other than an answering service that goes unanswered  They just disappear behind cancellation charges and no compassion for legitimate excuse for cancellation and rebooking  Then raise the rates the next week for same nights  Cold and opportunistic  Never will rebook with them  No response to many communications you said I could cancel and then charge  night stay I know that was your policy but you didnt have to enforce it and could have rebooked me for same days the next week that I asked for  Instead you charge      more for the list day and increased rates the next week  Bad busines  Never responded to my communication other than saying I could cancel before I arrived but still charged  night stay  I booked the wrong week 
355319648,My stay at your apartment was ok but the there was hair on top of the bedroom sheets   under the bedroom sheets  There was also the same hair that was on the bed on the bathroom floor under the mat   ALOT OF IT     Never found the tv remote but used the app on my cell phone host suggested  My stay at your apartment was ok but the there was hair on top of the bedroom sheets   under the bedroom sheets  There was also the same hair that was on the bed on the bathroom floor under the mat   ALOT OF IT     Never found the tv remote but used the app on my cell phone host suggested 
349497523,Location  ease of check in  and space were great  However the apartment heating system was quite warm and not adjustable  please adjust heat or leave instructions as to how to do it  I tried to turn the knob on a couple of the heaters but they were stuck and very hot  Also the black light fixture did not work  and a small power strip in the bedroom would help as I could not have the light on and charge devices  Other than that the location  space and ease of check in was great  but was so uncomfortable with the heat I would hesitate to book again  The apartment was very very hot  Probably at least    degrees  we got in at about    pm and could not figure out how to adjust the steam heat  even with a slightly open window it was uncomfortably hot in both rooms and skin parching dry 
348860887,There were very responsive to my inquiries  Place as pictured  front desk staff was great  Hello   Thank you for being responsive during my stay for the most part  I did have comments about the shower that were never addressed  The temperature in the shower was either extremely hot or ice cold   A few constructive feedback  notes   There were dirty towels from the previous stay hanging on the bathroom  There was a skillet with shrimp and some kind of stir fry in the fridge  from a previous stay  and there was trash in the bedroom under the bed 
347005473,Overall the place is very nice  and the location is close to wicker park  The apartment is spacious and tastefully done  If you are looking for a homey place with character  this isnt really the place though  You can tell no one has ever lived here before  no hooks to hang your coats  the bed covers arent warm enough for a Chicago winter etc   There are no personal touches around the house  Dealing with zencity feels very corporate   they dont respond directly to your questions  but send canned messages  I made the above suggestions to them in a private email  but never got a response  I provided all of this information to you in a private message  One of the reasons I like Airbnb is for the personal touch  I felt zero personal touch in this whole interaction  You can tell that this is one of those corporate air bnb situations  Canned answers  They would send a response that didnt actually respond to my questions comments  I sent all of these comments in a private message to the host and got a  thank you   please rate me   stars  which is why I am making ya comments public now 
343766949,The unit itself is very nice  Some things to note     HVAC noise   when the HVAC turned on off it sounded like someone taking a hammer to a filing cabinet      Upstairs Noise   the neighbor upstairs was an extremely heavy walker  And this occurred from      AM to well past   AM  Bring ear plugs     Bathroom Faucet   this was so loose that I had to hold it at the base in order to turn the water on off      Construction   there was extensive construction going on in the common building space  hallways  and units on my floor during my stay  The construction crew turned off the electricity for several hours in the middle of the day one day      WiFi   excellent connectivity     Roku   great value add service First lockbox didnt work  Contacted the host using up  went to Zencity and was told they couldnt help and that I needed to call Airbnb  Sent message using Airbnb and responded immediately with an alternative which worked without issue  Given construction was still underway in the building  it should be a bit less  Also electricity was out for several hours during the day as a result of the construction  When the HVAC kicked on off it sounded like someone taking a hammer to a metal filing cabinet  The bathroom faucet was hanging by a thread  had to hold it at the base to turn it on off 
339654566,Just as promised  this is a clean simple place to stay in Hyde Park  close to trains  the lake  and the university  I really do enjoy this location and I appreciate the simplicity of it  I have not cited how the elevator was not working on the opening night because I realize that could just have been bad luck  but the key issue was extremely distressing and I believe some money should have been taken off the fee because of that  After travelling and dealing with many obstacles to get there  not being able to get in and having to walk up with luggage was very frustrating  Nonetheless the location was just as promised once inside  I would prefer regular TV to all the bells and whistles of the television set up  by the way  because I cant watch something simple like the news or the Stephen Colbert show  But that is my only other concern  I did not receive a key for the outside door  Because I arrived late at night  this was very frustrating and I had to wait for someone to show up at the door  When I called  I had to ask multiple times before a solution was offered  I was not told until later the next day what to do about the problem  The problem around the key was a substantial concern 
333694054,This was my first Airbnb experience and I was definitely not happy with the management  Arriving after waiting all day to check in only to find that the unit had not been cleaned was quite disappointing and highly inconvenient  The dishes were not clean despite being in the cabinet so we were unable to cook  There was also a problem with the entertainment WiFi so we were unable to watch TV until we purchased our own HDMI cable  I am hesitant to use Airbnb again due to this extremely poor experience  This was my first Airbnb experience and I was definitely not happy with the management  Arriving after waiting all day to check in only to find that the unit had not been cleaned was quite disappointing and highly inconvenient  The dishes were not clean despite being in the cabinet so we were unable to cook  There was also a problem with the entertainment WiFi so we were unable to watch TV until we purchased our own HDMI cable  I am hesitant to use Airbnb again due to this extremely poor experience 
332574093,The hot water was out one morning  cold shower before work  and the host response time was very poor  Six hours to respond the message     hours to get someone out there  All the responses started with  Sorry for the delayed response      I cant stay here again because if something goes wrong  like basic necessities fail or the front door lock fails  Im afraid it will take   hours for the host to check his messages and two days to get anyone out to the property  As a business traveler this is a risk I can not tolerate  The slow to no response time when the hot water was out only made us wonder what would happen if the electronic front door lock failed  How long we would be on the street   Great location and a great place  but we are business travelers and wont be able to stay here again  One morning we woke to no hot water   I messaged and texted the host at      AM  and again later in the morning  I didnt here back until about      PM    he had  put in a request with maintenance    Follow up text was not answered until after we came back from a day of work to no hot water  SO that meant cold showers  again  All the hosts replies started with  Sorry for the delayed response       We found the poorly labeled fuse box and threw fuses until the hot water heater reset  I messaged the host  he responded late  again and still sent a guy out the following evening       hour response time for a hot water outage  which would have been two days of cold showers if we didnt take matters into our own hands  The uncertainty that if anything went wrong there would be no to slow response ruined the stay  I imagine if the electronic lock failed we would be on the street for the night 
325721274,the bathroom flooded   times  Water overflowed  Notified the owner said he would send maintenance and when we came back from dinner water was still there and bathroom was not clean  went and got maintenance from the front desk and stayed up till   am cleaning everything  Next morning used it again over flowed and just decided it was time to leave  Told the owner we used the clean towels to make a barricade so water would not flow into the living room asked to send towels in the morning  sent them at   pm next day  Ruined our first night in Chicago  Nice place  just never renovated the bathroom  Asked the maintenance if it was our fault even tho we only used it for number    he replied no the building has this issue 
321912890,First of all  The location was great   metra station and bus stops were really close and Wholefoods as well  The studio was definitely spacious for two  However  it looked like it was cleaned a while ago or the cleaner took very little time to clean the place  When we lifted up the comforter  there were little strands of hair everywhere on the sheet and some pillows smelled like somebody had just slept on it  I asked for extra sheets and Chris was kind enough to tell me that there were extra in the closet but majority of them were stained and not clean  Before you actually lie on the bed  check your beddings guys  The bathroom was clean but there were some used toiletries left behind  The check in and check out process was super easy and great  All the beddings including the extra one in the closet had either stains or hair on them  We had to sleep on top of the comforter with the towels covered  I really think you should tell the cleaners to pay attention to those  Also  I caught small roaches three days in a row  two coming from the stove and one coming from the bathroom   Food particles in the sink were there and we definitely didnt want to see that 
626334904,This unit was not as clean as i expected it to be and it seems like the AC was broken the unit never dropped below     The location was great and the beds were comfy but i would think twice before staying here again  The unit was not clean once we got there  The dishwasher was full of dishes that we didnt realize until the last day at the unit  We cleaned the kitchen counter that was covered in dirt and dust  The carpet in the living room looks like it hasnt been vacuumed in a while its full of hair and lent  The unit was also hot the ac never dropped below    the entire time we were here  I did appreciate beds which were comfy and the bedrooms seemed nice but the rest was a bit unexpected 
314476668,Place is ok for the value  No central Air so it got a but warm at night  Overall a good stay 
307070936,The good  an extraordinary location  Clean  good quality linens  Good number of towels  Super easy check in and arrival instruction  and quick response to questions  The bad  both the buildings common areas and the apartment itself where lacking a thorough cleaning  dusting   sweeping  vacuuming   At times there is even a perceptible tobacco smell within the apartment  The couch was super dusty  These are easily corrected faults that would have improved our perception enormously   Hi  The apartment is in an outstanding location  However our overall experience was affected by the overwhelming amount of dust on the floors  the couch  and the either old or very dirty carpet  Also  you are missing basic amenities like coffee filters  Definitely would improve the experience with a grater focus on the guest and its user experience  La percepci n de calidad baj  enormemente por el polvo que encontramos en todo el departamento 
303132949,It was overall decent but not worth the price we paid for this during the weekend   While the stay was nice  it wasnt worth spending      a night here  I felt ripped off 
300652200,A day before check in  Chris sent me a note which said he would tell me how to check into the unit after I       respond with a quick confirmation that you understand not to mention youre an Airbnb guest      FYI in case that bothers you   Not sure if you care  but this really isnt up to the standard I expect for airbnb  For example  the linens shouldnt have any stains  Also  about half of the drawers in the unit werent attached to rails and the bathroom  
299236094,My husband grew up in Hyde Park and his parents lived a block from this AirBnB for    years  so we are very familiar with the neighborhood  On the positive side  this is a small building located in the middle of a quiet tree lined street  The apartment faces the rear   a quiet  private open yard  This apartment is an easy walk to the University of Chicago  its two fantastic bookstores  and to two of our favorite restaurants   the Nile  with superb Middle East food is a block a away  Corea Cafe has homemade Korean food on   th and is always popular  There is also a large grocery store and many other cafes and coffee spots to stock the refrigerator very close by  The unit itself was very clean  airy  and appealing studio with a dining alcove facing the rear garden area  a full kitchen  plus a very large walk in closet  On the negative side  besides difficulties getting checked into the property  due to the prior guests late departure  we discovered two major quirks  We arrived on a hot day and found the window unit was running  keeping the place cool  The apartment has a large flat screen TV on a wall near the bed  After much confusion  we eventually discovered that the outlets used to plug in the air conditioner  the television and bedside lamp were only live when you turned on a wall switch in the kitchen alcove that also turned on the overhead lights in the kitchen  If we wanted the kitchen lights off  we basically were shutting off the power to the the air conditioner  the TV and the ability to light the bedside lamp or charge our phones  Another wall switch by the door worked in a similar way  There was no welcome materials provided to help guests navigate these peculiarities and we finally gave up and opened the windows  We soon realized there is a fire station a block a way with sirens blaring for much of Saturday night  The tenant above could be heard moving about and getting and out of bed  Airplanes also seemed to be flying by frequently  We realize all of this is out of the control of the host  and others may not be as bothered as we  In the bathroom  the shower pressure was adequate but the sink had two thin streams of water that ran from hot to tepid  We stayed two nights and check out is    am  At   am  loud banging and drilling began in a nearby apartment and the water to the entire building was shut off   a tenant with whom we spoke that any units are being renovated and water shut offs are not infrequent  Luckily we had showered and packed  but were not able to flush the toilet before leaving at   am  The only written info to welcome guests to the unit was a chalkboard in the kitchen with the WIFI and password written in chalk  Someone had rubbed off the    Improved communication would have helped overcome a variety of issues with our stay going and coming that would have at least prepared us for inconveniences  some of which were out of the hosts control  and some of which should be part of orienting the guest to what to expect   Flew to Chicago and waited for an hour and a half with our luggage in a public park until our room was available for check in   Arrived at the property at      pm and found no key in the lock box   After contacting Zen City  they called  back to inform us that the prior guests had misunderstood and thought they had booked for two nights  not one   At       the cleaning person came to the entryway with the room key and told us the guests had left shortly before   We ultimately got up to the room at     pm  Numerous issues were not described to the guest in advance   Lovely quiet tree lined street  near to many amenities  but also a block and a half from a busy firehouse   
298777247,Quiet neighborhood  Never returned my call about the tub 
297881275,Overall   the place was nice    Previous reviews mentioned noisy neighbors  which was the case  but thats not on the owner by any means  The neighbors were also smoking weed all through the night with the smell creeping into the bedroom  Again  thats not on the owner   There was quite a bit of hair on the bathroom and kitchen floors which made it seem as if there was zero vacuuming before our arrival   Bring a sleep mask  Theres a bright light outside of the bedroom window and the window curtain is piece of paper thin and white as a ghost  Some blackout curtains need to be installed if you want a quality night of sleep   The above issues arent a huge deal at the end of the day  The big issue was when my girlfriend came back in the middle of the day and found phone chargers on the kitchen table which were not there when we arrived the previous night  Im assuming the owner came to drop them off while we were not there  Im not sure what Air B Bs rule is for owners coming to the place during a customers stay  but thats screwed up  in my opinion  For one  I had my laptop and a few hundred dollars in cash in my bag  Two  my girlfriend had been in the shower at one point  so they could of knocked and just came in when she was in there    And no  I was not previously informed that he she would be stopping by  
292702382,Suite was nicely equipped with all the stuff youd need for a short stay  Cookware the landlord provided is of surprisingly good quality  However  we found the bathtub was clogged when we arrived  Landlord wasnt able to provide us with any help on a timely manner except for saying no one in his team was available to take a look  I had to walk to Target in the middle of the night to buy Drano  After a couple hours of trying different things we managed to fix it ourselves   and that left me not much time to sleep before my poster presentation  God  such a nightmare  Landlord refunded me for the Drano  But at one point we felt like we were there to be his cleaning staff and he didnt even pay for our labour and time  Didnt argue further  I am just trying to forget the sewage back flow and the ball of hair and filth we pulled out from the sewer  Oh god   
623563734,Rooftop was closed  Fireplace didnt function  Oven smelled really weird when cooking  no screens on windows  no TV in bedroom  Hot water was so low couldnt fill the tub  Two bathrooms was cool especially the larger shower  Really roomy  nice washer and dryer  cool view  air mattress was convenient Rooftop was closed  Fireplace didnt function  Oven smelled really weird when cooking  no screens on windows  no TV in bedroom  Hot water was so low couldnt fill the tub  Two bathrooms was cool especially the larger shower  Really roomy  nice washer and dryer 
642252246,Great place and location  had a hard time getting host to reply back
176252921,Chris was a good host except for the fact that he made us feel uncomfortable by not letting us mention air bnb  During our stay there was a pretty serious incident  The occupant of the condo right next to us died the night before we checked in  I have reason to believe it was a suicide  murder due to the fact that there were several detectives and police walking around the scene for days afterward  The whole hallway turned into a crime scene  The detectives waned to know the owners name and thats when I had to text Chris to find his information  He was slow to respond which wasnt great especially when we were talking to a detective  He eventually gave us his information but he was still very adamant about us not Mentioning that it was air bnb  That made me nervous because it really seemed like he was trying to hide something  Other than that the whole trip was pretty good  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable 
625136906,Apartment is in a good area  some issues with cleanliness  but other than that it was a nice weekend away just clean better especially during a pandemic  nobody wants to walk in to a place that is supposed to be covid free and see hand prints and stains from previous guest  It being clean 
647044136,Poor management and planning  will not be rebooking  Thank you for accommodating last minute but this trip was not what was planned  I dont understand why you would have booked another person in our listing when the one we ended up in was available    suuuuper disappointing  the loft was literally the only reason we booked 
673480983,Apartment was in a wonderful location with lots do to  sight see and eatieries   The check in process was seamless   The host was slow to respond to messages   Initially there were not enough towels for   guests however eventually they did have someone bring extra towels   The apartment was dirty   It was not cleaned well  there was socks left behind the bed  the kitchen floor had a spillage of some sort and was not cleaned well   The bathroom door had a huge hole on siding and wouldnt allow the bathroom door to close for privacy   Someone spilled a soda in the living room on ceiling mantle and was not cleaned but left there   We cleaned it because we were tired of looking at it   The kitchen has a bad leak underneath the sink that left a lingering odor   The paper towels that were left were soaking wet from the leak and could not be used   Washing machine has mold growing in the traps   Dust  old empty water bottles left under the beds   The bedroom towards back of apt leg stands to bed were broken when we arrived and shoved under the bed frame   The details of the cleaning were missed and you could tell   The apartment is lovely and has a beautiful layout however paying       for a few nights stay definitely should have been cleaned with adequate supplies   I sent in pictures as soon as we entered   The host was slow to respond   I was told someone would call me to discuss concerns but no one ever called or contacted me  No one ever called me when I requested someone call to discuss extra towels linen and dirtiness of apartment A clean apartment
627999096,Great area to explore Chiraq   I loved the location and view  Bring your own towels and toiletries  And also some lycol to be sure that its properly disinfected  Should air out before each visit   Placed smelled of cigar 
613725066,Its a cute little place  But just read all the reviews and take their instructions with a grain of salt  Dont wait until the day of to try and figure stuff out  because they will not call you unless you beg them  The place is in a great location and is mostly clean  Hopefully you take my review and make improvements  Its a great little place and most of the issues I had were with the service I received  Their check in process was really bad  They told me that parking wasnt good and to use an app to find a lot  They said it would be a lot less expensive than paying at the lot  So  I did what they said  The closes lot I could find was a half mile from the apartment  I paid     for    hours  When I got to the lot  I found out that I could have paid     if I had just pain when I got there  While walking over a half a mile to the Bnb  I saw about   different places closer by that I could have parked at for free or low cost  So they lost me money there  See more check in issues I had under  communication   When I got there  they told me to enter the room number on the call box to get let in  Small thing  but theres a  ring  button your supposed to press after you do that  Someone was nice enough to let me in  and I found out I needed a key FAB to access the elevator  And the key FAB was in the BnB  Now  what the host didnt tell me in their instructions was that if I had pressed the  ring  button on the call box  it would have given me a minute window for the elevator to work  But since they didnt tell me that  I tried messaging and calling them  I was sitting in the lobby with groceries getting warm and waiting on them to call back  About    minutes later they returned my message asking for more info  even though I had asked for them to call me  I asked again for them to call me  and they continued trying to communicate with me via messages  Even though I told them I was waiting in the lobby after walking a half of a mile with groceries gettting warm  Finally  the building manager helped me out and let me up the elevator  The rep from the BnB finally called me over a half hour later  Terrible communication on their end 
603234505,When my family and I arrived  the thermostat in the apartment read    degrees    it was only    outside in Chicago  I tried contacting via message and     hour  support  The apartment hadnt been recently cleaned and it seemed as if no one had stepped foot in it for a while  I left   voice messages with no reply  I chatted with one person back and forth about that and issues with the cleanliness of the apartment and after about    minutes  she stopped responding to my messages after telling me theyd try to find building maintenance but couldnt guarantee because it was a Friday   I finally had to contact Airbnb directly who actually talked to the host  as he ignored my messages and calls  and was told that he couldnt handle it as it was a Friday night  At this point  it was almost midnight and no other property could be booked   Due to the frigid temperatures  there was no way we could stay and were forced to find a hotel    which most were booked for the evening  Communication is key  The lack of responsiveness via message and phone was frustrating  Also  checking location before guests arrive would have solve the problems experienced 
586366342,Please make better efforts when it comes to cleaning the room  We had a dirty towel  bed sheets had stains  bar stools were beyond filthy  both bathroom showers were dirty and had smashed gnats on the ceiling  The bed in back bedroom is just about broke  blinds didnt work at all  None of us were able to successfully connect to the WiFi  The entry way when first walking in was a disaster  Looked like it hasnt been swept in months  Mail and newspaper laid in the walkway  Stains all on the walls and bathroom doors  We went to cook and utensils hadnt been washed  The picture are a bit misleading when it come to the cleanliness of the the place  Please make better efforts when it comes to cleaning the room  We had a dirty towel  bed sheets had stains  bar stools were beyond filthy  both bathroom showers were dirty and had smashed gnats on the ceiling  The bed in back bedroom is just about broke  blinds didnt work at all  None of us were able to successfully connect to the WiFi  The entry way when first walking in was a disaster  Looked like it hasnt been swept in months  Mail and newspaper laid in the walkway  Stains all on the walls and bathroom doors  We went to cook and utensils hadnt been washed  The picture are a bit misleading when it come to the cleanliness of the the place  No place to park  Better efforts on cleaning and designated parking spot 
621459158,Photos looked a little nicer but it was still a decent stay for us 
627334983,Terrible stay 
626137343,Cute place  Quiet  Safe feeling 
644310046,X Terrible check in  No doorman       Had to call maintenance  person in Chicago  didnt respond for more than one hour   Had to wait for pseudo doorman to unlock main door  Also  when I requested an extra day no one communicated the code  had changed   Seems like amateurs in action   No apologies or refunds from anyone 
628506469,Cute apartment  well located  Host was very accommodating of my last min booking  Although  upon entering the room was extremely hot as it was very warm in Chicago  The windows in the room does not work so i was unable to get air  However  someone came to fix the air conditioning but you dont have control of how high or low so some days the room becomes very warm  Worst if you take warm showers    The kitchen could have had more essential items  Paper towel  and etc and the building could be a little more cleaner   Overall  it was a good stay  Very safe area  And cozy apartment  Perfect apartment for someone who is coming to Chicago last min and need a very comfortable place to stay or for a couple or solo traveler 
618786773,The apartment is clean and as advertised however several of the towels had stains and were not clean  We requested new towels and received them later in the day  Also the WiFi did not work as advertised  The network wasnt showing up at all  Other than that it was a nice place to stay and the neighbors werent loud or anything 
626829198,I was really excited to go to this place  considering they boasted  meticulous cleaning standards   especially with current events such as COVID     However  I was really upset that many areas had cleanliness issues  The rug in the living room had what appeared to be hair balls  dusty curtains  and an overall surface level grime  It was particularly egregious in the bedrooms  where the A C units were covered in dust  and when we turned them on it triggered our allergies  I was not okay with the host coming in during the middle of our stay without telling us  regardless of the reason  Although the apartment has a great location  it is not soundproofed at all  especially given the location  and its an old building  You can expect to hear ambulance sirens all day  as its next to multiple hospitals  and you can clearly hear cars driving by despite being   floors above the street  Overall  it would have been five stars  if it werent for the entering without permission  and the cleanliness issues  I was not okay with the host coming in during the middle of our stay without telling us  regardless of the reason  they dropped off some sheets which we didnt ask for   Although the apartment has a great location  it is not soundproofed at all  especially given the location and the fact that its an old building  Ambulance sirens all day  as its next to multiple hospitals  and you can clearly hear cars driving by despite being   floors above the street  It would be five stars if it werent for the entering without permission  and cleanliness issues 
333775867,Average place  No response to one of my questions  All other communications were fine but seemed like an intentional avoidance 
640083008,Do NOT stay here  Do not support Zencity  Absolutely the worst experience  Dirty furniture  dirty pillows  reeked of smoke and alcohol  there was cigerette burns  carpet stains  worse yet extremely dirty hand prints and gross muck over all the handles and doorknobs  Dirty mop water left in toliet  Worst yet  there was a red fluid smeared all over the place  on furniture and the drapes   absoluely disgusting  This all started with them giving me a   hour delay on my checkin  then when i finally get the room  it was a horror show  I called and asked for a different room and asked them to come to room to see the issues  They said they were all booked and couldnt help me  i said i would stay at friends and they would send a really good cleaning crew and would fix the room in the morning  I came back to the room the next day at  pm and they didnt send anyone  Room was the exact same  So i called to get a refund and they would not answer my calls or texts  They do not care about their guests health  If you are at all worried about Covid do not stay here  They are taking no measures for guests  You treated me completely terrible and with total disregard  i am literally traumatized by my experience   Literally zero compassion or care for your guests health or well being   From the two hour late checkin  to the completely disgusting room  and then you promised me to clean room and lied and never sent anyone to fix  Then act like you doing me a favor by giving me    dollars  The absolute worst host ive ever seen  Im not done with this    Showed up and place was not ready  Had to wait in lobby as they  cleaned  the place   Finally got my room at    So a two hour late check in  and then the room was disgusting You like your health  Dont stay here  They are not a responsible host   Btw Airbnb was completely unhelpful    hour wait times on phone  Keep moving me to different responders  Supposed to be contacted and moved to another place as part of their guarantee and they never responded back 
617058106,So  the place is great  It is at a great location and the apartment itself is gorgeous  Unfortunately we ran into the AC  Heater unit not working  During our whole stay  we were told that someone was going to fix it and it never happened  It was not until we were literally walking out that someone was there to fix the problem  KC was cold      F cold  so the heater was definitely needed   I cant say the experience was horrible  but definitely expected better for the price that we paid  When facing issues  they would take a long time to reply 
661158798,DO NOT STAY HERE  UNSAFE   The door to my Airbnb automatically locked when the door closed  The door code was on my Airbnb app  I walked out the side of my room and the door closed behind me  My cell phone was inside  Luckily I had my wallet with my ID  So I thought Id be fine  I was wrong  I went to the lobby of the apartment building and used the phone in there  I didnt have any numbers so I called the number listed on the door of the building  I was basically told that they could not help me  They wouldnt look up the number to a locksmith for me  I called them a total of four times begging for help  I told them I have my ID and everything  They refused again and again  They told a single woman at      in the morning to walk the street and figure it out basically    It was appalling to me to hear someone tell a young woman to do that  This is totally unacceptable  If youre going to have an automatic locking device you should know that theres a chance someone can get locked out of that without the code  You should have a procedure in place  Im contacting my attorney  I suffer from PTSD and Im so shaken up  I was put in a dangerous situation due to negligence and I am very upset  We were locked out of our Airbnb at around   PM  with no cell phones because of keypad entry and auto locking device    We could not log into airbnb due to security features    I used the phone in the apartment buildings lobby  We had no numbers because our phones were locked in the room    I called the buildings number listed on the door  I was told that they could not get in touch with the Airbnb host  They could not help me get into my Airbnb  They could not log in to any electronic devices on my behalf  They refused to look up the number to a locksmith  They told me that I would need to find a phone to use  So I was basically told to wander around Kansas City Missouri at night as a single woman  I was terrified  My safety was totally put at risk  I was downtown  I was lost    I suffer from ptsd and I was so shaken up  I didnt know who to ask to use a cell phone    I couldnt get into my Airbnb for five hours  I was on the street until close to   or   AM  I was unsafe 
653226917,I like staying at Zencity locations  Hello Zencity  I often stay at your places and enjoy them  However this experience was not very pleasant  Had a maintenance person bang on the door to fix the AC and after washing cloths the dryer did not work had to travel with wet cloths as we were relying on that amenity  Was also disappointed that we were not offered any compensation for the bad experience  I still plan t stay at Zencity places note this location needs some improvement  All the best  Vernon Lockhart
643949008,BEWARE     the apartment I was in had DAMAGE already in several areas   Closet doorknob broken off and lying on the floor  golf ball size hole in the bottom of the bedroom door  hole scratch in closet door  etc etc    I luckily had the forethought to take pictures of all of the scratches and holes in doors when I arrived  They tried to charge me      for a broken doorknob and a scratch on the front door  that one I hadnt seen  In total there was about   things damaged in the apartment  So they completely picked and chose which damages to charge me for amd which to ignore completely    I have a feeling they charge people for damage that they never end up fixing    and thats how they make money  Its disgusting  I will be fighting this issue  I rejected the request for money and had heard nothing from them since after I yelled at whoever was on the phone  So we will see  Its sad because the apartment and the view was gorgeous  But I WILL NOT be renting from them ever again  They have several apartments they rent out  BEWARE OF ZENCITY 
648999479,A dirty ass place Get a new cleaning crew Didnt call Get a new cleaning crew
620677498,When we arrived we were initially thrilled with the place and the location  Then we discovered that all of the dishes were dirty and worse  the kitchen sink was irreparably clogged  While Zencity did promptly send someone out  when they could not fix the sink Zencity did not immediately offer to move us to another of their many properties  When  we asked to move we were told there would be an additional charge which we refused  finally they offered to move us without an additional charge  We would like to note that Ava and Marty  Zencitys customer service  were very responsive and helpful but seemed hampered by whatever policies were in place  This would have been an ideal place if the sink had worked  Ava   Marty were terrific  Zencitys policies or procedures were really problematic   we were very disappointed that the sink situation had not been noticed  before we checked in and was not quickly fixed  Or another solution would have been to immediately offer us an equivalent place to move to with no additional fee  Instead we had to spend   nights in a very problematic situation and do a lot of negotiating  We did finally get moved to another place at no extra charge but only after a lot of back and forth  And really Zencity should have refunded us some of our overall charge   Thanks again to Marty   Ava  When we identified the problems Zencity
626665733,Amazing place and very respectful host  The walls  are very thin and i didnt understand why i was told to turn the music down then i learned it was a group down the hall  I loved the place and area  Thank you for the amazing stay
623662914,Good value Unfortunately disappointed with the way the place was cleaned  If Im honest with you I dont think anyone had cleaned it prior to us coming  It looked like no one had stayed for a while and dust had built up on the covers and furniture  Then to top it off your covers have blood stains on them as well  There were no paper towels either in the kitchen  The dryer and washer never turned on 
646694542,Very unresponsive  definitely would book elsewhere if your not wanting to stress over your room on vacation at all 
702373691,Check in was extremely difficult and frustrating and you have to pay for a parking space so be sure to bring an extra      just for parking through the night during your stay  Other than these things it was a nice space  very clean  and quiet most of the time  We would stay again if the parking policies were to change  The instructions to check into the building are very unclear and its extremely difficult  We waited outside    minutes in the cold just trying to get into the building  Other than that the stay was nice and we would stay again  Parking was extremely difficult to find  We had to pay for expensive parking for every night we were there  We found it very difficult to get inside of the building  We were given a code that didnt work  The bath tub leaked a bunch of water  Other residents of the building were very loud at some times  Other than that our stay was very pleasant and relaxing 
627028611,The location itself is not bad but I felt that the responses and the services in the apartment such as wifi were subpar  I had many days where I would lose wifi connection for hours at a time  I even had water issues in the kitchen and had to resolve that myself  Otherwise the location itself is not that bad I appreciated the stay at this place  however There were times where I would not receive call backs when there were issues with WiFi on many instances which interfered with the purpose of my visit work  Secondly I believe there should be a maintenance check before any of the guests arrive because for one full day I did not have running water in the kitchen and I had to coordinate myself with the building to get it fixed when I had asked for assistance from zencity  Thank you and take care 
706471786,Great apartment if you dont mind getting whatever they give you  Did not get the original apartment I booked and didnt learn about it until the night before my stay  Was told that rest assured  the new pictures and description were accurate and what I would get  That wasnt true either  I wasnt given the apartment I had originally booked  The night before my stay  the pictures updated to a completely different apartment  It was explained that it was a new listing and the new photos hadnt updated  but rest assured the new photos and description were accurate  That wasnt true either  The apartment I booked  with the updated pictures  had two bathrooms  The apartment I got had one  The apartment was very nice  It was not was I was expecting or told I was getting  even after the first mishap  That was certainly frustrating 
626438353,Not worth money at all  Flies were everywhere and internet didnt work so we were unable to use TV and game systems we brought  Flies were everywhere  Internet didnt work so we were unable to use tv  The kitchen sink had a smell to it  Other than that a decent place 
621604336,This apartment is sufficient for two guest the most  as there is not a comfortable place to sit for more than two people in the living room  The chair in the living room was extremely uncomfortable  and the couch only sat two uncomfortably  Also  the amount of dinnerware and utensils is was insufficient for the amount of bedrooms  There were three plates available for use and only   forks  We constantly needed to wash the forks to re use them  Thank you so much for an accommodating spot for us to stay  However  we would like to request our cleaning fee be refunded  as the apartment was far from clean when we arrived  During this coronavirus climate  this was very unsettling for us  Cleanliness description is in review  Broken glass on the living room rug  stains on the ceiling above bed  etc  Also  the bathroom door was falling off its hinge  making it nearly impossible to close  The French press coffee maker also fell apart in my hands  I am not usually one to leave a bad review  but the conditions of this apartment were unacceptable  especially when such a high cleaning fee is charged  We would have liked to have cleaner surroundings  as we pay a hefty cleaning fee along with this rental 
722199816,WORST Airbnb experience EVER  Awful instructions and NO PARKING  We were locked out for HOURS because our key fob did not allow us access  We made it in with help of apartment tenants  The individuals working this scheme dump were fairly quick at responding but not at all helpful  The place itself was NOT cleaned and smelled like CIGARETTE smoke  The sinks in the bathroom as well as the shower had HAIR in it  Plus the couches and lounge chairs also had a horrible smell and significant amount of hair in it  The worst part was the BED  There is no way ANY person on earth would find this mattress comfortable  We felt as though we were sleeping on a wood plank  We were both afraid to make any quick movements in fear we would break a bone or paralyze ourselves  VERY LOUD ambulances all evening long  We were supposed to stay   nights and ended up leaving in the middle of the night to get a hotel nearby  Locked out of building for HOURS Somewhat quick responses Awful parking options
722017187,Maybe it was an off weekend for them but there was no towels in the apartment  The bathroom still had hair in the shower from last tenant and hair in the corners of the bathroom  It was unclean  Difficult to check in  More difficult than most Ive dealt with 
665497134,This property is gorgeous    just dont look too close   The  clean  dishes were dirty  the bathrooms were dirty  the carpets were not vacuumed  The door lock bolt was somewhat suspicious and hard to maneuver  I didnt feel safe that someone couldnt possibly get into the door  Unfortunately  anything you want to watch on the tv has a child lock  so good luck   This is decorated well  has beautiful views and is in a great location  You will get what you pay for and the price is on point  Tolerable  but definitely could be improved  especially after reading the previous reviews which state the same things that I encountered 
630386519,good

619055091,I am extremely disappointed in your unwillingness to refund        for Sunday nights stay  There is enough stress traveling during these uncertain times and your uncompassionate decision not to refund us made things ever more difficult  Our pre existing conditions  asthma and COPD  make us vulnerable to Covis     our decision to leave and get home as soon as possible was mandatory  Id never consider staying at your place again  nor will I recommend you as hosts to others  An entire disappointment  I am extremely disappointed in your unwillingness to refund        for Sunday nights stay  There is enough stress traveling during these uncertain times and your uncompassionate decision not to refund us makes things ever more difficult  Our pre existing conditions  asthma and COPD  make us vulnerable to Covis     our decision to leave and get home as soon as possible was mandatory  Id never consider staying at your place again  nor will I recommend you as hosts to others 
618832092,Fun location in the city with fun bars and great restaurants  Only concern that we came across was the pictures of the unit not matching the unit itself  Was extremely disappointing as we expected one thing to only receive another  Nonetheless  we had a good time  Fun location in downtown that lead to a good time  The only concern was expecting one thing as we looked off of the only thing we could  which was the pictures of the unit  and then to get there to receive something totally different was disappointing  As I stated though  fun location and instructions on access to unit was clear  The unit was much smaller than expected  while the biggest concern and frustration was the unit not matching any of the pictures present on the Airbnb site 
628642493,Great Hyde park location Very nice place  great location  Too bad about the setbacks Key wasnt there and we were given a runaround trying to get in before given a different code to get in Shower didnt work  and no drain stop for the tub   We were told it would be addressed  but no one showed up until check out time  Tried to call repeatedly and got through sometimes and were told someone would come and fix it  Didnt happen Key where it was supposed to be   And working shower 
617685480,This unit is located in one of the coolest neighborhoods in the country  Me and my children were very comfortable in this spacious   bedroom duplex  Hands down a great experience in a perfect location for any of the festivals in Pilsen  A must stay  I loved the location and cleanliness of the unit  My children and I were very comfortable there  The difficulty getting a response and the incorrect codes for the digital lock were extremely inconvenient and embarrassing  Your location is ideal  especially for the spring and summer festivals in Pilsen  My best wishes   Thanks for hosting us   Maria Lockbox was difficult opening  digital lock was the wrong passcode and host took a long time to respond with correct code
706262267,Overall  On a positive note  the house was a historic house with cool and modern touches  I love the interior decorations and mods done    Two things that werent transparent about      stairs being so narrow and also creaking with every step even though each of us weighed     or less lbs     Washer dryer in an unfinished basement   we didnt end up using because of how it looked after opening the door    I heard random sounds at night  possibly from attic   that woke me up while sleeping  The lights on stairs flickering and not dimming down properly was a bit creepy to add to the sounds  Overall  there was no issues if We just ignored these things  Maybe we are just not into older historic homes and that could be our personal issue   Another thing that bothered us is the tub  but again I believe it was in the pictures so we knew what we were getting into  Not a big fan of using the wide claw tub though the look is super stylish   getting in and out is difficult and not comfortable to use with all the curtains sticking onto us while showering   Not trying to defame the place by any means but I want others to know what they are getting into  Surprised there were not many comments mentioning any of these  See comments in Value criteria feedback Two things that werent transparent about      stairs being so narrow and also creaking with every step even though each of us weighed     or less lbs     Washer dryer in an unfinished basement   we didnt end up using because of how it looked after opening the door    I heard random sounds at night  possibly from attic   that woke me up while sleeping  The lights on stairs flickering and not dimming down properly was a bit creepy to add to the sounds  Overall  there was no issues if We just ignored these things  Maybe we are just not into older historic homes and that could be our personal issue   Another thing that bothered us is the tub  but again I believe it was in the pictures so we knew what we were getting into  Not a big fan of using the wide claw tub   getting in and out is difficult and not comfortable to use with all the curtains sticking onto us
287858017,Meh
622143655,Police calls and lying neighbors Neighbors didnt call police on no one outside none of my stay while they sat out smoking whatever they had that was horrible for what I paid for  Neighbors call the police  I stepped outside for my little brother to smoke a cigarette hes a military vet and his wife  However I stepped outside sat on the hood of my car did not make any noise some neighbor called police  no one walked past us no one came up to us to ask questions  however the police parked on the wrong side of the street with his high beams on us  We sat till he was done smoking his cigarette  went back in ate dinner he left  I received a call from the host stating a neighbor called police and him saying we were loud and smoking pot in the neighborhood garden   But police passed right by us  The temperature in the house is locked at       degrees    There is no smoking allowed however thee apartment building its self smelt like pot everyday  The walls are paper then I heard the neighbors entire conversation upstairs  I wanted to extend but my God after the first day incident I was afraid to even go outside for fresh air         but get this I told my little brother we could smoke outside because this is non smoking thinking it was ok because I seen other people from the time I checked in  pm  stayed inside   min to the time I actually came back in to sit and cook  about   maybe  pm  people were outside just puffing away no problem  I drive for Instacart just moved back from ATL Ga  If neighbors will do horrible things like call police on guest for no reason there should b smoking allowed inside 
622515880,Make sure you take pictures of the place before you stay they will blame you for existing damage
648948425,Good location  slow response time 
622312330,This place had some maintenance issues and did not appear to have been thoroughly cleaned prior to my stay  I rated it   stars for that reason  Otherwise  the location is good and it is neatly decorated and a good alternative to a hotel room if youd like a full kitchen  Code for exterior door did not work  I had to wait for someone to let me in  Once I had the key fob from the apartment  I was able to get in and out ok  Sent message about clogged disposal and received no response 
622741752,Never again Horrible  Worst experience ever  My car and purse was stolen and I tried having a different card billed and they just couldnt get it correct for the life of them
631206426,The loft was beautiful but I did have trouble controlling the A C and also with the front door lock that wouldnt work  The loft was beautiful but I did have trouble controlling the A C and also with the front door lock that wouldnt work 
622376002,The building is beautiful and very conveniently located 
631305704,The internet speed was below     Mbps and I wasnt able to work from this location or even stream Netflix  The rug in the main living room needed to be vacuumed pretty badly and the comforter in the bedroom had a pretty big brown stain on it  No parking  I just think with what I paid  I would have expected it to be cleaner 
624154378,We have stayed with this host in the past and had minor issues  This time around we were placed in an entirely different unit than pictured  Our headboard was missing  furniture was missing  no table and chairs  etc  The foyer was of the space was gorgeous  however  once we got to our floor it smelled like cat litter and the floor was dirty  There is tons of construction that kept us up into the wee hours  This was not a pleasant experience  The unit assigned was not the one pictured  It was mid update  no headboard  no accent furniture pictured  entirely different 
673678395,We arrived at the unit about    mins before  pm so I messaged the host to see if we could check in early  We didnt get a response so we waited in the car until the  pm check in time  We went up to the unit  through a very dirty building and elevator   we arrived to the unit and followed the checkin instructions for the keypad  It didnt work  We tried multiple times and the door alarm started going off  because of too many failed attempts Im assuming   I messaged zencity to see what was going on and we waited again  No response  so I called to see how we get in    while on hold we tried the door a couple more times and it finally allowed us in  We finally got a callback from a zencity representative    mins after my initial message about the entry issues    The first thing we noticed on entry is that there are no locks on the doors other than the keypad lock  There werent even handle locks on the main or patio door  That didnt make us feel very safe  When zencity finally contacted me about the entry issues I asked them about the sofa bed  we were under the impression the sofa was a bed as well  as there were two of us traveling and a need for two sleeping accommodations   The rep said to remove the cushions from the couch and the area creates enough room for someone to sleep  I told him a small child could not even fit on the couch comfortably as it was maybe only   feet long  Then I was informed that the unit we booked was the smaller couch unit and wouldnt work  So that was disappointing   Of course one thing piles on top of another at this point and we started noticing the cleanliness issues in the unit  We expected more cleaning practices since COVID   has created higher cleaning standards  The floorboards had dust build up  which meant they hadnt been touched in some time  There were fingerprint smudges on the mirror and glass door to the patio  The bathroom sink had soap residue as if the the dispenser was recently used  the toilet had stains and residue on the outside of the toilet and the inside rim  and there was dirt buildup in the corners  The walkthrough closet between the main area and bathroom had a broken table chair  which means our table only had one chair  and several other items stacked up in the space  Upon our discovery of the cleanliness issues on top of the lack of locks and sofa bed issue  we decided the place was not fit for us to stay as health and safety standards were not appeasing  Upon speaking with the host  and escalating it to Airbnb for support because the host refused issues  about the issues  cancellation  and possible refunds because we even had picture evidence of our issues    the host only agreed to refund half of   night of a   night stay and Airbnb was able to get them to agree to refund the cleaning fee   The building itself is    blocks from downtown  so it is not  close  to the touristy areas of the arch  Busch stadium  or the river and the neighborhoods between are not the best to walk  especially at night  We had asked prior to our arrival about dining places around the area as we are avid foodies and so we could get a better feel for the area  but there was never a response to that message  Im assuming because the host is not actually onsite or possibly not even located in St Louis  they are an offsite property management company  If you do stay here  Id recommend you drive or use a rideshare to get downtown safely as there were no dining options in the direct vicinity of the building  Which had we known prior to arriving  by means of getting a response about the dining options  which we never got  we wouldve cancelled well before arrival and zencity wouldve been required by their own cancellation policy to refund us more than     for   nights   Overall  I would not recommend this or any Zencity unit to anyone  as the cleanliness and safety standards were less than needed to be and the lack of communication  guest service  and resolve were unacceptable  We arrived at the unit    minutes early so we waited in the car until  pm  We went to the unit at     pm and the code did not work  We tried it multiple times and it still did not worked  and locked out the system to where an alarm started going off  I messaged zencity to let them know the issues  they called    mins later   While we were waiting for a response from Zencity I also decided to call them and see if that was faster than the emails  Was on hold and we kept trying the door  It finally allowed us entry after a couple more tries and I hung up from being on hold 
625681617,Construction worker attempted to enter my Airbnb  Im a small woman and while staying here a construction worker tried to enter the Unit  I called hello and he ignored me and tried the lock again  I had to get up and run to lock it   He continues to ignore me while I scream hello and tries again  Finally he walks away talking to a colleague   Simply terrifying   I also had no WiFi for the majority of my stay  Wrong password was given to me  then once it was found  it was shut off   I had to pay for hotspot on my phone because I had to work still  CONSTRUCTION at  AM TILL  PM DIRECTLY ABOVE MY UNIT    The space itself was beautiful  Couldve been cleaned a bit more  Such a shame  Was looking forward to escaping for a relaxing few days  Instead was meet with more terror and frustration  The WiFi password was wrong for the first days  Then I got the right one only to have it shut off    The construction worker not only attempting to enter but IGNORING when I called out hello only to have him try to come in again after HEARING ME INSIDE AND NOT RESPONDING is unacceptable and likely to be a criminal offense    Im a victim of sexual assault and mugging  This was extremely distressing and caused ptsd   ADD A DEADBOLT    No guest SHOULD EVER feel this way  There was no WiFi nearly the entire time  Construction all day in the unit directly above me  Im a small woman alone and a construction worker attempted to enter the air Bnb while I was there   I screamed hello and he imputes the access code to the door  I heard it unlock and I ran to relock it  Terrifying experience  Management provided a     discount for the  brief interruption   it wouldve been perfect if I had internet  wasnt scared to death  or construction    
628497897,The place had not been cleaned since the previous guests   You could tell someone picked up but the carpets were not vacuumed and had god knows what in them  The floors were half swept  the bedding smelled like it had been slept in  The instructions to get in were not clear  You have to hold your hand up to the lock and use the code they send  The AC unit has no physical control unit so it was FREEZING and there was nothing I could do about it  The windows had no screens  Sticky cabinets  I wish it had been cleaned because if so it was honestly a cute place in a quiet neighborhood  During the pandemic  One would think improper cleaning should result in an internal investigation  I honestly do not understand how this place was so dirty  I had no idea how to use the lock I had to google it Cleanliness
642886216,The check in instructions were not completely clear so make sure to touch base with the host before arriving  The location is excellent and the apartment is very nice and updated  We are sorry about the noise complaint  Did not know that the tv sound would carry so far  The apartment is only accessible via two elevators out of the six or seven and you have to scan the fob in order to access it  But this was not communicated prior  When we got to our apartment the door was open  We were not sure whether or not someone else was inside the place upon our arrival  It left us feeling a little vulnerable the whole stay  See the issues listed above 
622740153,Staying here was an alright experience  The first night was rough because it was a domestic violence issue that occurred  Very sad to see  Next was the amount of dust in the place  So dusty that it got into my boyfriends and I  throat  Very disturbing  On top of that  the water was disgustingly filthy  Communication was iffy  Relayed some of the issues and it took  what it seemed  forever for the hosts to respond  Also  the pillows were yellow underneath the pillow covers  If we disregard all those major factors  it was a decent enough stay  Make sure whomever is cleaning does dusting as well  Get clean pillows 
654351635,We had some issues with cell service inside the unit  other than that we had a pretty good stay the area was kinda iffy after dark but we had gated parking which was great we also had no issues checking in and for the price we couldnt beat it the hosts responded quickly with any questions we had wed definitely stay again  Most of the issues we had were out of your control overall it wasnt a bad stay we were grateful for the gated parking and the quick response to any needs we had thank you for being a great host  The area of town was ok until it got dark and then it gives you a very uneasy feeling  We had terrible service I couldnt use my phone in the room 
646382823,  stars  Star     location is great  Lafayette Square is beautiful and convenient  Star     unit itself is also beautiful and bed is very comfy  Star     communication about entry issues were very responsive  No star     previous guest smoked excessively in a non smoking unit  This itself is not ZenCitys fault  but it was an awful smell and Id wish they had been up front about that and offered solutions ahead of time rather than waiting for my complaint and told  maybe open the windows   No star     I paid for non smoking room as an expectation for my own health and comfort  with my prompting for a compensation for this missed expectation and inconvenience  they eventually gave      off   of my   night stays  but a full   star review would be reserved for proactivley addressing rather than a  sorry the last person broke the rules  but nothing we can do about it  approach   The room still smelled awful at my departure  So just a little miss with me  Quick to give me access when the keypad was down  slow to respond to my issues once inside
650234526,It was an okay stay  The location was alright  but when we first checked in we could get up the elevator without the key  so we had to wait    minutes for someone to come with their key  It was nice on the inside but there was a lot of hair in the shower and trash under the bed  Im not sure if I would stay here again just because I dont know how clean the room is  I think there should be a more thorough cleaning of the apartment  There was hair in the shower and trash under the bed  We couldnt get up the elevator the first time without the key If the place would have been cleaned prior to us staying  I would have given a better review
628936807,This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with booking  Upon arrival which was after  PM the entire apartment was filthy  not dirty but filthy  When I reached out to the host  there was no response until  pm regarding the nature of the apartment  By this time a woman arrived at the apartment without knocking  entered the apartment and did not state who she was  It was revealed upon me asking she was the cleaning person for the apartment   arriving   hours later  This is unacceptable with COVID being popular  I even sent pictures to the host showing how dirty the apartment was  I had to wipe down the entire apartment with disinfect wipes and change the sheets myself  The only thing the cleaning lady did was sweep and take the trash out as I had already did her job  Which is something I should have not been compelled to do  The host was not accommodating as I expressed how upset I was  for what I experienced  The response was   well she cleaned it now  No I cleaned it  She just took the trash out  I will NEVER rent here again  Rent at your own risk  If you like piss smell and a filthy environment  this is the place for you  Sometimes reasonable cheap is not worth your comfort 
623300084,  The floor had stuff on the floor when you walk in    Then the bathroom still had hair in the tub
623262240,Would recommend or book Zencity again  Minus the series of unfortunate events  I would recommend 
627087741,I rated this Airbnb a      Although the apartment was beautiful it was NOT the apartment in photos  The Airbnb I stayed in looked NOTHING like these photos  The directions for check in were not correct to enter the building and very vague  I had to wait for someone to leave the building to get inside  The building is also located right next to a fire station which kept my mother up  and no curtains so the street lights shined in all night  If youre used to softer beds this may also not be the place for you since it was very firm  There is also no parking other than street parking  I was told there was an app that I could use to book garage parking  but that app says there is   paid parking anywhere in the area  So unless you go on the weekend your only option is paid street parking    I messaged Zencity for help entering the building and didnt get a response for about an hour  It was very confusing and not convenient  The apartment and area was very beautiful  but the apartment was not what was listed in the photos  It was also located right next to a fire station and the street lights shined very well through the blinds  The directions for parking was incorrect  and check in was VERY complicated  Suggestions I have      Blinds for the bedrooms  Not only does the sun shine in super easy  but so does the street lights  We were not able to sleep due to the fact that even with the lights off it was bright  We definitely couldnt sleep in either      Notice of the fire department  The highway sounds isnt that much of a bother but the sirens definitely was      Trash bags  We found none and had to put stuff in the trash without one      Not the right apartment shown in the photos  That was not the Airbnb I booked      Better directions for check in  The instructions you gave me was no where close to correct  I had to wait for someone else to enter the build so I could get in  I messaged for help but no one responded so we had to wait outside the building  You told me to input  zen  into the pad but it asked for numbers  Even the instructions you gave me to help was vague and didnt work    This is the first time I didnt have a   star experience with an Airbnb    Otherwise we did enjoy our stay  It was the correct location  but was located next to the highway and a fire station  It woke my mother up constantly  Curtains to block out the street lights  trash bags for the trash cans  letting us know that its right next to a fire station  accurate parking notice 
625626459,Place was beautiful but cleanliness was not up to code  also slow responses from the company  But the area was a great spot lots of close restaurants and also a lot of things to do in the area  Just wish the place was cleaner 
624616469,The place was infested with bugs  I reached out to Zencity three times and I was told that a maintenance man would be out  They never sent anyone  Imagine bugs being all over the walls   floors  night stand  and bed  They suggested I use some spray that was there  I did  It did not work  I even asked if they had another Airbnb available  They did not  They offered no compensation    Also the walls are thin  You can hear everything outside your door  I asked for a refund and have not got a response  The bedroom was infested with bugs 
624601311,Great little Space
625415833,Photos didnt match the exact unit we were in  although similar  Door code wouldnt work  elevator required key to access our floor  got routed through automated call center  had to have security escort me up after proving Id rented it
630081885,Great host but did not act instantly when we reported an AC problem One of our acs was not working which made the stay in one room very uncomfortable  Otherwise the location and cleanliness was good 
721524594,I want to preface by saying the room was very comfortable and served the purpose I need it for  However  upon entering the building there was a man smoking crystal meth in the entryway  I cant put this on the property owner but I dont think its a  family friendly  place  I was also yelled at by some random  drunken pedestrians who offered me and my friend cocaine  The room overall was comfortable though but not entirely clean imo  I used some dishes and cleaned them to find a full loaded dishwasher even though the room said it had been cleaned and inspected  The bathroom was pretty clean but the toilet paper holder had an empty roll on it  It was an affordable stay  The room was nice  The area is practical but I wouldnt stay here again given the experience  I want to preface by saying the room was very comfortable and served the purpose I need it for  However  upon entering the building there was a man smoking crystal meth in the entryway  I cant put this on the property owner but I dont think its a  family friendly  place  I was also yelled at by some random  drunken pedestrians who offered me and my friend cocaine  The room overall was comfortable though but not entirely clean imo  I used some dishes and cleaned them to find a full loaded dishwasher even though the room said it had been cleaned and inspected  The bathroom was pretty clean but the toilet paper holder had an empty roll on it  It was an affordable stay  The room was nice  The area is practical but I wouldnt stay here again given the experience 
627858649,Honestly I could see Zencity having really great airbnbs  but I got unlucky  No working lock for three days  massive leaks from dishwasher  maintenance coming in and out  construction going on   asked for towels and got them on the third day  I have nothing but complaints and asked for my money back or help and got no response  Awful  They sent me the wrong key code  AFTER I had to call and ask for it   Then when the lock didnt work the rest of the time it was suggested that I was not typing in the right code  On my third day  or not having a working lock and relying on the doorman to let us in and out of the flat  they said the electric lock is broke  Guess it wasnt my fault after all  Dismal  Response rate slow  closed after  pm  not very professional
671899189,The place wasnt cleaned when I got there  I had to stay in a hotel instead  The host has not refunded me    weeks later  My place wasnt cleaned out at all when I got there  I had to find a hotel at    at night   You promised a refund   weeks ago and I havent gotten one  Please refund me immediately 
624037737,Unit was clean but not sparkling clean and in an area with several homeless wandering and didnt feel safe   While it was cheap and a good value close to downtown I would give this a     out of   overall and we didnt stay our  nd night to just move on      The apartment was not as pictured  different furniture  different layout  it is probably another unit in the building but I was confused why they wouldnt put up exact pictures of the unit   There was also a strong marijuana odor likely coming from other units and both elevators were not working the  nd half of our stay   The stairwell was completely disgusting  as we had to hold our breath to go up from floor   to   as floors     smelled of strong human urine   We left at   oclock on our  nd day there and did not stay the night of       Overall a     stay    
655654047,This place was not as clean as I expected  I had to get clean sheets for the bed and clean the kitchen as countertop was sticky when arrived  The bed was actually unstable uncomfortable and looks as if it will break any moment 
705951268,The bones of this apartment were nice  It has comfortable furniture  was clean  had nice amenities in the kitchen and bathroom and had an awesome location  Unfortunately  I am quite disappointed in the management during my stay  After the first night  I reported an issue with the heater making excessive noise  The responded that they would send someone to check it out  Later in the week  nobody had come to check it yet and it stopped heating all together  I informed the manager again via message and phone call and he said that he would send someone that day to check it but again nobody came  so I had to spend two nights without heat  I will definitely avoid renting from Zencity again  It took the host several hours to respond to questions  Also  I communicated an issue with the heater and was told twice that they would send someone to come check it out but never received follow up  I spent two nights without heat 
672951111,Great location near the lake and public transport  Easy access to restaurants and stores  Parking is definitely manageable  Seamless check in and out  A bit noisy looks out on a back alley  Two lights in BR do not work  Response to emails a bit slow  I had to call twice about a person who tried to enter the apt who had a key at   PM  It turned out to be someone from Zen City  Noisy back alley busy with garbage collection early in the AM 
627045700,It was ok
623563772,   stairs but its beautiful  The place looked beautiful but it really need some changes  Thank you for allowing me to stay  When I arrived the unit smelled like the cleaning staff took a poop and left  It was a long lingering stench  There was no tub stop to take a bath  I had to run out and buy one and when I returned and turned the water on the knob fell off in my hand  Thee was huge wet stain on the couch like someone had sex and left  I tried to negotiate another couple days because I accumulated a lot of things and the unit was on the fourth floor   They never responded and then said the unit was booked  It forced me to leave pre maturely and I wasnt prepared  It is a few feet from a train that ran all day and all night  I couldnt sleep much because it was very noisey   It was    stairs to get to the unit  If you are not able to do steps you will lose your money  I was exhausted  It needed repairs and new furniture 
702154519,We were told to be quit and respectful to the other units and they had an all night and day party with tons of people and made tons of noise  It was really bad  On top of that not having warm water was a struggle for showers   The key was put in the wrong lock box  so there was a delay in check in  Great location  but I wouldnt recommend this place  We were told to be quit and respectful to the other units and they had an all night and day party with tons of people and made tons of noise  It was really bad  On top of that not having warm water was a struggle for showers  Keys were put into the wrong lock box Water was cold for    hours  and a     hour loud party going on upstairs Location was the only thing good about this place  We wouldnt recommend it or use it again 
626128798,The place was okay overall  it could be cleaner 
626143437,  I honestly am very offended that we were accused of stains on sheets when we didnt even sleep under them  We never even spotted a stain in the beds because we slept with blankets on top   but the fact that we were told there was a stain we didnt cause definitely shows that the place was unclean  We dont appreciate being blamed for such a thing at all 
632297354,Loved it I think it would better for paper towels and maybe a broom other than that I loved it 
631855805,We road tripped from ATL and had a REALLY hard time checking into the property   The instructions sent did not allow access to the property  We contacted the host  albeit after hours  who didnt respond until LATE morning the next day  It was very frustrating after an eight hour drive  we were exhausted and had to stalk the building praying for someone to leave and give us access to the lobby  Mishaps happen but I was not okay with the late response we received from their team  an entire night of our stay down the drain    On a positive note  the place was clean and had a nice view of the arch 
625346391,Everything was nice  I think the people who stayed before me broke the bed cuz as soon as my wife and I layed down the bed collapsed   They were helpful and communicative very well  It was clean and smelled good  My wife loved that they had cleaning supplies too  They even offered a mid stay clean  Just make sure the bed isnt broke  
630612352,Perfect location  LOVELY LOFT  Comfortable BED and clean bedding  Common areas and bedrooms could have been a little bit cleaner I saw dust around the living room and bedroom walls  Which lead me to think it wasnt COVID cleaned  The washer also did not work my entire stay which was a major inconvenience   the elevator broke down one day as well  It was fun walking up five flights of stairs     Lastly  the vent above the toilet also started leaking as well so the other guests in the other bedroom had to use my restroom  Washer and Dryer did not work the entire stay which is one of the many reasons why I booked the place  The vent was leaking water over the toilet  So the other guests had to keep coming into my room to use the restaurant  None of the issues were resolved  Elevator also broke down during my visit and we had to walk up five flights of stairs with a child  FUN TIMES 
672399959,Good price for the location  You get what you pay for  The place was okay  The floors looked like they hadnt been swept very well and we found a pair of childrens underwear behind one of the beds  The washer dryer was broken too 
625239904,Second time staying  the place is gorgeous  that much is true  but the apartment was barely clean  After my check in i messaged several times about things that werent cleaned properly and got no response  Same as last time  Why charge a cleaning fee if you wont clean    Anyway maybe youll have better luck than me  I wont be back  This is my second time staying with Zencity  it seemed like things might be better  and I must say I am equally as displeased as the first time  The apartment was just barely clean  There were no supplies such as paper towels or extra rags to do dishes  There was hair all over the carpeted area and a giant bug in the bed our second night  I dont understand why were paying a cleaning fee if the space wont actually be clean upon out arrival  I am disappointed at the lack of response to any of my messages during my stay and wont be staying wjth Zencity again  Messaged about unclean conditions and still havent received a response 
645261912,The place is fine  The location is fine  Just note  I went to the CVS on Sunday night      pm for water and I was locked out of this apartment on July    through  July    at      am because their  electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  All of my things were already inside the apartment  I called their number and they said they could not help me until tommorow  They also did not have another spare key to get into the apartment  I went back to the apartment at      am and finally someone came to open up the apartment  They removed the broken electronic keypad and gave me a key  They do not know what went wrong  I also noticed this place is charging me for all the days in the apartment even though I could not stay there on Sunday night  Very shady practice    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience I was locked out of your apartment on july    through  July         am because your electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  Then at      am someone came to open up the apartment    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience I was locked out of your apartment on july    through  July         am because your electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  Then at      am someone came to open up the apartment    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience
647349275,As far as a place to rest my head and sleep  no complaints  Floorboards were creaky to high hell though and there was some mold in the bathroom  Great location in Lakeview though  felt very safe  Please make sure to clean between the bath tub and the sink  its infested with mold 
652910643,I was refused entry after notifying the hosts and Airbnb that I tested positive for COVID  I wasnt offered a refund  yet instead was promoted to cancel on my own  while paying over half for the stay   Then when I communicated that I wasnt able to where masks  short supply at the hospital  and my disposables were destroyed  after being hospitalized and having no support  canceling my flight  and driving   hours to St  Louis to stay in the listing  I was told  the check in was in fact accessible through a door man  and was threatened if I show I wont be able to enter and that my code to do was indeed revoked   I was stranded  no place to sleep and slept in my rental car  I also had to find abandoned areas to use the restroom due to COVID and me not wanting to enter any stores or restaurants and infect other ppl   This all could have been avoided had Airbnb either intervened or if the host would have canceled  seeing as I wasnt allowed in the listing and also a health threat to everyone in the building    Also  I was allowed to still stay even though I was positive I was refused entry because I didnt have any face coverings  I didnt bother to  check in  anyways for fear of my safety  or the police being called  With all that I experienced from having COVID  this wasnt worth it   Beware of positive COVID guests  however this hosts posses proper professionalism until I refused to gave cancelation penalties    I cant rate what I didnt see  so my rating reflects just that   Wishing you well  Ryann
625645869,The location is in a sketchy area right next to the El train   The description made it sound like it was further up Belmont  The train is loud   always   The cable tv was disconnected when we arrived  and it took   text messages and a phone call to get someone to fix it   Unimpressed and wouldnt stay at a Zencity property again 
623545079,My wife have to clean entire appt  To get rid of dust and and other trash doors walls paint is awful appliances  ok mattresses are ok   No body told that appt on  rd floor pictures from different unit door lock sticky and more  I moved and paid extra money assuming area are totally trouble free but my car had  key job  on one day and both front tire cut on another 
627325111,nice apartment but was extremely hot and was difficult to contact someone for assistance check in was broken and had no one to contact
653928700,I didnt have a great experience when I got there  No water pressure  no hot water  WiFi stopped working when I was on a conference call  no hair dryer and it smelled like cigarettes   The location however is perfect and the host moved me to another apartment which made up for all my negative experiences It started kind of like a disaster but glad you moved me to the other apartment which made up for all the bad experiences  You should however try to respond quicker
657908005,It was nice and clean
672666876,Close to everything but furniture needs to be replace Bed rails are broken and sofa leg was broken 
667800819,The apartment was a great location and really great space HOWEVER the apartment was not properly cleaned there was hair and crumbs everywhere  It was pretty gross cleanliness wise 
652305052,If you are looking for a nice set up based on pictures  this is your spot  But once you arrive  you may think feel otherwise  The kitchen common area is nice  And the location is ideal   However  once you get to the rooms   thats another story  Theres a visible leak outside of the apartment that seems to have been a problem for months  You can see the ceiling in the hallway of the apartment starting to buckle  Once you get to the master bedroom  youre met with a TERRIBLE smell thats deeply embedded in the carpet and it just needs to come up  The carpet is definitely wet from the leak as you can see the wording on the bottom of your shoes on the bathroom tile  Hand grease prints on the wall and the ceiling fan is packed with dust and spiderwebs forming   you can tell its been months since that was cleaned  The cleaning is simply just not up to par for the price of the stay  Luckily we only stayed   nights   You can take your chances on this one   the issue may or may not be resolved by the time you stay  Dont waste your money on a  pretty set up  based on the kitchen common area  You should definitely have the issue with the leak bedroom carpet smell checked out before allowing other guests to spend money for possible hazardous conditions   That carpet simply needs to come up  Period  The smell was worse every night   another night spent and it would have been quite unbearable  And also hire someone who is going to thoroughly clean ALLLLL areas of your apartment   not just the kitchen common area   Whoever cleans  simply does the bare minimum  And thats unfortunate and unacceptable   Ive stayed in much better AirBnB residences over the course of time   and this has been the absolute worst stay  This listing looked really nice  However  the resting areas were definitely not up to par as it should have been for the price of the stay  Would have done better staying at a hotel 
710637254,This place was exactly what I thought  It was a safe location surrounded by a ton of great places  I wish the apartment was a bit cleaner and the keypad was easier to use  Other than that  it was a good time  The keypad code was hard to use and took a day to actually check in the airbnb
626825334,I do not like to write negative reviews so I will focus on the positive attributes first   The location is great   The provided parking spot is a very nice perk   The apartment complex seems clean and appears to be well managed   The host did respond to my issues in a timely manner   The cleanliness of the apartment was not up to my standards  especially during a pandemic where you would expect extra care to be taken   The host did send a cleaning crew back for a second cleaning   It was better but I still decided to clean the apartment myself   I do treat rentals as my own and kept the apartment clean and even did a load of laundry before I left   Upon checkout the host said that I broke two chairs and wanted to charge me        I noticed two chairs were not assembled properly and were a safety hazard so I did not use them   This is the first time I have been accused of destroying property   If I did do anything inappropriate  I would have notified the host as I am an honest person   Between the cleanliness issues and being accused of destroying property  I will sadly not be staying with this host again on my many trips to Kansas City  You need to focus on providing a clean apartment and not accussing people of breaking items they are not responsible for 
654876413,It was a useful last minute booking for a week  Wasnt my best experience but I had a responsive set of hosts through the company that manages the property  FYI  Lots of dirt under the rug  Bathroom floor was dirty  Bathtub didnt look clean  Shower was a bit difficult to use at first  Other areas were not clean in general 
630473008,The host sent us the wrong access code and so we were unable to check in  When we had trouble accessing the property  there was no response from the host  We ended up having to contact AirBnB to handle the issue  We were unable to stay in the apartment  and had to find a hotel that could accommodate us at the last minute  We were really disappointed with our experience  Absolutely unacceptable  We were sent the wrong check in information  and we were unable to contact the host for assistance  Host did not contact me until I first messaged them on the morning of our arrival 
658586253,Good price  Wi Fi would not work for us  The TV speakers didnt work at all  Easy access to downtown  Door code didnt work  but got resolved after talking on the phone for a minute  Working TV and working Wi Fi
715925593,There was hair EVERYWHERE  on the rug  in the blankets   in the bathroom  everywhere  The ground was very sticky as well    The Netflix account will probably be down since users in zencitys other apartments are using it  Theres Hulu which we liked    Could not find the thermostat the whole time   They were not responsive when our new access code did not work when we got a new one since we extended our stay   I did like how there were serve ware  the showers water pressure was solid  the wiki worked well  the overall place was spacious  there were plenty of towels  and the kitchen was big  The bed was comfy as well   TIP  I do not recommend parking outside      Like street parking  my friend got her catalytic converter stolen  and she was parked right in front of the apartment  Its a safe area but not at night 
713004901,It was a good stay  Only some issue such as the closet door was off the rail  markings on walI  couple pillows were cut up  spots throughout carpet  and somewhat outdated shower curtain  I communicated this with Zencity and was informed  housekeeping made note of it before I we checked in   Did notice the closet door was back on the rail when we came back to our Airbnb that was a little weird since I didnt request it  But cleanliness was up to par  Overall it was good experience It was a good stay  Only some issue such as the closet door was off the rail  markings on walI  couple pillows were cut up  spots throughout carpet  and somewhat outdated shower curtain  I communicated this with Zencity and was informed  housekeeping made note of it before I we checked in   Did notice the closet door was back on the rail when we came back to our Airbnb that was a little weird since I didnt request it  But cleanliness was up to par  Overall it was good experience
702335887,When we arrived  the front door of the apartment building was open  but no one was nearby  A bit sketchy  and this happened several times more throughout our stay  On first arrival  there were dirty dishes in the dishwasher  with no soap anywhere  we had to request more   The bedroom carpets and linens were a bit dirty  and so were the wood floor in the living room and kitchen   About half way through our stay  the smart lock on the door stopped working   After spending a few HOURS on chat with the hosts  trying several different resolutions  they hired a handyman to come the next afternoon  For that period of time  I could not leave the Airbnb because the door would not lock behind me  and if it did  Id have no way of getting back in   There is no physical key   Its really not worth the high fee  and Id recommend searching elsewhere  Front door of apartment building  not unit  was open when we arrived and no one was nearby  Slow responses to their smart lock breaking 
700413722,The place could have been better  Especially the check in process  they did not give us a key to the building  which was stressful and a bit unprofessional  We had to time our entrances with other residents of the building or figure out how to use the callbox  Whenever I communicated this to the hosts  they sent generic check in messages that they had already sent twice  The woman that checked me in poorly communicated to me about getting into the building as well  The bath tub was covered in pubic hair and there was some on the towels as well  The bath tub was also super moldy   We were definitely disappointed by the listing  The place could have been better  Especially the check in process  not having a key to the building was stressful and a bit unprofessional  The woman that checked me in poorly communicated to me about getting into the building as well  The bath tub was covered in pubic hair and there was some on the towels as well  I really recommend checking your bathroom for mold as it was all under the grout on the tub  We were definitely disappointed by your listing  Sent me generic messages x  when asking for help to get into building
657031597,This experience was incredibly disappointing and considering my last stay I do not know if Ill be staying with Zencity again  I stayed with this host  same building but different unit  couple weeks back  I love the location  its near plenty of shops  and I love waking up being across the street from tennis courts  The host had the audacity to display signage boasting about the cleanliness of the room when it was nothing but  The restroom was full of urine and hair everywhere  The issue was so bad I sent the host   messages within an hour of my arrival with pictures   There was an offer after receiving several automated messages in response to my email to have someone clean the problem areas and sweep the floors   No one ever showed  The issue was so bad I used boiling water and the apartment cleaning products to disinfect the restroom  The young lady at concierge  who checked me in on my last visit  even reported the issue to a Zencity cleaner the following morning    This room did not meet the standards of cleanliness in the midst of Covid     theres no way  and you all should be ashamed  If I could have cancelled this booking and received a full refund I would have  Extremely disappointed  This experience was incredibly disappointing and considering my last stay I do not know if Ill be staying with Zencity again  The audacity to display signage boasting about the cleanliness of the room when it was nothing but    This room did not meet the standards of cleanliness in the midst of Covid    and you all should be ashamed  If I couldve cancelled this booking and received a full refund I would have  Extremely disappointed  I immediately reached out to the host about the hair everywhere  the lack of cleanliness  a piece of broken furniture  and a small hole in the wall  Initially all I received was automated emails about check in  When I finally got a proper response offering to have someone come clean I was in a tennis tournament  I responded with a proposed time for tomorrow and no one showed  Its a global pandemic at the least I expect the space to be clean
654834111,The locks to the building and the apartment took forever to open due to outdated door locks  The WiFi didnt work  It wasnt Covid    ready  No hand sanitizer  face masks  or anything of that sort  The host didnt respond to any of my calls during my stay  It was a terrible experience  Ive tried to reach out to the host several times  however  no one answered nor returned my missed phone calls  The wifi did not work at all  It was a struggle to get inside the building and inside the actual apartment because the locks are extremely old and require a lot of wiggling the keys  The location was nice  It would have been nice to utilize the Wifi  It would have better if it was cleaner  There wasnt any hand sanitizer  face mask or anything to help keep us save during the Covid    
714589123,They cancelled on me hours before I was supposed to check in and I had to stay in a filthy unit in a sketchy part of town with a dishonest owner   Zen City told me I couldnt have the unit because of  maintenance  issues  When I asked what maintenance issue takes five days  they had no reply  So  they left me stranded on the streets of St  Louis  Deplorable  You never answered what maintenance issue takes five days to repair  Not that I would believe any answer you give me  having experienced your lack of regard for customers who have made and paid for reservations days in advance  I suspect you just got more money from another client and didnt care if I was raped  robbed  or killed on the St  Louis streets Deplorable 
657039740,Overall a good experience  besides things not operating correctly and the lack of communication  Overall a good experience  however  things couldve been better if there was communication 
635080079,This apartment was OK  but Ive attempted to contact the host about two issues and havent heard back  the smell of smoke in the apartment and the fact that there isnt a fire escape because the windows are barred shut and dont budge  Hi  I messaged Ava about this and havent heard back  Theres no fire escape in the apartment because there are bars over the window that dont budge  The apartment also smelled like smoke 
630626015,To sum up my experience with Zencity in one word    yikes  Note  I am a solo female traveler  so my number one priority when looking for a place to stay is safety    The space itself was very nice  Netflix was free and many other streaming services were available with user login  Anything I needed for cooking was provided  Excellent location  short walk to cafes and in an area that many food services deliver to  ie  Postmates  DoorDash  etc     Zencity  on the other hand  was the worst experience Ive had with an Airbnb host  To get into the building  guests must enter a key code and then speak a code into the intercom  The only way to get in to the building and use the elevator  which must be used  as the stairs are locked  is by following these steps  Zencity said that they provide a key fob  available in the room  for immediate access to the building and elevator  However  there was no fob left in my room  I contacted Zencity immediately and was told they would get the fob to me ASAP  yet by the time I left    hours later  I still had not received a fob or any more responses  despite my multiple attempts to contact Zencity via phone and messages  Again  this causes issues for me that people traveling with others might not face  At one point during my stay I came back to find someone loitering in the entrance  waiting to follow someone into the lobby  If I had had a key it would have been easy to go in quickly and avoid the man waiting  But  since I didnt  and I did not want to say the code out loud in front of him  I waited outside  It was a scary situation for me that only ended well because a male resident arrived and made sure I got inside safely  While of course Zencity is not responsible for loiterers  they were responsible for providing a key  which they failed to do    Cleanliness  Im not sure anyone cleaned the room before my stay  more than to make the bed  The shower bath had clearly not been cleaned  or cleaned well  in quite a while  There was a makeup brush  not mine  sitting on the living room floor  which was a clear indication that the floor had not been vacuumed 
711149100,I would recommend to get every detail you can before renting from this company  Parking is horrible and Zencity arent good at communicating 
702994081,Not a bad spot to stay for the money 
654387670,Ive stayed in a plethora of spaces  sometimes you get what you pay for  The location was good if youre wanting to be downtown  However if you are looking for somewhere quiet this building isnt it  The neighbors were pretty loud during the quiet hours  This booking was really just a place to sleep and shower  Dont expect more There was a note saying cleaned by Haley  however the space wasnt too clean  The blinds were also broken and wouldnt close 
634028475,The floors were disgusting  sticky  there was nats everywhere  I could not even pour a drink without a nat getting in it  There was someone elses hair on the floor in bathtub  no keurig  or water in the fridge or steps on how to make coffee  No laundry detergent or soap  I couldnt even turn the ac on it was locked  The floors had streaks all over them and were dirty and sticky  I was harassed by two men in the hallway multiple times and felt very unsafe  Also there was no where to park  I had to pay     the first day for parking and I got   parking tickets  Would never recommend this place to anyone  The floors were disgusting  sticky  there was nats everywhere  There was someone elses hair on the floor in bathtub  no keurig  or water in the fridge or steps on how to make coffee  No laundry detergent or soap  I couldnt even turn the ac on it was locked  The floors had streaks all over them and were dirty and sticky  I was harassed by two men in the hallway multiple times and felt very unsafe  Also there was no where to park  I had to pay     the first day for parking and I got   parking tickets  Would never recommend this place to anyone 
635964442,The place was accurate to the description  The place was mostly clean but the garbage can was full when we got there and the AC did not do a good enough good cooling the room 
635011421,We stayed during the  th of July so it was quite busy but the building decor and scenery were nice  The Airbnb itself was spacious w  a lake view from each room  There were a few things that couldve been better  the couch definitely needed to be cleaned  its a cream color so you could see every stain  One of the bedrooms was extremely cold  even after turning the a c off the air was still blowing out and the vent wouldnt close  One of the bathrooms had an issues with water leaking on the floor after using the shower for longer than    mins    Once they fix the minor things it would be a perfect stay 
707893249,Had problems checking in  took over an hour before we were settled into a unit that was    min away from our original booking  I had to reach out to the company the next day to figure out checking in to our original booking  Upon checking in  there was a light bulb out in the bathroom and there wasnt a lot of cups and dishware for even two people  Disappointed since I saw so many good reviews for this company  Very disappointed with how our first night staying with you went  I understand having issues  but it was very frustrating being shuffled around and it seemed like your company didnt know what was going on  i e not knowing where your keys were   and garage arm at one property was not working and light bulb was out in our unit  Just didnt meet my expectations  Intercom system was broken at our original booking  then keys were missing from  nd unit they tried to put us at  and then garage arm didnt open at  rd unit we ended up staying at  And the only communication used was messaging through Airbnb instead of calling  We got shuffled between   different properties before we could settle in for the night  Slow responses  and customer support wasnt able to get in touch with people who supposedly had our keys 
652893918,I am from St  Louis and wanted to show my boyfriend around the area   This is a great location right across from Forest Park and the front desk attendants were very nice and accomodating   Unfortunately  the apartment was not clean examples being an old bar of soap with hair on it in the bathroom  spoiled milk in the refrigerator  no trash bags in the apartment  or the trashcan   Parking is difficult   Wifi was terrible basically didnt work  forced us to leave early so we could complete our telework   This is run by an agency so there is no incentive to make it better   I prefer real owners as they have pride in their property    There is a no visitor policy which we didnt know about until we arrived so my parents couldnt come to see us for dinner    I love STL and there are so many great houses and homes to rent from   This wasnt one of them  This is clearly run by an agency and not an owner   There was no help with the wifi which wouldnt even allow us to do our work remotely   We ended up having to pay for a wework as we couldnt take meetings  clean the apartment  there is a pandemic going on  and invest in better wifi 
630251543,This place has serious cleanliness issues  The host did not offer appropriate solutions  There was hair from several people all over the floor and the surfaces were noticeable dirty  Little to no effort to clean and disinfect  I noticed the morning after a late check in and was horrified  There was even something that looked like a bloody smear on one wall  It is abundantly clear that they are letting the place go between several guests with minimal attention  Hopefully they will fix these issues going forward  However  I would advise anyone traveling during the pandemic to avoid this place AT ALL COSTS   it is not safe and the hosts seem ambivalent about it  They hadnt even bothered to empty the bathroom trash between guests  and it was nearly overflowing   The amenities were poor at best  Cheap bed and pillows  no soap in one of the dispensers  stained and grimy furniture  I ended up getting a refund and booking a hotel for the same price 
636245118,good place  great location  There were endless gnats flying around  couldnt even leave food uncovered    the thermostat never went below    degrees  Even after Zencity changed the setting to cool only      degrees  it never dropped  Then a maintenance man unexpectedly wakes us up at  am to only look at the air system for   minutes to only say that it could get no colder because of the size of the building  But the location of the airbnb was perfect   all of the decor in the loft was nice 
671224681,I would not recommend spending this kind of money on this building  It is unclean  and more of a hassle than a  vacation   I would really like my money back  This is not a clean  safe environment  I contacted the host about the poop stain on the sheets Saturday afternoon and received a response Sunday at   am  We were leaving on Sunday so that really didnt help  It was just a hassle  The buildings elevator was  reserved  for the day and we had no way of knowing there was an additional one in another part of the building  To get to it we had to leave the building and walk a block to get to the other side  I at one time had to walk up the   flights of stairs 
702764602,Not the best  not the worst
635109673,This is difficult as I want to be honest for future Air bnb guests  The TV did not work because the outlet that powers it didnt work  Its on the  th floor and the elevator went out  I booked the room for the open rooftop to watch the fireworks but it was closed down  That being said  the room itself is wonderful  Has a great view  AC blows super cold  Has a bedroom fan  Bed was very cozy  Definitely has a ton of potential if all gets fixed  Im not sure the person that was messaging me  knew the room   Said for me to move the tv when it is mounted on the wall  Working tv  working elevator  open rooftop  Bed was perfect  Ac was super cold  Loved that 
591196950,I was ecstatic to give this place a solid      However  I would only give it a      The apartment was just  okay   Im not difficult to please  but the apartment didnt meet my expectations  that was based from the advertisement   This was mainly due to it not being clean upon arrival  I honestly feel like the cleaning fee shouldnt have been applied  Some of the issues encountered are as follows    There was trash   strange yellow liquid in the stairwell entrance to the apartment    The floors needed to be mopped  I was barefoot for less than    minutes and my feet were already black on the bottom   The shower was not on the clean side  one of the bathrooms had a bunch of dead flies on the ceiling    The dishwasher had dirty dishes in it and the smell on the inside was extremely sour   The keurig had old  foggy water in it and there were no k pods as seen in the photos  Besides the cleanliness of the apartment  Some of the furniture in the photo is not the same in the apartment  The couch on the right in the photo is not in the apartment    it was replaced with a futon  I will it was very comfortable   Now the grey couch in the photo is in the apartment  but its worn out in person  The cushion was not great  When you sit on it  you will slide off  We made it work by just pulling out the bed inside and sitting on it that  The mattress on that was comfortable  The kitchen table stools were kind of worn as well and the table in the photo had different chairs  However  I didnt mind it  The TV changes to different apps  STARZ  HBO  etc  very slowly so I would recommend just watching regular cable  The WiFi was strong in certain places and extremely weak in others   Aside from the cons  here were the pros    Very spacious    All of the bedrooms were clean and the beds were extremely comfortable     Water got nice   hot   The heating was great in the apartment    It was stocked with necessary cookware and silverware   Parking isnt a hassle    The team of hosts responded quickly when I had a questions  In conclusion  my family and I did have a great time in the apartment  I think if the cleaning team would just deep clean a bit more  everything would be great so hopefully it gets better in the future  Accuracy in what was listed in description  Information was misleading 
635717292,Good location  nice place to stay for a few days  We had no WiFi and couldnt use the tv the entire time we were there and received no response from the host  Other than that  it was a good stay  In the future  Id make sure the router works so your guests can have WiFi and watch TV  Also  some communication would be nice 
711275721,This place had few issues  Garbage disposal malfunctioned which led us to not being able to use sink  cook or use dishwasher   There were few bugs around sink and dishwasher areas that were an issue   The internet connection was weak  Streaming was lot of waiting and buffering  There doesnt seem to be a router in the place  just a wifi extender  which Times out pretty often    Other than that place was clean and all needed amenities were available  Garbage disposal malfunctioned and that led to us not being able to use sink  cook or use dishwasher    Lot of insects around dishwasher and sink    Place was clean otherwise  All needed amenities were available   Internet connection was weak  Lot of buffering while streaming  There does not seem to be router in the place  just a wife extender point 
631879426,My partner and I loved our stay with Zencity  specifically at this location and especially during these times of COVID     We did wish that the space was a bit cleaner when we arrived  there were still remnants of the previous guests in a few places  The listing also advertised that we would have rooftop access and unfortunately our key fobs did not give us access and it was never resolved  Other than that they had great communication and the apartment was wonderful  Would definitely stay again  Thanks for the stay  The only issue we had was the roof was available for use but our key fob wouldnt give us access to it
633804818,The area wasnt great and there is no parking  it ended up being okay  The place was pretty clean  No blackout curtains and bed wasnt so comfortable  Building has a ton of residents who werent wearing masks during Covid times and one small elevator 
630558777,Booked this Airbnb last minute because I was coming home to KC for some family stuff  Tried getting into the unit around  am after getting into town and the code for the door I was given was wrong  Tried calling leaving messages   but no one answered until the next day  If I would of been in a city I didnt know I would of had to sleep in the hallway  but luckily I knew people in town for a place to crash  Next day I got a new code  got into the Airbnb and was changing when a maintenance guy walks into the unit  He said he didnt think anyone was in the unit  but was told there was supposed to be a photo shoot later and that I should call to make sure I have the correct unit  When calling zencity they wanted to still do the shoot at a time I wouldnt be in the apartment  but verified that I had the correct unit and that I could stay in it  I was supposed to have a late check out the next day to compensate for all the miscommunication and that was not communicated with the cleaning lady and she also walked into the unit while I was still I was there and verified that she was never told about the late check out    Zencity refused to give me a refund for the night that I couldnt get into the unit even though they gave me the wrong code to get in  Because of that and the fact that there was clearly no communication with staff to update them on the status of the room  and I had my privacy and honestly safety compromised multiple times I will not be booking this unit or any other listing that uses zencity going forward 
631715128,This place was in a perfect location and was exactly what I was looking for to have a stay cation  However  I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the entire house  especially the bathrooms and kitchen  During Covid there should be even more importance from the host on how the home is cleaned  The house also had no paper towels or anything for me to clean up with  We did really love the outdoor patio area  but the lights did not work to enjoy during the night time 
635948432,The apartment was nice  modern and in a great neighborhood  Unfortunately  we experienced some cleanliness issues that we felt shouldve been resolved prior to us arriving  Upon arriving  the place looked exactly like the pictures but we soon noticed the kitchen floors werent swept or mopped  One of the first things we had to do after we arrived was sweep the crumbs and dust spread throughout the kitchen  The following day we regrettably found a pair of womens underwear on the floor next to our bed   evidence that the place wasnt thoroughly cleaned before our arrival  All in all  the place was nice but I feel more attention shouldve been given to the overall cleaning   especially in the climate we all now live in 
478209876,Clean large rooms  Really just two bedrooms with a couch sleeper downstairs  Little window units upstairs really try to keep bedrooms cool  we came on a     degree index day   Bathrooms are well stocked except hand towels   weird right  Driveway was tight for our Tahoe but smaller cars  it can fit two  will be perfect  Neighbors were quiet and landscaping beautiful  The surrounding area was a little questionable but the homes location was ideal for crown center so we chose this home  Plenty of bed linens and pillows to go around  Smaller winding stairs made it a challenge to get suitcase upstairs  Lots of plug ins beside beds for phones and such  Lovely home but   Would have like to have seen the front door window frosted   a little too easy for anyone to look right in  Also  food items should not be left open  sugar   Items so high up we couldnt reach  The fridge wasnt clean but that wasnt the worst part  These was used food items from perhaps the guests before us  The fridge did have items we could use but open containers of cream cheese open milk containers and sauce packets from past guests delivery were a turn off  If you keep fridge stocked with bottle water and a fresh chilled fruit tray that would have been perfect  Used items just say  we didnt clean the fridge and here you can have someones left overs   If you want to keep bagels and cream cheese in fridge   have individual packets of cream cheese  The Host unexpectedly came over and delivered TP and bananas without ever communicating with us  He came in and wanted to put the items where they should have been delivered before our check in  Two of our group where at there and felt very uncomfortable  Update the front bedroom mattress soon 
632040839,Do not expect a quick response if anything is broken  Unfortunately the place is great but if something doesnt work  be prepared to have it stay like that until the day you leave  I stayed for a week with no electricity in the main bathroom and although I sent numerous emails about it nothing was done until the morning I was leaving  The light fixture and breakers had to be replaced for both the bathroom and kitchen area  Even after I complained the day I left  I got no response  Note to self on my next trip to St Louis I will definitely stat in the air bnb I rented before thia one     It speaks volumes that I reached out to you more than once the week that I stayed there and nothing was done until the day I was leaving  How did you possibly find it acceptable to charge someone for   bathrooms when only one was fully functional  And for me to write and send a note the day I left with no response  not even an apology was the icing on the cake  Thank you for the great St Louis hospitality Main bathroom lights didnt work and although I reached out to the hosts SEVERAL times during my week long stay  it wasnt fixed until the morning I was leaving If I was able to use the main bathroom then I wouldve been happy
637485809,Place was not clean it all floor very sticky had ants all over and to top it off it was hot as hell with the weather being in the   s my whole stay the air was only set to go to    which was not sufficient enough it was hot there were no brooms or mop in sight have to buy one and also have to purchase a fan
630425922,Do NOT pick this co  to host your stay  We will never stay here with this Company ever again  Even though the housing was well kept  the look of this place was tarnished due to the lack of knowledge of the property and the INSANE hidden fees  The cleaning fee was waaaaay higher than the room cost  Which literally doubled our payment per night  On top of this the instructions were so inaccurate it took us    min just to be able to enter the apartment  On top of this the parking they suggested was costly as well  which is common with  downtown  locations  but there were ZERO less convenient though less expensive alternatives suggested by the host to aid with options  This was not worth our time or our money  By far our worst experience with Air BnB  Knowledge on the property was severely lacking which made for a nightmare of a time trying to even access the apartment  The directions were not very accurate  The keys werent labeled like you said  it was PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the keys in the room after check out  and the parking situation should have been extremely clear and more knowledgeable on the situation  This was unlike any Ari BnB we have ever stayed in  The place did not make up for the lack of customer service or description of how to get into the apartment  Would send almost automated responses that didnt answer my question till after the auto responses went out
629928102,Overall this place is fairly nice  with a few big drawbacks  Be very aware of the parking situation here  there is almost none and it is time limited  If you are travelling with any luggage or equipment  loading and unloading at this building can be very difficult or even impossible  The room has a very large amount of furnishings and gadgets  and a massive number of kitchen items  Some of these gadgets are a nuisance  like the keypad for the door  It has a    digit code that you will not be able to memorize  Not being able to memorize the door code makes it easy to lock yourself out of the room  and zencity cant be contacted through the callbox at the building  Also the smooth glass touchscreen where you enter the code is EXTREMELY sensitive to any part of your hand getting close to it  at which point you need to re enter the entire code from the beginning  And lastly  with all of the other furnishings and details  they have not yet purchased dark curtains that completely cover the windows  Dont expect to sleep past      or   in the morning  when light starts flooding in  Nice bed and fast wifi  Overly complicated check in process
669680330,Its a nice apartment with a gorgeous view of Hyde Park and the lake  I had trouble with the wifi and so also the tv  and that was pretty frustrating I had to use my phone as a hotspot for a number of work Zooms  Otherwise  it was nice enough 
652368499,the place was OK looked as pictured   my biggest issue was the plumbing   the drain in the shower was slow so when showering we literally had to wait   hours until the water drained for my boyfriend to shower   he fixed it the next day but it was a big inconvenience  another minor issue was that the wifi l tv didnt work at all  i wasnt there to watch tv but still would have liked the option   overall it was an ok place i think for the amount i was expecting a little more   the best part of the apartment is the view  
719468559,Great view  The view is amazing from this unit  towels may be a little dingy  the neighbors next door are rude and wants you quiet before the allotted quiet time that starts at   pm  Did you try using bleach on these towels   We washed the towels when we first arrived because they were dingy 
633376913,Spent a couple nights here for an impromptu getaway  The place is clean with a minimalist feel  Quiet place to sleep  Kitchen is well appointed for a basic meal  The apartment is in need of a handful of maintenance items for example not all the outlets work in the kitchen  The apartment is old and in need of updates  Decent view of the lake  Comfortable bed  Scored free street parking which was a nice bonus  This apartment could easily be   stars with a fresh coat of paint and some minor updates  There were small ants on the counter tops in the kitchen  at least two of the outlets in the kitchen are not working either  There are moisture stains on the ceiling of the bathroom  Black stained grout on more than one area in the shower 
719489522,Nice location  great for   to   nights  I drunk a cup of coffee on a cup that has red lipstick on it  and I thought there was Netflix on the unit  but there wasnt  When I arrived I couldnt find a fob or kay in the unit  so I got one from the front disk 
718365141,Loved the place  Very clean and tidy and in good shape  The electronic door entry was handy once we figured it out  The place could use a couple of things to make it great  namely a coffee pot and a couple of chairs in the living room  The lone couch is just not enough space  All in all  we had a nice stay  Not much retail available near the location
633852201,This place is centrally located in downtown St  Louis  although it is a few blocks from the more bustling areas of downtown  Still  for the price  it was worth it to be a few blocks from a ton of restaurants and amenities  The pictures are accurate  and its apparent that the furnishings are somewhat new and the place is well appointed  The building can get a bit noisy in the evenings  which I didnt mind  but if you need complete quiet this might not be for you  There is a convenient electronic door locking system  which was nice  Wifi was strong  AC worked really well and kept the place cool during a very hot few days  My biggest complaint was that the floors were extremely dirty  as if they had never been swept or mopped  and a few small repairs  window blinds  chipping on bedroom wall  were needed  The cleanliness was especially concerning given it was during COVID    and I was charged an extra cleaning fee  which I happily paid    I hope the host fixes these issues because the place is a great value otherwise  Hi  I was very disappointed in the cleanliness of the unit   I was charged a very substantial COVID    cleaning fee  which I totally support in theory and was happy to pay  but the place with really dirty  My feet or socks were blackened by dirt as I walked around  Surfaces were visibly dirty  and there was chipping and apparent water damage in the bedroom  This place had a very low base price  so I wasnt expecting to be in the lap of luxury  but the cleanliness was perhaps the worst Ive ever experienced in dozens of airbnb stays  I had an issue locking the door and I sent several messages to the host in the app that were not replied to  I ended up calling their hotline several times and eventually reaching an operator wh helped me  A cleaner apartment would have provided more value   especially since there was a huge cleaning fee added for COVID     The base price was very low  but with fees and the added expenses for cleaning  which had apparently not really been done  the total cost was more substantial 
634325531,I would not stay here again  When I entered the apartment  it was apparent that the management of the property does not align with the curated finishes and furnishings of the space  There was long black hair laying on the kitchen counter  When I took a shower the bath towels and wash clothes were covered in pubes  The unit is undoubtedly trendy but was not clean  One roll of toilet paper was left for a week long stay  After reaching out  it took two days before I received a response and have more dropped off  I had to go out and buy toilet paper which was not ideal as this was meant to be a safe retreat during covid while visiting a family member reviewing chemo treatment nearby  After a few nights of my stay  I asked to receive a partial refund so that I could check into a hotel  Various members of property management will respond to you  sometimes the next day and sometimes several days later  While waiting on a response  my week stay ended and I was informed I was no longer eligible for a refund  Other things I wouldnt mention if the rest of the experience had been better   the key fob to the entrance is broken and there is no way to get ahold of management in a timely manner so you have to wait for someone to exit and let you in  the unit is in the basement and the only windows are part of the property dog park  the entire basement unit smelled of musty mold  the elevator was very sticky  the outdoor rooftop was not open  the hand soap is watered down  and when it was raining the living room started flooding 
661276924,Hello  I had difficulty with checkin  messaging with host  unclear or wrong instructions to get house keys   also the photos look a lot better than it is in person  There is little to no light in here and wasnt great for me  From what I saw it seemed like there was a lot of bright lighting but I think the photos were edited  I wasnt able to find an elevator  The blinds were broken and the windows were very dirty 
661203807,The area was nice and quiet  the bathrooms wasnt cleaned completely it was hair all around the showers  The tv didnt work all my friends tried to turn it on even asked the host they said it was on the home screen we did that still nothing  Everything else besides the tv and bathroom  was nice  the Airbnb is a great location to go enjoy yourself not a far distance  I recommend thanks Zencity 
650181735,I do not recommend this place  It is completely over priced  The pictures are very misleading  The structure of the place is nice and it does have a lot of space and a nice balcony  The place was disgusting tho  I saw a bug  the couch was so nasty and badly stained that I had to put a covering over it just to feel comfortable sitting on it   The toilet seats were so badly stained  completely unacceptable  I was there for business  couldnt find the iron   messages the host multiple times about it   very slow responses and no attempt to fix the issue  I couldnt even control the air system on my own and once again  very slow or no response from the host  Multiple things were broken  it was just an overall disgusting experience and if youre looking for a nice place to stay  This isnt it  This place was just genuinely not what I expected  The pictures were absolutely misleading   the place was disgusting  The couch was so dirty and stained that I refused to sit on it without something covering it  There was bugs  the stove was disgusting  the refrigerator was disgusting  Needs new appliances if youre going to charge this much for it  Maybe I just like luxury and for the price I paid  This just wasnt it  By far my worst AirBnB experience ever  Even with communication  terrible Overall 
639126368,I was excited to stay in to this beautiful room until I went to the room and saw someones things in my room  When I contacted them to inform them of the error they switched me into a different room nothing like what I booked  I had to sleep on the couch which wasnta pull out so my stay was a bit uncomfortable  In the morning I asked for towels and were never got them so Ima little displeased with my stay 
638780537,Room was good for price only bad thing was parking it was almost impossible to find parking 
639114203,Be sure to check for damages and report them  If not  they will try and charge you for the previous damages Thank you for allowing us to stay in your air bnb  But there was previous damages
636913071,Checked in on July   and walked into an awesome view of all the fireworks in the surrounding neighborhoods  But things went downhill from there   The AC in the bedroom was out before I got there  Instead of informing me about the situation beforehand they allowed me to have one of my worst experiences ever in an Airbnb  Bc the The broken AC started to leak from the pipes underneath the floor  Zencity did try to get the situation fix but the repairs were too major so I checked out early  Im not a complainer but I was a bit confused on why the only supplied only   towels and   washcloth for my   week stay   I did get more after requesting   The kitchen was well prepped with silverware  pots and pans  and a few spices  Parking isnt too bad  You can usually find parking relatively close  This place does have potential to be really good once the repairs are made  It was bad luck for me 
640617683,The place was nice  The neighbors were arguing one night we were there  Space was conveniently located  However it is very small  I would ask the owner questions about check out and it was never answered Neighbors were literally arguing and fighting at  am in the morning
719435899,Couldnt have asked for a better location  and cute apartment as pictured   however definitely be aware that the bed is just inches from the ground  could definitely be an accessibility issue for some  and that the bathroom is definitely outdated  lacks a little in cleanliness than the rest of the apartment  In summery  good value and location  dont expect luxurious bathroom  There should be a warning that the bed is essentially on the floor and the bathroom REALLY needs a deep cleaning and fixing up
701711254,Great looking place  cleanliness was a little underwhelming in bedrooms  Door code didnt work at arrival
718892456,Great location and easy stay  pictures make it look nicer than it is
633360426,Overall  the stay is OK  It is in a great location in the city  No issues checking in or coming as far going as we pleased  HOWEVER  the listing is extremely deceiving  The images shown are not at all accurate to the unit we stayed in  The place gave of more of a  hotel room  vibe than it did an apartment  If what was booked matched what was received  the experience would have been better  The picture in the listing were NOT at all accurate  The unit re stayed in was not the one we thought we booked  The bedroom was also lacking in cleanliness  At one point we got down to pick up something that rolled under the bed and there were visible staining on the carpet from what looked like a pet  The  view of the city  was not much of a view  Overall our stay was fine  the place was suitable for our weekend  However it was EXTREMELY disappointing to stay somewhere completely different than what we were expecting  The place overall was not horrible  however the posting was deceiving  The pictures show on the listing were not at all accurate  Im not even sure the unit we got is the same one we booked 
634262585,VERY convenient and beautiful location  the place didnt seem that clean tho  there was a weird odor and it made me want to clean the entire place myself  so i did lol  also had a leaking sinking in bathroom which would cause water to cover a larger majority of the floor and  i notified them about it but they ignored me  other than that it it was ok i told them there was something wrong with the sink and that we didnt have a fob and they only responded to portion of the message that mentioned the fob and disregarded my complaints about the sink leaking and also being clogged
641116912,Furniture nearly broken  flimsy  No reply from host when contacted  Pest control came and sprayed for roaches while I was there  Noisy neighbors 
640248782,This was not what I expected in a bad way   Pros  The rate was cheap  The area was very pretty  There is parking in a gated parking lot   Cons    MICE   I should have been suspicious seeing the   mousetraps by the washer dryer  but I thought it was more precautionary  However at night I heard clear sounds around the apartment  Then one night around   pm I saw   mice running around the kitchen and livingroom  I tried to get a hold of the host to find a immediate solution or accommodation but they never got back to me   Not Clean  Although the listing says that they do enhanced cleaning measures to help combat COVID  I dont believe it  The walls are painted with a chalkboard like paint that shows every scratch and scuff mark  When I walked in there were clearly visible liquid splash marks on the wall  The handles of the refrigerator were very sticky for some reason  The remote had ketchup on the side from the last guest  I dropped my phone in the seat cushions and when I lifted the cushion I saw so much crumbs and dirt and even a dirty earbud   Fixtures  The restroom sink faucet is placed so incorrectly that when you go to wash your hands you end up splashing the entire counter  The air conditioner is preset with a schedule that only the host has control of  The lowest it can go is     If you set it to a certain temp at night  youll wake up to it at about     which is the locked setting   Overall  I could have put up with everything else if it werent for the fact that this place had a clear mouse problem and didnt inform me before hand  The directions to the apartment door should include that you enter the door at the end of the first hall  The door looks like you need a fob to enter it and it took me a while to figure out how to get to the apartment Host was difficult to get a hold of for urgent situations  Higher cleaning standards and being transparent about a clear mouse problem 
656397328,The check in process was extremely easy and it was great  We had a blast taking the Lime scooters from the apartment to our parking spot down the road  Once we got the key and went into the apartment I was a little disappointed though   When we first walked in  I used the bathroom  There was a ponytail with hair wrapped around it on the floor  The trashcan in the bathroom was full of qtips and a feminine product  Later on in the evening  we discovered the the kitchen trash had not been taken out either and was half full  During COVID     I did not expect to pick up and have to clean the place before feeling comfortable enough to stay there    Just makes me wonder what the cleaning fee is going towards 
700455037,The overall apartment is very nice   Beds were comfortable   mostly clean  There was some blood stains and what looked like dried snot on the comforter in the main room   There was an extra blanket to use   But that did gross me out and I find things like that unacceptable  I sent pics to the host and did not receive a response for over    hours   And it was   I hope you found the extra blankets   Sorry that you had an issue with the bedding     I would post pics to here if it will allow    Checking in was easy enough   We were given step by step instructions     Now to my complaint   When we first made it to the room it was so hot in there   Ok no biggie just need to turn air on     wrong   There was an issue with the ac   Snapped a photo of the thermostat and the temperature to see if maybe we were doing something wrong   Over an hour later after a  nd message I finally got a response    Oh thats unfortunate sorry its hot  Maybe set the temperature see if that helps   Its after   on Sunday and maintenance wont be in til tomorrow   Sent another message   No response   Sent another photo at bed showing the temp the same and what the thermostat was set on   Also sent pictures of the blood stained blankets and dried snot    was not like it was all over but enough I wasnt sleeping with it    No response til well over    hours later stating hope the ac issue is fixed   it was my boyfriend finally fixed the issue with the ac  and sorry the bedding was dirty   Hope you found the extras    I did but not the point   maintenance finally knocked on the door Tuesday morning   The ac issue was Sunday at        This is a part of down town so if you dont like noise    sirens  horns  cars people etc  you may not like it here  We are from a small country town and that did not bother us  Also there are some stragglers that roam the sidewalks   And some who will approach for money   just tell them youre good and move along   I never felt unsafe even being out on the street after dark  Thanks for the stay   The apartment overall was nice   The communication from the host was more than lacking   My boyfriend had to fix the ac then I had to wash blankets   Messages were not responded to for over    hours   In my opinion thats unacceptable When we first opened the door we were hit with about    degree heat in the apartment   Shut all the blinds and turned off all the lights and turned the thermostat down   Only to realize the ac was not working and would not cool the apartment   Sent pictures and messages of the issue and one message was responded to over and hour and then the next message about the blankets and the ac still not working took over    hours to respond   Only to say oh sorry   Hope you fixed the problem or found the extra blanket   Maintenance knocked on the door Tuesday morning   we arrived Sunday and reported the ac issue    Keep in mind this is down town  There are some stragglers but I never once felt unsafe  If the communication and concern would have been better 
649553379,A few hours after check out  I had realized I lost my ID  It took an hour long phone call on hold with no answer    messages on the AirBnB app  an email  and messages on Facebook to finally get an answer back from this company who rents out the property  I ended up having to order a new ID since they could not find it  and still havent heard anything back in regard to it  Basically  if you dont need to get in contact with ZenCity and your stay will be fine  A few hours after check out  I had realized I lost my ID  It took an hour long phone call on hold with no answer    messages on the AirBnB app  an email  and messages on Facebook to finally get an answer back from this company who rents out the property  I ended up having to order a new ID since they could not find it  and still havent heard anything back in regard to it  Basically  if you dont need to get in contact with ZenCity and your stay will be fine 
713002636,The apartment was okay and had all the basic equipment for the kitchen  Bedrooms and bathrooms were comfortable and of a nice size   The only issue I had was that for both nights there was a man speaking really loud at the street making it hard for sleeping  Hi  I like the unit although it would be nice to have some personal touches to the decorations  Also some plugs werent working   Thanks for everything
416449059,Great location  Very spacious place  Hey Brian   I appreciate your communication with me throughout the whole booking  I know you had a rough visit before us and I hope you got my note about the bed issue in the one bedroom  I just wanted to let you know we had a great time  You have a beautiful place however the cleanliness was very poor for our stay  We ended up having to wash towels and linen bedding because there was lots of glitter and weird substances and the surfaces of tables and counters were really sticky  The towels were left in the bathrooms damp too  Based on your rating I can tell this isnt your standard either so I just wanted to share with you  Thanks again for the stay  You have the perfect location for your place  Cleanliness was a really big issue for us  The home is listed with   bedrooms       guests   there was space for everyone but cleanliness of the entire unit was terrible  Towels and linens was an issue and we had to track down coffee cups etc  There was a overly used sponge and dish soap for cleaning supplies  For the price and description I assumed the place would be a bit more put together and accommodating  The host let us know that the visitors before us kind of trashed the place   we understand things happen but one of the beds was also completely broken  We had a super great time but we also had to wash the bedding and linens as there was many different substances on them  It didnt appear that the towels or any bedding had been washed  Bedding was really dirty and the towels were hanging on the shower racks damp  Overall handles on fridge light switches and doors were sticky and gross  The toilets and showers hadnt been cleaned either 
662400935,The host was good at relocating us due to a double booking  While the host did relocate us it took then an hour to do so  Very unhappy with the relocation   unexpected change in plans  Someone was staying in the original Airbnb that was booked  The host relocated us but the  nd place was a downgrade from the original booking  Very busy street
704278898,Ive previously stayed with Zencity through Airbnb   had such a positive   accommodating experience that I had high expectations for this stay with them as well  Check in was very easy   the location is great  Unfortunately  that was the best part of this eleven day stay  The apartment itself has so much potential that it could be a fantastic stay but the cleanliness of the place was terrible especially during a pandemic  when the cleaning should be very thorough between guests  The smell of the building  apartment was terrible so much so that I had to buy several wall plug ins as well as candles  The washer wreaked of mildew and the dryer makes the most obnoxious sound when its on  I reached out to Zencity about maintenance and was told they would let maintenance know and hopefully the issue would be resolved soon   and then nothing came of it  There were pubic hairs from previous stays in the shower and the tub doesnt drain so when youre showering the water is around your ankles  Hair that was not mine was found on the bedding  in the refrigerator and an entire clump of hair was sitting on a shelf   All of the silverware was dirty  There was a pile of dirt that had been swept up and just left on the floor  from the cleaner Im assuming    There was already trash in the trashcan upon my arrival  These things truly made my stay terrible  Again  not bashing Zencity as a whole because I have stayed with them before and had a great experience but this place in particular needs WORK 
662176264,Nice apartment right in midtown where we can get to places easy
718658529,Booked then was sent check in information that didnt work   We could get into lobby but the code given to get key didnt work  Was supposed to check in  pm day before and never got in ended up sleeping in our car while trying to find another Airbnb for the next day   Worst experience ever from my home town  
642933194,Good location in Lincoln Park Thanks for being a great host 
639135171,The space was in a great location  as well as easy check in  The only real concerns were about the cleanliness  A lamp by the dining area was falling off a wall  there was a weird stain on the carpet  and two cups of liquid hidden in the cabinet  Overall it was a great place  just wish it was a little cleaner upon arrival  The space was lovely  and great check in  But there was some concerns about the previous cleaning before we entered the space 
637444962,Good location  cute balcony  kitchen has some pots pans and dishes   with a few items like salt  pepper  oil   Nice size bedrooms and comfy linens   Beware the low water pressure in bathroom Sorry I have to be negative on this stay  very disappointed  Ive used Airbnb over    times in last couple years and usually have had great experiences  The smell of smoke permeated our clothing  low water pressure in bathroom made for difficult use of sink  shower and toilet  Please  replace smoke detector batteries and coffee pot and hopefully you were able to get rid of smoke smell  pretty awful  Sorry this didnt work out  as a great location  but I would not return or recommend this particular stay unless issues fixed   I was disappointed that I was not contacted earlier   only got updates from cleaning person  and he said he had communicated this to you Due to previous guest leaving significant smoke and mess issues  we could not check in for    hrs past stated  p check in   Never got message about this  I found out as cleaning person in apt at check on time and he told me   Smoke detectors also chirping due to low batteries Intense smell of smoke aside  decent water pressure   working coffee French press  was cracked    Fortunately the bar downstairs closed at   p
643371956,Good location  Building and units are dated  Tiny bathrooms and toilet area 
717892307,Nice lil place 
642858338,Great place but cleaning service needs to do a lot better I found a false nail in my sheets  the bedroom had not been vacuumed or sweeped  and the bathroom was unsweeped aswelll I found someone fake nail in my sheets  That is so unacceptable and dirty  The bathroom wasnt clean and the bed room wasnt vacuumed at all Its located right by the hospital so you hear sirens all day and night
636247287,The host ask that you park inside a gated parking lot where you need a key to gain access  My fianc  car was broken into inside this same parking lot  The gated parking lot has video footage in real time however the host  the property manager  nor air bnb helped us to resolve this issue  Our trip was ruined because our safety had been compromised  No one expects to go on a vacation and feel unsafe  I will not suggest anyone to stay at this air bnb if safety is your concern  My Fianc  car was broken into on the property that you all had us park in  This parking lot was suppose to be a gated parking lot where you need a key to access  When I called you all to report the issue the first thing you all said to me was  what do you want us to do   No one is being responsive to us to resolve this issue  You all have cameras through the building and our car was parked right by the camera but no one is looking into the video footage to resolve this  Customer service should be your top priority and to accommodate your guest  My safety was put at risk someone invaded my property  They stole my car keys and my house keys which means I dont have any other way to gain access to my vehicle or home  No one expects to go on a vacation where they are suppose to be safe and have their space invaded and while trip ruined because we literally spent the rest of our time worrying  The host didnt communicate well in responding to me with an issue
653935151,We arrived to the space and it was not cleaned  It was very grouse and there was dust flying out of the vents  something ive never seen before  i had to chnage a filter that looked like it hasnt been changed in over a year  There was a   inch build up dust  hair and dirt on the old filter  Not only was it dirty but there was a bad stench of a Cat and kitten litter in one bedroom that made the whole house smell  When i messaged Zen city all they did was tell me this was not an issue and that they would only send over a cleaning lady after we cleaned twice  They told me that was my only option and basically oh well  After speaking with Airbnb  they understood and saw the grouse photos i posted and got me and my girlfriend out of there   Lastly the washer and dryer are all the way outside  down a creepy hallway  in the basement of building  Not in the building    Apartment is nice  in a great location  I just wished we didnt have this experience 
637533662,Pictures were inaccurate  they must have multiple apartments here that they rent out  Communication was disappointing  Only two towels  one was a large bath towel  one was so small it couldnt wrap around me and Im     pounds  Overall  it was okay  Great location  underwhelming customer service  Its great that you guys have multiple properties in the same building  However  you should post accurate photos  Asked for check in info   hours before check in  was told I would get details  closer to my check in date  Responded immediately to my inquiry saying theyd get back to me  never heard back
633629018,The stay with Zencity was indeed professional and they were helpful  Finding parking was difficult  I tried very hard to follow the laws since Im not from here and ended up getting a parking ticket right in front of the building where there are no signs   Ticket for parking      inches away from the curb instead of    inches       Check in was a bit hassling  You cannot check in even   mins before  You have to be there at  pm or after which was not stated in the house rules  please correct me if I am wrong   I tried the code and was nearly locked out  My SO and I used the elevator multiple times and every time we pressed our floor number it went to a completely different floor   ex  pressed level    went to level   or just stayed on the lobby floor  It only seems to go to the correct floor when you scan the keyless key that they give you  which I didnt find out until today  The lobby was very beautiful and clean  Although  our room looked VERY clean when we got in  I decided to wipe down the counters and handles with disinfectant wipes so that I would not possibly contract Covid     The disinfectant wipes were dirty    which tells me these counters were not wiped off before hand  The bathroom floor seemed to have not been mopped  The bed was very clean and everything is functioning besides the thermostat  I am a hot sleeper  so my desired home temperature is set to     I had set the temperature in our room to    so that it would get cold in the room  Halfway through the night I was drenching sweat with no blanket on   I believe the thermostat AND the remote next to it to control the bedroom fan is broken  When I saw a c available for amenities  I expected to be able to turn it to my desired temperature  The bedroom fan works but only when the light is on  Although the stay was okay  it was a few things that bothered me personally  By all means  Zencity was very professional and communicated efficiently  The stay with Zencity was indeed professional and they were helpful  Finding parking was difficult  I tried very hard to follow the laws since Im not from here and ended up getting a parking ticket right in front of the building where there are no signs   Ticket for parking      inches away from the curb instead of    inches       Check in was a bit hassling  You cannot check in even   mins before  You have to be there at  pm or after which was not stated in the house rules  please correct me if I am wrong   I tried the code and was nearly locked out  My SO and I used the elevator multiple times and every time we pressed our floor number it went to a completely different floor   ex  pressed level    went to level   or just stayed on the lobby floor  It only seems to go to the correct floor when you scan the keyless key that they give you  which I didnt find out until today  The lobby was very beautiful and clean  Although  our room looked VERY clean when we got in  I decided to wipe down the counters and handles with disinfectant wipes so that I would not possibly contract Covid     The disinfectant wipes were dirty    which tells me these counters were not wiped off before hand  The bathroom floor seemed to have not been mopped  The bed was very clean and everything is functioning besides the thermostat  I am a hot sleeper  so my desired home temperature is set to     I had set the temperature in our room to    so that it would get cold in the room  Halfway through the night I was drenching sweat with no blanket on   I believe the thermostat AND the remote next to it to control the bedroom fan is broken  When I saw a c available for amenities  I expected to be able to turn it to my desired temperature  The bedroom fan works but only when the light is on  Although the stay was okay  it was a few things that bothered me personally  By all means  Zencity was very professional and communicated efficiently 
653504450,Be careful with this unit and renting from Zencity  Compared to other places Ive booked  Zencity just seems like a business and care more about the money than the ppl that are renting out their units  Honestly it is a business and not a person so it seem less family friendly like Im used to and not welcoming  They are not timely with their responses and not ppl pleasers   If you have an issue they always have a rebuttal but no way to solve to ease your mind and thoughts because you spent your money  I will no longer be renting through ZENCITY again  Also  the unit did have a couple bugs so I hope they fix that issue and sunlight hitting you directly in your face when you wake up because the blinds are broke  Their were roaches in unit and the blinds needs to be fixed if someone is there on vacation and want to sleep in it is impossible to do so when the sun is directly in your face 
636236068,Firstly  am very mad that I cant give a no star on this review  This is just a terrible experience for me and I would advice anyone thinking of booking this place to back off immediately except you dont mind dwelling in filth     this host handed me keys to an unsanitary environment  There was dust and dirt everywhere  food residue on the carpet and floor  the kitchen utensils were half clean and I found blood stains on the bathroom walls  To make matters worse this host offered me no solution and kept lying that the place was just cleaned  I literally had to partially clean this place myself just to get through the night because Airbnb werent answering my calls for solution  I have pictures of the whole experience and I await my FULL refund from Airbnb     
643007976,Nice place nice location but there was a rodent problem the host was not reachable my entire stay never spooke to an actual person the entire stay  After booking and receiving check in information there was no further communication nor response to my calsl and messages Thes is a mouse living in the unit you need to take care of this immediately i was very upset that I had to pay to live with a rodent  My girlfriend couldnt even sleep she was so scared  VERY disappointed Tried to contact a few times on my visit when I called i got a message service thats saying I will be contacted  Immediately and I nevr got a call back had an issue with wifi as well called the number and clicked the wifi option it says the information will be text to me and I never got a text
658709793,Place was beautiful my disappointment was shower wasnt cleaned and fingernail clippings was on couch cushions which told me who ever cleaned unit didnt properly clean it other than that the place is nice an location is perfect 
654301419,Great location  clean and cool place   A few issues of concerns  getting in the apt with the key fob  not enough towels and communication issues   I would love to stay there again just need a few issues addressed  Great place  location and clean   However the ac did not work and I messaged   I was told it would be the next day  I was not accepting that since it was       degrees   I was there for business and had an early morning   I needed a good night sleep   They guy finally showed up at   ish and changed filter and instructed me not to turn it on for a hour to a hour and half   So at a    pm I turned it on   Then only one bath towel per person  One last thing  one key fob  I was there with a coworker so we could not get into the garage at separate times   I asked for an extra one and was told they would try to find one   I was told I could access the building thru intercom which is inaccurate   Plus the key fob getting into to parking garage door and unit was always tricky   The door did not seem secure when shut   I had to ask last night for my check in instructions   I hate writing all of this stuff and I would love to stay here again since I will being coming to KC to work on a regular basis  I just feel the communication was not adequate and lack of follow through   Nice place and location 
644744586,The place was nice  just the communication with my host was terrible the whole trip  The place was nice  just communication with you was terrible for some reason  Besides that thanks for the spot 
711322202,This place is what to be expected for the price 
428267949,Slawik and Rebecca are really nice hosts and very responsive   The house couldve been cleaner and its pretty outdated but otherwise our stay was very nice  The house is located in a quiet street and has parking which was very helpful  Hi Slawik Thank you for allowing us to stay in your cottage  The only negative thing I can say is that when checking in  I believe there was a confusion of which house I was supposed to stay in so the house was not ready when we arrived on Wednesday    pm CST   The house couldve been cleaner but Im sure that was attributed to the entire confusion of which house we were supposed to be in   The kitchen garbage disposal was not working fully  It would turn on sometimes it wouldnt  There werent any clean sponges to wash the dishes  Im old school and dont use dishwashers lol    The bathrooms were very clean and thank you for the endless clean towels   Again thanks for allowing us to stay in your home   Thanks  Indira When we arrived at the house  host was confused and thought we had rented another property  The house was not clean and ready for us 
662987177,A great place to stay  Please get rid of the mold and update the couch  Its a great place 
700257562,This is my first and only critical review on Air BnB and Ive used Air BnB a lot  over several years now  Even on the rare occasion that a BnB let us down  Ive always found hosts to be honest and responsive   When we checked into this place  it was not yet cleaned after the previous guests  Like bedding in the living room  food and dirty dishes out in kitchen and dining table  That too during a pandemic where other BnBs have taken immense efforts towards the safety of their guests  I tried calling them  then sent images of the place via the messaging app   no response until I explained to the door person at the apartment that I was going to cancel    They explained to the door person that the cleaner had   other apartments to clean and this would take an hour  Only after I walked out did they message me  And when I asked them to cancel and fully refund my booking  they just sent me their cancellation policy  When we tried to mediate through Air BnB they falsely stated to them  that the problem was that we checked in too early  When in fact  we left well after check in time and no cleaner had arrived    Air BnB did a great job mediating but Zen City was terrible  Pretty apartment and would have been such a good experience if they were atleast moderately responsive or responsible 
661662584,Becareful with everything in the room  may be you needed to take pictures of everything in the room the first day that you get there  to prove that you did not do anything wrong to everything in that room I dont know what to say just feel disappoint  cleanliness and sincere
702742937,Wow  this place is beautiful   Sorry to say management didnt have the best performance for me   Check in instructions are literally impossible   They give you access to the building and access to the apartment   But you cannot get to the apartment because you need a key fob to get thru the inner doors   And  the key fob is in the apartment   IMPOSSIBLE   After successfully  breaking in  thru the building  I was able to reach my apartment and check in   I only had about    minutes prior to an NFL game being broadcast on a local tv channel   I tried Sling and Roku  but neither offered it   I tried adding the channel  but that was also unsuccessful   I think there might have been contractual problems streaming the NFL  but when I called to ask for help  all I got was an unhelpful arrogant pr ck from Zen City Management   All they probably needed was an antenna and local channels would be easy in downtown St  Louis   Brutal   I also had to ask several time and finally negotiate to get management to unlock the NEST thermostat   I just wanted to be able to turn the heat on in the evening and off at night   Dude said he would adjust it for me via computer   What am I ten yrs old   Cannot adjust the heat for a   night stay myself   Oh  and the hot water was luke warm  leading me to believe management had the hot water heater cranked down as far as possible     Oh  forgot  same problem checking out with the keyfob   Once you leave the apartment and keyfob behind  you cannot access the secure parking area if using the stairs   So  again you have to  break into  the parking lot because you dont have access with the keyfob   This wouldnt have been a problem if they didnt intimidate you into using the parking lot by saying street parking is illegal   No  street parking is not illegal here   Just a poor overall experience  Gotta change the check in instructions to make the keyfob accessible somehow  Impossible to check in with current instructions   You cannot get to the apt because there are inner doors which require a key fob which is in the apt Multiple attempts to turn on the heat ending with me negotiating to have access to the Nest thermostat   And  an unhelpful arrogant pr ck when I actually called asking for help
656154561,Clean apartment  Walking distance to many restaurants and coffee shops  Host slow to respond when needing to contact them  Minimal items in the apartment  e g   dishes   See previous remarks Would recommend having pictures in the check in process building is large and confusing  Also  card to use elevator was cracked and unusable  Therefore  we were unable to get to our apt on the   st floor  Sent message to host that night without any response  Sent another message in the morning and there was a response that the new card would be in the lockbox  We received it   with a lot of other keys to that same building  apartments that we did not rent  This is a huge safety concern  If it had not been for our friends that lived in the same complex to get us from floor   to    on the first night  we wouldnt had been able to access our apartment that night  There were minimal dishes in the kitchen for use  Come to find out on our last day  there were dishes in the dishwasher  unsure if clean or dirty or how long they had been in there 
656455101,good good things about this place where the location and the views  The bad things about this location where they at I got stuck in the hallway for an hour waiting for the a response to change the code on the door  I also received    tickets in the    days I was there even though I was paying the meter  If I had not taken the time out to go to the place where you pay tickets I would have been stuck paying all but one of them  Also you have to make sure all the bills are paid  First the electric company came out and put a disconnection notice in the door  I had to communicate with the host wow the man was in the apartment so he didnt cut off the electric  Also the Wi Fi got cut off and I had to call and get it cut back on  The place was not clean for us to be in the middle of a pandemic I would write the cleaning   out of    Make sure bills are payed up     I had to deal with electric company and disconnect issues Clean and parking     I got    ticket they forgave   but still 
710766207,Great area  place is clean   If more than two people are planning to stay  take notice that the only seating in the living area is a couch   No chairs in living area   No table for eating or for entertainment  board games  cards  etc      No REAL coffee machine like a Keurig or Mr  Coffee  If you are promoting your property as  can accommodate     people  then provide enough furniture to do so  My daughter and her friend came to visit and each brought their own outdoor folding chairs so they had a place to sit in the living area   Also  how about a small table in the living area for people to play cards  games  etc    No closet hangers provided  No  real coffee maker provided  like a Keurig or Mr  Coffee    Very limited kitchen supplies provided  plates  spoons  knifes  cook ware   These  little things make a big difference in ones choice to use your properties again 
720137267,You will sleep comfortably and the views cannot be beat  Just be sure the place has been cleaned properly before you arrive  I saw other reviews about the cleanliness of the space  Reached out to the host on the subject and never heard back 
719149888,It is very unclear to which building you will be located in  I a a problem with locking the door and parking  Other than that  the location was great  clean and comfortable
662115704,Nice location  beautiful place just need more maintenance work
664372208,Great location       mins from everything  We scored on free parking in the back of the building  If you have lots of luggage be aware your hauling it up   flights of steps they were very strict on checking in and checking out you check in exactly at   and have to be out by   am I flew in at   am I literally had to find nothing to do and was waiting at this front door to check in  So just know they dont offer any one that  This Airbnb for a small family not to much space in the apartment  We were aware of the stairs Ana we all had huge suitcases and i have back issues I think that should be listed  The dishwasher stinks really bad yall should check it out and for a person who wants the Airbnb to feel like home it would need more pots I had to buy almost everything to cook with those   pots wasnt going to make it work  The gate kept locking so we had to look like we were breaking in each time lastly they had a net problem they were in the trash can and where you Keep The broom and other things
656399832,Do not stay here   Horrible customer service and mediocre accommodations   Look for another unit  Im shocked that I was told by one of your agents that I would be compensated for the three hours I was locked out of your unit and never heard anything back  I was locked out of the unit for   hours due to the electronic locking system malfunction   It took Ive an hour for the cleaning person to show up and try the exact same thing I was trying to do to open the unit  This didnt work  as I stated to the agent several times   It then took an additional two hours for someone to show up with the master key to get in   I was told that I would be compensated for my time and Never heard back from anyone   What a joke 
716042622,Does not describe exactly as in photos  Overall not bad for short stay When we walk on the floor  creeking sound was coming especially in bedroom and hall   I found some dirty marks on the kitchen floor and in bathroom corners  There is no way for us to control the heat  Bedroom went so hot in the nights  The pans in the kitchen were worned out and we could not use them  These things need to be improved for better stay in future
709746004,This is my  nd Zencity stay and I have to say this apartment was quite disappointing from the other  The cleanliness of this apartment is lacking  its quite dingy  The couch is stained and the walls are not painted well leaving lots of crack and patches of paints  The apartment does not have forks or cooking oil or pepper  Legit  one fork and salt  There could be some major updates and this place would be worth the nightly cost  Yes  the view is nice but not worth the lack of cleanliness or care of the unit  The bed was comfortable but the bathroom was aold and has a lot of rust and spots on the ceiling  If youre a clean freak like me  I wouldnt recommend this apartment but if those things dont matter to you  then do you     also  the amenities are a plus  Restaurant and market on site  I was quite disappointed in this apartment  This is my  nd stay with Zencity  The apartment only has one fork and is not ready for a stay  No cooking oil or pepper either  The apartment can do some paining and upgrading as well  Please make it better 
660307410,Nice location
705464238,Lock your car doors  Sheets were soiled as well  The bedding was very clear soiled 
669623964,I want to be able to recommend this  because had it been clean it would have been great  Hoping its a fluke  But the place was gross  Food stuck to the stove backsplash  sticky alcohol rings on the desks  hair on the carpets and in the sinks   I didnt stay here  I have to travel for work or I wouldnt  WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC  corners cannot be cut on cleaning   Plus  yes they refunded their part but  I still lost     in service fees and    to park in their garage for the    minutes I was there  Not a great experience  I know its not one specific persons fault  but in a normal world I expect to not have hair clumps on the rugs  rings of sticky alcohol on the desks  etc  In a NORMAL world  We are in a worldwide pandemic  Protocol needs to be better The instructions do TRY to be clear But they need updated because the key pad is broken  you have to call a    go to a whole New garage  Its just a bit of a hassle  And then there are elevators right inside the door that ARE NOT the elevators you have to use so thats confusing  Then the elevators have a scan pad outside AND inside  i had to have someone help Me  They made an effort but It wasnt immediate 
653878246,It was a nice place  they had subscription services to watch on TV  Theres not a whole lot of space inside the apartment  but its a lovely apartment  Additionally  the check in process was awful for me  as I was there for an hour and a half before I was able to get into the apartment  Additionally  I paid for   nights  and I had to pay for parking  which cost me half of what the entire apartment cost me  Thanks for being a good host  There were a few issues with my stay which I mentioned before  mainly parking and checking in   but I would also like to suggest putting a coffee machine in the airbnb  I was upset when I noticed your french press was not a complete set so I was unable to make coffee in the mornings     The key fob was broken when I arrived so wouldnt work on any of the elevators or door entrances  Was unable to request another from office  Didnt mention that the door handle was broken and hard to open  so it was closed until the host explained that the door was broken  Additionally  when the host dropped off the working fob  they gave me the wrong code for the lockbox  I was trying to get into the apartment for an hour and a half before I was able to get inside and put my stuff down  Didnt answer any messages that I sent  but luckily did answer the phone calls  If there was free parking  I spent over      in parking for   days because there was no free parking available  on the street or in the parking garage 
702388602,Bare bones but the place was clean and location was great  Thrid floor hallway light was out  Two evenings unable to watch Netflix because too many accounts were logged in 
665432543,Mattress and couch cushions smelled very bad  Carpet had black mold 
657105033,This stay was decent  The listing and location were accurate and the room was comfortable and fairly clean  However there were two blinds missing from the windows  reducing the feeling of privacy and safety  The biggest issue was the keypad  Upon arrival I spent about    minutes standing outside the door trying to get in  After two failed attempts at using two different passcodes I was finally given a Bluetooth key  which worked well and was pretty convenient  until about three days later when the Bluetooth key failed to work as well and I had to call twice before I got an answer and some help  I will say that Zencity customer service is very polite  friendly  and helpful  which made the frustration of being unable to get inside my room a little less infuriating  Aside from these issues  the place was nice and overall I enjoyed my time here  Keypad failed to work for initial check in and continued to experience issues throughout the trip
663296164,Okay  WiFi didnt work  and I had online school  It was very frustrating  We didnt have WiFi during our entire stay and it was never addressed 
720459354,Good location  very small amount of dishes no toaster  poor follow up on repairs needed while we were staying there    Very comfortable bed  I was disappointed that I had notified Zencity that the dryer was not working and the only communication I received was that maintenance was notified  No follow up and no maintenance person stopped by for the   days that we were there after I sent the email note  I did a temporary  repair so we could get some cloths washed    No toaster and very little dishes 
665155533,Just had some issues with cleanliness  and it was a bit hot  but overall it was okay 
665493919,Very hard to find parking in that area  Didnt feel safe in that area
703322911,Nice place other than door lock leaving me in hall for hours After the door lock malfunctioned i was left waiting in the hallway for hours
663313973,Beautiful place but it has large rats  I would bet stay there if I was you  The place it self was beautiful however  it has a rodent problem  I saw a few large rats and they were running up and down the hallway late at night  Also  they were eating my bread and fruits  I would never stay there nor would I recommend it to anyone else  Had issues with getting into to the building and the unit upon check but even though in was after hours the host did respond quickly  However  later I had additional issues with with digital key  Still the host was very responsive  Thanks for that  Nice place beside the rodent problem 
671648242,Zencity place was overall a decent stay  The parking could be a bit challenging depending on the day   the place wasnt as clean as expected however it was still a decent stay    zencity was very friendly and straight to the point  Hey zencity it was overall a decent stay  It was just a little dirty in certain areas like the bedroom    living room  However we enjoyed our stay  Thank you for everything
667337689,A few missing light bulbs I think the unit had been neglected there were no trash bags or a key fob so going in and out was very inconvenient  I will say its worth the cost and a nice place 
666384105,Place was decent  The building an amenities are awesome  but the actual unit needs some  TLC Place smelt of mildew  the shower doesnt drain  bathroom doors dont lock  tv remotes were dead  internet had to get reset   times 
663015374,This experience was very unfortunate  Working in hospitality myself  from start to finish I did not feel like my comfort as a customer was placed at the forefront  I waited in the pouring rain for a delayed response of the check in details  The next morning there was shattering glass at  am right below our window due to the construction  Theres heavy road work AND construction happening right below the apartment that starts promptly at sunrise  The bathroom reeks of mold which is probably due to how old the building is  When I went to turn on the water  the entire handle fell off  The pipes were hissing and due to the handle literally falling off  it made it an incredibly difficult to just take a shower  Worse of all was Zencitys delayed and seemingly unconcerned response  basically saying I should have manage working with a broken shower on my own  For the price that their charging per night  it seems well within reason to expect a working shower and to be at least treated with a grain of care  Truly a disappointing experience  This experience was very unfortunate  Working in hospitality myself  from start to finish I did not feel like my comfort as a customer was placed at the forefront  I waited in the pouring rain after reaching out once I booked for check in details since it was passed  pm  The response came in about       mins later which generally might not be in issue but as a traveler in the middle of a pandemic  it left me waiting  drenched in the rain  The next morning there was shattering glass at  am right below our window due to the construction  Obviously not within your control but I do feel you should have a disclaimer to your guests that theres heavy road work AND construction happening right below the apartment  The bathroom reeks of mold which is probably due to how old the building is  When I went to turn on the water   the entire handle fell off  I did try to latch it back on to at least take a shower but the knob was too difficult for me to turn on my own  the pressure and temperature would fluctuate because I couldnt get a good handle on it and the pipes were hissing the entire time  Regardless of anything  you charge your guests      to be their own plumbers  Worst of all  is the delayed and minimal response and effort to even being helpful or wanting to satisfy your customer  Instead you say that I shouldve managed  not having an easy accesible shower in the morning  I stand that as I guest  it is not unreasonable to expect a working shower and at the very least your response in the world of hospitality  should be that of wanting to accommodate  It begs the question  why name yourself se city if this is an experience your comfortable giving to your guests 
669933110,I wish I could say I enjoyed my stay   Lets start with the good  The location is awesome   Just a short uber or even walk from downtown  and there are bike rentals   mins away so I rented a bike and biked to the museums and around Chicago  There is also a great Thai place STEPS from the building   Bed   The bed was quite comfy  like other reviewers say   Price   Obviously this is a cheaper listing in the area  so thats nice   Now for the bad      First off  walking in to this airbnb is like walking into a pre owned vehicle owned by a smoker    Maybe no one had recently smoked in there  but the whole place had a horrible smokey odor  Ironically there were TWO no smoking signs in the space      Second  there were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been cleaned for some time  Huge buildup of dust and dirt etc in the corners of the room  baseboards and cracks in the stove had food in them  These things made me question how well cleaned the rest of the space was   Third  the tub   shower had very little water pressure and took a long time to get hot  and every time you shower the drain backs up after about   mins of running the water  so you have to stand with your feet in disgusting shower drain back flow while you try to clean yourself    Finally  the bedroom also had top sheet   Only a duvet  Since most of the time a duvet doesnt get washed every guest  this was an additional gross factor    Last  you should know that street cleaners and construction vehicles of various kinds might wake you up in the morning  This might be seasonal  but while I was there at about  am every morning there was some kind of beeping construction or city vehicle that slowly drove by the building  Because the AC unit is in the window  it lets all the sound in    Oh and one more thing   Host says there is street parking in the listing  I attempted to park on the street and wound up with a     ticket  Clearly I missed a sign somewhere and so this is not the hosts fault  but I wouldnt stay here if you intend on having a car  I couldnt enjoy my stay because the whole place smelt like cigarettes and felt dirty  The price was good  but it needed to be clean and smell decent 
668640309,Looks like the picture bathroom needs a deep cleaning
716085187,I would not recommend this air bnb owner gave   men our codes to get into our air bnb to fix the heat but never notified us and we didnt have heat for   days on our extended day which was the   th day of our stay they decided to fix it we were freezing holes in the sheets  Rug linty boiler room was leaking  Forks and spoons were very dirty not like we were going to use them anyways but still HORRIBLE The key was hard to unlock we had to knock on neighbors door several times and also contacted the host multiple times during our stay  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
665131130,Just keep looking  There was no way to call or text the host  Air bnb messages went unanswered  The parking spots out front are not an option  Find a garage  Will never stay at another Zencity property 
718371497,Overall the place was fine   Had minor issues with the ceiling leaking water through the ceiling fan It was very difficult to get someone on the phone when I was having difficulties The first two days water was leaking from the ceiling through the ceiling fan which soaked my bed and had me scared to turn on the lights
719199145,smh
703318549,Overall a fine stay for someone who does not mind feeling a little trapped and dirty  Yeah I got something to say to mr DM the cleaner  The sheets were not washed before we got there and had stains and smelled like a cheap ladys perfume    
711899265,No comment When the Lock Screen failed the customer service was less than expected  Eventually we did get response but clearly they were unprepared for the problem 
704692845,Awesome Stay       except my fobs would not work to get into the building  or use the elevator  and it was embarrassing to ask people to let me in  then when I told  Zencity about it  no help
719199265,There were hairs in the bed and shower  the ceiling fan in the bedroom didnt work  the lighting in the bathroom is horrible  the dishwasher had an awful smell and could smelt while sitting on the couch  there were fake finger nails broken on the side of the bed on the floor and crumbs in the bed  The lock on door was broken and we had to stick it back onto the door to make it work properly  It took us    minutes to figure out that was the problem  The location is great though  The cleanliness of the apartment was not good at all  Free coffee would be nice to set out for guests  The room was unmarked  No room number was posted outside the door  Average communication
717391286,This place is what you would expect  Everything was clean and in place  However  there was only one towel for the week long stay which I found to be pretty gross  The air was stale and almost smelled of cigarettes  And the    digit long code made getting in and out of the door ridiculous  Not to mention the verbal code alongside the code needed to enter before you even got in the facility  Parking is stupid  so be prepared to walk  I would suggest offering more towels for stays longer than   days  Only having one towel for a week was disgusting  It smelled like smoke in the room like someone used to smoke cigarettes and it was still on the walls  Either that or the air was stale  Multiple entrances made getting in very difficult  Plus a    digit code to get in your door is ridiculous plus with your hands full nearly impossible  Trash parking and multiple entrances made this difficult 
452167326,This apartment is great for larger groups  lots of space and beds  Its also very easy to find and get into  My main complaint is that it was not very clean  There was hair all over the bathrooms and bedrooms when we got there  Brian however was very quick to respond to me and made sure I knew if he was going to be unable to respond for a little bit  Great host  great space but just needs a deep clean  Hi Brian Im not sure if youre aware but the apartment was quite dirty when we got there  There was hair all over the bathroom and dried chunks of something on the bedspread  The floor was also covered in dirt and very obviously had not been mopped in quite some time since my socks turned black after walking on it  I know you were in London so you didnt see the place after it had been cleaned but it didnt seem like it had been cleaned hardly at all  You may want to reconsider your housekeeper  It was very dirty and there was nothing stocked in the apartment at all aside from a few pieces of silverware 
485306924,The place is great for large groups  the space is very roomy and open to not feel on top of each other  But sadly the place wasnt very clean as they had a large group trash it before us  there was only   towels for    people for two nights  We had to make a target run for towels and rags  Overall great location  great parking  and could be a great space and value with a few fixes  Also if you love Italian food  we highly recommend Piazza Bella its walking distance  For the value I would have that place deeped cleaned  touch up  the paint  some of the doors dont close  the lack of towels and rags for the amount it sleeps each nights is very low  and inconvenient  I understand you had people trash it before us but thats not our problem  Arrived at check in time at   and the cleaning was still cleaning until      pm If it was cleaned  had proper amount of towels and rags for the amount it sleeps each night that would be great  Instead we had to purchase some 
673955924,The    Penn units are luxurious and with a great location towards the Plaza   walking distance   It has a lot of amenities but I was only able to use the gym due to COVID    even though  all the amenities are open   They assign you a private parking so you dont have to leave your car outside   I found the apartments are in a safe zone and the building has personnel checking out people that comes in  At my arrival to the apartment  I noticed the COVID    cleaning protocol wasnt employed   Under the couch there was a takeout sushi lid  the bathroom had hair residues in the cabinet and towel closet   I had to take care of the cleaning myself  The apartments are great  the problem is the Zencity Co  as the hosting entity  I had an accident at my unit and first it was a challenge to communicate with Zencity and when they did communicate  they tried to relocate me to a place that I previously told them was unsafe    Meanwhile they where handling the damages caused to the unit by the accident  I had to move for   weeks and pay for hotel stays while they were trying to get an available unit for me    They never got the safe unit I asked and stalled the process of finding one   Because my stay was time sensitive  I had to book another Airbnb  All because I wasnt provided an alternate option or accommodation in a safe location by Zencity   Thus  I ended up having to pay for   Airbnbs and a hotel room at once because they didnt provide a timeline on the repairs or even communicating what was being done   At one point  Airbnb had to become involved in the process   It has been one of the worst experiences Ive had with an Airbnb host  Zencity management is very difficult to reach    I had an accident at their apartment an I quickly notified them but they answered   days later when the emergency was already being dealt with   I consider that as an unprofessional behavior  If you a have little kids be sure to rent a   Bedroom apt from the same building which has a bathtub as well as shower   Having a bathtub with a shower in the property will increase the value of the apartment   Also for guests  it would be good to have a balcony with maybe   chairs and a little table to be able to admire the wonderful view you have towards the pool at night 
666812850,My girlfriend and I stayed here for her surprise birthday trip  The unit itself was everything  the description gave  One issue I noticed was that it was not throughly cleaned  but overlooked it  With it being a basement ground level pedestrians walking pass the unit can look directly inside when the blinds are opened  The mattress also felt old and sunken in  in the middle  The major issue came the last night at approx            pm when we returned from dinner  My girlfriend being pregnant had to use the restroom as soon as we entered  While using the restroom she seen a mouse run across the laundry room floor and into the bedroom  I didnt believe her until it ran from the bedroom into a closet  We immediately went outside  attempted to call the host several times  and leave voicemails  No response    I then emailed them  which they replied pretty quick  I advised them of the situation and that we need to stay somewhere else for the final night  They were able to get us into another unit   floors up  Before that we had to take all belongings into and down the hallway  checking to make sure other mice didnt get inside our things  We finally got upstairs and I did another walk through  I noticed this unit wasnt throughly cleaned either  The light switch for the kitchen and tv outlet were wired together  So the kitchen light had to be on to watch tv  The washing machine was also broken  with a full drum of  stale water inside  I contacted the host the next day about being compensated something for having to move out so late with a pregnant girlfriend for the rodent issue  then to get upstairs to a unit with broke appliances and partially cleaned and still havent heard anything back  The cleaning woman actually came in the checkout morning promptly at    am to clean both units  I told her the situation and she seemed nonchalant as of this happened before  Zencity did inbox and advise they would fix the issue with the washing machine  But that was it  When it came to  the rodent issue it was thanks for letting us know   Im not sure if pest control came out or not I feel like the unit was cleaned for the next upcoming guest and that was it  The location was great  close to downtown  I definitely would not be staying here again though and would not be gking through Zencity  Good luck If a customer call  call them back and dont refer to inboxing especially during emergency situations  Attempted to call  but no one called back
620785771,DO NOT STAY HERE  AND READ THIS REVIEW  I dont really know where to start with this review  I have never had a bad experience with any stay on AIR B B till now      First this place is filthy  I am talking dirty floors  dirty counters  Considering we are in an actual HEALTH PANDEMIC at the moment this is unacceptable  The  cleaners  and I say cleaners very loosely considering they did not actually clean  Tidied up no trash yes  at first glance it looked clean  Until you touched the counters  felt the dirt under your feet  opened the fridge and get hit with an old rotten food smell  Or just look at anything for longer than a minute   Stains everywhere  loved the big questionable stain on the master bedrooms carpet   sticky  overall  just absolutely disgusting  Not to mention the dirty BANDAID left in the master bedroom  I wish I would have brought with me cleaning supplies  but I did not expect to clean at a location with a     cleaning fee   Onto the couch situation and the kitchen chair   As soon as I step into the place  I noticed the couch  It was a bit lopsided thought this odd    on closer inspection the couch was broken  The legs of the couch were not installed properly or installed by someone who has never put together basic furniture one even with a crack  I immediately reached out to the renters regarding both the cleanliness the couch   chair   Received no aid in the matter just a  we know    also they knew the kitchen chair is broken as well  I expressed my need for actually working furniture since this is a basic necessity and I mean BASIC  I even asked for tools to fix it myself  No reply  Go figure  I actually had to flip the couch myself and attempt to jimmy rig it with a knife  I actually did better then the person who put this together Ill tell you that much   I didnt try to fix their kitchen chair   Maybe I should of since they clearly dont care   Lastly  we have the patio   You see that nice patio offered in the listing hell its even in the name    well guess what you cant access it  The door does not open to that area  So  you can waive at it from the couch   If you want to do some handywork first   Honorable mention  The lack of a clean sponge or dish soap in the kitchen  I did find a dirty sponge that had actual dirt on it and dishwasher gel  guess this is better than nothing  loved the empty hand soap dispenser it really added to the ambiance of the stay  I also have pictures of all of this   Followed by pictures of how I left the stay just as my own insurance  You can never be to safe 
718884193,This is not the first time this has happened  When I arrived the key pad wouldnt let me in  I attempted to contact and was unable to reach anyone or have anyone return my calls  I ended up having to get a hotel 
563971951,This was a very comfortable stay  Would use again  When we arrived  the lockbox code didnt work  My partner was trapped outside in freezing cold struggling to contact the host who was able to tell him to use a different lockbox  I say unclear instructions because the first lockbox should have been correct  but the contingency plan should have been known ahead of time too  Dangerous in Hyde park to be stranded outside  especially at a late hour  Struggled to contact host regarding above snafu
716074271,Overall the loft was amazing  perfect location and beautiful space  However the night that we drove in from Denver to check in to the Airbnb we followed the instructions to obtain the key and the key was not there  So late at night we had to find a hotel because we could not access our Airbnb  The host   company did not even apologize for the lack of their communication  Would love to stay in that loft again the next time Im in St  Louis but dont think I will do to the confusion and the stress that we experienced during check in  Extremely disappointed in the customer service of this company not once did we receive an apology for not having the key for us on our first night we were supposed to stay in the loft  Drove from Denver to St  Louis  in a snow storm so got in late and followed the check in Instructions and there was no key  So the first night we were suppose to stay in the loft did not happen  Very slow responses and didnt even apologize for not providing the key for us 
561053221,Communication was smooth and check in was easy  It was a great place for a short business trip  My biggest issue with this place is that when I got in  the heat was blasting and it wasnt easy to figure out how to turn it down  and the window in the bedroom was sealed shut  Zencity was very responsive over messages and sent someone the next day to take a look and adjust the heater  but the first night was sweltering  If it had been properly cleaned and if the heating worked better 
308099562,Kept well cleaned  comfortable living area  Loved the view from windows and the feel of the city  I just wish there was a AC unit in the bed room because it was a little to toasty for my liking  But other then that cute small apartment I would      recommend   Hey I had a great stay one thing I might suggest is getting a fan or something in the bedroom for more airflow because it was a little warmer then my liking  Also maybe having a nicer looking shower curtain although not a necessity it would make the bathroom look a little better  Other then that I live the area and the look and comfortably of your apartment   
301745969,Great location in Hyde Park right by the Lake   mi from the Loop  Clean and utilitarian  Downside is the high cost       a night for two nights  noisy a c  only one key set which requires going down   floors to let in partner  There were no WiFi or other instructions  had to email mgr  The Zencity company rep was reasonable enough for someone with no direct connection to the space  hes a good manager for an expensive crypto hotel chain with fairly crappy service   Note that this form doesnt allow for subtleties like noisy a c no WiFi instructions  not no a c or WiFi per se   The Zencity company rep was reasonable enough for someone with no direct connection to the space  hes a good manager for a crypto hotel chain with fairly crappy service      a night for a     sq ft studio with a noisy air conditioner  no WiFi or other instructions  no reserved parking and no bulb in the floor lamp bespeaks an out of touch ripoff corporation using airbnb as a front  
584720216,I liked the location  It around a ton of places to eat and shop  Apartment clean but not much for sound proof  You can hear neighbors above you  talking in the halls and when they come in and out as well throughout all hours of the night 
443704036,Zencity was a great host  I would definitely stay in one of their properties again  We encountered an issue during our stay  but their staff responded quickly to rectify it  If we did not encounter cockroaches during our stay 
76421041,Great location  but a bit noisey with proximity to W Ohio St and situated between   alleys  Apartment was very clean 
534408359,I would definitely look elsewhere for an Airbnb because the value isnt here on this one  I paid      a night for the unit and it was misleading  The pictures make it seem like its so much more than what it actually is  For      a night youll be able to find a way better unit in the same area  Hey Chris  Im sorry but I cant leave a   star review  The Airbnb was a bit misleading and the price was outrageous for the area  I was confused by the price when I booked and had thought the entire thing was supposed to cost half of what it did       a night in that small   bedroom apartment is insane  I looked around to see if other Airbnbs or hotels even came close to that price and they didnt  The pictures of the unit are also a bit misleading and lead you to think that the unit is actually a lot larger than it really is  I would like some portion of my money back  For the price you definitely need to look elsewhere  This is a tiny   bedroom apartment right next to a few elementary schools  The pictures make this unit seem bigger than what it actually is  Parking is a nightmare as well 
532947225,Good  Too expensive for long term  The zencity chat support was not overly helpful 
613986863,Apartment was nice but bed wasnt made when I came in  the bathtub didnt have a stopper and the wifi was treacherously slow 
437531933,Ive stayed at a few Zencity places and have always been impressed by the cleanliness and decor of their spaces  However  I would not stay at this location again  It was much smaller than anticipated  which was not really a big deal   since it was just me and my boyfriend staying there  However  the place was not as clean as we expected  The living room was dusty and the rug needed to be vacuumed badly  Also  the shower curtain liner in the bathroom had someone elses hair on the bottom of it  Ive never had these issues with any of their other locations so it sucked to have to deal with it here  Other than that  the place was fine  Hello   Some of the suggestions have would be to dust thoroughly  The living room was pretty dusty and the rug needed a good vacuum  Also  the bathroom needed to be cleaned more thoroughly as well  The shower liner had someones hair on the bottom of it 
703795453,The place is quiet  the gasoline station is   minute from the building  You can go for a walk along the beach  Its the only things  that I liked about this place  There was hair everywhere in a flat  including the bed  And its not mine  because Im short haired man  and the hair was very long and brown black  It was on a carpet  in the bath  on a bad  The bottom right electric stove didnt work  The smell from air conditioning was disgusting  Please come to the flat  turn it on and smell it  I was lucky it was cold outside so i didnt use it  The door opens only after   p m  not a minute earlier
598647000,The place was in a great location and it was absolutely beautiful  We only had a small problem with hair on the towels  so next time Ill pack my own 
707911689,Great location  Dirty kitchen with few utensils
435135529,The place was extremely far away from Downtown  The whole place smelled moldy  the fan didnt work and the light switches were very hard to find  The place was extremely far away from Downtown  The whole place smelled moldy  the fan didnt work and the light switches were very hard to find

584084199,Very clean  I loved the porch swing and king size bed  Front door does not have curtains  Concur with comments about ability to get out of tub when taking a shower  Cute curb appeal to  house  Decent location  some food in fridge expired  over a month  Not worth the price paid  Toilet upstairs had a problem  Unexpired food  ask guests what they want for breakfast
702119492,Very serious maintenance issues  Toilet  bathroom and kitchen sink did not drain  sewage pipe water bubbles up from the kitchen sink  giving the unit a foul raw sewage smell  Toilet did not drain  so we were not able to go to the bathroom in the unit  a basic expectation for a habitable unit  We were told a plumber would arrive  but never did  Hosts demonstrated extreme negligence for a serious maintenance issue  Again  we arrived to the unit to these conditions  Communication was timely  but largely unresponsive to inquiries or requests  I provided an opportunity to rectify the situation prior to writing this review  but you failed to take steps on repeated occasions  Responded  but did not answer inquiries and did not address problems 
708041402,Great place  but be careful when speaking with the customer service theyll hang up on you if youre worried about lost items  Lovely place rude customer service  Forgot laptops and when called for help hung up on called back and admitted to hanging up on me  Was very rude over phone  Luckily my ex had it from when we were working 
428699501,The location is great  Its a small  simple  but cool studio to crash at if you want to spend some time downtown  for a great value  Easy check in  very communicative  The only reason my review is   stars is because of the cleanliness  Chunks of food in the sink  random scraps in the bathroom tub  and random items left over from previous guests  Girlfriend had a real issue with the cleanliness  Other than that  it was a solid place for great value  Thanks 
558197805,The hot water and water pressure in the shower left something to be desired  Tv and bed were perfectly fine  Hot water wasnt working 
722022707,N A I wasnt able to take a shower for the two day I was there lucky I actually live in Chicago so I just went to my house and showered  Other than that everything was decent Parking
554124458,Do not stay here See emails and messages Quality furniture and cleanliness
589112781,Location was absolutely amazing  right down the street from numerous amazing CWE businesses  Parking can be difficult to find  but the listing states this  so just be aware  The property was relatively clean  minus some confetti on the common area ceiling fan  Some of the most comfortable beds that I have slept on in an Airbnb  Thanks for your quick communication and detailed information about the property  I hope my notices help you all to make the property perfect for the next visitors 
526229221,Cute place  in a good area The house was a bit disheveled when I arrived and couldnt watch tv  WiFi was bad  also unclear instructions for leaving
421475388,couldnt open the apartment door with the key given to us I had to pay for a hotel called several times with no response at all terrible experience overall couldnt open the apartment door with the key given to us I had to pay for a hotel called several times with no response at all terrible experience overall
523007539,You can expect very swift check ins and great locations  The view was also great  Bathroom drain was slow  Fix slow drains and check that sofa for possible bedbugs  I was bitten while sitting there 
522851200,The place was nice but it is way smaller than what the pictures make it out to be  The A C unit cuts on and off which wouldnt be and issue if it wasnt so loud especially at night  We couldnt use the parking garage since we were guest if Zencity so you should take into consideration that you may have to walk a long distance depending on where you park  The elevator smells and had a broken watermelon in it  The additions of Spotify and Netflix were good in the room  Just know if you have a lot of thing or if you need more space in a room you wont get it here  But for the couple days I was here it was decent  There was no parking I could find  The reason I found a parking spot was out of pure luck 
722014033,The overall experience was okay It was frustrating that it took over    minutes to get inside the building due to a broken inyercom and no front desk person  Commincation with the host could have been better when trying to retrieve left items  I reached out    minutes after I left to retrieve my items and I am still waiting for them to contact me back  Its been   days as of right now  Unable to access the bulging until a resident finally let me in   The screen broken on intercom  The host was unable to contact anyone at the building to let me in  I left a couple of books at the apartment and I have yet to hear back from anyone since       I sent the initial request to retrieve the books  It is now       
516629577,Dont even know where to start  Pubic hair on the  clean  towels and in the shower  Fire alarm beeping first night  all night  A C  Nest  kept adjusting and changing on its own  not sure if someone else was messing with it remotely but it is weird that the A C was adjusting by itself  Other than that  the apt was very nice and nice location  Beautiful views from the window 
516617969,Great location and hip vibe   but rough exterior and entryway   Comfy beds and linens   but lacked kitchen supplies and TV options  Older apartment with stylish furniture 
704234978,First Id like to say considering staying in Hyde park I assumed that regents was going to be ok to stay in during my visit  The experience I have over the weekend was horrible  First off  the walls were dirty  the couch  and the kitchen sink was linking from the bottom  The bathroom had surfaced mold around tub and ceiling  the bathroom sink had a disgusting build up around faucet  This location needs a serious upgrade  The most worst experience I ever had
512864403,Heres the deal   This was my first experience with Air BnB   Suffice to say that disappointment is an understatement   I could handle the fact that there was no parking as I was visiting my brother  in critical care  at Barnes and we parked the car there   But as soon as I went to take a shower and saw the handle was broken off and that we had to rig it to work  I called and left a message   I assumed  incorrectly  that someone would be over to fix it for our next day   Sadly  that never happened   I have no idea why they Wifi password written on the chalkboard was incorrect   Fortunately  when I called  someone clarified  you need to add        Funny how it works when you have the right Wifi password   So imagine our surprise when day two left us with very sporadic Wifi   to the point of connecting and dropping within a minute     Finally  I couldnt understand why my Bible was getting wet on the coffee table   When I looked up  I could see the ceiling was leaking   Again  I called and had to leave a voicemail   Suffice to say  no one called me back to see what the issue was   Fortunately  the girl had the front desk called her maintenance guys so hope it was attended to before the next guest experience the same   All in all  I cant give you a five star rating   Considering the price we paid compared a hotel and the unfortunate set of events that plagued our stay  it is simply not possible   At least with a hotel  we would have been refunded some of the money due the extremely poor experience  Heres the deal   This was my first experience with Air BnB   Suffice to say that disappointment is an understatement   I could handle the fact that there was no parking as I was visiting my brother  in critical care  at Barnes and we parked the car there   But as soon as I went to take a shower and saw the handle was broken off and that we had to rig it to work  I called and left a message   I assumed  incorrectly  that someone would be over to fix it for our next day   Sadly  that never happened   I have no idea why they Wifi password written on the chalkboard was incorrect   Fortunately  when I called  someone clarified  you need to add        Funny how it works when you have the right Wifi password   So imagine our surprise when day two left us with very sporadic Wifi   to the point of connecting and dropping within a minute     Finally  I couldnt understand why my Bible was getting wet on the coffee table   When I looked up  I could see the ceiling was leaking   Again  I called and had to leave a voicemail   Suffice to say  no one called me back to see what the issue was   Fortunately  the girl had the front desk called her maintenance guys so hope it was attended to   All in all  I cant give you a five star rating   Considering the price we paid compared a hotel and the unfortunate set of events that plagued our stay  it is simply not possible   At least with a hotel  we would have been refunded some of the money due the extremely poor experience  Shower handle was broke   no one fixed it  no one responded to the issue   Living room ceiling was leaking   Called and left a message   no response at all   You would think this would have registered as  we need to fix this   Location was described accurately  However  no parking available was a dissapointment  Had the shower worked without our rigging the handle and the ceiling not been leaking  the value would have been worth it   More disappointing was the lack of host response 
454092644,Cool spot if youre visiting Hyde Park  Old building but good value
508370925,The place was convenient and perfectly situated not far from UChicago campus  Too bad the building is old and would need some renovation and quick maintenance  The check in and check out was efficient and practical  We could stay in touch with Zencity all the time  which answered quickly to all our messages  We notice that the hairdryer was not functional  R novation de la salle de bain
508873974,My first weird experience on Airbnb  I made a mistake when booking since I needed a place where some friends could spend very briefly before going together to a friends wedding  I assumed that that would be not a problem since this place is published as  entire apartment   I understand that customer is supposed to be an adult and responsible person and they can act as if it were their home  this is not the case in this place so I think it is something that future visitors should consider  There is no such assumption of good faith here  I was even warned that I could be taken out at any time if I dared to take a visit  so if you are not used to these kinds of extremely conservative rules  it may not be your place for you  The worst part was when I proposed to change my reservation for two weeks later that I would return to Chicago  it seemed like a fair proposal since I would stay with them for the same price and I could look for another more convenient place  they simply ignored my proposal and after my insistence they told me that I could cancel  losing more than half of the money   The location was quite good  it is somewhat far from the center  loop  but it can be easily reached using bus and the Uber pool is less than    dollars  Also the apartment is quite comfortable and well decorated  the towels and sheets were quite clean  Only two small details  the air conditioning is in the main room and it is not good enough to cool the bedroom  and although I did not use the kitchen  on the last day I saw a small cockroach walking there  It was quite unfair that you ignored the fact that I made the reservation by mistake and when I proposed you to postpone the reservation you only told me to cancel losing more than half of the money More empathy with a customer that made a mistake with the reservation
508295349,There are quite a few things that could be improved with this location including the cleanliness and appearance  What you see in the photos is not what you get  Water pressure and cleanliness of bathroom bedroom and the pillows was not up to par  I highly recommend fixing this for future guests 
504411349,Good location  but parking is very difficult 
412479951,Wouldnt stay with this company again  You can check my reviews  I have nothing but positive reviews  I know when things are clean and when theyre not  Given the fact that this unit as well as most of this companies units are low cost  I dont believe this means that the units get to be disgusting  ESPECIALLY  when Im paying almost the same amount Im paying for a nights stay in cleaning fees  I had to vacuum the unit as well as use the disinfectant spray on all the surfaces  I went to the target around the block and got air freshener and candles  ran the fan for hours just so it wouldnt have the musty smell it had when we got there  This was our second unit with zencity after staying in another unit in the same building and having to add another night  The bedroom doer was broken  The bathroom door doesnt close as well as being a very outdated and dirty bathroom  The fridge wasnt clean and had old milk from the previous guest in it  The linens and the towels had an excessive amount of random lint and hairs in it  The whole stay I was very uncomfortable and this is by far the worst experience Ive ever had with Airbnb Horrible horrible response time  I even had to call to get a response and she said she would call me back  never did  Refer to above  Horrible response times  And it wasnt just on the times you guys claim to not be as available as I saw in other reviews No matter the price the place should be clean  I dont believe you guys even clean the units out  especially me coming from one unit to the next  the first being directly above my second
706211828,Very disappointed   Easily the dirtiest Airbnb Ive had to stay in  If I were at a hotel I would have requested a new room  Unlucky for my boyfriend and I  we got there late and had a flight early the next morning so we had to sleep in that filth  There was hair everywhere in all shapes and sizes  The sheets  extra sheets  bed spread  floors  walls  along the toilet  and bathroom floors all had hair  There were stains on bed spread    To make matters even better the door didnt lock unless you pushed it from the outside  We felt very unsafe so we slept with a bar stool in front of the door  Only thing that would have done is heard if someone came in   We stayed in one of their other places a few days prior and it was one of the nicest Airbnbs I have stayed in so I hope they make this right  Disgusting place would love a refund or I will be sending pictures and videos of the place to Airbnb  I recommend getting a new cleaning person and finding someone to fix the door that is unable to lock from the inside  Very dirty Other peoples hair everywhere  stains on bed spread  and the door didnt lock unless you pushed it from the outside 
409711601,What started out as a decent stay  ended in a terrible stay  In the unit that I stayed in  the window broke  and would not latch and stay closed  Thus  in temperature that dropped to    degrees  I was expected to sleep in said room  When I complained during the   oclock hour  the questioning I received  inferred that I was at fault for breaking the window  Seeing that I dont smoke and it was freezing outside  I had no reason even to think about the window  yet alone opening the window  When I requested maintenance  I was told that they were gone for the day  and would have to bundle up and wait until the morning  Again  it was    degrees outside  When I complained more  I was told to turn the heat up  in the midst of    degree weather coming in  To make matters worse  the radiator worked when it wanted to  barely emitting any heat  After asking for a refund  they said theyd only be willing to offer a refund on half a night stay  When I said that was unacceptable  Zencity ceased communicating with me  Needless to say  I will never stay in this property again  because they dont consider the health and safety of their guests  After staying in your property in March of      and referring to classmates to your property this past week  I was extremely disappointed and offended by the way you handled the situation with the broken window last night  Unfortunately  I would no longer use your properties when I come to Chicago or refer people to your properties  To expect someone to sleep in a room  with a window open  allowing    degree air in is not only ridiculous but dangerous  Im appalled at your lack of customer service  When I called the host with an issue on two separate occasions  they never returned my call  after saying they would  When communicating through text  the responses were extremely slow  There is no value in sleeping in a room with a broken window in below freezing temperatures and an insensitive host 
407625709,The space is a great location and a great deal costwise  The place was dirty upon check in and we had to clean it to stay there but that problem was fixed  Street parking may be a bit of a hassle so prepare to use uber lyft the host did not reply to the first two message issues with resolutions until I got AirBnB involved
407595473,The appartament was doubble blocked so there was people there when we arrived  The host offered us a new house but we endeed up staying here as the other guests left  The appartament is big the beds are very comfortable    Goodluck The appartament was doubble blocked so there was people there when we arrived  The host offered us a new house but we endeed up staying here as the other guests left  The appartament is big the beds are very comfortable    Goodluck
406993403,The experience was okay for the price  I think that next there should be a price reduction for the lack of heat and the room downgrade  The quality had a big impact on the stay  so much that I preferred to sleep somewhere else on the  nd night   I did not stay at the location that I booked The room was a downgrade but the price was the same 
708207717,Good basement apartment  well located given its value  Clean and quiet  We were unable to watch TV because it was being used by too many other TVs  This wasnt expected and was a poor experience  Cleaner was still in property
435538089,Not worth the price
486487059,Pretty nice view of the lake  About       from downtown 
404559751,Wonderful location  nice kitchen  shower does not drain  you may need to bring your own towels and linens due to the cleanliness of the ones we recieved  nice home  the towels and bedding had several stains on them  the sheets had BLOOD on them  just too many stains and dirt  the place is phenomenal however the lines bedding  and towels made the stay incredibly uncomfortable I wish I would have known to bring my own bedding and towels 
148348368,We ran into a few hiccups while checking into Chriss place  Mostly  it was due to the unit not being ready on time for our check in  Even though we had to scramble to find last minute lodging for our trip as the unit wasnt ready  Chris was gracious  He offered to provide us lunch  on him  He gave us a full refund  And  apologized sincerely for the unit not being ready  Pros  this unit is indeed in a GREAT location  Close to tons of fun shopping and excellent restaurants  Walkable to many great attractions  I would feel safe traveling here alone  Its an affordable Uber from the airport  Chris is able to offer many great recommendations for restaurants  It is a good value for the money and the building was cute  despite the unit not being ready for our stay   Please do not provide units to guests unless theyre maintenance issues are resolved and the cleanliness is kept up with   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  late host  Additional comments   Incorrect keys given  not able to check in on time    
708350481,Clean and nice location
483548158,Nice apartment  Parking was difficult at times due to street parking being limited  We would have liked to have a spot in the apartment complex parking lot  Furniture was not the most comfortable and seemed cheap  Over all the apartment was very nice and clean when we arrived  Host was very nice and checked up on us frequently  Thank you for hosting us  Very clean home  Parking in the parking lot would have been nice  Sometimes at night we had to park far away due to limited street parking  Not as close to downtown as we would have hoped 
481884024,Misleading listing  Its a mistake to deal with a host like Zencity because its a property owner  not a home owner  and they take no pride or care  What they offer is not worth the price and the standards of the accommodation make you think you wouldve been better off in a motel  Your satisfaction is not their priority  out smarting you to keep your money is  Dont trust these people with your stay  Have no pride in what they do and do not care about customer satisfaction  they do a disservice to the reputation of Airbnb
459776431,If you expect nothing  you will never be disappointed
714101701,Pros  Great location easy check in  Cons  no parking place smelled of body odor  No parking included is a pain car got towed for parking on the street
479924161,The CWE is one of my favorite neighborhoods in STL and I love that this Airbnb was right next to Wash Us Medical campus since the friend I was in town visiting is a student there  It is also close to lots of great restaurants both in walking distance or a      minute drive    I travel and stay in Airbnbs pretty often and have had great luck finding   star properties  I thought this trend would continue on my recent trip to STL but unfortunately it did not  This Airbnb has Pros and Cons  but overall it wasnt close to being a   star experience and in the end felt more like a   star    Pros  Clean apartment with a tech forward design  My room came with stand up iPhone chargers on the night stand  a white noise maker with several different noise options  and a mounted    inch Sharp TV with built in Roku in the living room with HBO  Netflix  etc already loaded up and ready to play  The interior is modern with black and white furniture that gives off a nice level of trendiness  Lots of soft towels for showering and freshening up    Cons  To start  a difficult check in process  I got in after midnight after a delayed flight and the access code provided in the email to enter the building did not work  I later earned this was because of system upgrades they were in the process of performing at that time  Either way  if someone wasnt leaving the apartment as I was trying to come in  I wouldve have been struggling to enter for a while  When it came to get my key from the lock box  the code did not work the first two times but did on the third despite my not doing anything differently  Next  extremely slow WiFi  making getting online nearly impossible  I never did any work while on this trip but even using my phone to check Yelp took minutes due to the WiFi speed  Additionally  the mattress on the bed was brick hard and I struggled to fall asleep each night due to not being able to get comfortable  I want to say that I am someone who can fall asleep practically anywhere and the firmness of a bed almost never bothers me  The fact that it did at the unit was telling on bad it was  Seriously  I cant get over how hard the bed was  and at one point I considered sleeping on the much more comfortable couch    Finally  there is no central air in this apartment complex  instead they each have wall units  The units worked fine and kept the house chill  so I wont factor this into my rating but did want to mention in case someone prefers central air over wall units  Thanks for the responsiveness during the check in process 
478178134,Save your    not worth the hype   Doesnt even have central A C
477654392,Good neighborhood and location of apartment  Decent value but common area carpet in stairwell was stained dirty and pictures dont fully represent the apartment  Apartments location was convenient and clean  But it had a VERY strong smell of cleaning agent which was overpowering during our entire stay 
475621732,Good location I feel I shouldnt have to pay a cleaning fee the apartment was not clean  If i didnt have to pay a cleaning fee the place was not clean floors were dirty shower was dirty towels had stains in them 
112571203,Chriss place is in a fantastic location  So close to the lake and downtown  Very walkable  Great cafes  bars and shops nearby  The apartment itself is pretty basic   nothing wrong with it at all but at the same time  lacks much charm and personality  It could do with a few extra touches to make it memorable or special   
472446426,Nice   clean on the inside  Very comfy  Didnt like the area too much   they were working on the carpet in the whole building  all the carpet was pulled off the floor   they started working really early so it was very load  Other than that  everything was fine 
470962956,Nope Zencity has always been responsive  But this stay was terrible especially given the amount we paid  I understand that you gouged us because of UC graduation weekend demand  Past experiences with Zencity have always been positive  Thus i assumed that for the money i paid I would get a nice place  Very disappointing  Two nights for over         Seasons would have been cheaper  Shame on me    Bad lighting  sofa sagging  back door was unlocked when we arrived 
528194952, 
468069079,This space is in the heart of Hyde Park  and the unit offers good views of the neighborhood and downtown  A deadbolt lock that we were not given a key for prevented us from accessing the unit  Lock code didnt work Took more than an hour to gain access after failed lock code 
468061139,Stained sheets  Clogged tub  After taking a shower  pools of water all over the bathroom  Missing items listed as amenities  soap  shampoo  salt   Not enough dishes to really use the kitchen without running the dishwasher constantly  No replacement trash bags  Sent a maintenance person without checking if that was ok with us  Would not recommend this location for this price   needs to be significantly cheaper given the experience 
705867750,My stay at this Zencity location was disappointing  My   stars are for the view from the bedroom and the convenient location  Read this review until the end because any travelers looking to stay at any of the Zencity locations should beware of the stunts they tried to pull    The Space This apartment looks a lot better in pictures than it does in person  Definitely in need of some updates and TLC  Paint on the bedroom walls is cracked and chipping  The hosts provide you with the bare minimum but honestly  there is nothing else special about this place    Checking in Checking in was quick and easy  Front desk staff was kind and friendly   Now  Ill speak on my experience  I knew Id be landing in Chicago over an hour before check in and when I asked the hosts if Id be able to actually check in early  I was denied which wasnt terrible but it may have saved me  a huge headache later  I finally arrived to the Airbnb at      on the dot to find that the apartment was dirty  as if someone checked out and no one came to clean after   Bed was not made  leftover food was in the refrigerator  living room rug and the kitchen were dirty  Im sure everyone has heard that COVID is still a thing  so walking into a dirty Airbnb during these times is the last thing youd ever expect  right  When I messaged the hosts WITH pictures  the response I got from Stuart was  Sorry about that  It seems there might have been some miscommunication over another tenant in the building using the space or not last night  Im checking now to see if we can get a cleaner there right away     Ok  so does that mean that someone else may have access to this apartment without your knowledge  Not a very settling feeling for a solo  female traveler    I did book this saying there were   guests for my own safety  and Im glad I did because who knows what else couldve happened    It was now too late and a cleaner was not around so I had the option to go to their other Airbnb which luckily was only a   minute walk around the corner for the night and then go back to the location that i actually paid for the next day   I was desperate and had no other options for a place to stay and agreed after going back and forth with the hosts and customer support about how much Id be refunded for my inconvenience  Zencity didnt want to refund me the cleaning fee for their dirty apartment but thankfully Airbnb customer support said yes along with only     for the first night   The new apartment was fine but upon reading reviews for it I found that a female solo traveler stated that a male cleaner came into the apartment while she was there  without warning and she was very uncomfortable  When I pointed this out to Zencity i was assured by Marty that the cleaners have already been notified that Id be checking out late so it wouldnt be a problem  Guess who knocked on the door at       a m  on the dot the next morning   the cleaners  More miscommunication Im guessing  They left once i explained the situation and an hour later i walked back to my original Airbnb and it was clean  Like the way it shouldve been when I first checked in  I was not very comfortable during my stay just knowing that someone else had access to the apartment  I was nervous whenever i left out thinking someone would come in and take or go through my things  I was nervous when i went to bed at night knowing that I was alone  but there were no other problems  Now heres the good part  Zencity had the AUDACITY to accuse me  a non smoker  of smoking marijuana in their apartment and had the nerve to request      from me because of it  This is the lowest  most desperate and manipulative thing Ive ever heard of an Airbnb host doing  Maybe theyre mad that they lost money because of their own mistakes and miscommunications  Thats not my problem  Like I said  the best part of this Airbnb experience was the view and location so travelers  beware 
456430835,The place was alright  The hosts did not respond when I had trouble with the wi fi code and the problem was never resolved  The wi fi code did not work  and when I asked about it  nothing was done  I was not able to do work at the airbnb 
455438756,  The AC was a little loud  Parking instructions needs improvement 
717881033,Nice apartment for the price but the intercom failed to work multiple times which left us stuck outside for hours  Fix the intercom and should have a number to call Intercom failed to work multiple times and waited hours to get in the last day
714957740,Strange problem filled experience  Earwig beatle in my bed sheets  Bizzare room setup  poor shower pressure  a building system that has you removing your mask to yell at a robot intercom system that still doesnt understand you  Broken appliances including broken deskside lamp  damaged tv with lines on the screen  weak pressure in the shower  The bedside lamp is broken  There were atleast   insects  The water pressure in the shower is poor  The   recognition system does not work well to let people into the building   There are no available power outlets for the lamp by the desk so it is unplugged  also no outlet ofc for any laptop the guest may use at the desk  Didnt respond until I called
448955958,The location to UofC was great  Cleanliness was lacking  Thank you for the great location to campus  but cleanliness is lacking  I love that there was a French press  The hot water was nearly non existent  thank you  I wish we hadnt paid so much for a room that was so dirty 
350894465,No comment No wifi for   days till you put an extension  No water during a shower  because the building is too old and it can not support all the people using the shower  Police at midnight in the next door apartment as guests were fighting        had to leave the apartment at midnight and move to my sons apartment  The suggestion is  THIS APARTMENT  THIS BUILDING IS NOT PROPER TO BE OFFERED FOR SHORT RENT  I WILL NEVER EVER TRUST AIRBNB AGAIN  And I am sorry for that because we as family have rented via airbnb in snowmass colorado  rio de janeiro brazil  filadelfia  atlanta etc     I am very sorry  Best regards The location is fantastic because it is close to the restaurants and shops  The problem is the building too old  dirty and UNSAFE
444254906,Location was great  host was very responsive  but the cleaning staff could pay more attention to details  Need to make sure cleaning staff prepare unit correctly for next guess  and be willing to accommodate guest better if they have problems at your location  Also provide a parking spot location for guest would be helpful 
442489620,We got there on time and Had to wait over an hour to check in   Waited an hour   after checking before I could get the keys  
443292989,  
442031358,When I arrived  I followed the check in procedures and put the code in the kiosk  They gave me   incorrect password  and I had to wait    minutes for someone to finally give me key to my Airbnb  When I arrived to my room  my bed was not made also had stains on it  The trash was also not handled as well  Other than that it was a pretty cool stay  The rooftop was gorgeous  Please make sure you fix the check in Key issue  Also  please follow up with the cleaning people to make sure they clean up the apartment before new guest arrive 
350214976,first of all  this apartment is rented out by a service  so there is no host  i would be wary of renting from a management company like Zencity instead of a host  since they dont really care about you  we had major issues getting into the apartment building and locking the apartment whenever we left  because this was a management company  we reached customer service reps who werent able to help us   only try to call someone onsite  when we tried to follow the instructions to get into the building  the zencity customer service rep kept hanging up  luckily  someone leaving the building let us in  otherwise we would have been outside much longer  when we had issues with the lock and could not leave the apartment since we couldnt secure our belongings  they were unable to reach their  emergency services 
438437046,Room was clean and affordable  had some communication issues with the host  Also  the listed wifi had no signal inside the room  The host forgot to send the code to get the room key  and then didnt respond for a couple hours

437314133,Would stay again
436650277,Great space  Much larger than it looks in the photos and it has nice big windows with plenty of natural light  There is a HUGE closet that is not pictured  Its walking distance from u of chicago and around the block from a number of restaurants  if youre coming for quick visit you may have found the perfect place   My main issue with this spot was the smell  There was a really awful sewage y smell in the bathroom and the closet  and the odor changed throughout my stay  so I know whatever it was  it was  fresh     The smell is easily contained in the bathroom closet area by a door so I had no odor issues in the rest of the space  I was Locked out of the building as I was given an incorrect set of keys upon arrival  keys received were also mislabeled Key issue was cleared up after a few messages and a phone call  However  when I was advised that the air conditioning unit would be installed during my stay I requested that it not be installed until after I leave  It had been fairly cold at night and I was concerned about staying warm  My request did not receive a response and the unit was installed anyway  The smell in the closet bathroom was VERY BAD
712867405,generic  they all are the sa h e  so if something seems a little off  it is likely a LOT is wrong  perhaps give a heads up if tradesmen are coming to fix things  dont forget about a problem when notified  the place was freezing with no heat 
548085471,So overall my stay here was good  But there was one big problem that I feel like people looking at this listing should know  the photos arent correct  When first getting there I noticed right away that the room I was in wasnt the correct room so I messaged Zencity  Before this they were responsive but after the problem came up it took them awhile to get back to me  When they finally did they told me that this was a new listing so they were using photos of a similar listing they have until they got the photos for this room  and that they had put in the description that they were using different photos  I looked and I could not find that anywhere  They also told that the photos are correct now  but they are not  So I messaged back asking where it said that in the description  and they never responded to that question and instead ignored it sending me a message completely unrelated  This was my first time using Airbnb and Im a little disappointed and not sure about the future since this one wasnt completely honest 
707119100,The location is great  within walking distance from several great restaurants and coffee shops  The studio is small  but cozy  We had to book last minute  and they were able to accommodate us  It is a ground level apartment that looks out on a parking lot  which didnt feel very private  especially since the blinds dont quite fit the window 
432093794,Could not check in  Called the host multiple times  no response until   AM the following day stating they would look into it  At  pm  the day after check in  I received a text saying that they would not be refunding me and that they were able to open the lock box 
432032247,Apartment is as advertised  Zencity staff are quite unresponsive  though messages often get ignored and you have to be proactive about following up  When we moved in  the bathtub was almost entirely clogged and it took several days for the problem to get fixed 
431265127,Poor management  Would not recommend  Learn to effectively communicate
599294734,I was wowed by the price and style of this place   The location was great  Check in great  The modern style great    But if you are particular about cleanliness  then DONT stay here  Hairs all over bathroom  shower  and rugs   Like a lot   And even pubic hairs   The elevator was out so we had to carry our heavy ice chest up three flights of stairs  Wont stay here again  Clean
595751820,Pros  The place is big and open     bathrooms was nice    Cons  It hadnt been cleaned the best  I could see dirt on the rugs and floors   Frozen beer in the freezer and beer was spilled all over the ice  I wasnt really concerned with any of that until they tried to make me pay a      fee for something on the rug   I hadnt even been in the place but to sleep   So consider yourself warned  they may try to blame something on you and get you to pay a ridiculous amount to replace it  The spill wasnt mine  For you to say it was a stain and try to make me pay      is ridiculous   Anybody could have cleaned that up  You should probably reconsider your cleaners  I didnt communicate with them at all If it had been cleaned prior to my arrival 
428989165,Everything Was Great But Went To Bad Really Quick  I Went To The Store While My Girlfriend Was In The Shower  Came Back And Slipped On Water That Was Leaking Really Bad Downstairs From Upstairs   Almost The Whole Floor Was Soaked   I Took Lots Of Pictures And Videos Everything Was Great But Went To Bad Really Quick  I Went To The Store While My Girlfriend Was In The Shower  Came Back And Slipped On Water That Was Leaking Really Bad Downstairs From Upstairs   Almost The Whole Floor Was Soaked   I Took Lots Of Pictures And Videos
428730106,Nice place  great location  hardest part is finding a parking spot at night 
362601149,Nice neighborhood  The place was okay  it just seemed poorly prepared 
722392118,I honestly just have no words lol
406997303,It was okay  A little dirty and the bedroom door was busted and the bathroom door wouldnt close fully meaning anyone could open it  The bath jets feature were non working  And the table was pretty chipped up  Other than that the bed was very firm almost a little hard but you slept pretty well on it  I didnt know if the windows were thin or what but it was colder in the bedroom and you could hear almost everything perfectly going on outside  I tried to close them again and the same thing happened  It was    dollars for one night so Im not really complaining I mean it served the purpose I needed it for  Seemed like the place was falling apart kinda
405176623,fumes were coming through the vents from the unit below  me and my bf could barely breath through the toxic varnish fumes  host refused to move us to another unit  terrible customer service  fumes were coming through the vents from the unit below  me and my bf could barely breath through the toxic varnish fumes  host refused to move us to another unit  terrible customer service 
721540559,The key fob did not work  I was told the security was supposed to fix the key fob but security told me that the company is supposed to take care of that  The door to get into the apartment was hard to unlock you have to unlock it then lock it back and keep turning it to you here click  Had to stand outside in the cold until the security guard came to let us in because the key fob wouldnt work every time we left  No parking  The view was great The apartment was clean Key fob did not work  Kept getting the runaround about who is supposed to fix it  Hard to unlock the front door to get into the apartment  Had to stand outside and wait for the guard to let us in
403347664,The place was nice but parking is horrible  The Hyde Park area is known for having first come first serve parking but this location was very congested  If you plan on going out at night  take an Uber or Lyft because Im pretty sure you wont find a park when you come back  Also  the elevators can run slow since there is over    floors so be prepared to wait a few minutes 
400570684,Nice location easy to find and chek in  close to everything 
578052840,Overall it was convenient  My stay there was great overall  there were a few things that didnt work in the house like the main bathroom shower was the biggest inconvenience
720460760,We arrived and had to put in a bunch of numbers to address the building then was promised a key fob to make it easier but it was missing   There is no gym access as promised  The direction to laundry were unclear and responses from the host were slow  There was a dirty lint brush on the floor when we arrived  There was also not as many kitchen tools as promised  Overall it was overpriced for what it was 
601049172,It is a good location and nice building  However  there were issues that were not addressed properly by the host  The apartment is stuffy  noisy and facing the parking lot 
363368689,Overall it was a very good apartment but there was a very disgusting smell of rotting meat throughout the apartment  We had to spray our own body spray in order to just sit in the common area  Overall it was a very good apartment but there was a very disgusting smell of rotting meat throughout the apartment  We had to spray our own body spray in order to just sit in the common area 
362609274,This host will assume criminal activity if youre black  DONT DO IT I checked in early because i didnt have to meet the host  When i called to see if i can check in i got an approval and someone else was already there 
360442768,Value was good TV did not work could have been a little cleaner TV did not work after communicating with Chris still no luck Perty disappointed about that Late night arrival could not see address on building due to bad lighting had to get out of the vehicle with a flashlight to see the number
351665375,The place is in the town and good location 
354376063,Nice place  Chris got back to me in a timely manner with whatever concerns or issues I had  Its a nice place but the quality of the furniture is extremely cheap 
353150776,The place was small and like the picture but it wasnt clean like the picture  And it had a strong smell to it  Great communication and easy entry  But the smell was really bad
352685647,Fine place  Two bathroom the first or shower broken second one the water cant comedown
346405911,Really wonderful location and well kept apartment  Minor issue was probably due to age of complex heard creaking and pipes going off throughout the night 
177707198,The apartment is clean and comfortable  with modern furnishings and amenities  Its a studio with a nice view of the pool and still has plenty of space  The location is great  walking distance to shops  restaurants  etc  Check in didnt feel super secure  though  and the host didnt disclose that a major crime had taken place in the unit next door just a few days prior to my arrival  Hi Chris  I was really surprised to arrive at the unit and see tape on the door next door indicating that the Cook County Medical Examiner had sealed it off  It looked like a death had taken place  and sure enough  after some research  I found that a gruesome murder had occurred there just a few days before I arrived  I know this is totally not on you  these things happen  but I would have appreciated a heads up  It was quite shocking  and although I liked the apartment  I was pretty creeped out the entire time   Did not disclose information about a major crime that had been committed in the unit next door  
582172033,Great location for Roscoe Village  North side visit  Easy self check in with code lock  Unfortunately  once inside the unit was disappointing  No pictures on walls or decor of any kind  Two couches and pool table  no coffee tables at all  Dining table was small outdoor type table with   metal chairs  The main room literally had at least    recessed lights   No coffee maker  incomplete dish set  only   bowl   Just no Chicago charm at all  Brian  please see my notes for why the value was just not there for this rental  Just take one weekends profits  do a little cleanup and some minimal decorating and tour place would be sooo much nicer and worth the rate  After check in  we had a couple questions and sent message but never received a reply at all  We did find the wifi info but never did find out why there were single serve coffee pods but no coffee maker  This place was just blahhhh  Not a single picture on a wall  no decor of any kind  Two couches  no coffee tables  what looked like an outdoor table with metal chairs    plates  but only   bowl  the hand held shower head was completely missing in the master bath  no coffee maker  the railing at the top of the stairs wobbled a good     inches  very unsafe  the paper towel rack in the cushion was loose on the wall  the light switch for the master bedroom was on the far wall so you had to enter a dark room and walk all the way across to turn on the light  Same with the kitchen  The handle had been broken off the dryer and there was a piece of a coat hanger stuck in there  Pool table  but no queue chalk that we could find  cables hanging out below the wall mount TV  Owner was wuick to message that there should be no parties  yet this property felt like a college frat house environment  For about       you could completely change that and make this a really nice rental 
339624408,It was a good stay  But  I think it was overpriced  The couch wasnt comfortable and there were not  a lot of amenities  tooth brush  tooth paste  snacks   I just think that for what we paid we couldve been accommodated a little more  Hey  the couch wasnt very big or comfortable 
338468887,Overall the studio is in good condition  It is not a luxury studio  so if you want fancy  this is not for you  The location is nice  close to restaurants and campus  About       minutes to University of Chicago  depending on how fast you walk  I didnt give five stars because the bathtub was not very clean and it also had draining issue  After the water ran for   minutes  water started accumulating and covered feet  This was uncomfortable  I emailed Chris about this issue on the second day  but the issue was still not solved after I checked out five days later  Hope this issue can be solved now so the next guests can have more comfortable shower experience 
595081744,The apartment was lovely  however  there were just multiple issues that were beyond the control of the host  A leaky roof and the entrance device had been taken by the previous guest  The device used for the parking and entering the apartment had been taken by the previous guest so anytime we went to enter we had to renter a   digit access code
332557996,You will be staying in a bit of a construction zone as the building is under construction   It is noisy during the day   The heating system smelled like natural gas when we tried to turn it on   I had an employee enter the apartment without our permission while I was staying there and greet us in the morning unexpectedly 
329364005,Amazing location and very spacious  Small cleanliness issue  but was easily fixed with a few wipe downs and vacuuming  Would definitely come again Only suggestion I have is to do one deep cleaning to get rid of pesky bugs on the shower curtains  the rest of the bathroom and the room  Other than that it was an absolutely amazing space    Thank you so much for a great place 
322612992,With a few adjustments  the unit is okay  There is no window covering on the main door to the unit  with it being glass  Id recommend placing a curtain or blinds over the door 
319217665,Toooooo hot  Walked in at     checked an hour later and it was now     Ac ran nonstop all night  loudly  but still never dropped below       Smoke detector hanging from the roof instead of being properly installed   Otherwise  location  the place itself  and the instructions to get in were all good  Nice location overall but the AC was terrible  It was just too hot  We were pretty much sweating all night    There was also a hanging smoke detector  instead of being mounted  Not sure if that was even functional or not  Definitely not up to code  Could be cheape
347555347,A reasonable place  but we had problems with a sewage smell in the apartment   We aired out the house and closed the tub drain and that seemed to fix it   Otherwise  a nice place  Again  it was a reasonable place but we were disappointed by the sewage smell and the lack of responsiveness to our call  We called about the sewage smell and the phone receptionist said someone would look into it and call us back   We never heard back  Price seemed somewhat high   Not unreasonable  except for needing to deal with sewage smell 
309113130,The apartment had ants in the bathroom and large bugs crawling on the walls in the bedroom  The A C went out multiple times during our stay  if you plug in too many things at once the power goes out  The apartment did have nice furniture arrangements   The A C went out the first day  and we notified the host  but it was not fixed until the next morning 
308020656,The pictures definitely look better than the reality of this place  The building is quite old and out dated  The shower head is old and ineffective  needs to be replaced    The worst thing about this place is the A C unit they have in the space  Its an old window air conditioner  it blows out cool air but doesnt cool the room at all  youll just be sitting there for hours waiting for the room to get cool and it wont happen    I couldnt sleep and had to check out the next day and pay extra for a hotel for the rest of my trip   I definitely recommend not staying here  theres definitely much better options closer to the city  and Zencity charges a     cleaning fee  but for what  You should invest in a proper A C unit and a better shower head  you shouldnt accept guests until you have resolved these issues  You cant run an airbnb like this and I feel cheated  
306888062,Good communication with the host  Sofa bed is not suitable for sleeping  The bed is very comfy  The common hallway is super stinky  
712475189,double check that apartment has been cleaned thoroughly before you book  this place smelled heavily of cigarettes and was dirty all around  had to leave and book a told me they would refund me and then went ghost great price   great building but not as depicted
303546516,Good but AC isnt effective  
303011341,The room was clean  quiet  nice bed and conveniently located near U Chicago  Everything was great except the room was uncomfortably warm and stuffy despite having the AC and fan on  Everything was great except the room was pretty warm and stuffy even with the AC on high  fan on and fewer lights on   Woke up sweating   Notify host and he said he will check it out the next day but it was our last day of stay   
342448945,Location was great  close to stores  restaurants and U Chicago  Parking was tough sometimes  but expected  Location to U Chicago was great as was neighborhood  Parking was an issue  but we expected that  The folks upstairs were extremely loud  until about  am  Mostly just loud foot traffic  Hazard of staying on bottom floor I guess  Took a few tries to open the door  You had to pull the door handle and input code so the lock would release 
716311538,This apartment was very clean  spacious enough for     people for a few days   check in was horrible  Starters on essentials  If trying to find parking at night be prepared to drive around for    min or more  This apartment was very clean  spacious enough for     people for a few days   check in was horrible  Starters on essentials  If trying to find parking at night be prepared to drive around for    min or more 
293162648,Just a heads up to future travelers  this building is very much under construction as of July       The description says  a quiet getaway  and that is definitely not what you are going to get in this apartment  Its very loud and felt like you were in a construction zone during the day  The workers are talking  yelling   using power tools right outside our door on the  th floor    Would have been nice to know ahead of time that the building was under construction and to expect some noise during our stay  Also  internet was very very spotty  Lost internet TV service for    minutes at a time  about   times a day while we were staying here  Also  this wasnt an issue for us  but  you do have to walk up a lot of stairs to reach the apartment  It was fine for us but I could see it being an issue for others    Other than the construction  which Im sure is just temporary  the apartment itself is exactly as shown  Very clean and nicely decorated  Had the basic amenities  The best was firm but comfortable  It was extremely quiet at night  which is nice since youre on a very busy street    The location is fantastic  very close to many bars   restaurants and right by the Damen blue line CTA station  If the construction doesnt bother you  this place is absolutely fantastic  But if youre looking for a quiet place to relax during the day  this probably isnt the place for you   It was extremely disappointing that you did not mention the fact that there would be ongoing construction in the building and on the floor we were staying on  It was extremely loud and uncomfortable having workers yelling back   forth to each other throughout our stay  Power tools being used at very early times  definitely not the  quiet  getaway as advertised  
290079008,Great location but more hotel than home away   Although you have a lovely looking apartment  It was very obvious that no one lives here as a number of essentials were not in place from the start to the end of my trip  Internet  Iron  TV remote  blocked bath tub   Took a while to verify key handover   Gaps in information  I had people coming into the apartment without being notified
285369518,Apart from some problems with the sink and the laundry during our stay  we enjoyed our stay  Towels and linens could be cleaner  but we werent too bothered 
171002431,Very clean and Chris was very responsive  One note  we stayed on a Saturday night and got very little sleep because of the noise from the neighbors and individuals outside  
332560086,It was really bad experience  I dont recommend this apartment or host at all   While Im sleeping someone tried to open the door by the code and the end she entered right and she told me that she wants the other floor but my concern that how other people can open and know the code of this apartment  Also  the host isnt responsible at all  I cant reach her  so at the midnight I left the apartment and she called me on the morning shell send someone to change the code thats what she offers after all bad experience happened  I really advise everyone to not book this apartment if you care about your safety and have family  They dont have any responsibility 
276742111,Lovely location and balcony  Walls paper thin but quiet neighborhood  Bathroom was not great but livable  Had problems with plumbing all week We are not picky   but living with a smelly sink all week was pretty nasty Said he would come to fix sink all week   did not show Expensive for what you get here  Location great   all else mediocre
567136249,The location is fine  However  the impression of the pictures is misleading and cleanliness is an issue  The place is just worn down and needs a remake  All written above  Carpets are done and someone needs to clean the apartment and wet clean the floor until its not sticky anymore  The place was not wet cleaned for a very long time 
582210073,Apartment is cute  few discrepancies that need to be addressed  Overall experience good  Shouldnt have had to contact host for checking information  should have been in my box  Location good  parking at a toss up 
258148512,I feel a responsibility to share that I was burned by an uncovered radiator that was flaming hot in this place  The radiator is in the bathroom  My stay was during the last weekend in April    I ended up in urgent care and have been in pain    and I know I was lucky it wasnt worse  I do hope Chris will have these covered soon to prevent future injuries  and have suggested this  Other than my burns  this is a pleasant and very clean apartment in a convenient part of Hyde Park  The radiator must be covered to prevent future injuries 
714715335,Be prepared to pay a lot for parking but the stay in the loft was doable  The furniture is very low to get in and out of  So bring extra pillows  We made rhe most of our stay but i would like to see somethings done a little better  Like doors that lock naturally  not so low furniture  it made it hard to ger in and out of  cleaner walls there were a lot of scuff marks  But we did make the most out of and found ways to enjoy our stay  Thank you again  Directions were a little vague Downtown with no parking except after enforcement hours   no near by parking
702741811,Dont plan anything for the start of your trip because the room might not be ready on time  We had to wait over an hour in the cold for them to finish cleaning our room and provide the key  The room not being ready at our check in time was very disappointing  Financial compensation would be appreciated and then I would increase my review  We were late to our dinner plans  had to stand out in the cold  and created conflict between my girlfriend and I  Extremely disappointing  Our check in time was      and the room wasnt ready  We had to stand outside in the cold for over an hour before we could check in  This was a very disappointing start to our trip  We wont be using this company again 
598176962,Nice place with an amazing view Try to get fresher blankets  towels  etc  They towels and sheets had stains
226259645,Nice appartment with all the appliances youd need  walls are a little thin though and Chris got pretty rude when we checked out    mins late   Having let him know in advance we were a little late waking up   Thanks for having us stay  Not sure whats happened with the towels so sorry for any mix up   CHECK Out  
142527147,Chris is very responsive and there were some very nice touches  such as leaving snacks   I stayed during a cold couple of nights and was freezing  the radiator heat didnt work that well and there was no wall thermostat  one of the knobs had come off the radiator and this was how you controlled the heat    Place was pretty charming and clean overall  but could use a good thorough dusting and vacuuming   Great location  a bit noisy on the  th floor  walk up  from outside   Occupancy  cleaning and AirBnb fees added up and I wouldve saved money with a hotel   Im getting less enthused about AirBnb         Given the occupancy tax  cleaning fee and airBnb fees  this isnt really a bargain  
197181662,Great location to explore the marvelous city of Chicago
709231941,While the location of the unit and the host communication were stellar  the cleanliness of the unit was not  To be honest I was very disappointed in my stay  Besides not being able to work the TV because there was no remote  and the Roku apps I downloaded did not work because there was no way to turn the TV on  was the least of my disappointments  The countertops had dried soap on them  There were dirty footprints on the floor  There was a Dorito on the floor behind the couch  Most upsetting of all was I found two different kinds of hair in the bed  I seriously think the unit was not cleaned after the previous guest checked out  Two different kinds of hair lead me to believe this to be true 
297848816,Looks just like the pictures  Cute and modern  Would recommend 
85499482,The location was awesome   The place was cute and offered what we needed   
594473218,Nice location and apartment  We were disappointed in  our stay as we had issues checking in and with amenities in the apartment  Keys were mixed up and somebody had to come figure out which key we needed  Not helpful  generic responses that didnt resolve anything
526210886,Location is excellent  Walk to get breakfast and sit in the park or on the water to eat it  Building is very nice  easy access to everything in Chicago  The rugs are gross  really should lay flooring  The bed is is very small for such a large room  Mattress and pillows are terrible  Need drapes that fit the windows so the light doesnt peer through at sunrise not allowing sleep 
524341490,The place is very cramped  The building had a nasty smell  The place looked very unsafe and the deadlock for the door was not working  There is lot of bleach and clorox smell in the room  I decided to vacate earlier than my stay due to these reasons and didnt receive refund  Dont stay here  The place is very cramped  The building had a nasty smell  The place looked very unsafe and the deadlock for the door was not working  There is lot of bleach and clorox smell in the room  I decided to vacate earlier than my stay due to these reasons and didnt receive refund  Dont stay here 
524318881,Great place with an even better location  Only had one problem with this place  The air conditioner did not work in the bedroom  When I reached out to them about this they said they were aware of the issue and that flipping the breaker would get it working again  Only problem is it would only work for       minutes before it stopped working and flipped the breaker  So needless to say this was not a solution and I had no air conditioning in the bedroom all week  Great place  But the suggestion to just flip the breaker to get the ac to work in the bedroom is not a solution  Not even fifteen minutes later and it had stopped working again  An air conditioner that worked in the bedroom 
715232352,The key fob wasnt there and the response was terribly slow and non existent from the host  It didnt really matter just had to use the keypad  the listing says      fee for the missing fob  hopefully I wont be charged since it wasnt there upon check in  Place was ok  blind was broken and kinda loud next to the train but its Chicago  Some foreign hair was present throughout the airbnb   
608117844,The price is right  so you cant expect perfect   The floors and overall cleanliness was average   My only real issue was I arrived to no toilet paper  soap  or shampoo for a shower   There was hand soap available   The apartment is nice in a decent location but the price is indeed very good   Overall a   star experience 
600030997,I ended up not staying there due to the building itself  The hallways had a strong  unpleasant odor and the space itself wasnt the vibe I expected 
466879620,No electricity  hot water  or gas  We checked in around    pm  exhausted from a long day of traveling  The check in instructions were incorrect  so we were led to the wrong door to enter the building  When we finally heard back from the host  after waiting outside in the dark for almost a half hour  they told us that even though the instructions say  the door to the left of the lock box   and there is a door directly left to the lock box  you are supposed to go to the second door  which is further down the building and not at all referenced in the instructions  When we finally got in  there was no power in the entire unit  Again  it is    pm  we are very tired  and already irritated because we couldnt get in to the place  Again  I have to message and call the host and wait for someone to get back to me  They tell me they have to call the electric provider so we just need to wait  We waited almost an hour in the dark until the electricity was reset   After that  we are all so exhausted we get ready for bed  We try the hot water and its not working and we figure  maybe it just needs to heat up and we will try again in the morning  We were wrong  There was no hot water all weekend  We had to take ice cold showers  Again  the host told us it was a provider issue and we just needed to wait  There was also no gas   so we were unable to cook   I am not a high maintenance person  and I realize this was a relatively inexpensive spot for a Chicago stay  but electricity  gas  and hot water are basic living needs  They wouldnt put us in a new place and they would only refund us half of what we paid  after I went back and forth with Airbnb all day   Instructions for check in were wrong   It led us to the wrong door  and then we had to wait    minutes to hear back from the host who finally responded to tell us  Oh yeah  the instructions say the door to the left of the lock box but really its the second door further down   This was all at    pm when we were exhausted from traveling and just standing outside in the dark trying to get in  Because its a company  you have to wait to get through to people and give them all your information just to talk to someone  Electricity  hot water  and gas 
518989014,The two most important things about a place to stay are the bed and the shower  They are the things that you cant do anywhere else  Everything about this place except those two things was   stars  but they alone dropped it down to   stars   The bed was very soft and had an exceptionally warm comforter  Those may sound like good things  and for some people maybe they are  but the result for me was that every morning I woke up drenched in sweat and with severe back pain  Any amount of the comforter covering me would cause that part to sweat because it did not breath at all   I would recommend immediately purchasing a firmer mattress and a more breathable comforter  Ive stayed in many hotels and Airbnbs  and this is the worst sleeping experience I can remember   The shower barely drained  I complained the very first night of a week long stay  they said theyd  filed a maintenance request   and I never heard another word about it  Despite cleaning the incredible easy to clog drain grate twice myself  which was disgusting   I never managed to take a shower with less than   inches of water pooling at my feet  A disgusting way to start every day   I would recommend getting a less easily clogged drain grate  making sure its cleaned every flip  and checking that the drain is functioning properly more often  I would also recommend making sure to have someone in the unit fixing a problem within    hours of a complaint like this  Complained of shower drain issue and was told a  maintenance request has been filed  but never heard back after that about anything actually being done 
518517468,While overall clean and safe  this unit is very bare bones and is more a place to drop ones head at night  The walls are fairly thin  and noise travels through them  as well as bathroom vents  Despite all the warnings to be quiet on our end in the listing  even when just speaking  neighbors could be heard  were coming from NYC and have a fairly high neighbor noise tolerance too   That said  location wise this was perfect for our purposes  close to family we were visiting     as well as nearby to groceries  a number of parks  the lake  and the train  but in general for city sightseeing or to from ORD could be a bit far for some  Hi there  An automatic  or k cup  coffee maker would have been much appreciated  More towel racks in the bathroom are needed  as are more essentials    shampoo  conditioner  soap  etc  Also this was noted as a new listing  but the duvet covers on one bed were torn and felt a little thread bare in general  and there was some blood on the other  Also  I realize the keypad is safe  but an override once in the unit  or an extra deadbolt locked from the inside would have felt safer 
601529149,apartment was cute   nice amenities    it could have been a little cleaner   window sills could use some attention       The apartment had a very strong smell of Pot most of the time    in fact many of the apartments in the building reeked of Pot 
593686943,Great location 
590461156,The place was very beautiful  Only problems I had were the ceiling started leaking water and the fog for parking wasnt available upon check in  Fog was missing for parking
716876108,I would have had a better experience at the motel    This was the absolute worst experience Ive ever had  We couldnt get into the apartment for over   hrs  When we did the apartment had no heat and was beyond freezing  We were told to turn on the radiators and the noise would stop after a few minutes  We turned them on and went to dinner to escape the cold and noise only to return to a freezing cold apartment and raging radiator  We were told nothing they could do and other guests complained before but it would stop  It never stopped and the heat never cut on  Not to mention the dirty dishes  Best part  host was unapologetic and seemed irritated with our request for a warm place to sleep  Unable to open the door with because they provided the wrong code  Then i was unable to contact anyone Host answered our messages several hours later No heat in the apartment  We slept in full clothes
508944801,Skip this nightmare  The building is dark and dank  the elevators out of service  None of that is Zencitys fault  but their slow responses when something goes wrong  in my case  a very active cockroach in the bathroom  make this an unpleasant stay  and simply not the small savings  I am still waiting for a reply to my most recent message regarding my refund  In the meantime  I hope youve done a thorough cleaning and extermination in the studio  Information about how to find the lock box was a little confusing  but the lack of information about which floor a room was located on  and how to get there  meant I wandered around a bit trying to find my way 
582152597,Building was not very nice however the inside of the apartment was great  It took until day five of our stay for the dishwasher to get fixed but overall it was a very nice place 
580455273,Bath tub takes forever to drain   Basically taking a bath and shower at the same time   Very small apartment   Washer and dryer downstairs and u have to pay with a debit card to wash and dry your clothes 
130807511,Great location   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   Had to wait to check in  
578685951,Nice place but still under construction  Washer machine flooded  no response to fix it  Terrible experience 
613669207,Parking was expensive  Place was nice  Clean and comfortable  The parking could have been better  Adding a parking pass for guess to use would be helpful 
532411922,Very good
611684950,This is a below average quality corporate apartment  Flat was not clean upon arrival  Extra linens were clearly dirty  Dishwasher does not work  Dishwasher does not work  Flat not clean upon arrival   Extra linens just balled up in closet and not clean  Neighbors dogs barking at all hours of day and night 
713444009,excellent space for short term housing  unfortunately   if you plan to stay longer than a weekend or are here for a work contract    they refuse to allow access to the mail  must find temporary mail services    first time ever being refused mail access on airbnb when renting for months    thermostat is locked so you have to call sometimes to request to have it unlocked to control the temp in your apartment  also    you may be locked out of your apartment for over    mins as they use bluetooth locks and they malfunction sometimes   zencity is out of california so there is no one on sites for any issues or customer service  there is no    hour contact number  you call  leave a message and someone responds via email  location is excellent with restaurants and easy access to everything   Rented for   months if zencity didnt have the monopoly on airbnb in STL   i would never stay here  unfortunately its the only avail apt close to my contracted location 
494605959,large  spotlessly clean  fashionably designed flat in a safe  modern building with gym  free coffee tea bar  and meeting rooms working areas  Wifi in the unit was weak and unstable  thanks for your support during my stay  Ive tried to be careful about my review  because I definitely will stay with you again  and my previous two zencity experiences have been  tar      you have to sort out the wifi  or at least inform  guests that it is not of sufficient strength and stability to be used as an office    you did not tell me  but i figured out  that the ground floor lounge has excellent wifi   that can be something you offer other disappointed guests    In the previous two units I stayed in  a nice touch was the full bag of coffee you left in the cupboard  The nearly empty  good for about   cups  bag left this time was a disappointment
572099457,I would not recommend staying with Zencity at all  Upon arrival we found the whole apartment dirty and without towels in any of the bathrooms  The towels that we did find look like they were thrown in the back of the closet  The host was unresponsive when we tried to contact them with the issues  We had to stay in apartment for over an hour until we found other accommodations  It was a very inconvenient situation for us and we will not stay with this host ever again  Did not get back to us when we had issues about cleanliness 
715728800,nice
126005801,Had to leave due to maintenance work that was done in the middle of my stay  However  they tried to help me find a new place and address the issue as best they could  Still quite unfortunate that they were not able to anticipate the disruption that caused me to have to find another place to stay last minute  Thanks for trying to help so quickly  although you might want to figure out a way to know if these things are going to happen in the future  as I am sure you know 
722802157,Was disappointed with this stay  I have booked through zencity before and was very impressed with communication  Check in process is not accurate because you have to access the building through the back and not the side  Did not have a remote to use the tv  notified them Monday and did not get the issue fixed  They just blamed it on the previous stay  
722221918,Great location  however the check in process was not well planned out  Our key code did not work  Luckily there were a few other Air bnb guests who teamed together and helped us into the building  If it werent for them we would have been locked out for a long time  Thanks guys    Hi great stay  poor check in  Caused unneeded anxiety  The key code didnt work
714103435,False advertising  No W D in room  Late responses from host with lack of information about units This host is using false advertising Parking
545136455,Terrible host service 
607243255,Its hard to write a review due to the unique circumstances of the stay  Apparently the night before we arrived the upstairs neighbor had some sort of a water leak which made its way down to our apartment  Now by no means do I fault Zencity for that   its totally out of their control   but what confused me is that there was no communication about the issue until we showed up  So imagine my surprise when we open the door  theres a horrible odor coming from the kitchen  the heating was off  on a day that was    degrees   an industrial fan is blowing on the floor  and theres a mop and bucket sitting there with a strange liquid inside  Additionally  while sitting on couch a few minutes later  a man barged into the apartment  without knocking  and started asking me questions about the aforementioned water leak  which I still had no clue about at this point   Again  while I dont blame Zencity at all for the leak  I would have appreciated a heads up about the situation before I had arrived and more clarity on what was being done to clean it up   Beyond that  the apartment was mostly as expected and advertised  Location was great   we walked to many restaurants  bars  and the Whole Foods  Unfortunately there was a horrible smell in the kitchen our entire stay which I assume stemmed from the leak  All in all  Im not sure how to review a place with such a weird problem happening that most likely wouldnt happen to others  no communication prior to check in regarding the flooding and clean up that happened the night before
618754903,The location is great but for price it was a very small space  that was overly secure to the point where it was a hassle to leave and come back  But communication and directions were excellent for getting there   Wifi was very weak  The furniture wasnt comfortable and oriented awkwardly  We also  had to re clean the dishes before using them  This place is fine for a short stay if you wont be spending much time there 
485385705,The beds were very comfortable  check in was delayed   hours 
575559979,Good location and parking Its filthy
559038740,This is a very small basic place  but the location is great 
483717549,The Airbnb was at a great location and is just how it looks in the pictures  We enjoyed our stay  But unfortunately we had a lot of problems checking in  There was no fob left for us to get in and out of our building and it was never provided for us during our entire stay  even after we notified Zencity  Additionally  the wrong WiFi password was left for us  Besides these hiccups  we had a good experience  We enjoyed our stay  It was a great spot in an ideal location  Unfortunately  we had problems checking in  We were provided with the wrong WiFi password and never received a fob to get in and out of the building 
482528789,The apartment itself was well decorated  and the bed was pretty comfortable  During the hot summer months  the small window AC didnt cool the unit to a comfortable temp  so sleeping here was challenging  The WIFI here didnt work either  but that may have just been a temporary issue   Overall  would not care to stay here again  It would have really improved our stay if someone had taken a minute to turn the AC on before our arrival   The unit never got to a comfortable temperature  and sleeping was very difficult  Working WiFi  functioning AC
459557758,Awesome location and very spacious airbnb  Great response from the host leading up to the visit  As a note  the sofa bed is a couch that folds down into a futon  and temperature control from the nest thermostat was difficult to manage resulting in a cold downstairs and hot upstairs when sleeping  Entry was easy with the keypad  and the patio area looked great  but we didnt have time to use it  Hi there  thank you for having us at your place in Chicago   The location was wonderful  The Airbnb was incredibly spacious  and the beds were comfortable  The massive master bathroom was impressive   My communication with the host prior to arrival was great  In regards to feedback  there are a few things  We were anticipating a true sofa bed  as advertised   not a futon type situation  We were able to have an air mattress delivered to make things more comfortable for our friend who was planning to sleep on the sofa bed  Also  temperature control was difficult  The downstairs would be very cold and the upstairs was very hot which made sleeping comfortably difficult  Finally  we were not made aware of the large ceiling issue in the kitchen  This was not revealed in the pictures advertised  and it wasnt fixed during the maintenance visit that was scheduled during our visit  however  we were not told what that appointment was for   We did have an unfortunate issue with the couch futon on the last day where the arm seemed to break when one of the guests was leaning against it while sitting  We received the      request and sent the money within    hours  We apologize for any inconvenience

458165183,Overall   the place in itself is very functional and clean  Customer service was horrible  They just didnt care about our needs and never offered any viable solution to the problems that the place presented  We had requested to cancel our last day and were denied the refund in spite of the fact that it was a week prior to the rental date   It was really cold in the apt  and after not responding to our messages the first day  we were told that is was too bad it was unusually cold  We had an entire day with no lift and were not notified     we were staying on the  th floor  The second day a lady and a gentleman came in unannounced and made a hole in the wall to install something  The third day a guy opened the door without notice and came in to do some maintenance work  I was in bed  I had to insist to send him away  The neighborhood didnt feel safe nor friendly   we were two ladies traveling for work and somewhat this place popped in our zip code request  it was very far away from our area   Not a place I suggest to anyone wants to enjoy Chicago  we had requested to cancel our last day and were denied the refund in spite of the fact that it was a week prior to the rental date  we had very cold days and after not responding we were told that is was too bad it was unusually cold we had an entire day with no lift and were not notified     we were staying on the  th floor  the second day a lady and a gentleman came in unannounced and made a hole in the wall to install something  the third day a guy open the door without notice and came in to do some maintenance   I was in bed  I had to insist to send him away  Overall   the place in itself is very functional and clean  Customer service was horrible  not safe customer service was horrible 
601530776,Nice place but still being renovated  There was drywall dust and paint chips throughout building  including apartment   Someone spilled a salad in hallway Friday which as of Monday was still on the floor  City traffic noises were pretty loud at night and construction noises in the building were fairly loud during day  No key fob as promised we had to use code all trip Said they would get new key fob and to park on street until contacted  Never heard back 
471476339,The space was as described and in a pretty good location to get where you would want to go while staying in St  Louis  However  there were some cleanliness issues  I found dried on food on dishes that I was trying to use  There were black hairs on the towels  dish towel  and in between the sheets that were on the bed  After the stay  I was asked to give a   star review   not just please give us a review or hope you enjoyed your stay  I responded privately that my stay did not warrant a   star review and gave the same reasons to them that I gave above  I never received any communication back after I sent that message  Two days later I received an e mail stating that zencity had given me a review  Someone was able to get on the site to leave a review on me  but not to respond to a message about issues that the apartment may have  Some kind of communication with the cleaning service is much needed  In the beginning  the host was very helpful  Recommendations of restaurants and things to do  After the stay  I was asked to give a   star review instead of just asking to review the space  Once I responded privately that the experience was not worth a   star review and explained why  all communication stopped and then I was notified that I had been reviewed  So obviously someone had time to be on the site 
594073876,Nice location and very home like feeling inside the apartment  However communication was NOT good   often took multiple messages and a couple of days  to get a response  Interacting with the workers was not pleasant but as a whole  Id give this place a       Will never be staying in this location or with you guys again  So beyond disappointed  You guys use to be great  Cleaning lady was halfway through cleaning when we walked in after check in  Asked for a key because we were having troubles with ours and it took    hours and a triple text to get a text back and over    hours till we actually got one 
230036678,The host canceled this reservation     days before arrival  This is an automated posting 
595744420,Beware if you like to sleep before     AM  This apartment is above a bar with loud club music playing every night  Music begins at    AM  lasts until     AM  In addition to the music  the bar patrons are very loud  Constant shouting and fights  vomit on the sidewalk  The actual apartment is fine enough  but the proximity to this bar is a huge issue  You should disclose the fact that this apartment is above a bar when renting and that loud club music plays until     AM every night  It is impossible to sleep here  This apartment is above a very loud bar  club music until     AM every night  Lower price considering you cant sleep here until after     AM 
594063133,Great price for the location parking is free and close if your in by like   pm needing a fob to get in to the building later at night made us feel safe kinda smelt like oil in the apt and a blind wasnt even installed but over all good stay There where a set of blinds not up whole place smelt like oil and was covered in oil  Picture frame in between the windows was broken
605472713,I had a huge problem with being accused of smoking indoors with no actual evidence and not being given the benefit of the doubt  Other then that the place was stellar I had a problem with being accused of smoking indoors without being given the benefit of the doubt  Other then that place was great
707531420,The property was as pictured and the location and value is hard to beat  Although the listing did not display this for us  the property is strictly non smoking  Wed also caution that the neighbor s  can be a bit sensitive to noise  The neighbor introduced himself to us in his underwear while we were checking in  We also had to learn later at night that the property is non smoking although there is nothing stating this in the house rules  only a sign we couldnt see on the porch at night  This would have saved us a bit of embarrassment and may have informed our decision to rent this property over others 
484825449,Nice apartment in a good location but amenities are bare bones  Apartment is managed by a company that manages multiple properties   it shows  Corporate vibe to communication  lack of flexibility regarding help storing luggage  a common need   no coffee  dish soap  or anything in kitchen other than a few dishes  Overall not a bad spot but lacked the friendly human touches I typically appreciate when using airbnb 
700017332,Our stay felt quite the opposite of many reviews posted to Airbnb  Overall  disappointed with our stay and the lack of service provided by Zencity  didnt feel very  zen  like     The apartment felt a bit more run down and dirty than expected  We had a difficult time accessing the AC controls because they are locked by the property manager making it a very uncomfortable sleep on the very uncomfortable beds even with the partially working fans on and windows open  It should be common knowledge that peoples comfort and sleep during their stay is top priority  would you agree Zen   insert YES neon sign here      In general  we felt the price did not reflect the value of our stay and service  Would not recommend even with the location being much desired  Overall  disappointed with our stay and service  Will be avoiding any future stays under the name or entity with  Zen  in it   Despite the instructions  the code to access the key was incorrect and it would have been helpful to know exactly which exterior door to access and was difficult to find the  sweet spot  to unlock the doors  Lots of communication leading up to the trip a week   a few days before  but communication and care lacked when asked about gaining access to the AC controls and or being given a fan to supplement the broken ceiling fan in one of the bedrooms  Im willing to sleep in an uncomfortable bed but atleast provide some air so were not sweating throughout the night  even with the windows open    Lowering the price to match its value 
495220293,This is a mediocre Airbnb at best  Robotic communication  Smelly building  poor location  Not accessible to McCormick Place  soldier Field etc   super corporate vibe all the bad of an Airbnb and none of the good Auto generated messaging   not real people messaging you   no reply addresses etc 
713813324,Very cute place but poorly kept   The unit could be so gorgeous with better upkeep 
479862725,Zencity is the third party handling this location and frankly I would stay away    If you have any travel issue  I e  cannot access the building  they dont have a number to contact anyone to get it resolved immediately    I had reserved this particular location with two teenage girls because of a concert that was going on    Check in is only after  p and the event was open at   p  so we only were able to get to the Airbnb by after midnight    Support cant help you  You dont get direct contact to the host  You also dont get any compromise for the experience you have    We were locked out and we felt unsafe  It was frustrating and scary  Luckily the email support answered us  but it was not timely    We spent almost   hours sitting by the door  unsure of what to do  I almost had to book a room elsewhere    Place was nice  once we were able to get in  but at the expense of dealing with Zencity and being denied something in return  its not worth it    I would much rather book at a hotel  because I know Im GUARANTEED access to my room  I think its ridiculous that I cannot speak directly with the host whether through Zencity or even through Airbnb    Its clear Chris has no concern for safety  has no sympathy  or even cares for what happened  I wont be staying at an Airbnb ever again    At least a hotel will GUARANTEE an accessible room     Chris should have courtesy towards his clients    Its simple business practice to take responsibility for a bad procedure  and in return  do something to make up for it    I feel betrayed because I was not taken care of and Im sure I will continue to be ignored    Clients concerns should not be ignored  I hope this company can learn from this  Its unfair how this has turned out to me when I had two teenage girls to look after    Were very lucky that nothing bad happened to us  There wasnt a second lockbox code provided just in case the first key was missing  Theres no way to contact anyone on the phone and receive immediate support during an emergency  Customer support could give no advice in what to do  An email was provided but it was not timely 
476211906,Nice place and great location  but management was sub par  I booked same day for a last minute extension of my trip  Had to wait for    minutes outside the unit for access instructions  When I finally got in  the place was half cleaned and the crew was working in the unit across the hall  They didnt finish my unit until    hours after check in  There was also no coffee stocked  but there was a coffee pot and filters  Yay   I also had the next nights guest try to enter the unit at   am  They offered me a     refund  Waited    minutes at the Airbnb for access instructions  Call center has no idea what the management companys processes are  Better management
457673575,I had great experience with Zencity before  but this time it was a bit disappointing  The key given to me has a wrong room number  and the passcode into the room was not given to me  making the check in process very confusing  The response was in time though when I sought for help  The value of the room is not so good compared to the price  the building and facilities were a bit old  key has wrong room number  and passcode to the room not given to me
447975121,If you are happy with super clean and have no reason to want anything to make it feel cozy and welcome  this is the place  Location is great  You will feel super safe and so much to do in walking distance  If you want to snuggle on the couch and watch a show   bring a blanket  No extras here  the soap bar was TINY  not good The experience would have been much better if there had been any effort to make it feel welcoming  There was small hotel sized bottles of shampoo and a hair dryer  but there was no extra towels  no effort to make me walk in and smile and feel like I was happy with my choice to rent this unit  It was sterile and clean  Not even a single sample of coffee on the morning after my   am arrival to the city    Ive just stayed in so many airbnbs and the reason I keep choosing airbnb over a hotel is for the fun experience of seeing how different hosts welcome and treat guests  Its just inspiring  This one left me feeling like I should have just used a hotel 
444233744,Room     leaves a lot to be desired  The kitchen has NO counter to work on  no cooking sharp knife  very little cutlery  if youre   tall you can use the cabinets  seating only for    The bed was lumpy  no air condition in bedroom  the tubs are slippery  the worse sofa to sit on  We sat on extra pillows on top of the sofa to have a little comfort  It was noisy   No lighting as you come in at night  you need to turn on a lamp that barely lights the living room   Theres a place to sit on in the living room that is super dirty   In short  that and a previos Airbnb place we stayed on Blackstone have the worst places weve ever stayed  I dont recommend this place except for having two bathrooms  The apartment was not what we hoped for or expected
573944976,Ive stayed in this building before  My family lives on both sides of the water so it was a nice location  The second time staying here I was placed in the basement  Little natural light coming in but it was still a cute place  My biggest problem was with the shower  The pressure was absolutely terrible  It was sprinkling on me and I had to stand directly under it to even get that  I called to have someone come fix it but it was never fixed  I know there was someone that came to  check  the shower head because there was urine all over the toilet seat upon my arrival  I would stay here again if the host was better about getting that shower head fixed and if they didnt allow workers to just come in and make themselves comfortable around my stuff  I reached out multiple times about the shower head  No one ever came to fix it so my sister and I were bathing in sprinkles of water  which sucked  I understand that this is a superhost but showers are essential 
430448878,Not designed for comfort  Not designed for comfort  Also the power strip in the bedroom didnt work  Keys were miss labeled Less noise
429306434,It is a nice place   Parking is very difficult though at night time  I would like to have known more details about the parking situation 
404302163,Overall a pretty good place  but the pictures made it look bigger and less worn down 
423268855,The overall stay was okay  The space and location were great  I stayed for   days  When I got there most of the dishes were dirty in the dishwasher  I located those AFTER I purchased paper plates and cups  The living room and bathroom needed to be cleaned  as it hadnt been swept  and there was long brown hair in the tub  On my last day  I cleaned the entire apartment and washed the linens  as I assumed I needed to because the apartment hadnt been cleaned after the previous guests  I came out to find that my car had been towed  It hadnt been specified by the host nor in the listing that parking is PRIVATE and paid for by residents  Im currently out of an extra      that I had to pay to get my car back AND a cleaning crew showed up  So a waste of energy as well  Im highly disappointed and disgusted 
415779646,The heating system is very old and makes strange noises  The building has strange smell The building and the place has bad smell and heating system is scary
412108484,I wrote on another unit from this company and Im going to write on this one too  I would never stay with this company again  The place was disgusting  I dont believe they have people cleaning the units  at least in the building I stayed in  As soon as you walk in your reaction is  ew   Had a disgusting smell  The couch reaked  of body fluid odor and had what I believe to be a stain from sexual intercourse  All of the linens were dirty as well as the fridge and the bathroom  I had to go to work cleaning the unit as soon as I got in because it was either that or leave and not have a place to stay due to things being last minute  The company has a horrible response time and are very unorganized  Ive never had a problem with any Airbnb Ive stayed in and Ive now stayed in a few to say the least  This one was absolutely gross  You pay almost as you do for a nights stay  as a cleaning fee  Just to have the unit very gross  Would never stay with this company again  Very gross
408070719,Nice location  quiet  perfect for those who want privacy and a good view of the sunset rise  Easy access to trains  neighborhood   expressway  Parking is hard to find  It was a warm little place with all the necessities  supplies  good bedding  storage    Directions need to be more clear and weather sensitive since the building was blocked off for ice  The neighbors were quite loud with their music but it was fine seeing that the walls are indeed thin  Inside smelled fresh  outside the apartment smelled of rotting fish because of the pile of garbage at the end of the hall    The laundry situation should have been handled better  Laundry machines dont really accept all cards  mine was a visa with a chip and it never read on any machine     Response time was bad  but even though you took long you still answered with accurate info but a little too late  for i had to figure it out myself or attempt to mend the situation myself 
401927458,The place was a bit older than expected  the sheets on the bed were a little dirty with stains and lint hair but other than that it was alright
366522412,Great location  Big space  Make sure you ask them to clean before because ours was not  I really did love your place and would maybe stay again  but the way the cleaning situation was handled was really poor  We wanted to ask for a refund of some sort due to your phone service and lost key but your cleaning woman was so nice we did not  The key was not in the spot they said it would be  making us wait    minutes in the cold calling back and forth with the company 
364511264,The place was very clean  but  much smaller than I expected it to be  The bathroom was extremely small and I didnt even want to take a shower because of the joke of a shower head that was there  It was very hot when I arrived and the old school heaters made it difficult to bring the temperature down  My husband searched all over for a remote and was unable to find it so we never touched the television  The heater in the living room was leaking when we returned after a night Out  and it was  water all over the floor which was annoying  The host was responsive but unable to actually make our stay more comfortable  I appreciated the place being clean  in a nice area  and well stocked of toiletries but with the little issues we had helped me to decide that I would never use this location again 
362119539,This place is very near to Chicago downtown and very accessible to all restaurants and pharmacies  The room space and the amenities are all great and very much clean You will get everything what all are needed for a stay  We dont have to carry any samples also  But we had a issue with bath tub in which the water is not draining and accumulating which became a very frustrating problem for us  Also the bathroom size is very small  We did not find any room temperature settings in the room and we felt very hot in the room  The room is an old one but with all upgraded things and is clean  Thanks for hosting  We enjoyed our stay but we had a big issue with water draining from the bath tub  The water from the bath tub is not draining out and accumulating  So it was a major issue for us as we both couldnt even take bath for   days  All other amenities are good but as bath became a problem for us we are not satisfied very much  The responses are automated and not clear
361770325,Very disappointing experience  Check in was fine overall  though the host did not inform of a second non working lock on the door  therefore we had some difficulty accessing the unit  Host was slow to respond and refused to send someone to clean the unit  although we thought we paid for an already cleaned unit  until the next day  We waited around the next morning and no one arrived to clean while we were present  Very disappointing   especially due to it being Christmas weekend 
356579353,It was one of the worst experiences I have had with Airbnb zencity is a unprofessional company I had medical supplements maild and everything arrived fine I picked them up from the mailroom BUT THE LAS   pakeges that were diliverd I was told by the mail room employee that it was in the mailbox so I contained Chris from zencity he said he would go on Monday to get it from the mailbox this was a Friday I said ok Monday come around he never replied until I contacted hem then he said that there was nothing in the mailbox I had tracking the tracking information said the pakege was diliverd whe theres a diliverd the delivery company scans it therefore I knew that it had been delivered then Chris sent me a message saying that he is not liable for anything I basically believe that they kept my pakeges he was rude and disrespectful  You are unprofessional company
708330811,I typically never write bad reviews and often am pretty easy to forgive and accomdate for the situation  However  when I had arrived  the place had not been cleaned despite their COVID policies in the listing  There was brown and yellow things floating in the toilet and other waste  The sheets hadnt been changed  towels that had been used were still hanging and the floor was not clean  I did  book my stay the day of  but I dont think that if a room isnt ready  that it excuses a room from not being cleaned prior especially given the pandemic and need for cleanliness as a health and safety risk  I did contact support and at first they said they would send someone for touch up  but it really needed more than a touch up   needed a full clean  Thankfully the lady who cleaned the room was kind and did a great job  but I am definitely not booking again with Zencity ever again and did not appreciate the nonchalant approach at first when I made my request 
343502935,Host number on listing does not take calls for AirBNB reservations  Gave me another number which just slowed down response time  Keys left did not fit lockset  so I was unable to check into apartment  Ended up paying twice as much for a hotel        a few blocks away  The number listed on your page does not answer Airbnb calls  This delayed a prompt resolution  Your instruction said one key should open both locks for the apartment door and it only fits one key  The second key  the one that broke  does fit the lock but broke before unlocking 
341688593,Moldy bread left in the kitchen cabinet made the whole unit smell like trash  Other than that the unit was excellent and as described  The immediate area wasnt super vibrant  but overall the location was great  close to two different L lines and just a short ride to the loop  Didnt get buzzed in  luckily another resident came by at that moment The immediate neighborhood is pretty dead  but its close to downtown and multiple L lines for getting around  Expensive  but all the options in Chicago were 
336806566,This place was a lot smaller than expected and not worth the price 
322271236,Great location and good value  Communication with the host could be confusing  and guests should note both that     a digital keypad is used for entry and    the door and keypad alarm is extremely sensitive and likely to go off  even when simply locking the deadbolt from inside  Had a tough time getting good information or responses  The check in instructions in the details page were different than those sent via message ahead of time  and my follow up questions by message and phone went unaddressed unreturned   Unit location is great  and values pretty good  but the difficult check in and communication issues overshadowed it for me 
463114818,dont stay here lost email with instructions host never responded to a long time to in said there was street parking   good luck with that
161796055,Great location  Didnt include much information about Wi fi and cable 
582265089,Building was under construction so there was a funny smell literally everywhere  Was clean and nice  just expected a finished building for the price Building was under construction
611618230,I was waiting for   more hours for check in 
583384352,Centrally located on main strip of central west end  No designated parking but street parking on the side with meters  Wi fi was super slow the whole time  We couldnt log into Netflix because there were too many users  Check in instructions were very complicated but well laid out  The florescent lighting is abrasive in most rooms  Feels more like a hotel than an air bnb  Nice lobby  nice furnishings in the room  Good water pressure  The listing says sleeps   but only one bed available  Very pricey for the amenities available  Not many  Clean but I do not recommend  Add a wi fi server because yours was very slow  Too many people were on Netflix so we couldnt watch  we had to use our own  Please sign out of ours  Also the listing says sleeps   but there was only one bed  There is no designated parking  Try using soft white light bulbs for lamps  not as abrasive Parking  Working wifi  Netflix that worked   Food staples  Difficult instructions to check in to follow very complex  Non flourescent lights 
596431917,Pros   Great area to be in for shops and things to do Apartment was nice and well set up  Cons  FOUR flights of stairs to walk up with no elevator  No overnight street parking  No Netflix Pros   Great area to be in for shops and things to do Apartment was nice and well set up  Cons  FOUR flights of stairs to walk up with no elevator  No overnight street parking  No Netflix
575594148,The location was great  There were many restaurants in walking distance  The building was filthy upon walking in  There was sticky floors as something large was spilled everywhere leading to the elevator and the elevator smelled of pee and beer  They ended up mopping up late into my second day of the stay but still wasnt spotless  Bathroom wasnt the cleanest  But the rest of the suite was charming and well decorated  Bed and sheets were clean and comfy  There was apparently a leak above the unit and two days we had visitors from the building to inspect  Not hosts fault  Could have been better for the price 
581333022,Nice neighborhood  good transport  easy parking on the street  The building is safe with helpful staff  You should solve the lack of responsibility in case of any problem with the room  I think it is not acceptable that you rent the room in a building and dont take the responsibility for and the building either  You two should make it clear  Other than that  this is a good place  we were satisfied  Thank you  When a sudden problem came out  they replied to my email but misunderstood and did not solve the problem  I had to figure out a phone number of the company in the middle of the night  Made some phone calls without moving forward and if I hadnt been that distinct  they would not have found the solution 
576895601,I checked ahead of time to make sure a later arrival would be ok  I was told there would be no problem  I got into rental property place at roughly  AM and was told by the staff I was not on the list of guests by Zencity to be staying in the apartment for the night  I showed them my airbnb reservation along with my receipt of payment  The rental property staff tried contacting Zencity where they said they were being answered and then told they would get back into contact with them before getting hung up  It took until  AM for them to get back into contact to let the rental property know that I was approved  I had a meeting this morning in Chicago that I only got   hours of sleep for  I leave Chicago Saturday morning and now my trip is ruined because I am exhausted from last night  I had paid for a service that was not met  I had planned and notified them of a late arrival and was told it would be ok  I would have otherwise made arrangements to get into town earlier had I been notified it would not be ok  It was frustrating being told by the rental property that we would most likely not be allowed to stay the night and having to figure out other arrangements  Asked for a refund that they said they would grant over the phone  however didnt hold up to their word  Escalated to airbnb 
575577631,My fianc  and I had multiple issues with this Airbnb  First off  upon arriving I was told per my itinerary that the keys to the apartment would be with the doorman at the entrance to the building  Which was not the case   the doorman could not locate the keys and seemed to act like he had no idea what I was talking about  I was also told not to mention anything about Airbnb and instead say that I am staying in a corporate rental  Not sure why the secrecy is necessary but if there is some type of stipulation with the apartment building that bans Airbnb hosts from renting units out you probably shouldnt put your paying customers in the middle of that dont you think  Anyway  He ended up calling a maintenance worker to let us into the apartment after he verified my identification  Upon being let into the apartment at      pm  Airbnb host was not flexible whatsoever about check in time even though he knew it would result in us being basically stranded with nowhere to put our luggage for several hours  the room was occupied with several people whom Im assuming were cleaning the apartment although there was quite the language barrier between us  They informed us the Airbnb   that I already paid hundreds of dollars for for LESS THAN a    hour stay  was NOT ready for us yet and to come back later   mind you our check in itinerary told us  pm and it was well passed  pm by this point  So we had to leave our luggage  which my fianc  didnt know at the time contained an extremely expensive engagement ring  with   complete strangers in an apartment that we still did NOT have keys to for another hour  Which as you can imagine was not a comfortable or secure feeling  When we finally returned the cleaning lady was STILL there and I basically had to ask her to leave  We both have been traveling since   am that morning and were exhausted and had dinner reservations  that we ended up missing because we couldnt get ready in time due to our late check in  to get ready for  Also  the floors surrounding the apartment are currently under construction so expect ALOT of very  disruptive noises throughout the wee hours of the morning  At times it sounded like someone was going to basically come through the ceiling  Not happy whatsoever and will not be booking with zen city again  I hope you guys do better 
570988769,The unit is in a great location with restaurants bars easily accessible in this safe and clean neighborhood  The hosts were very prompt in their communication  The TV is loaded with popular streaming services and the kitchen is well setup  One downside was the shower had barely any water pressure and the tub didnt drain very well which made showering very difficult  Hey guys  there seems to be an issue with the shower and tub that seems to have been reported by an earlier user as well  The shower barely has any water pressure  some previous guest had mentioned this in the reviews  and the tub doesnt drain  The second thing was the bed sheets had stains on them and there was a hair stuck on the photo frame above the bed  With that said  the place itself is well laid out and the location is great  Overall we were fine for the short stay but fixing the shower and bedsheets issue would go a long way for future guests 
610555811, my stay was maybe   weeks ago so things couldve been fixed by now   Its a decent Airbnb for the price youre getting  The pipes in the master bedroom make some noises at night  The  cold water  faucet on the master bathroom doesnt work  so youre basically gonna have to brush your teeth with hot water  The bath tub doesnt drain very well  All in all  its a nice spacious apartment with nice lobby staff  They just need to fix those flaws and itd be perfect 
615876493,Pros  Nice spacious apartment in a great location  Check in was a breeze and the space met our needs for the weekend    Cons  Host was not responsive at all  seemed like a company managed this and doesnt check their messages  Had been trying to ask questions for almost a month before checkin and never received replies    Outside it was pretty cold and windy but inside the apartment was insanely hot  It was a sauna in there and there didnt seem to be a thermostat in the unit    WiFi speed was just awful  I wouldnt even list it as a feature  Videos constantly pause and load at    p  Tried to watch a movie but decided the WiFi was too bad to put up with and had to hotspot for their smartTV   They only provided   set of keys for   guests  Excellent space  please check your messages  That is how your guests customers communicate with you  Host never seems to check their messages  seems like a machine was on the other end 
616437087,Decent place  Not the best part of town 
722588482,Okay
590423722,Location was FANTASTIC   Perfect short drive to downtown  The residence was very hip and unique  Not as clean as I would have thought and missing common things like a coffee maker Starbucks is only a block away   Overall decent experience  They were very quick to respond to the few questions I had
608045316,Thanks Had to leave property and get an alternative room due to unsanitary property  Requested a refund and took days to get a response which was ultimately denied  Near alot of bars and restaurants  Over a run down cleaners  Property is owned by zencity and they really dropped the ball on this one  I would advise against staying at any of their properties  A refund in my option was fair since I left the property and never returned  Their communication was slow and poor customer service  Airbnb was no help  They have no standards for customer service in these instances so dont waste your time and money with this pair 
717712132,This place gets two stars    for location and   for responsiveness of the host  We rented for a month long stay and we paid a lot of money for it  The laundry list of damaged furniture and the filth of the place was offensive  We had to have a handy man in twice to properly fix broken furniture and appliances and to scrub scum and dirt from the bathroom tiles  The couch had to be steam cleaned it was so filthy and smelly  We had to request mattress covers because the mattresses were stained and had pubic hair on them  This is definitely a place for parties and not for long terms stays  I corresponded frequently with the host and while super responsive to get issues addressed which was appreciated  a discount reflecting the extend of the disruption would have been even more appreciated  I unfortunately cannot recommend this unit  I appreciate the responsive customer service  However as I communicated early in the stay the cleanliness issues were insulting to the price we paid  Equally the resistance to offering an appropriate discount for the disruption we experienced was disappointing 
714554975,For the price  this was an OK stay  A cleaner entered the unit with us at the beginning of our check in to bleach the mildew in the shower  so we had to endure an intense bleach smell for the first evening  An additional cleaning fee was also requested at the end of our stay 
709498491,Disappointing  The worst   flights of stairs leading up to a decent unit  The shower handle is broken and they dont allow you to control the thermostat in this very cold unit  Very convenient street to stay on  I honestly feel as though I should be reimbursed for a portion of my trip  The cost of the stay is overpriced due to the inconvenient stairs as well as the control of the thermostat  Prior to me confirming my booking I asked if I will have complete control of the thermostat  I was told that I would but that was not the case when we arrived  They then said they unlocked it and gave us control but that was a lie because they never provided the pin to control the thermostat  Once you are inside the unit it is a comfortable stay aside from the temperature  To get to the unit are the ugliest unsafe   flights of stairs I have ever seen 
723894910,Very Small and dont have many appliances
607419530,This is a beautiful loft in downtown St  Louis  ample for four travelers  walking distance to the Gateway Arch  Busch Stadium  the Enterprise Center and Union Station   And reasonably priced  too   We had an HVAC problem  no functioning heat  on a day the high temp in St  Louis was   f   So the place was unlivable   They responded as best they could but could not repair the underlying problem  so we rebooked elsewhere and Zencity refunded their portion of our rental  still waiting on Airbnbs part of it       I am sure if the heating had worked I would have rated it   or   stars   And I am sure they will get it fixed  because it is unrentable without functioning HVAC  Thanks for reimbursing   The unit was beautiful and the location was great   Too bad we couldnt enjoy the weekend there   Thanks for making it right   Hope Airbnb will reimburse their take on this as well     we will see    Thanks  Bob               Management being out of town  Chicago  made it pretty much impossible for them to respond to an issue that made the otherwise beautiful  well appointed and superbly located unit unlivable   Wish theyd had on site help 
722602303,was unsatisfied with this stay i had     hello when i was about to cook i noticed that there was a dirty towel hanging from the stove like somebody used it to clean up then hung it back up  the toilet seat had brown stuff on it even when u lift the seat up    i clean for a living and the place was not cleaned properly     thanks wasnt told i had to use a specific door to enter the instructions said use the side door
720515582,TERRIBLE customer support   Its a shame that this place was so cute  I just wasnt able to get into the building  The access code they gave me was wrong  the key fob to get into the building and use the elevators was not working and on top of that Zencity did NOTHING to help  Residents had to keep letting me into the building  when contacting the host they saw that as a resolution  It was New Years Eve with Covid and not a lot of foot traffic  My boyfriend and I were stuck at the entrance for over    minutes waiting for a resident to come home  I had book this place for one night  and had way to much trouble to pay       This was a complete rip off and Im VERY disappointed on how the host has handled my situation and lack of communication  Pick wick place apartments should no longer do business with this company because they have such a nice apartment building  that I would have loved to stay there again  but most definitely WILL NOT  I am VERY displeased with the way your company handled my situation  We were locked out of the building and was told that nothing was wrong  The access code to get into the building was wrong  and our key fob was not working  When trying to get in touch with support  it was difficult  Then when trying to resolve the situation  it was even more difficult  No one actually resolved my error with the access code  or my non working fob  Residents had to keep letting me in and Zencity kept seeing that as a resolution  Couldnt get in contact when I was locked out of the building 
616403602,The place is clean an comfortable The desk for working is very small No place to sit down and eat Took   days to get Coffee plunger and kettle replaced and bathroom tap fixed
223674767,Brians place has a lot of potential  but there are still a few kinks to work out  The beds are very comfortable and the location was great for getting a quick Lyft ride  Brian is an excellent communicator and did all he could to help us with a few issues we had  Brian  your place has great potential  but definitely some details to work out to match the level we are used to with AirBnb  For example  there is a ton of dirt under the sink in the front bathroom  It looks like construction dirt that is still there  There is no where at all to put your toiletries so that space is needed and it was pretty gross  Both bathrooms had a lot of hair and dust around the baseboards and the corners    We would highly recommend some boot racks  rugs  towels by the entrance  It was impossible to keep that area dry with nothing  Weather in Chicago will require those most of the year    More towels would also be really great  We had one large towel each and no personal hand towels or any washcloths    Last  just a reminder that the couch is broken  so we had barely anywhere to sit  We left the broken stool in the closest so no one would fall and get hurt 
722825730,The apartment building had very bad cellular reception  I also found a huge roach which I had to kill  I also found mouse droppings in the bed  When I asked the property manager about refunding the cleaning fee they pretty much ignored my request   only refunded the days left on my reservation due to me requesting to leave early  I appreciate being allowed to shorten my reservation however I dont think its fair that a cleaning fee was charged to me due to the amount of sanitary issues I came across  I also had to use my own bug spray in the unit to make myself feel comfortable while there  When I asked for a refund for the cleaning fee I was ignored The apartment unit has horrible cellular reception  I had to leave in order to have a full phone conversation
721725761,  great location but no parking on site    there were two spots on spothero within   blocks  but nothing directly on the street after December   for overnight parking   during the day was easy       hr    they were quick to respond via messaging to issues  but the handyman was rude and failed to show up multiple times when promised     days without stove microwave and needing to be moved to another property for   nights is not a big deal   but with two kids during the winter and paying  k for   weeks     yeah  its kind of a big deal       new dishwasher and washer dryer were nice   space looks freshly remodeled  but the furniture looks second hand or worn     wobbely desk and one of the dining room chairs was so bad it wasnt usable     bowls for a  br apartment    one of the widows literally fell out onto the bed our child normally slept on   i guess it wasnt locked in place when we arrived and i never checked   could have been really bad had  somebody been in that bed  sent through text already  issues put aside  it would have been good value   however  too much went wrong for the amount we paid to give five stars
722550803,This was the worst AirBnB experiences Ive had  I drove    hours and arrived at the AirBnB at    pm  It was self check in  and the code to get the key didnt work  I contacted the host who then self released the key box  No key inside  We try   other boxes and the key was not there  She said the cleaner did not return the key to the box and to go up to the unit to see if it was unlocked  When I went in the tv was on  furniture moved around and the bed un made w make up on the sheets  She had me drive to another unit in town   which had unclear instructions on how to arrive  I ended up not inside until      am  It was not the ladys fault who helped me  I asked for    extra minutes for check out and another person told me it was impossible for them to allow that and I needed to leave by the time they said  They ignored my message when I asked why no one had rectified or even attempted to rectify any of these issues  Strongly would not recommend any bookings w ZenCity no one rectified all my issues and were rude about check out
459619503,Brian let his place to us after mentioning that the previous group had damaged the place  He then proceeded to try and charge us       for the damages by the previous group  He also provided no brooms  mops  paper towels or cleaning supplies and then chastised us for not leaving the place spotless  Either leave supplies or use the       you charged us for the place to clean it yourself  Ruined what was a nice weekend with odd behavior after 
709625954,Zencity hosts are slow to respond these days  Ive stayed with them before without issue but now responses can take over an hour  Parking at this location can be an issue  The check in keypad at the building entrance malfunctioned and I had to yell the code several times before the door would open  I inquired about extending my stay at   on the morning of check out  No response until        Check out is     I began gathering the rest of my things and housekeeping showed up at        Zencity then sent me a    dollar bill for delaying housekeeping  I really like the places but given the communication delays then charging me for leaving less than    minutes after check out after waiting over an hour for a response from someone  I doubt Ill be booking with zencity again  Speaker at checking was not working correctly  I had to yell the code several times into the microphone before door was unlocked 
719785019,Nice place  Nice Location  Past reviews stated it gets cold  I inquired on that  they said I shouldnt have a problem AND  it was cold   lol  Heater works great  they dont do any winterizing and the bedrooms are frigid and the main room  close to the windows dont seem to stay warm  it wasnt terrible  but I definitely wore my winter hat a vest and a sweatshirt    Customer service was terrible  I got locked out of the building for an hour when when it was     out during a pandemic so I couldnt seek refuge anywhere  They never really responded and I resorted to emailing the rental department off of their website and finally got a response    In any event  I will NEVER rent from a COMPANY on Airbnb ONLY owners    The place was cute though  just be aware that ur on ur own if you rent from ZEN CITY  You need to review protocols on customer service as we move into winter during a pandemic  I got locked out of the building on check out  my fault  and my keys were in the car  Couldnt get any response and it was   degrees in the middle of pandemic  so I couldnt seek refuge anywhere  I ended up having to email their Rental Felt from their Website  no one EVER responded on Airbnb    only BOT responses like  PLEASE SEND REVIEWS     sy time booking an airbnb from a legit company  NEVER AGAIN  Ill only rent from owners who care about customer service 
719203323,The communication was good but the place was unclean which raised a lot of concern especially during the current pandemic  After not being able to check in until      pm  throughout the rest of our stay we found things such as undergarments in the dryer and food left in the oven and microwave  I would suggest if you stay here to take pictures WITH time stamps of every single thing wrong  For the amount of money spent to stay there and the time wasted on getting the place cleaned and coming to some kind of reasonable resolution was not worth the money AT ALL  Will not be staying here again  I would suggest making sure the place is ready for the next guest so they wont go through the drama and filth I went through especially during COVID  For the amount of money spent to stay there and the time wasted on getting the place cleaned  obviously in a hurry since things were still left unclean  was not worth the money  Will not be staying here again  Could not check in in time due to room being unclean 
714712529,This place is in a great location and the beds were comfy  Unfortunately  everything else was rather disappointing  Given that they charged a high cleaning fee  I expected it to be cleaner than it was  The shower curtain  for example had a layer of mildew at the bottom of it  last     inches   A shower curtain is pretty easy to clean and or replace  There were also hairs all over the beds and bathtub    The hallway of the building constantly smelled of smoke as another reviewer pointed out and at times we could smell the smoke coming into the apartment   One thing to note is that its an old Chicago apartment building so it does get cold unless the radiator is running and I was pretty cold a good portion of the time   a space heater would have been nice   What sent us over the edge though is that the wifi wasnt working and the property managers took half a day to get back to us when we first reached out  if this was being managed by an individual we might have been more forgiving but its a company managing this property so their response time  in my opinion should have been fast  Hosts at every other Airbnb Ive ever stayed at have responded within the hour whenever Ive reached out during a stay    Overall  I would say that if you are not going to spend much time here other than to sleep  if you dont mind paying an overpriced cleaning fee  and if you dont ever need to use wifi  this might be a good spot for you 
714761665,Communication with the host is AWFUL  If you try to call  youll only get an automated system asking you to leave a message  then youll never get a call back  If you message them  they are extremely slow to respond and not helpful  Dont bring anything valuable  they will have maintenance and who knows who else in and out of the apartment during your reservation without your permission or notifying you   I had a maintenance man show up in the middle of my stay to replace blinds  and he said he had been in earlier that day while I was out to lunch  I was never notified of his arrival nor did I give my permission   Great place as far as value   location  but I will never rent a place through  Zencity  again  Communication with the host is AWFUL  Dont bring anything valuable  they will have maintenance and who knows who else in and out of the apartment during your reservation without your permission or notifying you  Very poorly run business  Check in was to be anytime after  pm  I arrived at around      and there was someone inside the apartment and sounded to be playing video games  Thought this was hosted by a person  but its some sort of company  Tried to call and only got an automated message telling me to leave a message and theyd get back to me  soon   Never got a call back  Messages the host and they were extremely slow to respond  if at all   Also  in the middle of the day  a maintenance man arrived to replace blinds  I was NEVER notified that he would be there  not to mention that he said he had been there while I was out earlier in the day  also without my permission or being notified
