I would not stay there again though because the bedding, bed, and around the bed were disgusting. To be fair, I have OCD but it should be normal protocol for people to check for bedbugs when traveling. I saw what could be evidence of bedbugs. And the bedding was nasty. I had to go to Target and buy my own sheets, pillow, and comforter just for one night. Because there is no way I would risk bringing bedbugs home with me. Otherwise it was ok with plenty of room to yourself, easy to get in and out. The host was very receptive to my feedback. I think it's a busy Airbnb so they may have a lot of turnover and I could have caught them at a time where they didn't do as good of a cleaning job as usual.",Thank you!,"I check for bedbugs so I inspect the bed and around it with a flashlight. First, the comforter had pronounced stains and there was long hairs all over the bedding. It looked like there were possibly bedbugs under the mattress. The floor around the bed had food crumbs and looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in years."
27962742,446928741,2019-05-02,231682850,Daphyne,It feels like a hotel. It’s nice and modern. It doesn’t feel homey in anyway... there’s not a lot of soap in the bathroom (again it’s like a hotel) and there’s nothing in the refrigerator. There’s no room for garbage either. This is the type of place you’d stay for a night or two.,,There was stuff on the sheets and hair.
22265007,627373633,2020-06-01,263975496,Elizabeth,"Place was nice. Couldn’t figure out how to change the thermostat and  host was not very helpful. The screen on the thermostat was not turning on at all. Also couldn’t figure out how to turn on the outside lights that were located on the patio (host did not respond at all about the lights) The location of the place was very nice, not too far from downtown or some nice restaurants.",,Areas were filled with dust.
38268915,616427415,2020-03-09,85359935,Delia,"Our stay in this place was supposed to be a joyful one. We came for a few days to celebrate my daughters’ birthday. This place is very close to Barnes hospital which made it a perfect location to get together. 
It was very disappointing from the beginning. The bathroom was not cleaned and full of hair from the previous guest. A set of dirty linens was thrown in the closet if bedroom number one and in bedroom number 2 the linens were full of hairs.
The company’s response was slow and unapologetic and they did nothing to remediate the situation. We had to buy our own sheets. The next day they came to clean but, in spite of our request, they did not leave toilet paper.
Avoid this place at all cost.",,The unit was not cleaned after the previous guest left. The linens were not changed and the bathroom was full of hairs from the previous guest. We had to buy our own toilet paper

25983750,441243680,2019-04-21,72761022,Shavon,GREAT place to stay! Very clean and has everything you need. Responsive hosts too!,Thanks for being a great host and being so accommodating!,Bathroom was great! But there was an issue with the toilet and the fact that maintenance wasn’t available was the only down side
25983938,617317015,2020-03-12,339912446,Xhosoli,"Stay away. These places are not clean like they are said to be. I have videos and photos on my phone of how nasty the rooms were. I had 2 different rooms. Also, my wallet and license and ID along with 3 bank cards of mine were stolen from my room. I was the only one I my room besides Zencitys house maid. I spoke with Marty who is 1 of the owners of the apartment and he had a total attitude and did NOTHING about my things. He was suppose to call me back but after waiting for his call for almost a week I decided to call him back just for him to not even remember who I was. That showed right there that he didn't give a damN about my items missing from my room with only his personnel having access to my room... Makes me wonder if they go around scamming & frauding people. I will never stay in ZenCity properties again! I will also tell my friends & family to avoid them as well.",,Bathtub wasn't clean. Inside of microwave wasn't clean. The refrigerator wasn't clean neither was the bed sheets/blanket or the hangers. So much more besides an unclean room has made this the trip from hell~
39868719,615861615,2020-03-08,57454656,Maria,"I would highly recommend this apartment for a group of up to six people. It is located conveniently in the CWE with access to dancing, restaurants of all price ranges, bookstores, ice cream shops, etc. Check in is incredibly easy with a lock box. The rooms are spacious. The apartment building is quiet. Down side is that it is a first floor apartment, so whatever is happening on the street or at the entrance can be heard inside the apartment.",,The towels had a pungent smell of cigarettes. The place itself was clean.
35845966,635997055,2020-07-08,1238382,Damani,The apartment is not bad. I felt safe the whole time I was there. It is convenient to many shops and restaurants. The mattress was super firm as were the pillows. That was tough to get comfortable with.,I would just suggest responding to request would have made the stay more satisfying. Other than that I was fine.,Walked into the bathroom to find the toilet filled with hair and other particles. It was on and around the toilet which made me feel like the whole apartment wasnt cleaned properly. It was nasty and Especially during a global pandemic
25456143,438842802,2019-04-17,112796523,Andrea,"Overall, the location is great and there were plenty of restaurant options, especially cafe like restaurants.  I do not recommend staying here if you are not willing to pay for parking. It was hard to find a free spot and the meters are only for 2 hours at a time. My friends and I stayed one night and we got a very close spot through Spot Hero for $35 for a full day. It is a good space for a quick stay that is close to the city, but not in the midst of the hustle and bustle.","Zencity, 

I think you property was in a great area and the check in was flawless. We felt very safe and we thank you for keeping up communication with us and responding to our needs. We ended up finding parking and working it out with you all and Airbnb, but I really feel that free parking should not be included as an amenity option. The rooms and kitchen were really clean, but the common areas just missed the mark for us.  

Thank you for letting us stay, it was a pleasure.","The furniture and the rug in the common area was not completely clean, there were small hairs, and residue on the window area and table (not wiped down). In the bathroom, the shower lining curtain was a little dirty. Couch could have been vacuumed and touched up a little more as well."
28517080,437443289,2019-04-14,86047880,Richard,"Great location - convenient for Lincoln Park, Old Town and the L to get into the city","Hi.
The apartment location is really good. The challenges we had were a lot of the light switches didn't work and there were cleanliness issues in the main bathroom and kitchen. Also, when taking a bath there seemed to be a slight leak which we couldn't work out where it was coming from. With respect to the shower - because there was only 1 shower curtain, water tended to get everywhere - would be easy to buy a second shower curtain and also maybe replace the shower-head?","Bathroom floor seemed to be dirty as did the bath and window area. Kitchen was also slightly dirty.
ALso - the entrance hall to the building and stairs to the apartment were dirty"
23436978,437331940,2019-04-14,35562004,Tiffany,"This location and space was perfect for  a weekend getaway! In the center of Hyde Park, where you're in walking distance from EVERYTHING you need -- I'd highly recommend this spot. For a weekend with a friend/partner, it's just enough space. The only issue we had was the internet service. It was not working well most of our time there, but we were out so much that didn't really matter. Something to check in on when you arrive or inquire with this host. Overall, amazing experience and would definitely go back again!","Zencity was responsive and made our stay amazing! With its close proximity to amazing coffee bards, shops and restaurants -- it was literally a perfect location for everything we needed for this quick getaway. Appreciate the team that hosted us, and would definitely stay again!",A bit worn and needed of a bit more cleaning around the bathroom window and baseboards.

However, the apartment was still a mess when I walked in because the cleaning lady was still working in the apartment.",Need to improve your internal communications between the host and the cleaning service.,Dishwasher was still running when I checked in
25491473,435834050,2019-04-11,231880078,Ashleigh,Spacious apartment with bonus bathroom off the bedroom and lots of closet space. Found parking right out front of the building which was great. 5 minute walk to the train station. Very nice neighborhood. Bed was comfy and the tv had everything on Roku that you could imagine. Had a great stay (:,,Little bit of hair in the shower.
39334572,626688366,2020-05-29,347454245,Jackson,"Great location, overall good apartment, but bathroom needed some maintenance before we got there.",,The bathroom smelled like sewage and we had to close the door to the bathroom or else the whole apartment stank. Kitchen had some half-used food supplies from previous occupants.
39484967,606791298,2020-02-16,125438457,Danae,The location was the best part of this Airbnb property. Lafayette square restaurants and bars are well within walking distance. However one issue that I will remember in the future was with parking. The ad stated a gated parking lot was provided to guest with access from a key fob. When we arrived the fob was not there. I called Zencity and they told me previous renter took it and they didn’t have a replacement. I was told sorry for the inconvenience. We had to park on the street for the two day stay which can sometimes be tricky in busy St. Louis neighborhoods. The apartment was very nice but one thing I noticed was that the floors were dirty. There was drywall dust on several places and I wouldn’t call the place sparkling clean. Nice appliances and kitchen but beware of the limited hot water supply. It’s a small tank and forces a very quick shower. Kind of a bummer if you need to relax or shave. Pluses and minuses for this place.,"The location was convenient and the building seemed safe. For $150 a night it would have been nice to have a sparkling clean place, parking as listed, and extra towels.",The floors didn’t looks like they were swept very well. There was drywall dust still on floor in several places.
39484969,640129277,2020-07-19,72931067,Matt,Overall a fantastic location close to a beautiful neighborhood! The only issue we had was the fact that other guests don’t know how to respect an Airbnb like it was their own home and the walls were very scuffed and lots of water stains on the paint as well... a fresh coat of paint and this place would be perfect!,,The only thing I would say is that the place overall was very clean but there should be a new coat of (non flat) paint for the whole apartment because people apparently don’t know how to treat an Airbnb like their own and the walls were very scuffed and dirty with water spots.
39485059,604562609,2020-02-11,199751439,Laura,"I had a comfortable stay in this incredibly stylish modern apartment. Awesome value for the price, and conveniently close to some cool bars and main downtown area. 
Only issue was a leak in the roof that dripped when it rained - a minor annoyance, but I share publicly in the hope that the issue is resolved soon, as the small puddle it created could pose a hazard.",Please get the leaking roof fixed as soon as possible!! It is not only an annoyance but a hazard to all future guests!!!,Trash from previous guests was not emptied before my arrival
27961613,430000054,2019-03-29,250049798,Kerri,This is a great place and worth the money. Excellent hosts.,,Shower curtain was moldy on the bottom - otherwise it was spotless and included all cleaning supplies.
39484972,601450953,2020-02-03,146674182,Cristin,Overall had a nice stay for the weekend in this apartment. The neighborhood is very conveniently located to get to many different St. Louis locations.,Overall a good stay. Without the key it was pretty inconvenient for parking and entering the apartment. I chose the location over others based on having the gated parking area so was disappointed that we then had to find street parking when we returned each evening.,The whole weekend we were there a spilling of tomatoes/dressing was directly outside our door and people had garbage bags in the hallways. It did not smell pleasant.
38646026,672418662,2020-10-08,267175386,Subramanian,"Average stay, looks exactly like it is. Floor and bathroom are dirty however. Make sure to clean",,Floor was very dirty when I came in and bathroom had bugs
27525969,429040485,2019-03-26,119834661,Dana & Kenny,"The apartment building is beautiful and the rooms are cute. So close to many shops and eateries. Great if you're a foodie like we are! The architecture is so unique as well, the elevator especially very old fashioned with sliding gate to close.  You do hear slamming doors/people in halls and the light from the hall under your door all night but otherwise great for budget travelers. 
**Our apartment wasn't cleaned properly and reaching out to Zencity was pointless because ""they weren't management ""   Maybe other rooms were better, ours wasn't. The whole time we were there the light didn't work for the main room.",This building was beautiful but cleanness was that to be desired. Sending photos and saying how paying extra for the cleaning charge when it was not is not right. I just got automated responses from you as well as one that said you can't do anything because you're not management of the building.... Not even trying to make things right for us. Our light in the apartment also didn't work and we didn't even bother mentioning it to you because you didn't care about our other concern. I really think its funny you ask for a 5 star rating when you definately  did not even give any courtesy of a 5 star treatment.,"Mostly door knobs and handles there was grime. Also caked on something in the kitchen sink and stucked toilet paper on the radiator. The ceiling light fan didn't work for light, even tried changing bulbs."
39485071,599597725,2020-01-30,103558568,Christina,"Overall experience was great! They are still undergoing construction, so it's very loud during the day. Walls are thin, so you can hear other units clearly. However, for location and price it's a great place and the modern industrial look is great! I would definitely stay again.",I'd give guests a heads up that you're still under construction until work is completed.,From new Construction
40483464,613224745,2020-03-01,315920005,Devorah,"The location was very convenient, there are food options in walking distance. Comfortable beds and bedding. Price was fair. 
Cons- There is only one set of keys available so if you are traveling with others you all have to be on the same schedule (coming and going). The place wasn't cleaned thoroughly. The floors had dirt/dust, and the showers hadn't been wiped down. There was no coffee pot (but a grinder???). A lot of light comes into the larger bedroom which makes it hard to sleep in/nap. The gym is in the basement and the equipment was nice but it was all dirty.","Please pay attention to cleanliness, add a coffee maker, and two sets of keys should be standard for a 2 bedroom place.",The floors were dirty as well as the bathrooms
26423555,442122365,2019-04-22,84586900,Khalid,Very cool building. Public parking available but scarce. About 15 minutes to downtown with your vehicle.,Please clean the bathroom tile.,The crevices in the tile are black. They need a deep cleaning.
26423798,428684836,2019-03-25,221770922,Vanessa,First time using a airbnb so my husband were very excited. The apartment was easy to locate and directions to get inside were very detailed and helpful! Unfortunately when we entered the apartment I could tell it was not newly cleaned. Dust balls on the floor in the hallway and in the living room. Our sheets in the bedroom had stains on them and hair. I tried to communicate this with the host but with no response to this problem. Our stay was not what we expected and hoped for at all.,Thank you for opening up your home to us. It was our first airbnb experience and unfortunately it wasn't the best. My suggestion would be to make sure the apartment is truly cleaned before allowing new guest to stay.,When entering into the apartment there was dust balls on the floor and on the walls. I could tell the apartment had not been recently cleaned. There were multiple stains on our white comforter
35845457,620675807,2020-03-23,341968957,Ramse,The place was wonderful,I've stayed in a few of your places and I like them. I know things happen sometimes so not being able to checkin on time wasnt a deal breaker,Tub and inside the oven needed some extra attention

39484976,598695634,2020-01-27,22648653,Dean,The previous reviews were all fairly accurate.  It’s a cool unit in a cool building...but the thin walls...constant noise from people running up the stairs and in the apartment above...made it not the best stay.  Lots of construction...hallways dirty and in disrepair...and for a new unit there was also a lot of damage to the walls in the unit.  For the price it was acceptable but I wouldn’t pay more...and it can’t compete with high quality places in other locations.,,Just lots of marks in surfaces...dust and dirt on floor from construction.

We really enjoyed our stay & would definitely come back,"It wasn't an issue of cleanliness, more maintenance. Light out on bathroom"
34977420,638500601,2020-07-15,340247188,Maysa,Tbh it really could have been better.,I’m sorry about the sheets. My period came unexpectedly and I didn’t know what to do. Otherwise cleaning walls needs done swept and mopped properly and the kitchen cabinets needed washed bad.,The walls in the bedroom were dirty. The bathroom looked clean but the tub was gross and was stopped up so when you shower your standing in water. The floors need scrubbed and the cabinets were absolutely nasty on the outside. There were no pot holders there weren’t any knives to properly cut things.

Gorgeous historic building exterior was fantastic for our photos as we are celebrating a girlfriend's upcoming wedding. Park and beach just across, plenty of room with laundry. 

THE BAD:

We sanitized the whole kitchen area and living area that we had to touch as we've noticed that it wasn't clean. Host was veeeerrryyy slow to respond and offer no help. Sofa was very dirty and stained, hair, pieces of candy wrapper under cushion, we had to put over a comforter to sit on it. Kitchen was not cleaned, fridge smells, microwave splatters all over inside, oven handle and front is sticky. Tons of dead bugs in window sills. NO WIFI our entire stay!

Parking would be the only downfall, in that you must find street parking or park in a nearby parking garage that is $15.00/day...however, this information from provided in the listing and we were aware of it when booking. Overall, the check in was very easy, even arriving late at night like we did. The door staff was helpful.

I absolutely will be back- highly recommend.","I absolutely LOVED everything about this space, location and building.   I will be back soon.   Finding it was rough at night dark and then to have door code wrong was frustrating but the place was amazing and great value.  Thank u!!!",No biggie but a lot of small hairs in the bathroom sink- must have been caught around rim of the sink cause when water ran they appeared.

You made it very easy,  but you definitely should look into your cleaning crew... I think they partly forgot our unit. Thanks!",The first bathroom was completely disgusting. The quantity of dry pee on the toilet and boots' stains on the floor would suggest that it hadn't been washed in a while...

Building has character.
Second time I have stayed here, first time significant maintenance issues that should have put the unit out of service prior to my check in. Manager tried to resolve the issue, I get a lazy maintenance man...
Give the building a second shot. Unit had a bad smell, if you’ve been around farms, think damp hay in the barn... there was an air freshener in the closet so someone was trying to address the issue. However unit needs a deep cleaning. Email issues to manager I worked with on the prior visit, no one from Zencity responded.
I have pictures of the issues (other than the smell, leave to you imagination) if you want to message me...","Awesome location guys. Was hoping you would have shown me your best foot forward after the leaking ground floor mess last month.

Book today!","Great safe property, but this unit may need more care and upkeep with the age of the building. Better heating (and possibly cooling) units would probably help the overall stay. 

In addition, I would have maintenance for Zencity check the door lock. The door was very hard to open and close on this unit. The door appeared more older and worn. The central west end is a beautiful area in St. Louis, but units and property can be older and in need of updating. 

Overall good stay besides these things.",Apartment dusty and needed to be cleaned a little better. Probably due to hardwood floors throughout. My allergies started acting up due to the amount of dust. This was an older building so that may have contributed to the difference between the newer unit in Soulard that wasn’t as dusty.

The building and apartment are both very stylish, not really much you could ask for on that end. Definitely worth the value, I’d recommend this apartment if you want a chance to experience what KC has to offer","Other than the slight tidiness and and thermostat mishap I think this could be a great rental unit. Maybe keep it set at 68 or something a little more reasonable than 62? Fantastic location, stylish apartment and building. I did definitely notice the neighbors above walking around came through the ceiling so I understand the concern for noise in the listing. I also noticed there were ice trays in the fridge too late into my trip to fill any, maybe you could leave one of those filled for the guests? Either way I enjoyed my stay and it gave me a good chance to explore the city, I’d definitely like to return! Happy holidays","Crumbs of trail mix on couch, out of hand soap in bathroom"

It was a pleasant surprise to see the choice of art books provided to read, as we were in town for an upcoming art exhibition. Private entry and free gated parking made our late arrival most convenient . This was a quick trip for us and we only had enough time to eat dinner and sleep. With that being said, I must note the kitchen had everything we needed and the bed is incredibly comfortable. Unlike some other reviews we found the neighborhood to be one of the quietest we’ve experienced in a city and slept great! Our stay was relaxing, convenient and enjoyable. We hope to stay again in the future!","This was a quick trip for us and we are so appreciative for your swift replies, and the thoroughness of communication. We especially appreciate the detailed information for accessing entry and parking, etc. It made the process of check-in so much smoother. Thank you!","Bathroom: The toilet was not clean and had evidence of remnants. Also, a bathmat/towel was left in the floor. Unsure if it was clean or used.

32147463,420774671,2019-03-07,227344761,Chi,"Overall, it was a good place. The only complaints I have were regarding the slow and sometimes not relevant responses and the sickening smell coming from the bathroom. But in their defense, it was a building issue and the maintenance person said it would take a few days to fix (after my stay). Unfortunately, I had to endure it but maybe by the time you book, all will be fine.

The slow response was really inconvenient once when I had to extend my stay but before they responded, a photo crew had already come in and we had move everything outside to wait. 

I am a 'home person' so I loved that I never really had to leave for anything except food and what I came for. THIS IS THE BEST PART- The owner really put thought into stocking the place with household items like laundry and dishwasher pods, pots and pans, phone chargers, air fresheners, etc. Things you don't think you will need on a trip, they had the foresight to put it there.  

All in all, I think my issues were just luck and I would recommend booking here.","Everything was good except for the smell and slow responses. It seems a lot of thought went into making the apartment feel like 'home' (very convenient courtesies). Perhaps add a micro USB charger (Samsung, other non Apple devices).","There was an odd smell emanating from the bathroom, but to be fair, it may have been and issue in multiple floors of the building not owned by Zencity."
39484972,589689207,2020-01-06,62692505,Julie,"Very cool space, modern and comfortable.
Cleanliness left some to be desired.  The shower had not been cleaned.  Still need to tweak some amenities (lots of pans, but no pot holders to get them out of the oven) - nothing to really use as a pot holder (no rags, no kitchen towels, nothing).  Little things that I'm sure they will address.  People in the hall were consistently noisy.  Otherwise, we loved the stay.  Everything was functional and nice to look at.  Parking is super safe and the neighborhood is safe and close to the highway as well.  Great restaurants close by.","Need pot holders or kitchen towels
Cleaning crew needs a stern talking to, sheets were changed but I can't say anything else was actually cleaned
Jet dry for the dishwasher to help dry the dishes","The bathroom (specifically the shower) had all sorts of hair in it (pubes or leg hairs or both, plus head hair).  The floors had foot prints all over them (which I was able to wipe up in the bathroom).  The bathroom counter wasn't clean.  Dishes were put up in the cabinet wet.  There was pink glittery tinsel all over the place, mostly in the bedroom. Carpet clearly not vacuumed.  Earrings on the floor right by the bed (vacuum should have caught them and all the glittery tinsel stuff)."
39485077,587896716,2020-01-03,42950815,Taylor,Overall stay was okay. Apartment was beautiful and just as described/pictured. We had some issues regarding building security but hopefully they are addressed and not an issue for people who stay in the future.,"Overall stay was okay. Apartment was beautiful and just as described/pictured. Still had some construction dust in the unit. When we arrived we accidentally transposed numbers of apartments and went to the wrong one. Entered code and were granted access to someone else’s apartment. Both they and we were freaked out when we walked in on them. Definitely a concern that our code worked for both units. Construction workers woke us up at 8:30 AM wanting to install lights under cabinets. Aren’t we supposed to be made aware of people entering our apartment? There is no peep hole to see into the hallway and as two women staying alone in a new city, this is a major security issue. The superintendent of the building was extremely rude and said it needed to be done before the New Year even though we were not comfortable with two strange men entering our apartment. Fire alarm went off at 6:45 one morning and didn’t turn off for 45 minutes. I understand the building is in the final stages of renovation, but the security issues are very disconcerting.",Clean for the most part. Some construction mess still in the unit.

We had 6 people and we all could sleep with plenty of enjoyment. There isn’t too much seating other than a couch, a chair, and 4 barstools. The TV is really nice and very easy to run. The bathrooms were nice and soap, shampoo, and conditioner were supplied. There is plenty of space to maneuver around and chill in. For the price, I would stay here again.",Thanks for letting us stay there! It was a great stay and it was so nice being close to the Blue Line.

39484976,586216367,2020-01-01,34922240,Zachary,"This is a very clean, well-appointed apartment in a terrific location. However, there is significant renovation work happening in this building at the time of this review. Also, the soundproofing is pretty minimal - while in the bedroom, you can loudly hear anyone going up and down the stairs from one of the building’s entrances. If you’re looking for a quiet place to stay, this might not be your best option in STL.","On 12/31, the fire alarm went off in the building around 6 AM. A man who identified himself as a janitor said that it was set off by accident. Unfortunately, the fire alarm in the room was blaring loudly for almost 45 minutes. Between this and the significant renovation activity in the building, our stay wasn’t as frictionless as we had hoped. I hope you’ll give future guests a clear heads-up that this building is being actively renovated so they can decide whether it’s a good fit for their needs. Other than those issues, this is a beautiful apt. Hope this feedback is useful, thanks for hosting us.","The building is undergoing renovations so the hallways were full of debris, nails, and construction materials."
42102965,618071503,2020-03-14,103364527,Chaitri,"Given that photos were not provided of this listing, the place was nicer than expected. I stayed in unit 416- it is a very spacious and large apartment for just one person. There’s a nice in-unit laundry room, a large kitchen and living room area, walk-in closet, big bedroom, and a nice balcony as well. There was a tv as well with a Netflix account provided by zencity. The location is great since it’s in the Plaza - all in all, it was a comfortable stay. However, I would caution prospective guests about the following - if you have a large car, parking will be difficult. It is provided free of charge in the building but it is a very tight spot, with a pole on one side and a usually large car on the other - which made parking an everyday nightmare for me. However, there is some street parking available too. I did have difficulty checking in, but by calling the number provided, it was sorted out quickly.","The parking spot provided needs to be seriously re-evaluated. There is a pole on one side and usually a very large car is packed (often outside of bounds) on the other side. This made the parking experience very difficulty and resulted in scratches on my car. It would also be helpful to have a much smaller code to enter the apartment since it needs to be entered every single time. Providing more dishes, like plates and glasses, would be very useful to people staying for a longer period of time. Decorating the place a bit more would be an additional nice touch. Beyond that, the apartment was nice - plenty of space, nice amenities, and good location.","There was a bit of a smell in the entire apartment, especially in the kitchen area. It would have definitely been useful to add room freshners."

22320506,413978739,2019-02-18,63419024,Tony,"This is a great location and a very nice unit.   We stayed there in Feb 2018 and were very pleased.  In February 2019 we were disappointed on two counts: 1) the unit was not cleaned when we arrived -- once we reached the host, they responded promptly and had the unit cleaned within 90 minutes.  However the prior guests (or someone) had smoked a lot of pot in the unit and the usual cleaning did not get rid of the very strong smell.  The smell faded slowly (but not completely) over our three night stay, and certainly robbed some of the pleasure of staying in the otherwise very nice unit.

Also, the hot water pressure is bit on the weak side -- adequate, but not great if you really like your shower.  Towels are very nice however!  Other pluses are excellent internet and TV options,  lots of closet space, and generally well-equipped and clean. 

Because of the location and overall quality, we would definitely stay in this unit again.   Zen City did a good ob responding to the problems we reported -- though prevention is always preferred over cure.","Only one set of keys provided.  Would have been nice to have 2 sets.
More hangers for clothes. 
Better hot water pressure.  New shower head..   Spare light bulbs so we could change when burned out.   Dish drying rack for when we washed dishes.","We corresponded about this.  The unit had not been cleaned and reeked of marijuana.  You did arrange for a prompt cleaning, but the smell persisted for days (it faded over the course of our stay, but each time we entered the unit we had a fresh ""hit"")."

Thankfully I carry tools on me as well because the vacuum cleaner was literally jam-packed with dust.

Place could use paint touch up and cabinets some degreasing.,Could use a paint job throughout. Kitchen cabinets are sticky and could use a good degreasing.
39485055,580502375,2019-12-22,39027149,Theresa,"Pros: Nice safe location, new construction building with modern clean and minimalist design of furniture. Beds, pillows and towels were comfortable and plush. Nice extra touches like clothing hampers in each bathroom, luggage racks, extra pillows, blankets and towels. Plenty of hangers and closet space. Conscious effort to make plugging in cell phones for charging in bedrooms and living room easy. Blue tooth speaker and iphone charging dock (although I have a Samsung and couldn't use it). Washer and dryer with detergent pods available. ( no dryer sheets).

Cons: the entire building is deep in the middle of construction. On our lengthy walk through the building to get to the apartment door, we came across a bunch of construction debris piles. Everything is dusty. Including a thin layer of white construction dust on many items in the actual apartment. I woke up every morning with a stuffy nose. Also, even though we took our shoes off right at the door, we were tracking white dust into the house on our shoes from walking around. The gym is advertised as being on premise, but it was not installed yet and not in working order. Kind of messed up my work out plans for the weekend.

 Our apartment was also without a key fob (previous renters didn't return and zen city doesn't carry extras for this situation). The benefit of the key fob is to use the entrance that is closer to the elevator and park in the parking lot. So, we had to park on the street and take the long route to get in and out each time. There is also only a ramp to get in and out with rolling luggage or for handicap purposes, through this door. Had to go up and down about 15 stairs with luggage when entering and leaving. Not a huge deal, just an inconvenience. 

Our apartment also did not have a tv remote. So I was instructed by zen city to install the roku app and use that as a remote on my phone. It worked and it was an ok fix, but it was annoying. I didn't want to have to download an app on my phone and I couldn't charge my phone while needing to use it as a remote. Also, listing says coffee maker. There was NOT a Keurig or even a simple coffee machine. What there was , was a coffee press which I had no desire to figure out in a hurry in the morning. I don't use a coffee press at home and just wanted coffee quickly. I had to get dressed and go down the street to get a cup for breakfast every morning that I was there. 
The walls are also very thin. We could hear the TV as if it were playing in our own room from the apartment across the hall. 

Most of the cons can be fixed once the building is finished being under construction and therefore I would stay here again in the future. Overall a great place that needs some kinks fixed.","Other than a few issues like no remote for the TV, no key fob for the parking garage, and no coffee maker or working gym like mentioned in your listing as an amenity, our stay was nice.","Construction dust everywhere. Shower stall had hair in it, freezer had some old food dripped in there and wasn't clean. One of the kitchen chairs had food or something rubbed on the leather part where u sit."

I don't pay to be a housesitter and ensure repairs are done when I book an Airbnb.

May I suggest a pour-over situation? French press sucks when you only need 1 cup of coffee. Also, the bright white light bulbs in the place aren't great. A warmer tone would make the space more comfortable and seem less like a fake apartment.","Apartment was clean with the exception of the inexplicable amount of long, thick black hair scattered around the apartment. As someone with very long hair I understand how it can be left behind seemingly everywhere without noticing but the amount in this apartment was almost disturbing. In every room there was a clump of hair; on the couch, on the bed, wrapped in the bamboo mat on the floor in the bathroom,  everywhere. It didn't bother me much it was just disturbing and I'm slightly concerned for the health of the person to which it belonged. Other than that, the duvet smelled like sex.

39484985,574801448,2019-12-08,104746964,Alexandra,"Overall the place was nice and had an excellent location, but there were several little problems which really irked us. It was difficult to find the room, we had super noisy neighbours (who I believe are also airbnb guests), and WiFi dropped out very frequently. We weren't supplied with a bin and when we messaged to rectify this, they said they'd drop one off but didn't. Biggest thing that annoyed us was the cleanliness - if you are charging a $70 cleaning fee (already ridiculously high), I expect the place to be absolutely spotless. There was dust all over the windowsills and around the skirting boards in the bathroom, as well as fingerprints on the walls and mirror. The carpet hadn't been properly vacuumed and I stepped on a screw. IF these problems are acknowledged and rectified, I would recommend this place.",,"Dust along skirting boards in bathroom, windows all had heaps of dust, there was a loose screwdriver in the carpet which I stepped on whilst barefoot.

There were a couple issues I needed which forced me to have to move locations. You may want to double check when booking to ensure renovations are complete. First before even booking I had asked about gym and being able to use it prior to arriving and they stated that it was in the building and I could use it any time. When I arrived I had to keep asking about where the gym was, then come to find out it was not available due to renovation. They also did not tell me they were going through a major renovation, which was too much to handle. The noise started about 7:30 am in  the morning and continued through the afternoon. I had to move apartment complexes because the renovation was right outside my room and they didn't have any other space available in the building. They said they would give me a refund if I booked with another location through AirBNB with them, which I did, but the refund was a fraction of the cost. I suppose I should have validated the refund amount prior to booking my new stay with ZenCity. The other place was further out, but at least I could rest well.",Please next time try to be more accurate with your description and if doing renovations make sure you have disclosed that to the person reserving space. This was hugely disruptive for my business trip.,The apartment had just finished renovation. There was a little dust and it looks like someone used the toilet and forgot to flush.

Zen city was nice to work with and check in was very easy. The neighborhood is pretty nice. The space is nicely designed and has a good feel overall.  

There were a few cleanliness issues that were a bit of a turn off. There was a stain in the middle of the couch and what looked like pasta sauce on one of the bed comforters.

22265007,592164656,2020-01-12,68594862,Sue,Watch for the final price as it was much more than originally listed on the final calculation before paying.  The location is wonderful and the house is quite beautiful and spacious.  Queen size beds are very comfortable.  The heat floats upstairs so you will want to turn it down at night.,Did not feel welcoming as signs listed reminders of being quiet and no smoking.  Please note that on Saturday night the marijuana smell from next door was very  intense and wafted into the master bedroom.  There was no soap in the soap dispensers anywhere downstairs.  No instructions on how to operate the television.  It would have been nice to have your suggestions of favorite diners and how/where to pick up public transportation.  Most of all was the price being listed so much lower than actual.,Some mold around shower.

39485001,571849973,2019-12-01,291037291,Anaikia,"My experience was not amazing, but I am sure that yours could be. My problems with this particular listing were with security (the smartlock did not have batteries in it when I arrived and therefore was useless). There were no batteries in the apartment, otherwise I would have just resolved the issue myself. So I messaged through the app, due to it being Thanksgiving night I figured that they wouldn't be able to come out that night to fix the lock (which I understood), there was a deadbolt and I was able to safely spend the night. I took my stuff with me to work the following day since I couldn't secure it in the apartment until after they fixed my lock that day, a minor inconvenience, not something that would ruin a trip. They came on Black Friday, put batteries in and I came back to a lock that was not responsive. I attempted several times to put in the code and it would not accept it. It even set off an alarm, causing it to lock me out for five minutes from the panel and then reset and accepted the passcode that I had put in the same way every time. I messaged them and let them know about the issue. I was able to get in and secure the lock, slept, woke up, went to work and was able to lock the door behind me with the keypad. Came back from work and it was a repeat of the night before. I checked out the next morning as planned and only then did they offer to talk to me about the problem with the keypad. 

Additionally, they were very upfront about the fact that the building itself was still under construction but assured me that the apartment was ready to go. This was kinda true. The lock was clearly not ready to go and additionally there was a wall mount for a television, but no television, and a lamp that sat on the kitchen counter but was meant to go somewhere else because it was not near an outlet and uplugged, just chilling. There was also a water bottle filled with used paint water from when they painted. Furthermore, there was a trashcan in the closet the night I checked in, but after they came to put batteries in the lock, the trashcan mysteriously disappeared. All of these things would have been minor inconveniences and not earned a poor review from me, I am a reasonable person. But as a cumulative experience it was not great. I am sure that once they are finished with the building, it will be a nice place to stay. The bed was comfortable, there were plenty of dishes and flatware to use and space to lounge. But it was not a finished product and should not have been listed as a place to stay until it was checked for completion.",I truly hope that you read and understand the comments that I submitted. I can tell that the furnishings are nice and that once the building is done this will be something that I am sure a lot of people will enjoy. I understood when I agreed to stay that the "common areas" were under construction but perhaps a quality check run should have been made to the apartment to ensure that the issues I mentioned were resolved. Particularly the lock. Best of luck in your future endeavors.,"When I arrived to the apartment there was a water bottle full of paint water in the sink. While I understand that the entire building is under construction this was disappointing. Furthermore, when someone came to inspect the lock and why it was not working (there were no batteries), they took away the trash can that had been in the apartment - so I had to place all trash in the tiny bathroom trash can."

The amenities are minimal inside the apartment, but it is safe and secure.","We made due with the space, but it was pretty filthy when we got there. Most disturbing was the hair all over the bedding and towels. I am not sure whether it was an issue of where laundry is done or if the maid is not keeping an eye on her own hair while cleans, but it was very upsetting. The smell of the shower curtains was also incredibly unappealing and it was difficult to feel clean at any point during our stay.
You were very responsive in your communication and we appreciated the convenience at check in.

The bed was very hard and the traffic noise kept us up, mainly ambulance sirens heading to the hospital. Luckily I brought my fan so it helped drown the noise out. The kitchen had everything you needed for cooking. The TV had Netflix and Sling which was nice. The couch was pretty comfy, which is where I slept most of the second night. There is a Whole Foods close and lots of bars and restaurants near by, probably a 10-15 min walk. And of course the hospital is right down the road.","Thank you for hosting us.

I do have a few nitpicks:
* Two bags of garbage were sitting in the living room when we arrived. I mentioned this to the host, but the trash remained there for the whole length of our stay.
* The front entry light was not working, while the steps and porch were icy, not to mention that it's a front entry in an urban setting – it should be well lit. Again, I mentioned it to the host to no effect.
* We stayed in January and the temperature difference between first and second floor is dramatic. If the heat is comfortable on the first floor, you will swelter in the second floor bedrooms. It is also drafty, with cold air pouring through the open chimney flus. The host can't be expected to do anything about this; it's just something to be aware of.","We enjoyed our stay at this place.

We tried vacuuming but the vacuum is old and weak. I recommend a new better vacuum for the space and maybe a couch upgrade.

The communication was great! However, the cleanliness of the place was a bit disappointing. Other than that this place was a good spot to stay the night at for a weekend in the city!!",Thank you so much for hosting us. The place was styled nicely and it was in a great location. We found free parking near by! Your rapid communication was greatly appreciated! Having the option to assess Netflix was great as we were able to watch a comida special before heading out for dinner last night. My suggestion to making this place a 5 star Airbnb is to fix the bottom boards under the mattress on the bed frame in all the rooms and to do a better job of cleaning.,"The bed sheets had stains and the bed frames were failing apart. The floors were not vacuumed/swept either, as I found a piece of wine cork in the kitchen. The shower curtain was old and dirty."

Not particularly clean and a lot of little issues with the amenities that make clear it’s not very well tended to. Overall it’s fine for a night or two, but if you’re planning an extended stay in Chicago you should look elsewhere.",,"Biggest issue was the sink in the bathroom, which really didn’t seem like it had been cleaned at all.

After getting locked out for an hour on our second day, and not having the WiFi work for almost the entire time we were there I realized this place is crap. There were short curly black hairs in the dirty bathtub. The dishes put away in the cupboards were dirty. The kitchen counters were sticky. I will never stay here again","It was really disappointing to pay a $60 cleaning fee and find the place so dirty. The dishes in the cupboards weren’t clean. The kitchen counters were sticky. The bathtub had hairs in it (short, curly hairs) and a ring around it. The internet also did not work after our first day there. Getting locked out for an hour was really unfortunate too. I could not be more unhappy with the service you provided and I will tell my friends and family never to book anything with you",The bathtub had a ring around it and short curly black hairs in it.

25983838,590470777,2020-01-08,322434751,Jasmine,"The laundry is not free at all, anywhere, as the listing said that there is FREE or unfree laundry. 
The apartment was spotless, the only problem was that there was hair on the bed from someone before us. Unsure if it was not washed or if it did not come off from the washer. We had to wash the blanket ourselves. To be able to do laundry, you have to go to another building to do it. The card is $5, on top of a $5 fee to do the laundry in the main building. The dryers there also suck at drying. Besides that, it was clean, no concerns otherwise. 
Hyde Park is a somewhat decent neighborhood. Looks a bit unsafe but it’s decent. It’s in walking distance of Whole Foods, restaurants, and gas stations. 
You can hear traffic next to the window at night, so if that is a concern for you, then I would not stay. 
The host was very nice and answered my question. Had to call twice though. 
ALSO parking is terrible. Absolutely terrible. If you don’t show up by 5, you’re going to be driving around the lot for a long while. There is no parking pass included for this stay. Hopefully that is something that comes about sooner or later. Parking is the most stressful thing to deal with at this place, so if you don’t have patience for it, then stay somewhere that has accessible parking because even when you find a spot, it’s going to be a long walk in the cold. 
The TV has several watching options, as well as Netflix, so that’s a plus. 
The mattress is firm.
You will literally sweat ALL night with the thick blanket they provide, as well as the firm mattress which is not ideal, so bring your own comforter if you don’t want to be hot and maybe lay something underneath you. 
Overall, it was a comfortable stay and I’d recommend it if you don’t mind all of the comments above.",,"The bed had some hair on it as well as the pillows. There was also a yellow stain that was on the bed spread. We had to wash the blanket with our own money. We also had to travel to another building just to buy a $5 card to do the laundry.

36694064,586273846,2020-01-01,3696411,Maya,"There were a couple of issues with this listing that were purely cosmetic: a broken smoke detector that was never fixed though we reported it, blood stains and dirt on the comforter, and a severely clogged tub. 

But the dealbreaker was noise. Every morning other than Sunday and a Wednesday that fell on New Year’s Day during a week-long stay, we were awakened by trash collection noises (dumpsters rolling over pavement, revving and beeping trucks) that began between 6:30 and 7:30 am and lasted between 30 minutes and an hour. This is because both sets of bedroom windows overlook the alley where trash collection  takes place— a fact not mentioned in the listing. In addition, the apartment is located directly above the building’s trash room, which dumpsters were rolled in and out of repeatedly. Though we reported this issue to the host and provided photo documentation of trash collection happening immediately below our bedroom window, they denied that trash collection was occurring (?) and suggested the problem was our “sensitivity to noise.” Had there been mention of the alley and the trash noises in the listing, we would never have booked this Airbnb. 

In short: noisy, dark, and not super clean. Hosts denied the noise was a problem despite ample documentation and refused to give a partial refund for the disruption to our stay. Though the building and location are lovely, I would steer clear of this unit and perhaps ZenCity altogether.","Your business model seems to be to fail to disclose crucial details about your listing (noise) and then deny there is a problem when guests complain. The reason I didn’t respond to requests for further clarification about the other stuff (smoke detector, gross menstrual blood stains on a comforter) is that it was relatively nbd, but together with being awakened by truck beeping and dumpster rolling 5/7 days of our vacation, it made for a pretty shitty experience. Rest assured I will be escalating this to Airbnb and letting my many local friends (I’m a native Hyde Parker) know never to rent from ZenCity.",Tub was clogged.

Do you guys have discounts for 2nd stay?","I hope this is private. It’s very beautiful, I just had to do a lot of cleaning when I got there. The master bathroom toilet seat should be replaced.

Great location! - It’s located in Hyde Park with a ton of options close. It’s also right next to a bus stop that can take you downtown. 
Home away from home - this has everything you need for a mini stay in an actual apartment. Great view from living room and bedroom plus the bed is comfy. 

Cons: 
Cleanliness - several reviewers said this place was sparkling clean but that was not the case for my stay. There was random hair around the common areas and food crud on the carpet. The microwave had food splatter in it and the fridge had leaked liquids in the bottom. There was even a used washcloth hanging on the shower pole when we arrived!

All in all - this place is great to stay in, but I’d definitely recommend some sort of cleaning crew in between guests to air the place out and make sure it’s actually clean for future stays.","The location was great. The cleanliness was below sub par. I would recommend a cleaning crew between guests to make sure no used stuff is lying around from previous guests. 

On a smaller note - the record player was one of the reasons we chose this place; would have loved a response when I reported it broken or anytime other than an hour prior to check out.","The place had not been cleaned in between guests. There was a used wash cloth hanging in the bathroom with someone else’s soap, food smashed into the carpet in the living room and the kitchen appliances (microwave with food splatter everywhere and leaked food in the bottom of the fridge) were disgusting.

Great neighborhood.","The location is great and five bedrooms with Q beds are terrific - allows a large group like ours to stay together! The beds are comfortable and rooms are pleasant. Thank you! That was all great.
However, as I mentioned in the review, the kitchen really needs work - there are only four coffee cups and we were nine people! We had to take turns drinking coffee, and one day my husband drank his out of a bowl just so he could join us. There was no kitchen sink dish scrubber and no dish drying rack or pad, so we had to dry dishes in the dishwasher; also no soap in the shower so we bought that. Also, under the kitchen sink is pretty dirty, so you don't really want to use supplies from there. It feels like guests would really not want to spend time eating at the apartment. Also, the outside front door lock seems like it is breaking or something... it is very difficult to work; only a couple of us could get the key to work in it.","While the apartment itself was very clean, there were no supplies with which to wash and dry dishes."

No fans anywhere tho so if you need one to sleep, definitely bring one with.  All in all, great location.","Thanks for sharing your space. It was a great location and just a short train ride to the heart of the city.  My only thought is that the cleaning fee did not match my expectation of how clean I would find it.  The amount implied it would be clean plus.  If it’s hired out, I would check the work of whoever is doing it before the next guest arrives, especially since you charge so much for the cleaning fee.  Also, I would set out towels for two at least.  We found an extra towel with hair on it in the closet but none of us wanted to use it.

If you're without a car, it's right under the Belmont L station which gives quick access to the brown, red, and purple lines, as well as an east west bus route.

38088375,563978116,2019-11-14,37495500,Zdravko,"WARNING!
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL! 
Misleading description of this accommodation!
This accommodation is above a pub and unbearable loud music is played till 1:00 am!
We tried to sleep as we had long business days ahead of us, but the music was so loud that the floor was vibrating from the speakers and was impossible to relax or sleep. 
It was clear for us; we cannot stay in this apartment and be fully functional for our next business day/s. Half an hour after we tried to go in the bed, around 11pm, we booked another hotel, and left the apartment with our entire luggage.
The other reasons we decided to leave this place was the cleanliness of the apartment - so unacceptable – the mid frame of the split window next to the oven was with a greasy black layer and full of black sponge pieces, looks like dead flies laying on it. I tried to sit on the coach before to go to the bed and watch TV, but it is an old piece of furniture, looks like collected from the street with unpleasant smell and broken springs. I could not sit more than 5 min before I felt the hurting pain on my bones from the broken springs.
The ventilation fan on the ceiling, greasy and dirty as well, additionally was generating loud noises like tractor, which I stopped with the hope that it will reduce the noise in the apartment. The 2nd bedroom door was with penetrated hole.
THE BREATHING AIR IN THE APARTMENT WAS HEAVY AND STALE!
I lost $715.00CAD thanks to the host’s misleading information and in spite of proving them wrong, the host refuse to reimburse me at all.
Here is the misleading description at the time of our booking that the hose word it like that:
 “ The home is just a short walk from the park and the lake and stone’s throw from number of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues”  
This  “stone’s throw” is not the same as above the bar in one wooden ceiling distance. A child can even throw a stone at least 20 yards!
Ironically at the time of our booking, the House rules #3 says: “Quiet time after 10pm”
Please read it twice before you get burned as we did with this booking and Zencity's management company.",,"Old and scratchy place. 
Greasy black layer on the middle window frame next to the oven. 
With the first look, looks like dead flys all over on that frame, but happen to be old black pieces from falling apart sponge. 
Greasy ventilation outlets, some of them broken. 
Unpleasant smell coming from old and broken coach. 
Heavy and stale air, unhealthy and damaging my lungs.
Second bedroom is with a penetrated hole; look from inside of the room, unpainted, scratches etc."

You cannot control the heat and it was very warm. There wasn’t coffee maker but a coffee press. They did have a blow dryer which I appreciated. They had shampoo and conditioner as well and that was nice. The neighborhood location is super close to a lot of places to eat and shop.,Can I just say first off that the bed was super comfortable. The down comforter and the all cotton sheets were amazing. The sleep would have been better if it wasn’t so dang hot in there. It felt like in the 80’s. The radiators were in the off position and the heat just kept coming. We had windows open but it only cooled off so much. Tried to turn on the a.c. But it was fighting with the heat that was coming out. Finally just put extra sheets over the radiators to kind of trap the heat. Don’t know if that was safe but it did help. Very frustrating. An actual coffee maker would have helped make the morning better. They are not that expensive. A Mr. Coffee is like 30 dollars.,I don’t think the rug in bedroom was vacuumed. Seemed pretty dirty.

It is right next door to the Belmont (red line) station.  You literally walk out the door and up the stairs to the train, and from there can easily get downtown or wherever else.   We thought we must have been on the opposite side of the building from the tracks because we barely heard the train at all.   So we were surprised when we looked out the window in the day and saw that the window overlooked the train tracks.    That is some amazing sound proofing.

There is a big TV on a swing arm that already has Netflix and other services installed.  To watch from bed.   The unit has good amenities; washer dryer, stove, dishwasher, big fridge.

The street it is on is nice, there are a number of cafes and restaurants.  Theres a nice little produce market across the street.   So we were able to cook a few things, buy fresh fruit.

Got my Chicago style dog on the first floor of the building at the Devil Dawgs.  That helped me get that Chicago to do checklist item done,  and it was good!  

The only problem we had was there was an inordinate amount of hair on the floors in the bathroom  on the sheets.   The rest of the unit was clean , but if all that hair was everywhere it kind of gave us a suspicious feeling wondering how well everything else was cleaned.  

We got over it, but if that one little bit was fixed it would have been a 10/10 experience.",Recommend switching out the white sheets with darker sheets.  I understand that hair happens.   But might as well make it a little harder to spot.,"The place was relatively clean.  But the amount of hair we found (especially the short and curly variety),  all over the floor and bathroom and in the bed sheets  kind of made us feel slightly suspicious about the cleanliness of everything in the apartment.    But id say these things happen and i there were extra sheets in the closet which we switched out."

If you aren't planning on doing much in the kitchen it's perfect. Because obviously, the location can't be beat. But if you were planning on cooking, which I was, it was just too bare bones. No oven mitt, the pots and pans were sparse and not very good sized and in truly beat up condition.

Enjoyed my time here, but the price range it was in made me expect a little bit more.","Location is amazing, view is too! but some of the details need work. Used to work in quality control for vacation condos in Hawaii...details is what I do.","Needs a good deep cleaning. Walls need scrubbing and so does the vent.

Sadly, the place is more run down than the pictures imply. Also, we felt that after 6000+ reviews, this host (who rents several apartments as a business) has become somewhat complacent. The bedsheets were crumpled and contained hair, there's plenty of dust under the bed, and the living room carpet and sofa are in desperate need of a deep cleansing.

Of course you have to be willing to pay for the parking, but I feel that it was definitely worth the convenience.","The place was great! Super stylish, super affordable, great location.

The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was sufficient (small). The entry door didn’t feel overly secure, but we had no problems. The room has a little view of the park across the street, so that was nice. Air conditioners rocked and kept the room plenty cool. Kitchen was nice too. Overall I’m happy with the stay. There were only a couple of low points. The place has no parking available. There are garages close, but be prepared to pay quite a bit. We found on street parking around the unit and download the city’s parking app and that made paying super simple. It’s free parking from 7:00 PM until 8:00AM, so with the app (ParkLouie), I just logon and payed from my room during metered times. It’s in a very convenient location, and close to the park, zoo, and art museum.","We had a nice stay! Really have very little criticism to give.

I ended up going to a hotel for the night for safety concerns, and they assured me it would be check and locked by the next day. Unfortunately when I came back the next evening, it was still unlocked. What is more, they had changed the code and it took hours to get a response so that I could leave and gain re-entry. As if this wasn’t enough, the shower is disgusting and does not drain. There was hair left in the in from a previous guest upon my arrival, and I quickly saw why. It literally took over 24 hours for the water to drain from a 5 minute shower, and all five minutes of that were spent in standing, dirty water.

The dishes not being clean and the bed having hair on it were off-putting for sure. Most frustrating was the amount of time necessary to fix the beeping smoke alarm in the hallway.

There is a record player, and a blutooth speaker as well as multiple phone chargers and some nice touches like an iron/ ironing board, and blow dryer. The location is awesome, there is a really rad street corner bar right down the street, whole foods is a block away and basically any shopping or eating you could want to do in St. Louis is within a five minute walk or a 10-15 minute drive. Zencity staff, who book the room, were quick to communicate and check in was pretty seamless. The room we booked, 2R, does look over a parking lot and doesn't have a lot of privacy, especially at night when you want to have the curtains open. But you really can't beat this location or accommodation for the price.","Thank you very much for your hospitality and for a great stay. The location was amazing and the room very cozy. Check in was seamless and the front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The reason I gave Zenicity 3 stars was because of the following. 1) The bath tub was really gross. it had thick dark hair throughout the tub and a big hair ball in the drain catch. There was noticeable grime along the grout joints of the tub, it was clear it had not been cleaned. 2) Zencity directly requested a 5 star review without asking how the stay was. To the best of your knowledge it could have not been good but you're still requesting a five star review. Best to just remind your guests to review you and not directly ask for 5 stars. 3) Zencity requested $20 from me through the app because you suspected there were some stains on a wash cloth that would not come out. It seems as though that request was made before an attempt to actually wash the rag was made because it came only a few hours after check out. It was a wash rag my wife used to wash her makeup off, which she does at home with white rags so we know it would come out. 4) it should really be noted that this is a 2nd story room that over looks a parking lot and garage, the privacy is not so great because anyone standing in the parking lot or on the second story of the garage can look right in your windows. Otherwise it was a really great location and the accommodations were nice, we loved the decor and the fact you had things like blow dryer, iron, and lots of power outlets.

A couple things to note, which I hope they will address for future guests: 1. provide knives, additional cutlery, and cutting boards in the kitchen. I could only find one small steak knife, 4 forks in total, and had to use a plate as a cutting board. This was not a huge deal because we mostly went out to eat, but might pose a problem for those that want to cook more; 2. the patio sofa had some mold due to all the moisture. We could only sit on the two wicker chairs among the four of us. Given that the patio area was a big selling point for us, it would have been ideal to have the additional seating; 3. wifi was spotty and we had to reset it a couple of times.

The cancellation policy is pretty severe and they collected half in front and half 2 weeks prior to occupancy. Check they AC unit too - after waking up at 3 am several nights, we discovered that the AC was programmed to go to heat at 79 in the middle of the night. Grrrr.
   The location was pretty sweet, minutes from the tunnel to take you to the Promontory Walk and minutes to the Metra stop. Beds and bed sheets were comfortable.

Be aware that there are a lot of flight of stairs to get to the Airbnb but definitely worth it. Will definitely book again.,,Hairs in the shower and floor

It was just what I needed for a three day trip.",Thanks for being a great host. It was a great experience and I would definitely stay again if in the Chicago area. I would like to recommend you add a full length mirror to the outside or inside door of the closet beside the bathroom.,It was pretty clean.

Was able to get to and from office downtown in less than 10 minutes; appreciated that hassle free commute.  Local restaurants in the area with great service and food.   Make sure to check out the rooftop pool and lounge area the sunsets and views of the city were fabulous! Would definitely stay again!,"The condo was great!  The beds were comfortable, the size and amenities were fantastic and it was a perfect location with great views from the room and the rooftop.

Sometimes had to go in circles for ages to find a spot.

Can not use the laundry in the facility, if you are coming to stay longer you will have to find it outside.

Overall a very good experience 👌","Please check the kitchen equipments inside when going through all the items. The water heater inside was not cleaned for a long time and I cleaned it up several times and was not satisfied.

Other thing is the extra linens for the bed was not clean. I saw yellow patches on it and they smelled. Had to stay in the same linens the entire time.

All in all your please is an excellent place. Very clean and all. But please pay attention to the length of the visit.","I had to stay in for a half a month, lad to use the same bed linens for that period.

Good for couples who wants to spend few days in Chicago not in the city center. You can hire a bike not far away from the house and make a ride along the lake to the city or back. Uber prices to town are affordable - around 12USD. Wifi is fine, Kitchen should be more equipped. In the neighborhood are shops where you can buy grocery or other stuff. At night there is a gas station open 24hrs a day.  In general I would give 80%.",The apartment was ok. Clean was ok only bathroom should be more taken care off.,Shower curtain was a bit used and had mold.

32819129,488825132,2019-07-15,220715515,Latricia,Overall this apartment is in a pretty neutral/convenient location. It is well advertised and the apartment looks exactly like the pictures. However the parking off premises is a HUGE inconvenience and can be a HUGE expense if you are leaving on and off the premises like we did. You literally have to ride around and hope to find nearby parking or you could end up blocks away.  I will never stay at this location again because this was a nightmare and PURE nuisance with parking!,"I've already addressed my issues with my experience at this location so I will not write them again, but the parking was insane!!!!!",Bathroom sink had not been properly cleaned. There were brown spots under the items on sink. This was a clear indication that thorough cleaning hadn't been done inside the bathroom. However there was PLENTY cleaning supplies and I was able to clean myself. I actually left the dirty rag I used so you could see how many crevices had been overlooked.
22320506,484378238,2019-07-08,75382706,Fiona,"I stayed in this unit for a week. Pluses: It's in a great location, south-facing with lovely views of the neighborhood, and Zencity management was terrific: check-in was straightforward and my request for an additional fan was quickly met. Minuses: The apartment itself is very basic. If you picture youth hostel-type furnishings, your expectations will be met. Water pressure in the kitchen is low, and hot water was in short supply when I stayed so I got used to cold showers (water is more of an issue with the age of the building than with Zencity per se). On the whole, a solid three stars out of five.",Thanks for being super responsive to my requests. Check-in and mgmt responses were the best I've seen in any Airbnb host.,"Food in the microwave from previous guests, which wasn't a big deal but also suggested that it hadn't been cleaned out between stays."

The apartment has everything you need for your stay with a fun rooftop pool as a bonus. I also highly enjoyed that there is a market a few blocks away and yummy restaurants in walking distance. Nice place!,"Thanks for hosting us! We enjoyed our stay but as a fellow Airbnb host I always appreciate any private feedback that I get so I wanted to share mine with you. 
I know you have no control over what happens outside the apartment itself but I would talk to management about the fact that the hallways reek of cigarette smoke. 
Also, I would change the type of floor cleaner that is used as the smells is extremely strong and lingers for a very long time. 
Lastly, I would talk to the cleaning person as there where hairs in the tub/shower and the baseboards are covered in dust. 
Again, just minor feedback and we enjoyed our stay!",Hairs in the shower
32819129,483503910,2019-07-07,109058030,Ashliegh,"Where to start? I will preface this long honest review with the fact that we travel and use Airbnb a few times a year, so I’m very aware of a good stay. When we arrived our space had not been fully cleaned. There was trash and scum on the night stands, brown gross spots on the comforter, black marks on the sheets, hair EVERYWHERE on the sheets and pillows, the floor had clearly not been vacuumed or picked up (there was a stretchy band from a new item in plain sight and crumbs all over the rug). I have photos, but will spare you. We called Zencity and they sent the cleaners back to clean again. However, it took the cleaners an hour to arrive. Everyone was very nice and courteous from Zencity, so 5 star on communication, but just an annoying experience as the entire ordeal took our afternoon of a very short stay.

Aside from that, parking is absolutely ridiculous. Other reviews said it was no big deal. It was a very big deal to us. All that is available is street parking (metered) and a few free spaces. Most of which are always full as this street is lined with other apartments, so everyone is looking for a space to park. We were frustrated EVERY time we tried to park. There is a parking lot for this building, but permit only. I’m confused as to why zencity doesn’t have a permit for their guests to park. One car per room? It was just beyond annoying to try to find parking and then when you did, walk from wherever you managed to get a spot and then all the way around the building to the entrance. If you’re looking for convenience, run away. There IS a cute street of a few restaurants a few blocks away, but that’s the only convenient factor this place has going for it. 

The place itself is well decorated with modern touches. Just wish it had been clean. The AC units are in the windows, so you have to maneuver the curtains just right to try and block light for sleep. There’s also not a TV in the bedroom, not a big deal, just not noted anywhere incase it’s important to you.","I really wanted to love this space, but we just didn’t. Decor is awesome, but it wasn’t clean and I can’t give stars for that. The parking is also awful. A suggestion would be get a permit space so your guests can park in the lot. I’d even pay more for that.","There was trash and scum on the night stands, brown gross spots on the comforter, black marks on the sheets, hair EVERYWHERE on the sheets and pillows, the floor had clearly not been vacuumed or picked up (there was a stretchy band from a new item in plain sight and crumbs all over the rug). I gave 5 stars for communication, though, because the host was very apologetic and sent cleaners to clean."

The living and sleeping areas were spotless, cozy and comfy.

I've never been so shocked by how horrible a place was compared to what it was advertised as and how much I paid for it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. There was a giant hole in the ceiling in the kitchen. Every single drawer in the entire place was peeling grossly - to the point where we wouldn't put anything in them. There were bugs in the whole apartment. Couch was different than in photos, nothing on the deck worked at all. Basically an empty shell of an apartment. Honestly the location is THE ONLY positive about this entire place.

We however had a few small issues.  The unit only has one small window air conditioner in the living room area so we were a bit too hot in the bedroom , the water pressure was very low and seemed to not get very hot and the coffee pot was broken.  I reported the broken pot and did get an apology a couple hours later and was told they would be sure and get a new one for the next guests.  I feel the cleanliness of the kitchen could have been better.","We were disappointed in the broken coffee maker and felt like maybe the kitchen wasn't properly cleaned or that would have been noticed.  Also, I would suggest a measuring cup, hot pads and a smaller size pot with a lid as something's that would be helpful in the kitchen.  As far as the air conditioner, that could be an oversight of mine , as I don't recall whether or not the listing described it as a window unit or not.
We really loved the neighbor hood and had positive interactions with the locals as we walked to  the 
nearby park and stores.",There was a bag of open coffee in the cupboard and sugar spilled in there as well.  There was also a dirty pizza cutter in the drawer.  The soap dispenser didn't work either and the water pressure was so low in the kitchen it was very difficult to clean anything.

- overall, the apartment is in desperate need for a deep clean. it's obvious it's been quickly cleaned over and over again but with zero effort.
- when running the water in the bathroom, it came out brown at first
- the garbage was full in the bathroom with toilet paper and paper towels

27963346,470048099,2019-06-15,190668478,Roslyn,"The apartment was a good size, with lots of natural light. The location was great - we could easily walk to and from some of the great craft beer places and restaurants around Wicker Park. It was also close to a supermarket.

The decor was simple, but provided a nice, minimalist feel. Having a dishwasher in the kitchen, and a washer and dryer on the premises really came in handy.

Unfortunately, it was not really clean. It looked like it had been given a surface clean only. My partner had to scrub the toilet and shower; there were crumbs all over the sofa; and we had to wash most of the plates and cutlery. Zencity responded quickly and offered to send assistance as soon as we reported it, but we needed a shower after a long flight and couldn’t wait until the next day. Fortunately there were cleaning supplies on site.

The air-conditioning was only in the living areas with ceiling fans in the bedrooms.

Apart from the issues mentioned, it was a good place to stay. It was really quiet, which was key for us, and it came with Netflix.","Thank you for being quick to respond, and for offering to take care of the cleaning issue.","It looked like everything was cleaned on the surface, but we had to give the shower and toilet a good scrub.

- Fridge was making a very loud hum for extended lengths of time during the visit. The noise would stop when opened, then restart when closed. Made it challenging to be on conference call / to sit and talk at kitchen table. May want to look at repair.

Super walkable neighborhood with lots of great restaurants and coffee shops. The space was a really comfortable size for four people and nicely decorated!

However, the check-in process did not go smoothly. Upon arrival, we were instructed to use the intercom to access the building. Unfortunately, the intercom was broken and the receptionist was unable to hear us on the other line. After multiple attempts, I called Zencity, and after the second phone call, I was told I would receive the access code. While we were waiting for a response, we ended up getting inside through other people going in and out of the building. The check-in process ended up taking almost an hour total. After reading another review, I realized others have had issues with the intercom not working and an all together bad check-in experience.","Upon arrival, the kitchen sink had a really strong, foul smell. My brother-in-law, who is a general contractor, checked out the sink and there seemed to be some type of clog that was causing the smell.

But I'll try not to. This is simply a turn-and-burn facility that is looking to make money. Period. As a fellow host, I just expected much more care and cleanliness for the price. 

I would caution anyone deciding to stay here or any Zencity property and I'll just stick to the facts as to why.....

1. Found a dead cockroach in bedroom. 2. Found little black hairs all over bathtub (which was eroding) and black hair in freezer! 3. Floors wore filthy, do not walk barefoot in there. 4. The fridge was disgusting with leftover food and what looked like fresh spilled kool-aid stains everywhere 5.

Upon my arrival, I took it upon myself to look at the details of the space. Next thing I know, I see hair everywhere. On the floor, in the bed, in the shower, on the couch. Then I ran the shower and next thing you know it turns into a bath due to a hair clogged drained. The kitchenware was dirty, every single one. I had to clean anything I wanted to use!

29300816,450953310,2019-05-10,42144726,Stephen,Zencity is a great host with very prompt responses and easy to follow check-in steps. Great hosts!,,"Dirty dishes in dishwasher, few clothes left behind from previous renter, broken shower tile."
22265007,367835287,2019-01-05,118423574,Samuel,"This is a 2 floor, 2 bedroom 2 and a half bath unit with a large outdoor patio area. This is NOT a fully furnished unit being occupied by current tenants like you would expect from an air bnb, instead, this is a bare bone unit furnished only to the extent of a hotel that is being rented out by some sort of rental company solely for profit. For starters, the unit smelled strongly of cleaning products upon entering, and somehow smelled strongly of cigarette odour upstairs (we messaged right away asking them why this unit smells of smoke despite it being a non smoking unit, and they responded saying that it is a non smoking unit. That was their only response. Obviously the last renters smoked in it and Zencity tried to cover it up with Fabuloso, which was obvious thats all they did. What good is the $300 cleaning fee if you smoke if the owners don't even use it to make the extra effort?) Any way, this place is up on air bnb purely for the profit of ZenCity. The only amenities are towels pillows cups, bowls, and plates, and some Pert shampoo and ""Mountain Fresh"" body wash. It's very obvious they invested the least they could in this place. Good luck drying your hair because there is no hair dryer, and good luck making coffee because there is no coffee maker, just a French press in the kitchen with all the stickers and tags still in it, clearly not used or cleaned. I couldn't even wash it because there wasn't even a sponge to clean it lol. I asked my boyfriend ""how am I supposed to clean this?"" And he responded ""with the 110$ cleaning fee"" which was pretty funny. The place isn't finished with patches in the ceiling and exposed wires in the closets. Would only be perfect for parties, which are not allowed without incurring an extra $300 fee. Wouldn't recommend this place for a couples night or even a family travelling unless you want to bring your whole house with you. Take your $220 a night and get a nice hotel or a real air bnb.","The idea of renting an air bnb is to rent a fully furnished apartment that is currently occupied by people that leave you access to all amenities that anyone living in a nice apartment would actually have to share, not a bare bone unit furnished only to the extent of a hotel that strongly smells of cleaning product and, somehow, cigarettes.",Entire second floor smelled of cigarettes. Seriously. Not ok.
24454493,367409875,2019-01-04,135272137,Shae,"I enjoyed my stay here there were some very minor issues that I informed the host about in my personal review communication, but overall I have no major complaints.  I enjoyed the convenience of having a washer and dryer in the apartment.
 
Oh just a tip if you’re driving the parking can be a bit tricky so it might be best to stick with “Lyft or Uber”.  Especially if you are not going to be here for a long period of time.

I would recommend this or utilizing a car share program or Lyft or Uber as previously mentioned.","Thank you for the hospitality!  In the future I would suggest leaving a note or notification regarding that a maintenance personnel will be stopping by.  Also overall the house had the appearance of being clean however I noticed some crumbs and small paper on the kitchen floor along the cabinet’s floor.  As well as some spots in the tub that could have been scrubbed harder or with a cleansing material that would have whiten it more.   

Other than that I had a pleasure stay!

Thank you

I arrived and followed self check-in instructions, but found no key in the lock box.  I tried for over an hour to reach the host, via phone (supposed 24 hour urgent response line) and airbnb message, but after receiving no response, I ultimately had to make other plans (it was getting late, I had to be ready for early meetings).  Hopefully, this was just a mistake on their part, but the communication went from great before my arrival to very slow and incomplete after things went wrong.  I had to scramble to find alternative accommodations and am still working on getting a refund.  I can say that the location seems to be convenient- near the convention center and restaurants...",Please process refund/grievance.,No idea.  The lobby was fine.
38646026,563059410,2019-11-11,152028857,Margaret,"This was a great place! Exactly what we were looking for on our budget. Though not having parking was a bit more to worry about than we expected, we ended up using a nearby garage for Saturday and then parking on the street all night and on Sunday. The TV was awesome and the bed was super comfortable! Great value though there was an unpleasant smell recurring throughout our trip that they can hopefully sort out soon.",I loved how easy it was to communicate with you all and get in and out. The location was great and the people we encountered were lovely. I think something needs to get sorted out with that smell quickly because it is very noticeable.,There was hair in the shower and the floor made our feet dirty. Would help to have a rug somewhere in the common area because the hardwood was dirty very quickly. Also you all should figure out where the foul odor in the kitchen is coming from because it was very prominent for many hours of the day. Probably the only thing that will keep us from using that space again.
39334586,562389164,2019-11-10,176831055,Alejandra,"Area was exactly as pictured. A beautiful view of central west Park! Being up higher was really nice. No loud noise and pretty clean. The lighting in this cute little apartment was gorgeous! I had to take advantage and shoot some of my photography session in here. There was even multiple iPhone stands/chargers to use around the place which was convenient, including a Bluetooth speaker. The desktop area was nice to have as well. The only thing I wish there was, was a washer and dryer inside the apartment but there are plenty to use in the building. Rooftop was gorgeous and it was nice to have a 24 hour fitness area. Would stay here again especially because of the location!",I thought that you adding the iPhone stands and chargers was a great option as I had forgot my iPhone charger back at home! Thank you. Place had an awesome view. I definitely would stay here again for my next visit!,"Pretty clean, the kitchen stove had a little of left over burnt grind stuck to the burner covers. The floors could’ve been a little cleaner but other than that the rest of the place was spotless :)"
29614026,367321332,2019-01-04,86120702,Michelle,"I would recommend this unit to any and all of my friends. It is just as beautiful as the pictures make it look. The location is very central and walkable. There are nearby affordable garages for parking using Park Whiz. The host is responsive and available. And the unit offers many small details that other places do not. For example in the bedroom there were small shelves on both sides of the bed, along with outlets for charging our phones at night. If we'd had iPhones it would have been even more convenient as there chargers provided! The kitchen is great and includes a dishwasher and full size stove, oven and fridge, as well as cabinet space and everything needed to prepare a full meal. The larger bedroom has a walk-in closet and large private bathroom with both a stand alone shower and a tub. And the couch folds down to provide a third sleeping option. It was January when we visited so we didn't make use of it, but there is also a balcony with chairs that would be lovely in warmer weather. It was a $8 Uber ride (only $4 if you choose the carpool option) to the Magnificent Mile and all of the shopping, restaurants, the Art Institute, and Millennium Park. The El and buses were also available. This place is great and was perfect for our needs. We would definitely stay here again.","Thank you for a great stay. I will leave a glowing public report because this is definitely a place we would rent again. The doorknob issue will be resolved I'm sure. But it would be helpful if there were at least two key fobs, especially since the place is able to be rented up to five people. For our own personal taste too we would have preferred a coffeemaker instead of a French press, but that's our own preference, not an issue with the unit. Thanks again for getting us back into the unit and for providing such a lovely place for a very affordable price. We look forward to staying with Zencity again!","The bathroom could have been more thoroughly cleaned. It wasn't really dirty, just a few spots on the tub and toilet that could have been a little cleaner. Definitely not a deal breaker and on the whole the unit was very clean."
25983598,366898165,2019-01-03,167991720,Jojackson,Comfort.,"Overall, I enjoy the Zencity experience. I think that this listing was poorly prepared for, but with some more attention in the cleaning department, this could have been a great experience.","The dishwasher was still loaded with dirty dishes, which gave the impression that there were not enough dishes in the unit.  There was broken glassware in the cabinets, and dried spills in the bathroom that tracked throughout the apartment."
25983938,364849723,2018-12-31,223053165,Kristina,Nice modern studio in a beautiful neighborhood. Really enjoyed my stay and the nice amenities included. Great host as well!,Thanks for being a great host!,Refrigerator wasn’t clean. There was food left in from previous guest.

However, the one major issue I had was the cleanliness of the apartment. You are charged a cleaning fee in addition to the room charge which is totally fine except that I expected to walk into a clean apartment. Instead I walked in to find the floors in the kitchen had clearly not been cleaned and there had clearly been something spilled. The bathroom floors were covered with hair. The bed linens and blanket were covered with all different hairs and when I brought this to the hosts attention I was assured that they were clean but that there were extras in the closet if I wished to use them. I pulled them out only to find there were a bunch of big yellow stains on them and again, more hair.",Overall I enjoyed my stay. I just wish that it would have been thoroughly cleaned before my arrival especially since there is specifically a cleaning fee.,"The floors in the kitchen had clearly not been cleaned and there had clearly been something spilled.

38268915,554075643,2019-10-25,45008041,Pearl,"We enjoyed our stay here! The location is great if you need to be near medical or want to be near Forest Park. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Although on-site parking is our preference when traveling, we knew it was not available but were happy with the several nearby parking garages less than a 5 minute walk away. No stairs required to access the building or unit so that's also a plus!","We enjoyed our stay, but noticed a few things that might improve the experience for others. 
1. Clear instructions that when checking out and leaving the key on the table, it is okay to be leaving the unit unlocked
2. More silverware would be very helpful especially if staying for  couple days with 2-3 people
3. Non-slip mat for bottom of tub",Shower mat had curly black hairs on it when we arrived and the floor in kitchen by fridge was sticky. Carpet in living room was a bit dirty and fuzz balls could be seen on the floors in other rooms. Shower floor/tub bottom was very slick and made it feel like you could easily slip.
30672766,362546015,2018-12-26,96543721,Libin,"Not recommend! The host would be so unresponsive and  irresponsible when you encounter some problem even though it is not your fault. In my case, he just told me to call the building technician (which was not free) when I was locked out  because I got no key on check-in and  the two locks on the door both work. Now the host still ignores my request for the reimbursement of the stupid money I paid.  Last issue,  the Wifi is not so stable and fast even after being restarted.",,The bedsheet looks quite old and a little bit wore out
38268915,535544411,2019-09-24,4784003,Tamara,"The location cannot be beat and the apartment is nice. It's very sparse with few of the necessary items including eating utensils and a coffee pot. There is no onsite parking, no instructions about how to use anything.",I've stayed in many places that were not corporately owned and received better "how to" manuals and guidance to the area. There is only 1 spoon in the apartment. No extra light bulbs or towels. We were very disappointed with the cleanliness and the lack of concern for actually helping us have a good experience while we were there.,The floor wasn't swept or mopped. There was food stuck to the floor in the kitchen. There was dried fresh blood on a pillow case. The countertop in the kitchen wasn't wiped either.
40483468,668105669,2020-09-26,93314456,Jessica,"This is fine for the price, but definitely not the level of hospitality I am used to with Airbnb. When we checked in, no bath towels had been provided. The host sent some over eventually but we were out and they were left on the hallway floor - kind of unsanitary. The kitchen was only partially stocked (only 1 spoon, 2 bowls, etc) - definitely not what I would consider a fully stocked kitchen. The location was ok, no one in the building wore masks in the hallways or elevators and one night someone was running through the hall and stairs screaming late in the night. It could have been worse, but I wouldn’t stay with this host again.",,"Chunks of Hair in bedroom on the floor and stuck to the nightstand.

Apartment was the perfect size for my husband and I to get away for the weekend and the tv with Netflix was a nice touch. A little difficult to find at first and may have to pay for parking but we were able to find street parking for free. I would recommend this location for anyone wanting to find a cheap way to go to Chicago for the weekend.,"Thank you for the stay, we enjoyed the shops and restaurants so close. Loved being so close to downtown as well. I think a fan would a good idea in the bedroom, it gets very hot with the comforter you have. Maybe another sheet for the bed as well. But bed very comfortable and a very stylish apt. Thanks again for the stay we had a nice time!!","The tub was clogged after one use. Something was dripping in the fridge on the ground, not sure what it was because we didn’t use the fridge.  Not your fault but the hallway and stairs were so dirty and it smelled."

However the apartment heating system was quite warm and not adjustable.","please adjust heat or leave instructions as to how to do it. I tried to turn the knob on a couple of the heaters but they were stuck and very hot. Also the black light fixture did not work, and a small power strip in the bedroom would help as I could not have the light on and charge devices. Other than that the location, space and ease of check in was great, but was so uncomfortable with the heat I would hesitate to book again.","the second blanket that my daughter would have used for the couch/bed was wadded up, dirty and on the floor in the closet.

The location is fantastic (lots going on in / around the area, plus just a quick trip to get downtown for the more touristy locations), and the place is clean, comfortable, and quiet. The only thing that I would mention is that the heating system is a little noisy. None of the people in our group were light sleepers, so it didn't impact our stay - but if you were a light sleeper it might not be a great fit.","Hi Chris -

If you are looking for a homey place with character, this isnt really the place though. You can tell no one has ever lived here before (no hooks to hang your coats, the bed covers aren’t warm enough for a Chicago winter etc.) There are no personal touches around the house. Dealing with zencity feels very corporate - they don’t respond directly to your questions, but send canned messages. I made the above suggestions to them in a private email, but never got a response.",I provided all of this information to you in a private message. One of the reasons I like Airbnb is for the personal touch. I felt zero personal touch in this whole interaction.,Overall the house was very clean.

And apparently key sets work for multiple units because arriving tenants were able to unlock our unit waking us up at 4am. Not safe!!!,Having multiple keys that access any unit is a safety hazard. We were mortified to have arriving tenants able to open our unit waking us up at 4am. That’s really unacceptable!,Light fixtures are really dusty. And there are few outlets so tangled of extension cords wrap around the old steam radiator which gets very hot thus creating a potential safety hazard as those cords make contact with the hot radiator.

It took us about 30 minutes to find parking. We eventually found a free spot to the east on lake shore drive where you park diagonally. We had no problems parking and leaving our car there for 3 days.

That made everything much less stressful,"The bottom sheet on the bed was a size too small, like someone tried to stretch a full size onto a queen. It kept coming off. And the top sheet had a reddish stain which was kind of gross. I would definitely try and get that stain out or buy new sheets.

Shower head initially not working well, though was fixed very fast upon my complaint. Furniture ok, in good condition. Generally pleasant in the apartment. The building is bustling -- what was a notorious disaster in the 1970s has become lively and cheerful, reasonably clean and stylish though inevitably a bit beat up. The elevators are really preposterous, though -- filthy, badly adjusted, with weird, scary doors.

Historical building with unique charm not found in most hotels but not without its quirks. The appliances are a little older, if you decide to cook. The building is not young, so the plumbing can be tricky with a lack of hot water in the shower and a finicky toilet that you need to hold the handle longer to flush. We didn't utilize but found: french press with coffee and instant creamer, a straightener, and body wash and shampoo in the shower. Towels were clean, there was wifi and streaming on the TV. There was also an iphone charging station bedside. The check in and out was easy and convenient. It would probably be a great place for a student or someone seeking quiet and the building seemed very quiet.","Thank you for letting us experience Hyde Park. Overall, for the price (basically fees and taxes) we feel we could have gotten more from a hotel downtown. The shower curtain needs to be shortened in and out of the shower, that was a real hazard and we obviously weren't the first to experience this, as one loop had been previously torn. The window ledge needs to be trimmed by 1-2"" as well. There was nearly no hot water -ever- and the toilet needed finessing just to flush a few squares of tp. I'm not sure how someone is supposed to safely hang towels above that radiator when it is in use. There was no hair dryer that I saw yet there was a flat iron? I brought my own regardless, because I didn't see it listed. The cleanliness was the ultimate for us as we were charged for the cleaning fee and I'm sure the person before us was as well, yet the kitchen wasn't clean. It looked very pretty in pictures but to more accurately represent the place and avoid disappointment, I'd suggest a message regarding the finicky ways of an old building and for the love of Pete, grease the hinges on the main doors. Creaky floors are one thing, but those doors made so much noise. The work throughout the studio was a little sloppy when you see it in person, and seems to have been done hastily to make it rent-able. I'd also close off the 1 storage closet to make it less janitorial and more comfortable throughout the joining spaces.",There was a leak or some sticky substance by the trash can which was still wet and food left in the fridge.

27961370,323453574,2018-09-15,64984717,Jennifer,"If you are looking for a comfortable place near the University of Chicago, this place is great. The building itself is very charming, with a large, old-fashioned lobby and a private courtyard. The apartment was well-stocked with all the essentials plus extra thoughtful touches, like a phone charging station on the nightstand, coffee, and neat automatic soap dispensers. Chris was very quick to respond to all of my messages. The place was very clean and everything seemed quite new. I had no trouble finding free street parking nearby. The only small negative thing I have to say is that it is one floor up from ground level and near a fire station, so if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. I would definitely stay here again!","The apartment was great, overall! The kitchen and bathroom were thoughtfully stocked, and I appreciated the smaller touches like the phone charging station on the nightstand. I think there are a few things that could improve it even more for future guests. As I mentioned in earlier feedback, I did see 1-2 cockroaches during the night on several occasions. I don't think this reflects on your management of the apartment, nor was there any food/dishes left out to attract them, but this is definitely something to address. One other important thing is that there were blinds in the closet that looked like they were meant to be put on the bedroom windows, but had not been hung up. This meant I had to choose between privacy with the curtains and using the air conditioner/fan unit, since the curtains cover the unit, which was a mild inconvenience. A couple amenities that would have made the place more comfortable are an actual chair for the desk instead of the stool and a full-length mirror somewhere in the apartment.","I think this is a building issue that is not your fault and should be brought up with your landlord, but I saw cockroaches on all occasions that I was awake past 1 AM."

The location was great - metra station and bus stops were really close and Wholefoods as well. The studio was definitely spacious for two. However, it looked like it was cleaned a while ago or the cleaner took very little time to clean the place. When we lifted up the comforter, there were little strands of hair everywhere on the sheet and some pillows smelled like somebody had just slept on it. I asked for extra sheets and Chris was kind enough to tell me that there were extra in the closet but majority of them were stained and not clean. Before you actually lie on the bed, check your beddings guys. The bathroom was clean but there were some used toiletries left behind. The check-in and check-out process was super easy and great.","All the beddings including the extra one in the closet had either stains or hair on them. We had to sleep on top of the comforter with the towels covered. I really think you should tell the cleaners to pay attention to those. Also, I caught small roaches three days in a row( two coming from the stove and one coming from the bathroom). Food particles in the sink were there and we definitely didn’t want to see that.",Unwashed  beddings and uncleaned sink

Very very stylish and the place was calm and quiet.  It was great to come to a place that felt like our own apartment after working late....also appreciate the roku....thanks again

- a cutting board
- an actual butcher/cerated knife

Everything was great the TV even had Netflix and this home is very cozy for a nice night of Netflix and Chill. Neighborhood is beautiful and really easy commute to any where in Chicago.  Chris was great at hearing out my concerns and we talked about the minor cleanliness issues I had. I can  be obssesive compulsive over cleaning . It was nice to have someone listen and understand.

26420661,310513895,2018-08-19,51144276,Davey,"the absolute best feature is the location. Great neighborhood lots of cool eating, drinking, shopping options nearby. 7 minute walk to the Blue Line makes the entire city accessible. felt very safe.  

the place is clean, the beds were very comfortable and clean, and communication with the host was awesome. great linens, comfy towels,  well stocked.  Even has an Alexa that was fun to tool around with.  

some things to just be aware of case you're not paying attention to the description... one of the bedrooms has a cutaway in the top half of the wall that opens to the living room. the room is still private, however you can hear all the sounds from the rest of the apartment. the apartment itself is quiet. Did not hear Neighbors. you do not hear the train either. not the host's fault but the common area hallways had two different smoke detectors chirping a low battery beep every few minutes the entire first night and part of the second night, until maintenance was able to replace the batteries.  

as of this writing the entrance stairwell to the building, some of the common area and other apartments in the building are undergoing renovations. it should not bother you but note that the common area is not prestine. there is unfinished drywall and construction remnants about.  until that is done,  the stairwell area is in a transitive state. 

the only other complaint is that as well stocked as the apartment is,  feel it should have a coffee maker in the kitchen.  but there are several coffee places nearby.  Kinelas was an awesome breakfast spot.  

all in all,  good value, comfortable and clean.  I would recommend this to you and friends.  



",thanks for the quick responses and attending to things that came up,"the space is obviously intended to and is clean. Perhaps a bit nitpicky but the place has not apparently been subject to a deep clean with dust bunnies abundantly  observed in corners, on window sills, under the curtains. to be clear the place is clean just not perfect 5 stars"

Negatives:  dirty place with hair in bathrooms, dirty dishes in dishwasher, water filter in fridge overdue for replacement by 99 days, dead insects on floor, stains on stairs, broken slats of beds.  You need to have a thorough audit of the property to do the needed repairs and maintenance. And also improve cleanliness.

Super easy check in and arrival instruction, and quick response to questions. The bad: both the building’s common areas and the apartment itself where lacking a thorough cleaning (dusting,  sweeping, vacuuming). At times there is even a perceptible tobacco smell within the apartment. The couch was super dusty. These are easily corrected faults that would have improved our perception enormously. ","Hi. The apartment is in an outstanding location. However our overall experience was affected by the overwhelming amount of dust on the floors, the couch, and the either old or very dirty carpet. Also, you are missing basic amenities like coffee filters. Definitely would improve the experience with a grater focus on the guest and its user experience.","El edificio está descuidado y se ve que no lo limpian habitualmente.

The water didn’t drain that night or throughout my stay. I notified my host he responded right away but nothing was ever done about this huge inconvenience. Not being able to use the shower or tub from Friday till Sunday. On the day of my check in I was notified that the washer and dryer would be unavailable, I responded with that’s ok. Still waiting for the host to rectify this inconvenience. "
23698100,297881275,2018-07-28,203029720,Joe,"Overall,  the place was nice. 

Previous reviews mentioned noisy neighbors, which was the case, but that's not on the owner by any means. The neighbors were also smoking weed all through the night with the smell creeping into the bedroom. Again, that's not on the owner.

There was quite a bit of hair on the bathroom and kitchen floors which made it seem as if there was zero vacuuming before our arrival.

Bring a sleep mask. There's a bright light outside of the bedroom window and the window curtain is piece of paper thin and white as a ghost. Some blackout curtains need to be installed if you want a quality night of sleep.

The above issues aren't a huge deal at the end of the day. The big issue was when my girlfriend came back in the middle of the day and found phone chargers on the kitchen table which were not there when we arrived the previous night. I'm assuming the owner came to drop them off while we were not there. I'm not sure what Air B&B's rule is for owners coming to the place during a customer's stay, but that's screwed up, in my opinion. For one, I had my laptop and a few hundred dollars in cash in my bag. Two, my girlfriend had been in the shower at one point, so they could of knocked and just came in when she was in there. 

And no, I was not previously informed that he/she would be stopping by. ",,There was A LOT of hair on the floor which I had to vacuum  myself.

Very walkable for touring around. The French market down the street was a cute spot for grabbing some things to have on hand to unwind with (wine, cheese etc). Just be aware there are very basic cookware and utensils, so if you wanted to do some hardcore cooking you might be missing some needed things. Otherwise, this place is beautiful, accommodating and highly recommended. ","A box of Kleenex or two would be helpful, as would some more kitchen towels and a small knife set for the kitchen, & cutting board.

The balcony is really cool and perfect for a summer night to watch the passerby’s of the neighborhood. The location is wonderful. Very close to many restaurants in Hyde Park and to the buses and Metra. The amenities are plentiful, and there was no need to buy anything extra. We were a little disappointed with the washer and dryer not working as this was one of the reasons for choosing this place. We were coming from another destination, and we had the need to wash our clothes to last us the entire trip. Hopefully, this gets fixed. In any case, I would recommend to stay here for any future travelers. ","Hi Chris. Thanks again for letting us stay in your apartment. Overall, it was a good place to come back to after pair long days walking and seeing the great city of Chicago. A couple things we’d recommend to spruce up the place for future occupants would be to fix the shower as the pipes were backing up from the first shower we took to the last even after using Drain-O. A mesh would help this in the future to catch all the hair and crud. We would also recommend adding a more comfortable couch. The low back makes it difficult to lay back and relax. We ended up using our pillows to create a higher back. Besides that, the place was comfortable, and the amenities were great. The small office area was perfect for me to get the little work in I needed to get to on my laptop while watching tv. 

Further, we were a bit disappointed the washer and dryer were not functional. Part of our decision to book this place was to have that amenity, since we were coming from another destination and in need of washing out clothes. We had to take other measures to make sure we had enough clean clothes. We would have chosen another place if we would have known this was not available. 

Lastly, we did enjoy the kitchen, the tv, the closet, and the overall spaciousness of the apartment. We never felt cramped, which made us feel at home. We also really liked the balcony set up, although we weren’t able to use it due to the weather.  The neighborhood is wonderful and the location of the apartment was perfect for food and public transportation options. Overall, we appreciate the time we spent in Chicago. Cheers!","The bathtub was backing up from the day we got there. The final day was terrible as I had to use the plunger to drain the tub. When plunging, a bit of dirt was coming up. I used the Drain-O I found under the kitchen sink, but it was not effective. May need to use a snake to clean out the pipes. Recommendation is to put a mesh to catch all the hair and crud that could plug up the tub in the future. "

When we got there was impossible to park so we used a paid parking garage around the corner. I wish we had waited for a bit because spaces on the street do open up, just have to be patient.

On 53rd street there’s everything you might need, Target, Starbucks, CVS, restaurants, etc
Chris sent us precise and clear instructions on how to get in. The building is old but has lots of character, the front lobby was being renovated which was badly needed. The apartment is beautiful if you like old style. It has lots of character and tons of storage space. Chris keeps it stored with all the basic amenities and more. The kitchen is very well equipped and clean. It has two bathrooms which is a bonus. The TV worked very well and the bed was very comfortable.

For the most part, the size and cleanliness of the apartment were a 5/5 (but when we went to use the glasses in the kitchen they were dirty.) Apartment is small, but works for 2 people. The bad: the furniture (and there isn’t much) was outrageously uncomfortable. The futon  had to have been an IKEA family special and in my opinion, needs to be replaced with an actual sofa as you feel every spring! This apartment does not have AC, but one window unit in the living room. When we arrive (on a 90 degree day) the unit has not been turned on, so the apartment was very warm. It finally cooled down as we left the following morning. All in all, apartment was ok, but would be great with a few changes.","That futon has to go!!! It is so uncomfortable.

Although we were attending for a conference at McCormick, we liked to be downtown everyday. Over the weekend, public transit was not the easiest. Rideshare/taxis became expensive especially
coming back at night due to distance and passing by McCormick place which gets crazy with events. The actual unit is clean and modern. There’s coffee press and grinder as well. My main issue was the lack of blackout curtains in the bedroom- it was super bright and so sleeping in anytime past sunrise (around 7am around the time we went) was an issue which was unfortunate as we were there over the weekend. ","Hi Chris, please for the bedroom- consider blackout curtains- this was the main reason why I couldn’t give 4 stars- sleeping past 7am was an issue! ",One of the kitchen sinks looked  really rusty 
22264479,269680133,2018-05-27,108688022,Anna,"Chris’s place was very good for the price. It’s small, but great for 1-2 people max. We were a little confused with the directions to get to the apartment as they do not go in numerical order like you’d expect. Make sure you walk all the way to the very end of the hallway, here you will find the correct apartment number. This past weekend was extremely hot, in the high 90’s. The unit luckily had a window air-conditioner that worked okay. It never got lower than 75 ish degrees in the apartment, so it was still a little warm. The shower & shower head were also a bit on the older side and the water pressure was not great. The rest of the apartment was very nice, small kitchen with essentials, and having Netflix was also a plus. As far as location goes and traveling to the city: It’s about a 10-minute walk to the Metra station and another 10-15 minutes downtown via the train. The Metra only comes about every 30-minutes, so plan out your schedule ahead of time unless you want to wait. Another useful tip is that the ticket station is only on the North side of the station. So if you need to purchase a Metra ticket, enter on the North end, or you’ll have to walk around to the south end which takes a little bit of time. (You can buy them on your phone too!) You can of course Uber or Lyft, but it is quite pricey, so the train is a much cheaper alternative. Free parking around the apartment is also quite full on the weekends, so you may have to park a few blocks away. ","Hi Chris! A couple of suggestions: 
1) It would be helpful to guests to tell them the apartment unit is all the way at the end of the building. The units do not go in numerical order and that was a bit confusing.
2) The shower needs a little love. I think a new shower curtain without stains and a good scrubbing of the tile. There were some mold spots as well. Also, the shower pressure wasn't good. I don't know if it is the shower head or just an older apartment building, but it wasn't great.
3) The air conditioner didn't get very cold. Not sure if it's old or what?
4) I couldn't find a scissors in the apartment. That would be a good gadget to have in the kitchen. I used a knife, which worked, but a scissors would have been better.
5) Some other places we've stayed had a listing of sights or places to go/see, maybe a book or something would be helpful. Also, directions for the Metra or map or something like that. We used our phones, but something physical might be helpful.

Street parking is relatively easy to find. Chris was very responsive and the place was quiet nice. There were some issues with the hot water in the shower, but other than that, everything was awesome! Loved the snacks in the kitchen! Thanks, Chris!","Thank you very much for letting us stay at your place. It was very nice and the location is great. The only issue we noticed was that there was a slight sewage odor in the apartment. That can be normal in older buildings, but maybe adding an air freshner? Also, there was absolutely no hot water available from the shower this morning. Not sure if this is a regular issue, but maybe worth noting to future guests. I wouldn’t have tried to use the shower if I knew how cold it was going to be. Overall, everything was great! Just a few small notes 🙂","Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas: odors, shower or tub."

23699085,248453663,2018-03-31,60286046,Stephanie,"I chose this location to be near my son who attends the University of Chicago. Chris really adds extra touches to make you feel at home and responds quickly to any questions or needs. I stayed in a few Airbnb's and this by far was the best. He has all Dove products in the shower, memory foam bath mat, hand towels, automatic hand soap dispenser, body lotion, plenty of toilet paper, kleenex, extra towels and linens, air freshener, iron, umbrella, hair dryer, a vacuum and mop should you make a mess, laundry pods, interesting coffee table books, snacks, dish soap, dish towel, dish drainer, electric hot water kettle, french press, ceiling fan, and door has a peep hole for safety. Next let's talk about the safety and location. There are three locks between you and the inside of the apartment. There's the door to get in the building, the door to get in the hallway for elevator access, and then of course the door to the apartment which makes you feel very secure. The lobby is quite swanky with a nice place to sit and there's also a courtyard which I would have utilized had it not been 40 degrees outside. On the corner sits Love Taco  and Dunkin Donuts. You are only a block or two away from Target, Sushi/ramen, Rajun Cajun, Starbucks, Mellow Yellow (love), Velois (one of President Obama's breakfast spots *cash only* huge portions good prices) and many others. Walk a little further maybe 3-5 blocks and you have CVS and Harold's famous chicken in one direction and the other direction is LA Fitness, Walgreens, Office Depot and Treasure Island. It is only a short walk to many bus stops
*The apartment has radiators for heat. Visiting from Florida I was not used to this and even when they're turned off they still let off a little bit of heat. My son told me this is normal. If you tend to run hot, having a small fan is helpful. I definitely recommend this place and would definitely stay again.","This really was the best Airbnb I've stayed in as far as amenities. All those little touches really made a difference such as the vases w silk flowers, bath mat, hair dryer, umbrella, laundry detergent, body lotion, air freshener. I would suggest having a fan as well that guess could plug in and moved from room to room as needed.","Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas: towels and linens, odors.

There was plenty of space for 2 people, the building was great and Chris was excellent at responding quickly. The queen bed was a firm Tempurpedic-type mattress. Good for some people, not good for others. And now, for the breakdown:

PROS: 
-Good living space and sweeping views of northwestern Chicago with lots of light from the large windows, especially at sunset. Dark fabric blinds are in the bedroom to block out early morning sunlight.
-Great gym and lounge areas in the building.
-Location was excellent for walking access to downtown and West Loop attractions & restaurants.
-Good kitchen space with all the necessary tools for making meals.
-A rare bonus: plenty of toilet paper and paper towel provided for the entire stay.
-Lots of closet space and storage space in the bathroom.

CONS: 
-There was quite a lot of train noise from early morning into the evening. 
-The quality of the cleanings provided by Chris's staff was a problem, with dirt remaining on the floors and carpets after the cleaning, but Chris was willing to make it right.
-Bed frame was squeaky and couch was rather uncomfortable.
-There is no proper office desk for study or working on a laptop, except by sitting at the bar stools on the back side of the kitchen island.","Chris, thanks for being such a great host and paying attention to our needs during our extended time in the apartment. We appreciate how you brought the extra set of keys, coat hooks, kitchen towels, knives and pillows during the first week of our stay and how you were willing to grant the complimentary cleanings to make it right. 
Suggestions for making it a top-notch property:
-providing a table or stand for belongings at the front door.
-providing a more comfortable couch (and repairing the right side arm of the current one)
-providing a different bed frame that doesn't squeak every time the occupant moves an inch.

Easy walking distance to the 'El', coffee shops, restaurants, pubs, grocery/drug store,  and close to downtown.  Uber rides to Sears (Willis) Tower, Museums, Navy Pier etc only ran $6-11.  The neighborhood is very comfortable and quiet, but you can be in the thick of things within 2 blocks.  Chris communications were clear and timely and overall our stay was a good value.

It was my first time using airbnb and I couldn't have been more pleased. I would definitely recommend, and would stay here again without hesitation.","Loved your cool apartment. Would definitely stay again. I'll make a few friendly suggestions here below easily found at Ikea: a sharp knife for cutting and a cutting board, a few hooks to hang wet bath towels to dry, a small desk (Ikea has a super narrow desk), a small chest of drawers in the bedroom next to the bed with a night light, and maybe a blanket (the one in the photo was no where to be found). That said, these are super friendly suggestions, not at all critisism. Your place is close to perfect. Just for your own info, one day the heat was not working even with valve fully open, walls are thin and some neighbors forget that others are trying to sleep, and the toilet doesn't flush easily (I suggest single layer paper for old plumbing, but that's me). None of this bothered me. Loved my stay. I will recommend it to other UChi parents visiting the school. And hope to rent from you again. Maybe soon.

It is in a great location, but for the condition of the place, you might want to think about lowering the price. The bed is very comfortable, and the linens were all clean and smelled fresh. I also appreciated the snacks upon arrival.nI felt like the cleanliness overall was acceptable, except for the notes above and below. The blinds missing in the kitchen was a bit uncomfortable as people in the building did use the fire escape stairs. There was more than once when I found myself standing face to face with someone while I was in the kitchen and they were going down the stairs. People could also see in the window to the couch/chair in the living room so privacy did become an issue. I also thought the dishwasher was gross on the inside. I don't know if it is not working or what, but I ended up just had washing all the dishes. Whoever does the cleaning may want to take a look at it.

Our biggest issues with the stay is that Chris was selectively responsive with us. That is, he promised Netflix and when we arrived it wasn't logged in. We expressed this issue to Chris and he said that he would like to keep his credentials private. That's completely understandable! But when we asked him to fix the problem in other ways, he stopped responding. Similarly, we asked for recommendations of things to do nearby on multiple occasions, and each time, he stopped responding to messages. However, despite the trouble almost everyone else had with the keys, we found it to be a very smooth and easy check in. All-in-all it was a good experience. Being on the 4th floor is a plus in Chicago as it minimizes how much noise travels to your apartment!","Hey Chris! I just wanted to note that there was a spot on our comforter. Even if it was a stain, it's a little discomforting to see something like that in an unknown environment. Just for future reference! Also, we were pretty frustrated with the fact that the Netflix was logged out despite the fact that it was a promised amenity. It would be fine, but when we asked for you to fix it, you stopped responding. ",“Spot on comforter”

The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price. ($238 per night). The building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that it’s in, however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself. Although, in this case, it did. The elevator was not functional, causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs. We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls, dirt and grime in the refrigerator and freezer, as well as faulty hardware in the bathroom. We also noticed that the dishware was not properly cleaned and had yellow caked-on residue from previous usage.
 
Chris was extremely unprofessional, and needed to visit the residence multiple times during our stay which really made us feel uncomfortable, and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays, let alone hotel stays for comparable price points. There was a showing of the space scheduled during our stay, which was completely unacceptable. Chris also needed to retrieve a garment for a (supposedly) previous guest while we were staying, which also made no sense to us. Why couldn’t these things be handled after our stay was finished? 
 
Furthermore, we had booked a stay at one of Chris’s other listings which we had to unfortunately cancel due to a change of schedule in our business trip. The fact he was unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at the other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didn’t settle well with us. Especially since we had booked a longer stay at his other listing.
 
All in all, we are completely unsatisfied with Chris as a host, and even though the Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area, we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing.

The reading lights and clock in the bedroom made for a cozy evening, and providing some basic office supplies (like a stapler, pen & paper) made the desk useful.

Not clean. We had to clean up other peoples hair in the bathroom before we could use it, we were grossed out. There was hair and pee stains on the sheets.

Great location. There is a parking garage right across the street which was very convenient for our rental car (which you don't need, at all. parking is expensive, too).

We were allowed to check in early, and they even let us keep our bags in the apartment during the day of our departure. We had a late flight out of the city, so we still wanted to enjoy our stay and explore. The space was as described and in a great location. We were central to all Chicago has to offer. The apartment was not the cleanest one I have been in, but it was suitable for a space to stay.

Before our stay, the host provided us with some great suggestions for things to do during our stay. We never had any issues reaching the host before or during our time. I recommend Chris and Collin to anyone traveling to Chicago!",,"There was long black hair all over the floors and in the shower. Neither my wife or I have black hair, so I am assuming the space was not cleaned before we arrived. Floor in kitchen near sink was sticky."

There was even a welcome 6-pack of beer in the fridge!

The apartment is lovely, painted all in white, has wonderful architectural detail not shown in the photos, and so is even lovelier than posted! It is located in a great area of Chicago close to shopping, restaurants, bars, and is just a block and a half away from the “Mag Mile” AKA Michigan Avenue. It is also within 10 minutes’ walking distance of Northwestern’s campus and is on a street frequented by taxis and Ubers. The Red Line of the El is just a few blocks (2-3?) west, while plenty of buses are found on Michigan Avenue.

Collin is very nice, extremely smart, intellectual, well-versed on F. Scott Fitzgerald and is a joy to chat with! You’ll love him!

It’s a great little place and most of the issues I had were with the service I received.,"A lot of the pots and pans had oil and were dirty. And also, little things like the bathroom not having soap in the soap dispenser or a trash can made this an inconvenient stay. Also, another little but irritating thing. Why would you have a coffee machine, creamer, and sugar for your guest but no filters? I ran to the store to buy coffee and got back to realize there was no filters.

It has amazing natural light, is stunningly designed and decorated, and was worth every penny.

The only challenge we had was with getting into the Airbnb. It’s a bit of a process and took us about 30 minutes to figure it all out and find our way. The instructions could be a little more clear, but that did not hinder our experience almost at all.

There were no decorations, or hints of being in Chicago.  I wish you would have included instructions as to how to use the TV and the remotes.  While I appreciate the free cable/Netflix and so on, I could not access local TV.  I also wish you would have included a list of nearby restaurants with phone numbers to aide in ordering food.  I was surprised you did not include Wifi, or instructions as to how to access your Wifi.  Other Airbnbs I have stayed in gave access codes.  Saturday night and Sunday morning, the building door (to get to the elevator) did not shut all the way no matter how much we tugged on it.

Although the apartment has a great location, it is not soundproofed at all: especially given the location, and it's an old building. You can expect to hear ambulance sirens all day, as it's next to multiple hospitals, and you can clearly hear cars driving by despite being 6 floors above the street.

a lot of natural light in and the space was very nice, as well as the kitchen. Unfortunately there was a lot of little problems that were very unpleasant. The worst was the four flights of steps you have to climb back and forth to get to the place itself. The walk up to the stairs was awful and the hallways smelled and were really dirty. The shower had barely any water pressure and the head fell off the second I tried to turn it, and it wouldn’t stop running. The thermostat is not controllable so we were either freezing or hot. The majority of the windows did not stay open and they almost slammed down on our hands a couples times,
only two actually stay open. There’s a very loud train right across from the apartment so that’s all you’ll here every 20 minutes. The floors creaked everywhere you walked and the walls are thin so you have to be quiet the whole time. The room without the window is literally suffocating, trying to sleep in there was extremely difficult there was no ventilation and was very hard to breathe in, even with the door open.","Fix the shower head and do something with the second room there’s no ventilation it was very suffocating sleeping inside there, and fix the windows because it almost slammed twice or didn’t even pull up at all.","The place was really dusty, the mirror was dirty and so were the windows."

The parking garage is a 3 min walk which is very convenient and was free during our stay. So that’s a huge plus! I would recommend Investing in a wine opener! And spot checking cleanliness is some areas (The curtain and the back wall of the tub)

The bathroom cleanliness left something to be desired, but I hope that it was an unusual occurrence. The building amenities were amazing and better than expected.","Normally I would not leave a note here but the bathroom cleanliness left quite a bit to be desired.  I hope your cleaner was just having an off day and that this was not the norm. The floor looked as though it had not been swept (I swept it with the provided broom not long after arriving and there was quite a bit of dirt/hair/TP bits/etc.), the shower walls/tub had clearly not been wiped down (I wiped it down with provided cleaner and rag), and the toilet rim had very obviously not been wiped down (dust, urine drips, etc. were clearly present). The rest of the apartment appeared to be clean, but if you are charging guests a cleaning fee, it seems like you would make the restroom a priority as every single guest uses the restroom and that is where the most germs are present.

Also,  you may want to be more detailed in the individual building amenities--I had no idea that the building had a hot tub or coffee machines, and wasn't positive that they were available to me as a temporary guest. Knowing both of those things would've been an even bigger selling point in addition to the stylish space.

The beds were very comfortable and they had fresh, clean towels a plenty and ready for use but the common rooms such as kitchen and living room could have used some extra attention some spots seemed to have missed the last couple of cleanings.

I would recommend bringing your own so you know you have what you need. There was no kitchen knife, or measuring cups as an example.

I didn't have any numbers so I called the number listed on the door of the building. I was basically told that they could not help me. They wouldn't look up the number to a locksmith for me. I called them a total of four times begging for help. I told them I have my ID and everything. They refused again and again. They told a single woman at 3:00 in the morning to walk the street and figure it out basically. 

It was appalling to me to hear someone tell a young woman to do that. This is totally unacceptable.

When  we asked to move we were told there would be an additional charge which we refused; finally they offered to move us without an additional charge. We would like to note that Ava and Marty (Zencity's customer service) were very responsive and helpful but seemed hampered by whatever policies were in place. This would have been an ideal place if the sink had worked.",Ava & Marty were terrific. Zencity's policies or procedures were really problematic - we were very disappointed that the sink situation had not been noticed  before we checked in and was not quickly fixed.

I called security when a fight broke out. At 1 a.m. when I still could not get to sleep for the noise level I politely asked them to calm it down. Thankfully they did.

My one real complaint which I won't do publicly was the slow to no response and the lack of checkout details.  I'm used to a bit more interaction. In one way it was fine but also I was a little lost on if I needed to strip the bed or wash dishes. I leave a tidy place anyway, so not an issue... just something to note.

However, the instructions on how to get into the building are rather confusing and most of the dishes in the kitchen were dirty or still had food on them, so I had to rewash all of them before I could use them. The bathroom is super cute though and there’s a good diner within walking distance from the place, so that was nice!",,Almost all the dishes/glasses in the cabinet were dirty or still have food on them and there was hair all on the towels in the bedroom and sheets... but other than that the place was pretty clean!

42519935,645306829,2020-08-01,200205753,Naya,I was very surprised at how filthy the place was. the host were very slow about fixing the issue and sending people to clean the mess. It’s cheap though so you get what you pay for but hopefully they fix the issue as soon as possible. other than that it would’ve been perfect. very nice spot in a good location.,please just take care of your cleaning people so they take better care of your business. invest in candles. always keep the air blowing even if no one is there.,"the floor was dirty and had t been swept before they ran the duster mop across the floor. the sheets were dirty, the extra sheets were dirty. i smelled terribly. i was overall just very disgusted. used my t shirts as pillow cases."

The pictures are true to appearance. kitchen is stoked with pots, pans, silverware, toaster, and what looked a tea maker or french press? didn’t look too well but either way! Location is wonderful if you’re planning any lakefront activities; beach,  navy pier, biking, etc. there’s also a 24 hour gas station within a 10 minute walking distance. There’s also a park directly across the street. All free street parking but you might struggle to find a spot if you come back late. Gym/fitness center is small with limited machinery but is totally perfect for a quick pump up in the morning. The bed is super cozy, and the apartment overall is very cute. Water pressure isn’t the best and it tends to get pretty warm in the bedroom/living room temperature wise but crack a window open and that solves the issue quickly. neighbors are basically nonexistent so no noise complaints from me as far as the actual building itself goes. I’ve stayed at other Zencity locations before and from my previous experience they’re always prompt with responses and I have had zero problems. look forward to any new locations they add if they do!","I would definitely like to point out that none of the lights on the wall in the bedroom work aside the small bedside lights. The water pressure could be a little better, and there were some ants in the kitchen.

37215644,621604336,2020-04-02,56178161,Alex,"This apartment is sufficient for two guest the most, as there is not a comfortable place to sit for more than two people in the living room. The chair in the living room was extremely uncomfortable, and the couch only sat two uncomfortably. Also, the amount of dinnerware and utensils is was insufficient for the amount of bedrooms. There were three plates available for use and only 4 forks. We constantly needed to wash the forks to re-use them.","Thank you so much for an accommodating spot for us to stay. However, we would like to request our cleaning fee be refunded, as the apartment was far from clean when we arrived. During this coronavirus climate, this was very unsettling for us. Cleanliness description is in review. Broken glass on the living room rug, stains on the ceiling above bed, etc. Also, the bathroom door was falling off it’s hinge, making it nearly impossible to close. The French press coffee maker also fell apart in my hands. I am not usually one to leave a bad review, but the conditions of this apartment were unacceptable, especially when such a high cleaning fee is charged.","Rug had remnants of crumbs of some sort, as well as a piece of broken glass we discovered. Very glad we didn’t cut our feet. Spots on floor, as well as mysterious spot above my bed on ceiling that looked like a sticky white/clear substance. Very repulsive to sleep under."

39599097,621537820,2020-04-01,2649572,Pauline,"Calming design, very spacious and light-filled apartment. Great location and fast responses from host.

Unfortunately, no in-unit laundry as listed and very, very loud roof construction that I wasn't informed of. It was disruptive for my WFH calls, and caused debris to get over the floor, creating a mess for me to clean up at the end of each day. A ZenCity staff member named Mallory was seemingly dismissive about my inquiries on both points, however Ava and Marty were much more helpful. Marty was able to have the construction pause by my 7th day there, until I left a week later.

Would have loved to give a glowing review otherwise!","Thanks for the quick responses, especially to Marty and Ava for helping when I felt uncomfortable with the construction and electronic lock.","The place was clean upon arrival, however, due to roof construction for the first 6 days, small debris and dust regularly fell from the walls and ceiling onto the floor, becoming a daily chore that I had to clean up."
45684905,704499224,2020-10-27,136450623,Begemina,"My friend and I had a lovely 4 day stay at Zencity’s place. You definitely receive a lot for this low price. The building is incredibly secure as you need to use a key fob to access all parts of the building (including the elevator). Everything looks exactly as it does in the photos. I wish there was pictures of the Roof Deck so everyone could see how beautiful the view is! It is essentially a 360° view! It is in an excellent location (close to everything) and it seems like the room and the inside of the building are brand new. There was a lot of construction going on throughout the building, not that it bothered us in any way. 

The hosts were always quick to respond and offered detailed instructions for how to access the building/apartment/parking lot.

I thought it was very thoughtful that dish soap, laundry detergent, and extra trash bags were provided. The shampoo and conditioner are in small bottles, similar to those you would find at any hotel. I would recommend bringing your own instead, depending on the length of your stay. 

If you are interested in baking anything in the oven, we did not find any sort of tray or pan that could be placed in the oven. You may consider bringing your own. There was frying pans and pots for the stove top, though. 

There was no hand soap (we left ours behind for the next person) or hair dryer. I say these things so that you can prepare for your stay a bit better, not as complaints.

Although most of the place was sparkling clean and seems to include new appliances/utensils, the bathroom could have used A BIT more attention (cleaning wise). 
Other than that, I have no complaints! We will definitely be staying here again!

One final note: keep in mind that parking is across the street (sort of) and that there are several doors you need to open before getting to the actual apartment. I say this so that you are mindful of the amount of things that you are packing and what type of “packaging” you are using.",,"The bathroom was covered in tiny black hairs, namely on the floors and walls. The rug was still wet so it seems like the cleaning job may have been rushed. Otherwise, everything else was pretty spotless."
39485038,618693237,2020-03-15,117471673,Skyler,It’s a beautiful place! I just advise you to inspect carefully that it’s cleaned!,,"Hair all over the shower! The bed linens also had hair all thru them. At first I picked them up and threw it, however there was so many hairs that it was obvious the blankets hadn’t been washed so I washed them on my own. There were crumbs on the counter and A TOE NAIL ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR. Aesthetically the unit looked nice, but sitting down and noticing all the small hick ups were not acceptable especially since I paid a cleaning fee. I would like a refund for that. I took pictures and sent them in."
39485091,626826592,2020-05-30,158321809,Mark,"We were very disappointed to discover when we checked in that our apartment smelled strongly of cigarette and/or marijuana smoke.  We found the packaging for an air filter and ""smoke trapping ashtray"" in a kitchen cabinet.  Putting 2 and 2 together, it was clear that a smoker had stayed there and Zencity had not bothered to clean apartment to get rid of the smell.  (We emailed the photos to Zencity but this website won't let me upload them to this review.)  We contacted Zencity by email and their first response was we should look under the kitchen sink for cleaning supplies.  We replied that it was not our responsibility to clean the entire apartment, the carpeting and furniture to get rid of smoke odors.  We eventually sent Zencity an email asking them to consider a 50% refund of our fees and their response has been...silence.  We left the windows open day and night and that did reduce but not eliminate the odor.  It also created other issues because the weather was rainy and variable and the apartment was often either too hot or too cold.  And on 2 nights there were heavy drinkers and loud partying on the rooftop above us, so with open windows it was very loud.  By the way, both doors to the rooftop have big signs that it was closed.  The apartment itself was OK, but the customer service by Zencity was completely unsatisfactory.  There was a prominent sign in the apartment that smoking is prohibited and a smoker may be charged an extra $300 cleaning fee.  Obviously that was not enforced.  I read that Zencity manages extended-stay apartments in Chicago, Kansas City and St. Louis.  Based on this experience, I would be very cautious renting a property managed by them.",Your company needs to be more responsive to customers when there is a problem.  Your customer service was very disappointing.  You can read the chain of emails between me and your representatives.,"The entire apartment smelled like cigarette and/or marijuana smoke when we checked in.  We notified the manager - Zencity - who basically shrugged their shoulders and did nothing.  Their first response was to look for cleaning supplies under the kitchen sink (and there were not any there that might have helped).  We found the packaging for an air filter and ""smoke trapping ashtray"" in a kitchen cabinet, so putting 2 and 2 together a smoker had been staying there.  Zencity appartently did nothing to get rid of the smell before we arrived, in spite of the prominent notice in the apartment that no smoking is allowed and there is a $300 extra cleaning fee for smoking.  We left the windows open day and night and it did reduce the odor but did not get rid of it.  That led to other problems because the weather was rainy and variable and it was hard to keep the apartment at a livable temperature.  And for 2 nights there were people partying on the building roof above us very late, so we could not keep the windows open because of the loud noise.  By the way, there are big signs on both rooftop entrances saying that area is closed, but that apparently did not stop groups of heavy drinkers on 2 nights.  We sent an email to  Zencity asking them to consider refunding 50% of our total charges, and the their answer has been...silence."
35845966,669413907,2020-09-29,231218829,Silvana,Booked this place because a friend came in from out of town. We saw how their listing stated they did ultra cleaning so it made us want to book it especially because this is during covid. This place was the opposite it was SO dirty. There was a hair ball in the toilet and hairs on the seat. When we checked the bed there were hairs too and the table had dirty marks on it. I contacted the host immediately with pictures too and did not receive a response until the next day. We wanted to use the dishes that night and when we grabbed a dish it was dripping with water. The stove had dirty marks too. I was surprised that the host did not respond to at least accommodate. After check out I requested a refund and they said they can assure me the place was clean and that it was discounted too much already so they couldn’t. I contacted air bnb support after and told them my experience and they refunded me the cleaning fee thankfully. I wish I would have gotten refunded for the whole thing as the host did nothing to accommodate. This place is unsafe. Don’t stay here trust the reviews. This was the worst experience especially having a friend come in from out of town I was embarrassed.,,"Hair in toilet and on the toilet seat. Hairs in bed, dirty marks on tables and spots on couch.

Some glasses and plates were stuck to cabinet shelves, or hadn't been cleaned fully in the dishwasher, so they had to be ran in the dishwasher again. There were hairs in one of the bathroom sinks, and the trash had not been emptied in the other bathroom. There was also a large sticky spot right at the apartment entry/kitchen area that we had to mop down.

Unit was nicely designed and just enough space for a single traveler or couple. The windows provided great light and a refreshing breeze off the lake (yes they open!).  The air-conditioning unit works extremely well. My only disappointment was the lack of complimentary bottle water, coffeemaker and paper towels. Otherwise the unit was optimal and safe!","Overall I enjoyed the unit. Not having the fob wasn't so much of an inconvenience, however during the Covid issues, it was bothersome to have to keep using the touch keypad to enter the building. Melissa is who I believed cleaned the unit before my stay but it was subpar for the fee that is  being charged to the guest. I can suggest a better cleaning person who cleaned my rental units in the Chicagoland area. But for the extremely discounted nightly rate it was tolerable.","The cabinets need to be wiped out to remove caked up substance in bathroom and debris in kitchen. Also the shower curtain needs to be washed or changed (cloth was dirty at base and is tucked inside the tub to prevent water leaking out, so it posed a sanitary issue). Wipe down light switches to remove dirt that's very visible. Shower caddy needs to be wiped off to remove soap scum. For it to be a $60 cleaning fee, I expected a cleaner space. Please note that I wasn't uncomfortable in the unit but I would have appreciated paper towel on the installed paper towel holder. And the stove should be wiped down without leaving water marks and grease streaks."

There is a heavy walker who stays above. I do mean HEAVY.  If you are an early riser, it isn't to disturbing. In the evening it sometimes it is very annoying, but turn the your speaker up, and you can drown it out.  I will be booking again for my next work trip. Thank you for the quick accommodations. 
💙 Legacy Sharpening","With the exception of the iron not working, I really enjoyed my stay. There is a heavy walker that lives above. I do mean HEAVY! The  concierge, Ian is amazing! Very friendly and eager to help in any way. 
The place was tidy, but there was alot of hair left on the white tile. You could tell it was whiped down, just not dried. The dishes could afford a good washing, due to dust.  Perhaps some packets of  condiments for the fridge. A nice little bistro table would do wonderful for the balcony. A more complete kitchen would do wonders as it is the heart if the flat.
Perhaps some expanded outlets for the bedroom.","You can tell is had been cleaned, just alot of hair left from the wet rag."

25545961,706262267,2020-11-02,93353413,Mohan Kumar,"Overall. On a positive note, the house was a historic house with cool and modern touches. I love the interior decorations and mods done. 

Two things that weren’t transparent about: 
1. stairs being so narrow and also creaking with every step even though each of us weighed 150 or less lbs.
2. Washer/dryer in an unfinished basement - we didn’t end up using because of how it looked after opening the door. 

I heard random sounds at night (possibly from attic?) that woke me up while sleeping. The lights on stairs flickering and not dimming down properly was a bit creepy to add to the sounds. Overall, there was no issues if We just ignored these things. Maybe we are just not into older historic homes and that could be our personal issue.

Another thing that bothered us is the tub, but again I believe it was in the pictures so we knew what we were getting into. Not a big fan of using the wide claw tub though the look is super stylish.. getting in and out is difficult and not comfortable to use with all the curtains sticking onto us while showering.

Not trying to defame the place by any means but I want others to know what they are getting into. Surprised there were not many comments mentioning any of these.",See comments in Value criteria feedback,Noted that this place is huge and thus it didn’t bother me too much. Most areas are clean
39149880,627088226,2020-05-31,26059882,Kelly-Monique,"Overall I enjoyed my stay. I saw some reviews that said the internet wasn’t working, however during my stay the internet worked just fine. 

This location is perfect for walking. There are grocery stores and restaurants within a 5 min walking distance.  However, the location isn’t great for a car. I suggest that people use ride share or take the metrolink which is close to the hospital that’s a couple of blocks over. 

The building is older ( the interior is not) so be mindful to your neighbors and keep your volume down after a certain time. I didn’t have any issues with neighbors being loud, however I did want to mention that to future guests. 

My only complaint is that the tub is painted and is peeling and the walls could use a fresh coat of paint. 

The customer service was great and I would consider staying at another one of their properties. 

Overall, my experience was positive. The people who work in the building are friendly. I give it a 4/5.",Customer service was great and I would book with your company again. Please paint the walls and fix the tub.,"The bathtub is painted and is peeling and ended up on my foot. There are other areas in the apartment where paint is peeling as well.  Also, there were spots on some of the walls. I think the apartment needs a fresh coat of paint."
41196842,621072318,2020-03-29,17249091,Julian,"This was an experience that started out fine and ended horribly.  

Price gouging - We booked the space for six nights. Though the keypad was giving us issues every time we tried to enter the apartment (we once waited 30-45 minutes for Zencity to change the code since the keypad wasn't working), we wanted to extend our stay.  They refused to give us the new daily rate (which was about $20 cheaper for those same new dates that we wanted to extend into). They said that if we extended it we'd have to keep our same rate because they couldn't change it for us.  Annoyed and frustrated, we said fine because we didn't want to have to move and the place was nice enough.  After going back and forth, they finally sent a modification that actually added an additional day on top of what we requested.  We were flexible, so we didn't say anything because we were already pretty annoyed and wanted to not have a sour relationship with Zencity.

RODENT (I.E. MOUSE) and poor response - A little past the midway point of our stay, I saw a mouse in the kitchen go from under the oven to under the dishwasher, and later to the bathroom.  Now...my partner is TERRIFIED of mice. Terrified.  I immediately messaged Zencity, asked them during one call to send someone (they said they would), then asked them on a second call (three hours later) to send someone (they said they would).  About four hours after that (around 9-10 hours in total) they sent someone who said he just got word an hour before his arrival.  In the meantime, like any reasonable person, I had to find another Airbnb last minute, which ended up costing more than this location.  Despite the fact that we found large holes throughout the apartment (laundry room and bathroom) and the door doesn't have a door guard (so anything can slide right in.....), all of which we documented, we were only refunded half of the money we paid for the remaining days of our stay after Zencity ignored our messages and started only communicating with Airbnb.  

It really started out as a promising trip, but my partner is still reeling from the experience, I'm out of a few hundred bucks unexpectedly and I don't even know if I'll have a job in a month. I will NEVER rent a place managed by Zencity again.","The space was nice until I found a mouse.  I think you all should consider plugging up the holes around the space (laundry room area, bathroom) and put a door guard under the doors.","There was a mouse in the kitchen, and we didn't leave food out."

We would definitely stay there again.,I actually almost did not choose this because of the unknown with the parking. However I was very pleasantly surprised. They only charges $9 per day in their parking ramp if I paid in cash to the security guard. The security guards were very cordial and did not act like we were a burden to them.,"The bathroom witthe window had a toilet that probably can't get cleaned - possibly due to age. The first impression was that it was dirty but I don't think that was the case. Also - with the wood blind in the shower there was paint peeling and there was a smell of wet wood.

But besides that, pretty much everything else was a problem. Our “enhanced clean” unit had dusty surfaces, broken seals on the travel sized toiletries, part of a roll of toilet paper left from the previous tenant, among other minor cleanliness things that normally wouldn’t be an issue but made us feel very unsafe about the cleanliness of the space in the midst of a pandemic. Along with this, there were several maintenance issues including missing bath drain plug, broken soap dispenser, missing light bulb, and even the entire right bedside table being ripped out of the wall with unsightly holes left in the wall and no temporary replacement table. We also received no response (within 24 hours) after sharing our concerns via direct message after we checked out, which is why this review is so bluntly honest. Again, the space was well curated and beautifully designed, but it seemed poorly kept up and not at all “enhanced clean”.","We were very thankful for our sleep space, but didn’t feel safe or sanitary in the space until we cleaned it ourselves. We were so excited to stay here since it’s a great location and beautifully curated space, but it just seemed like the maintenance and/or cleaning staff didn’t put much thought or effort into maintaining the space or cleaning the space. At almost $160 per night with a certified “enhanced clean” we expected far better.","Was not spotless as we would expect with “enhanced clean” in the middle of a pandemic. The provided travel sized toiletries had their seals broken, dusty surfaces, loose change along the floorboards, and 1/3 of a roll of toilet paper left from the previous tenant.

Then on my last day of the stay a maintenance man unlocked the door and came in while I was sleeping at 7:39am. They would not make it right. It’s big corporate and you get the run around.",Having the matinace man come in while I was asleep is horrible. If I had been a girl I would sue you for sexual harassment! Having a locked door open at 7:30 am out of your sleep in your underwear is not a good experience. All that after non cleaning.,"The bed was unmade, dirty dishes in the sink, the trash was not taken out, they literally did not clean it after the last person had been there, they apologized but only gave me 75 dollars off for the whole ordeal I had to get a different place (which they did pay for ) but was very unprofessional and I had to fight for my 75 instead of them making the wrong right. Also the iron does not work, and there customer service is horrible. The matinace man walked in on me while I was sleeping. Clearly he thought the place was vacant so they have communication issues as well! (It’s also in a rental place were it’s probably illegal to have air bnbs."

So much so that we opted to order a mini dehumidifier. It seemed to be fine if the air was cranked to arctic, but anything above 68 meant that the place was lingeringly swampy.","Our unit was very clean upon move in.  It's a functioning apartment building, and urban hipsters  living their normal lives can be slobs. We saw maintenance folks on the reg doing a good job keeping up with any issues.

TONS of coffee shops/restaurants within walking distance, cute neighborhood to stroll through and the nearby park is nice. The bar downstairs is decent (although on the young side) and they shut down at like 10:55 on the dot during weekdays, so you don’t have to worry about being kept up all night. Check in was super easy, TV is big and there was a fire stick with Netflix etc. Decor was cute, felt like staying at a friends place in college. Both the beds and pillows were SUPER comfortable (the one in the front room is firm and the one in the back room is much softer, so you can Goldilocks it until you find one you like). It’s managed by a company and they were super responsive to all my questions. 

Cons: felt like staying at a friend’s place in college. Place is pretty bare bones and could have been a teeny bit cleaner, but nothing that I wouldn’t have expected for the affordability of it. With a few minor kinks worked out, I’d stay there again.","Hey guys, I really appreciate your great communication and the fact that someone came to get me off the balcony (although, someone probably should have double-checked to make sure that the door didn’t lock before they put a chair out there). Once you get the kinks worked out, it’ll be great, I really like all the furniture. Also, you should know that someone in the building, not the bar, was bumping bass music literally all night, it was on when I went to bed at midnight and then still when I woke up at 4am and 6am. It was the loudest in the back bedroom, so maybe ask whoever lives on the other side of that wall.","The place had a stale smoke smell, despite the little air fresheners all over the place, it seemed the worse from the back room. I assume some previous tenant had been smoking (the windows were open in the front bedroom when I checked in?). I’d recommend all the linens/textiles be washed bc those little air things aren’t cutting it. Plus, there was some dirt on the floor around the toilet and in the track for the sliding door."

Star 3 - communication about entry issues were very responsive. No star 4 - previous guest smoked excessively in a non-smoking unit. This itself is not ZenCity's fault, but it was an awful smell and Id wish they had been up front about that and offered solutions ahead of time rather than waiting for my complaint and told ""maybe open the windows"". No star 5 - I paid for non-smoking room as an expectation for my own health and comfort; with my prompting for a compensation for this missed expectation and inconvenience, they eventually gave  20% off 1 of my 2 night stays; but a full 5 star review would be reserved for proactivley addressing rather than a ""sorry the last person broke the rules, but nothing we can do about it"" approach.

The apartment and its furniture were falling apart. The fridge leaked. The toilet did not flush, the shower took a solid 10 minutes to warm up, and the water pressure was very weak. Some other minor things, like the blinds were all convoluted and not attended to properly.

All in all. The biggest issue was the reek of cigarette smoke that made our stay unbearable, besides the variety of falsely advertised amenities. Also, Zencity's reluctance to properly address the situation was disappointing. 

I contacted and explained our issues with the apartment to Zencity. First they offered alternative accommodation, but for another date. Which of course, visiting Chicago, we needed a place to sleep then and there. They initially charged us for the second night we did not stay. When I declined their offer and further explained the cause of our cancellation, Zencity went quiet and has not responded to my request for a refund. I've tried to contact them for multiple days now.

Spare yourself the headache, money, and unpleasant consequences of booking with Zencity and go with another Airbnb host. I wish I could leave a good review and not have had dealt with all this. The new place I booked is cheaper, in a great location, and is truly CLEAN and properly maintained.","Hi Zencity,  can somebody please get back to me regarding my stay and refund for checking out? Thanks.",Reeked of cigarettes. Made our clothes and hair smell like cigarettes. The fridge leaked water. The bathroom plumbing was awful.

Definitely a college feel in the apartment - as long as you have a city-camping mindset you’ll have a blast. If you’re looking for finer things - like a nice shower - look further. The balcony was a great touch - just don’t close the door behind you - you might get locked out. Overall the location really makes up for the flaws.,,No airflow in the back bedroom.

The apartment was nicely decorated, and the bed was comfortable. Didn't really have any issues / concerns with the check-in process. Unfortunately due to covid-19 the restaurants in the Central West end area were only able to offer carryout. If you like to walk, Forest Park right across the street is an ideal location. However, if you are a light sleeper or prefer to have a quiet setting, this may not be ideal for you. It sits right on Kingshighway, so the noise from traffic, including multiple emergency vehicles traveling to or from Barnes Hospital is quite loud.

3 easily fixed cons:
- They had changed the sheets and pillowcases, however the not the comforter and there were hairs on it from the previous tenant (not cool). 
- Also the furniture, while super cute, looks worn and the large couch had a white stain from a previous stay. I was out of the apartment most of the time but decided to just avoid that space while relaxing.

The first one was the description showcased a dedicated parking spot behind the building as we are a band on tour this was a big selling point to secure our van and music equipment. We arrived to a car already parked there and upon messaging were informed to park somewhere else in a paid lot. This was fine, but not what was expected. The next issue was the door's touchscreen keypad which we didn't realize was the keypad and tried the wrong door initially (made for a bit of a laugh even though it was 3:00 AM). Then we tried the correct door and the code didn't work even after multiple attempts. After messaging the host the code magically worked.. 
Upon entering, the space looked like the photos albeit not quite as clean. Just seemed slightly dusty and not as pristine, but not a huge deal. Just a slight disappointment, but we got over it because it was overall nice and beds were all clean and we were tired.
In the morning shower time saw us struggling with a showerhead that lacked pressure and only partially worked. Then when trying to do some work the wifi password didn't work - regardless of the device. I sent a message and the response was to use the WiFi we had been trying with the same password, I followed back with that it didn't work, no further help.
Aside from those issues, everything else was great. The location was perfect for us walking around and a short walk to the CTA and etc. I would definitely not mind staying there again for the price and if I was not on tour concerned about parking.","Overall good stay, but there's an issue with the WiFi, the door code not working right away, the seemingly included parking spot that isn't actually included, and the not fully functional shower head made for a not as ideal stay.

After my check in i messaged several times about things that weren't cleaned properly and got no response. Same as last time. Why charge a cleaning fee if you won't clean? 

Anyway maybe you'll have better luck than me, I won't be back.","This is my second time staying with Zencity, it seemed like things might be better, and I must say I am equally as displeased as the first time. The apartment was just barely clean. There were no supplies such as paper towels or extra rags to do dishes. There was hair all over the carpeted area and a giant bug in the bed our second night. I don't understand why we're paying a cleaning fee if the space won't actually be clean upon out arrival. I am disappointed at the lack of response to any of my messages during my stay and won't be staying wjth Zencity again.","There was hair all over the carpet as well as a dirty rag in the couch.

A little loud as it's located by the front door and under the stairs in the basement, but still very enjoyable. Host was super awesome. I would definitely stay here again when i'm in this city.","Enjoyed my stay, only critique I have would be to put a sign on the window behind the couch for people not to bang & knock on your window disturbing guest when they can't get in the front door or the box code is malfunctioning. Thanks again.","The bed had been made, but not washed.  I had to pull the top sheet wash it then sleep on top of it. The fitted sheets had shoe prints on them when I pulled the comforter back. Comforter had hairs & light stains as well. Black leather chairs in kitchen were dirty with food particles. I'm easy going I hardly care about stuff like this, but i'm mentioning it so that the owner can make sure his staff is truly cleaning things in the era of Covid-19.  Walls were a bit dirty with what looked like liquid stains & lots damage to the paint in some areas. I called & Zencity took note for the record. Right under the stairs & by the front door, so it can get very loud at times. Everything else was good to go."

The area is definitely safe! You can walk to anywhere you want on the plaza.  I stayed there during the shutdown due to COVID-19 so the Plaza was closed down.  There is an amazing park by the apartment as well.  Food Delivery was very easy to do.  There were animal hairs on all of the towels, wash clothes, washer, bed sheets and pillows.  There was hair in the shower. There was urine on the toilet seat.  I let Zincity know this immediately and sent them pictures of the hairs.  They did drop off new towels the next day and let me know that there were other sheets and pillows in the closet. However, they did not provide me with a new comforter. I had to re-wash the comforter, sheets and towels as I did not have anything the day of check-in.  I was unable to figure out how to put in the code to unlock the doors.  One of the other tenants let me in and gave me a quick crash course in how to enter and exit the building. After that getting into and out of the building was a breeze.  Parking spot 44 was unable to be used because there was someone already parked there. Zencity did a great job with finding me another spot to park in during my stay.  Many times there were several hours between some responses to my inquiries.","You may want to ensure that all towels, linens and bathrooms are truly clean prior to a new guest arriving especially with COVID-19 going around.","There were animal hairs on all of the towels, wash clothes, washer, bed sheets and pillows.

We enjoyed our stay and will definitely look to stay with you again in the future when we are back in town.

Cons- There was a listening/ recording device hidden under the desk. No where in the listing does it mention it nor in the apartment. Floors look as if they have not been vacuumed in months. Head board had hand prints. Washer smelt of mildew. Could not park in the gated parking lot because the fob would not work. They brought me a new one and it still didn’t work. 

Before you book on Airbnb check out the Zencity website.

However, once you get to the rooms...that's another story. There's a visible leak outside of the apartment that seems to have been a problem for months. You can see the ceiling in the hallway of the apartment starting to buckle. Once you get to the master bedroom, you're met with a TERRIBLE smell that's deeply embedded in the carpet and it just needs to come up. The carpet is definitely wet from the leak as you can see the wording on the bottom of your shoes on the bathroom tile. Hand/grease prints on the wall and the ceiling fan is packed with dust and spiderwebs forming...you can tell its been months since that was cleaned. The cleaning is simply just not up to par for the price of the stay! Luckily we only stayed 2 nights.

You can take your chances on this one...the issue may or may not be resolved by the time you stay. Don't waste your money on a ""pretty set-up"" based on the kitchen/common area.","You should definitely have the issue with the leak/bedroom carpet smell checked out before allowing other guests to spend money for possible hazardous conditions!  That carpet simply needs to come up. Period. The smell was worse every night...another night spent and it would have been quite unbearable. And also hire someone who is going to thoroughly clean ALLLLL areas of your apartment...not just the kitchen/common area.  Whoever cleans, simply does the bare minimum. And that's unfortunate and unacceptable.

I've stayed in much better AirBnB residences over the course of time...and this has been the absolute worst stay.","Master bedroom had a terrible smell which is believed to come from a leak. There's a noticeable leak outside of the apartment..to the point it looks like it may buckle any time soon. Once you walked in the master bedroom, the carpet was damp as you can see the wording under the bottom of your shoes on the tile in the bathroom. There's another review that indicated a possible leak, and we thought it would have been taken care of by our stay. Not the case. The leak is settling into the carpet which is causing the smell to get worse. Whoever cleans the apartment should be able to tell...but it doesn't seem to be a priority. Also, top sheet of the bed was dirty and crumbs from the previous visit in the bedroom were not cleaned up. The bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned; and the ceiling fan in the master bedroom was quite dusty (hard not to see the mounds of dust) and you could see spiderwebs forming on the ceiling fan as if it hadn't been dusted in months. Hand/grease prints were also on the wall...

Could have been cleaned better! 

The focus of cleanliness is obviously in the kitchen/common areas. That was somehow spotless as compared to the rest of the place."

We would consider staying here again.","Although we had some issues explained on the previous page, we still had an overall great experience. It was nice to have more space to spread out for approximately the same price as a hotel room, and we felt at home after the initial frustrations. Also, having access to the roof was amazing!

There were also dirty dishes elsewhere, such as a spatula in the crock pot that had dried egg caked on it. Based on these findings, we had to assume everything was dirty, so we washed all the dishes in the dishwasher before we were able to use them. Regarding the bathroom, there was a sample body wash left behind in the shower. We know these usually are thrown away when rooms are cleaned, so it made us wonder if the shower had actually been clean.

There was constant noise from other apartments and the hallway, as well as from inside the apartment— creaky floorboards and loud thuds from the air conditioner. Our sleep was so interrupted that it aided us in leaving a few days early 

The apartment was not clean or stable. The decor was very cheap. A lamp fell out of the wall randomly one morning.

Strangely enough, there’s a garbage disposal but no switch to turn it on in plain sight, we checked everywhere— even in cabinets. 

The washing machine and dryer had missing knobs, rendering it hard to use and understand. 

Jacuzzi tub was amazing! The highlight of our stay. 

Property manager randomly stopped by to check our water heater. It put us in a very uncomfortable situation to allow a man we didn’t know, and had no knowledge of, come inside of the apartment. This was an issue never addressed by the host, despite me sending multiple messages about it.

Would recommend and definitely will be staying here again!","Hello!,

This place was beautiful and we really enjoyed it! It would have been 5 stars if it weren’t for the bathroom issues. The toilet made a super loud sound after every flush and the shower had issues. The host did get maintenance up there right away to fix everything which I really appreciated. I just wish we didn’t have to deal with it the first night. Besides those minor issues , it was an amazing stay and I would love to stay again in the future!

Thanks,

When we had trouble accessing the property, there was no response from the host. We ended up having to contact AirBnB to handle the issue. We were unable to stay in the apartment, and had to find a hotel that could accommodate us at the last minute. We were really disappointed with our experience.",,n/a

If you arrive late on a weekend be prepared to park on the street if you can find parking as this location is downtown. You must then enter into a garage and then get keys from a box and then trek through an office building to correct elevator banks.

The biggest issue was that our unit was DIRTY! I sent pictures and contacted someone and was told it would be cleaned and it never was. I was then told I could not have a refund on the cleaning fee as I had to clean Urine and fecal matter off both the toilets, change the sheets, clean the counter tops and after that I gave up. The showers were dirty, long hair everywhere. It was just dirty, point blank period. 
The fan in the guest bathroom never turned off and rattled like it was going to project itself out of the ceiling at any point. 

I received a text about the tv being too loud before the cleaning issue was addressed and that’s unacceptable. 

The staff with Zencity was friendly, and one gentleman helped me with the key situation so I was appreciative of that.","I’m disappointed that no one came to clean while I was there. Nor is the cleaning fee being refunded as I had to clean myself. 

The space is stunning and worth the price, if it was clean.","There was urine and fecal matter on both of the toilets. The counters in the kitchen weren’t clean, there was hair all over the bathroom floors and shower. The sheets and comforters were dirty. The couch had stains, we were given dirty towels."

Too, I called to request an early departure following the contract rules exactly. I was told to expect an email and all I needed to do was click the changes for a partial refund. No email ever came. No one returned my calls.  Honestly, I don't think folks on the corporate end of the Zencity brand are paying attention. Thus their poor Google review status.  You are taking a risk by booking with them.  Airbnb should remove them as an option.",If it was easier to communicate with Zencity and if they were more on top of the overall customer experience - which they claim on their website - these properties would be great.

38647176,629902673,2020-06-15,29217558,Ronnie,"While this place had a very cool vibe there were some issues that I feel people should know about. One of the toilets was clogged for 2 days.  The plumber came the first day and said he had to have another plumber come to use a snake.  Then I heard from no one for another day.  I sent several messages to Zencity with no response for 24 hours or more.  He finally came the third morning I was here and he had a plunger - no snake.  He fixed the toilet in 5 minutes.  

There was a party on one night next door that was so loud I could not sleep.  Loud music and loud bass with over 25-30 people.  If you are looking for a relaxing, quiet place this is not the place.  Zencity said they would call in a noise violation around midnight.  The party ended around 1:30-2:00 am.

The ad says black out blinds and drapes but the blinds are clearly not black out.  There are black out draperies on some windows but not all of them.  The tracks are there for all windows but it appears many have been removed and never replaced. The draperies are black out but the blinds are not.  Clearly bright street lights come in these large windows at night and bright sun in the mornings.   

The place, while having a very cool vibe, has not been kept up very well in my opinion.  There are lots of burnt out light bulbs and cracked mirrors on the bedroom closet doors and a broken chair. 

I did ask for a refund for a part of my 4 day stay there due to these issues and didn't ever get a response to that.   This was only my second time using Airbnb and the experience was just ok.",,"The place, while having a very cool vibe, it has not been kept up very well.  There are lots of burnt out light bulbs and cracked mirrors in bedroom closet doors and a broken chair.  Just needs some attention and it would be fine.

But make sure you've practiced your parallel parking ;) The pictures were very accurate in that they showed the space is not finished in a pristine fashion but it did not take away from the experience at all. The rooms were spacious, neat and clean. The location was fantastic in that we were within a short walking distance of Euclid Ave where a lot of shops and restaurants are located as well as around a 10 minute walk to the northeast corner of Forest Park. The bathrooms and kitchen had everything we needed and were in great shape. The only additional thing we would have wanted was a table for eating meals as a group but this was not a big deal for us. Check in/out was simple and easy. Parking was a little iffy during the evenings but out of 6 nights we only had to find a spot on a different street once, and even then it wasn't a long walk.",,*Very* minor spills on the kitchen floor that we wiped up.

The unit in the living room is so tiny, it doesn't even cool off the living room and attached kitchen adequately. When I brought this up, I was told by Zencity that they would have maintenance come and install at least 1 AC unit, if not 2 in the two bedrooms. The way the place is set up, the bedrooms are down a hallway from the living area - there is no way in hell this tiny unit would be able to cool the bedrooms. The towel rack was broken. They said maintenance would also fix that. MAINTENANCE NEVER CAME. We slept on the floor of the living room because the bedrooms were so hot. Which caused me to have neck and back pain. It's one thing to have an issue; it's another to make promises and not deliver. They also said that there was a fan in the closet - there was no fan when we got home on Friday night. We found 2 blood stains on the rug and a used condom wrapper on the floor of one bedroom. We had issues checking in as there was no key to the building in the lockbox nor instructions on the alternate way of getting into the building. Also, after sleeping on the floor and picking up the comforter to clean up the space, it was filthy underneath. I don't think the floor has been vacuumed in some time which made me even more nervous because of covid. While they were timely in their responses to my concerns, none of them were actually fixed. Their solution was to let us leave on Saturday and get a small refund, not even 50% saying it didn't ""seem like a good match."" We were there for a funeral and did not have the time or the mental space to search for another place and move all of our things. This is the first time I've had a negative experience with Airbnb. I still love Airbnb but definitely not this place.","You need to get your stuff together. One problem after another, that you did not address. You made promises that were not kept. I'm very disappointed.","We found a used condom wrapper on the floor of one of the bedrooms. Because the AC didn't work, we slept on the floor in the living room and when I picked up the comforter, it was filthy on the bottom which means it hadn't been vacuumed in some time. This of course, is a concern during the time of covid. We found 2 blood stains on the carpet in the living room, the towel rack in the bathroom fell off when we put a towel on it."

Especially the check in process, they did not give us a key to the building— which was stressful and a bit unprofessional! We had to time our entrances with other residents of the building or figure out how to use the callbox. Whenever I communicated this to the hosts, they sent generic check in messages that they had already sent twice. The woman that checked me in poorly communicated to me about getting into the building as well. The bath tub was covered in pubic hair and there was some on the towels as well.

I stayed with this host, same building but different unit, couple weeks back. I love the location, it’s near plenty of shops, and I love waking up being across the street from tennis courts. The host had the audacity to display signage boasting about the cleanliness of the room when it was nothing but. The restroom was full of urine and hair everywhere. The issue was so bad I sent the host 3 messages within an hour of my arrival with pictures.

There was an offer after receiving several automated messages in response to my email to have someone clean the problem areas and sweep the floors.  No one ever showed. The issue was so bad I used boiling water and the apartment cleaning products to disinfect the restroom. The young lady at concierge, who checked me in on my last visit, even reported the issue to a Zencity cleaner the following morning. 

This room did not meet the standards of cleanliness in the midst of Covid-19, there’s no way, and you all should be ashamed. If I could have cancelled this booking and received a full refund I would have.

We had an issue with the cleanliness of the place, the apartment smelled badly of cigarette smoke (our belief is that it came from elsewhere but it was very strong and never dissipated throughout our weekend stay). Also, the floor was quite sticky and the carpet unpleasant to walk on barefoot. Having said that, and given that these distracting things (we are very sensitive to cleanliness and bad smells) would be rectified, we'd be more than happy to stay there again.","Thank you for hosting us. We believe it's rather easy to better the cleanliness issue. We noticed another reviewer has also said the exact same things. The smell in the place was very disturbing but we tried to stay there as little as possible and open the windows. We think that while your property is smoke free, the whole building is not. Thanks again for hosting us.","The floor was sticky and the space smelled of cigarette smoke. As no smoking is allowed, we assumed that it came in from vents or ac of the building. It did not feel like the house was not cleaned, just that the carpet was very well used and the floors, well... Just maybe very well used as well. However, the sheets and towels seemed very clean and inviting."
35845966,632039542,2020-06-25,342905964,Renee,"This historic building is a converter hotel from the 1920's. The building has loads of character and studio I stayed in was very modern, sort of the best of both worlds. However, my goal for this trip was to find housing for a move to the area in a couple of months so I was excited to stay in a building I was considering. This is a fine place to stay for an Air BnB, especially if you'll be out and about; but I won't be living in the building when I move. With the 1920's character came thin walls and a window unit AC.   Fine for a short stay however, the apartment building its located in just wouldn't meet my needs for a year long lease. Overall happy, it served its purpose for a great price.","This may be the building's ""issue"" and a combination of the space being a studio; but it very much felt like a hotel room. I found myself refer to ""my room"" when talking to my friends.   It felt more like a hotel stay than a home; but without the luxury of a hotel.  Also, there were no paper towels. There was a holder but it just seemed weird. Again, not that big a deal.  A few more towels and bath mat would've made a noticeable difference.  I was in town looking for an apartment for my upcoming move. I was considering the Del Prado; but after this stay, I am not. Perhaps that is not within your purview and that's fine.

1) Cleanliness.  Overall, it was fine, but the debris on the floor when I arrived was definitely annoying.

The bathroom is directly inside the front door with a frosted glass door...kinda lacks a private feel. The flooring is laminate, and coupled with the loft ceilings,  it make for an echoy, less than quiet environment.  WiFi was painfully slow, but the router is closed inside a closet so... locatiion
matters. (lack of)  Bedroom lighting is atrocious.  Great bedding, so comfy.  Nice, big windows face street with a great view.  Overall, you will not beat the price on an apartment like this, period.  It is a steal, and well worth every dime.",,"Lacked basic cleaning supplies for longer stay guests, like paper towels, tea towels, trash bags, dishwasher soap, mop. Extra light bulbs for bathroom.  I would have liked to been able to spot clean over the week."
41916806,610579660,2020-02-24,33828341,Annette,"Upon arriving at the listing and getting settled, we noticed that leftover from previous guest were in the frog and freezer. The sheets were covered in hair and appeared unclean. Bathroom sink and mirrors were not clean. Mud was on steps and floor. Sticky fingerprints on the cups in the cabinet. It was late at night (after 10 pm), so not much could be done until the next day. After communicating with three different managers of the property, which was frustrating, the cleaning crew came back the next day and cleaned everything and changed the sheets. The steps leading from the front door up to the apartment are very steep corner steps with no handrail. Difficult to maneuver with luggage. Would not recommend for guests who are elderly or who have small children. Listing states it’s within walking distance to city attractions, and it is a little over a mile from Crown Plaza, but I would not recommend walking through the neighborhood. Thermostat would go down to 64° at 6:00 am, and the only way to adjust it was to manually change the temp; you couldn’t change the schedule, so that was inconvenient since it was cold out and having to get out of bed to turn up the heat was not desirable. 

It was a nice space with good size bedrooms and two bathrooms. Kitchen had everything you’d need to eat there. Beds were not the most comfortable, but fine for a couple of nights.",,"Bathrooms sinks were dirty and splashes were on the mirrors, so who knows about the rest of the bathroom. Lots of hair on bedsheets that made bed appear very unclean. Leftover food from previous guests left in refrigerator and freezer. Cups in cabinet had sticky fingerprints all over them."
39334572,631841518,2020-06-24,121581424,Elise,"The apartment overall was nicely decorated — very minimalist, but all you need for a few day stay. It's in an apartment building so you're among other tenants (just an FYI). Check-in was easy. You also have access to the apartment building amenities, which was a nice bonus, although they were a bit dated and dirty (mainly fitness center). Location was nice — right next to Forest Park and close to lots of restaurants and a Whole Foods. Here comes to bad — the place looked like it hadn't been cleaned (particularly vacuumed in weeks). The floors were covered in dust/dirt/hairs (especially gross in the bathroom), to the point where I had to whip out the vacuum they had stored in the closet and clean it myself the first night just to feel clean enough walking around. The apartment is a bit old, which is fine, but the bathroom could use a bit of a facelift/renovation. We were in town briefly for a funeral and were not expecting/needing anything too high-end, but this even grossed out my husband, who isn't the cleanest of people. I also sent a message to the host before we even arrived asking a question and never heard back. Had it not been for the affordable price, I probably wouldn't have given it 3 stars.",,"The entire apartment looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks. The bathroom was particularly dirty, but the floors throughout were covered in dirt/dust/hairs and it was pretty gross. I had to bust out the vacuum that was stashed away in the closet the night we got there just to feel OK walking around. One of the blankets provided also smelled so bad we couldn't use it when sitting on the sofa."

It’s all housekeeping issues"

Would recommend,"If you could add an all purpose cleaner, something for the kitchen countertop, it would make cleaning up a lot easier for your guests.",Only thing to note is there was an enema left on the kitchen counter when I arrived.

The next morning we also found cockroaches. If these two incidents were taken care of and prevented, then I would recommend this place but cannot until this is dealt with.","We had a man break into the house using the same key code that you gave us. He came into the house and closed the door before we got over to the stairs and he let us know he was in the wrong house. While this seemed to be an innocent mistake, there have been people who use this approach to check to see if a house is a good place to come back to and burglarize. My sister and I did not feel safe in this house after that and it’s very concerning that someone else would have the same key code that we did to this place. I messaged you immediately and never heard a response which is also very disappointing. 
The next morning we also found cockroaches in the kitchen drawers, the brown banded ones. I’m not sure why we would be paying an $89 cleaning fee, which I’m sure each customer is paying and still find cockroaches in a house. 
Both of these were very disappointing because both of us were very excited to stay and were ready to book again until these two incidents occurred.",Had cockroaches in multiple drawers in the kitchen.

While scanning the loft I went to the bedroom which there was only one light in on the nightstand and the giant beautiful mirror had a huge crack in it. When going into the bathroom I noticed a huge hole next to the toilet that looked like it had been busted open and attempted to be “semi repaired” and the hand soap dispenser was broken. There was also no tv remote in the living room. Overall it was a beautiful and convenient place if it would have been kept up with because there was dust everywhere and it was very spacious. The real kicker is that today I revived a fee for “smoke smell” and I am now being charged for a problem they displayed, none of our guests even smoke.",,"The entire place was covered in dust, the appliances in the drawers had crusted food still all over them.

This is a great location right across from Forest Park and the front desk attendants were very nice and accomodating.  Unfortunately, the apartment was not clean examples being an old bar of soap with hair on it in the bathroom, spoiled milk in the refrigerator, no trash bags in the apartment, or the trashcan.  Parking is difficult.  Wifi was terrible basically didn't work, forced us to leave early so we could complete our telework.  This is run by an agency so there is no incentive to make it better.  I prefer real owners as they have pride in their property.   There is a no visitor policy which we didn't know about until we arrived so my parents couldn't come to see us for dinner.   I love STL and there are so many great houses and homes to rent from.  This wasn't one of them.",,"The bathroom had an old bar of soap, and the kitchen had someone else's food in it.  It seems the only thing they cleaned was the trash can as it didn't have a bag in it when we arrived."

If you’re up to cleaning and disinfecting the entire apartment then it’s a great value",I enjoyed my stay but I think you really need to make sure the apartment is being properly cleaned between guests. It was a disaster when we got there and it made us tense wondering if anything had actually been disinfected including the bedding that had some visible stains... also there were only 2 bowls and no measuring cups. The master bathroom was missing a toilet paper holder and a drawer front was broken off in the kitchen and just left leaning against the cabinets when we arrived. Not super great first impressions. It didn’t hinder our enjoyment of the apartment but might be offputting to some guests,The countertops in the kitchen hen and bathroom were disgusting. The rugs had tons of long hair in then and didn’t look like they had been vacuumed in a long time. I probably spent 45 mins cleaning the apartment when we checked in because I didn’t feel good about it actually being disinfected.
38646942,708541466,2020-11-13,250071119,Angela,"Our stay at Zencity was very short lived. Upon entering the apartment, the tables, toilets, walls and flooring were not clean. The whole place smelled horrible because the dishwasher was full of water and dishes. We had to leave right after when checked in related to the poor conditions. Although we did have great and expeditious responses from customer service, we still were not fully refunded what we originally paid. I would not consider renting from zencity in the future.","I wanted to say thank for your quick response and customer service, but this apartment really needs some upkeep and deep cleaning performed before it is rented out again. I am also upset that I lost one night on my refund. But I was pleased with the quick responses from Marty.","The tables, toilets, walls and floors were disgusting.

38268915,633015624,2020-06-28,51959616,Quonny,I would never suggest booking with this host. They are very dishonest and will not respond to legit concerns. Our place did not have lights in the bathroom for 3 days. They never came out to fix it. We had to use our phones as flashlights to shower. They told us that it was not an emergency. Who does that?? There was only one set of towels for 4 adults. Our reservation got changed a day before we came into town. I tried reaching out to the host only to be ignored. They are very shady and I will never stay at their properties in the future. They ruined my first time in St. Louis. Also the photos that they post is all smoke and mirrors. The place is sooooo much smaller than the pictures depict. Cheaply made furniture and there was damage to the property as soon as we got there. The bathroom had a dirty tub and dried up poop stuck on the toilet. Renters Beware!!!!,You guys suck. You ruined me and my friends first visit to St. Louis. I will never be back. I hope you all are happy with my hard earned money. Businesses like yours will never prosper because all you care about is money and not the actual person. I saved up for months for this trip just to have it ruined. I hope you can sleep well at night knowing how you operate your business.,There was dried up hard poop in the toilet that must have been there a while. The tub was dirty as well. We actually had to go out and buy tissue paper as well as extra towels.

The stairs will give you workout. :)","Marty you were great, I'd get that toilet seat fixed and clean the floors. :) Any recommend a regular coffee maker. I didn't have the time or desire to fuss with a french press so I spent a lot of time and money getting coffee every morning.

The host is super responsive to issues as they arise.","The faucet in the bathroom is mounted poorly (too far back), causing you to splash water all over the sink every time you wash your hands. 

Maintenance is a problem worth addressing.  I couldn’t sleep in the unit for several day’s because of a smoke alarm.  Given its height and the fact that it had to be reset after the battery is changed, it required building maintenance to address it. This took several days, when it should have taken hours.  Further, there are piles of wood trim in the hallway on the way to the unit that are unsightly and a potential hazard.",The kitchen smelled of used cooking oil for several days during my stay initially.  I had to re-clean the kitchen to get rid of the odor.

We really enjoyed being able to walk into Forrest Park and down Euclid St. There were lots of cute shops, restaurants and bars within walking distance. Although the place does not provide parking, they told us about a great parking garage that was really close and affordable. We spent thanksgiving here, and were able to make due with the kitchen furnishings that they provided.

We did wish that the space was a bit cleaner when we arrived, there were still remnants of the previous guests in a few places. The listing also advertised that we would have rooftop access and unfortunately our key fobs did not give us access and it was never resolved.

36693625,630818562,2020-06-20,339923280,Mario,"The good: The apartment is spacious, has a great view,  comfortable beds, and new appliances. Zencity is quick to respond, check-in and checkout are seamless, and the lobby staff is wonderful.

The bad: As other reviews mention, it really seems like no one cleans the apartments between each guest. We arrived to a very dirty floor, bedsheets that did not smell clean and has several stray hairs, and a trash can that had not been emptied. We asked for clean sheets; Zencity delivered them promptly, but only gave us one set for two beds. I'm sure Zencity would have sent someone to clean it had we not cleaned it ourselves, but it really should just be cleaned before guests arrive rather than upon request. Also, the remote had no batteries; Zencity sent us replacement ones, but after that, the remote still was not paired to the TV.

Overall, the apartment is worth it only because it is so competitively priced, but it could be improved so much and be such a better value if it were just cleaned more thoroughly (or at all) between guests.","I assume the lobby staff is more of Mac Property's responsibility than Zencity's, but regardless, they deserve a standing ovation. Every single one of the wonderful women who staff the front desk was extremely friendly and cheered up our days.","As I said in my email, it really seems like the apartment was not cleaned at all after the last guest left. The floor was very dirty throughout, the beds looked barely made and all the sheets had hair on them, the trash can had food and empty cans at the bottom underneath the trash bag, etc. It's really a shame, because the apartment is beautiful and comfortable, but the first thing we saw when we came in was the very dirty floor. It really ruined the first impression completely and left us apprehensive of touching any surfaces for the entire stay."

However, I found that cleanliness was lacking and that many folks working in the building did not wear masks, which make me hesitant to recommend this listing during a pandemic. During non-pandemic times, I would absolutely stay here, but right now, I may find somewhere with higher cleanliness and more consistent mask wearing procedures.","Thank you so much for hosting me. The space is beautiful. However, I would have appreciated if the space was cleaner since I found hair in the shower upon my arrival, and I would have appreciated if the Zencity staff member who entered the Airbnb during my stay (to pick up an internet cable) had worn a mask. Additionally, I noticed that there were many folks who worked in the building not wearing masks- I'm not sure if they're with your team or not, but it's disrespectful not to wear a mask at work during a pandemic. It demonstrates that your company is not concerned with potentially exposing your guests and your staff members to COVID. I hope that mask wearing will become a company policy moving forward for the duration of the pandemic to protect all parties involved. It's stressful enough to travel right now- please make it easier on your guests by cleaning your units thoroughly and having team members wear masks.",I found a couple long hairs in the shower and a bug in the shower upon my arrival.

The sound throughout the whole apartment is connected as well since the rooms aren't completely divided and the echo makes EVERYTHING loud and clear. Wasn't a deal breaker either but it just wasn't what we were expecting and I wish that was more accurately described in the listing.  We also chose this place specifically for wifi access and were unable to connect to the internet the entire stay, the hosts were also not super helpful with this and only responded to our concerns once our stay was already almost over. There was also no battery in the smoke detector which could potentially be a major safety concern. The code to access the building also didn't work 100% of the time which was really annoying.

Still, for the price, it was worth it to be a few blocks from a ton of restaurants and amenities. The pictures are accurate, and it's apparent that the furnishings are somewhat new and the place is well-appointed. The building can get a bit noisy in the evenings, which I didn't mind, but if you need complete quiet this might not be for you. There is a convenient electronic door locking system, which was nice. Wifi was strong. AC worked really well and kept the place cool during a very hot few days. My biggest complaint was that the floors were extremely dirty, as if they had never been swept or mopped, and a few small repairs (window blinds, chipping on bedroom wall) were needed. The cleanliness was especially concerning given it was during COVID-19 and I was charged an extra cleaning fee (which I happily paid!). I hope the host fixes these issues because the place is a great value otherwise.","Hi. I was very disappointed in the cleanliness of the unit.  I was charged a very substantial COVID-19 cleaning fee, which I totally support in theory and was happy to pay, but the place with really dirty. My feet or socks were blackened by dirt as I walked around. Surfaces were visibly dirty, and there was chipping and apparent water damage in the bedroom. This place had a very low base price, so I wasn't expecting to be in the lap of luxury, but the cleanliness was perhaps the worst I've ever experienced in dozens of airbnb stays.","The floors were extremely dirty throughout the apartment. There were broken window blinds, water damage and peeling drywall in the bedroom, and hair/dirt on baseboards and in corners. The kitchen appeared to be well cleaned, though."

It was in a great location however and overall it was a good stay.",,"Things were not super restocked- no paper towels, not a lot of TP. And it seemed like they don't replace the little hotel sized shampoo/soap bottles. There was one that had the shampoo seeping out and crusted on the outside and one that had a tiny hair in it. Which during COVID, wasn't super comforting. Just made me question how thorough they were in the rest of the cleaning. Everything was put together nicely though."

Though I brought my own supplies, the cleaning and sanitizing supplies in the apartment as well as  the french press and coffee table books were an added bonus.

It looks like the pictures but when you get to the space you’ll realize it is actually much older than it seems in pictures. When we moved in there was no A/C. That is a major problem as it was said in the description of the bnb that there was A/C. It took days to even get a temporary fix on this problem and communication was very slow. They ended up providing two portable A/C units (did not cool the whole house so we had to flip a coin every night for who would get A/C). The living room temp unit they provided leaked so they provided a bucket and told us we had to dump it every day. This air bnb isn’t the worst day but definitely not the best.

39484987,640248782,2020-07-19,351881917,Yanira,"This was not what I expected in a bad way.

Pros: The rate was cheap. The area was very pretty. There is parking in a gated parking lot.

Cons: 
-MICE:  I should have been suspicious seeing the 4 mousetraps by the washer/dryer, but I thought it was more precautionary. However at night I heard clear sounds around the apartment. Then one night around 11pm I saw 2 mice running around the kitchen and livingroom. I tried to get a hold of the host to find a immediate solution or accommodation but they never got back to me.

Not Clean: Although the listing says that they do 'enhanced cleaning measures' to help combat COVID, I don't believe it. The walls are painted with a chalkboard-like paint that shows every scratch and scuff mark. When I walked in there were clearly visible liquid splash marks on the wall. The handles of the refrigerator were very sticky for some reason. The remote had ketchup on the side from the last guest. I dropped my phone in the seat cushions and when I lifted the cushion I saw so much crumbs and dirt and even a dirty earbud.

Fixtures: The restroom sink faucet is placed so incorrectly that when you go to wash your hands you end up splashing the entire counter. The air conditioner is preset with a schedule that only the host has control of. The lowest it can go is 68. If you set it to a certain temp at night, you'll wake up to it at about 73, which is the locked setting.

Overall, I could have put up with everything else if it weren't for the fact that this place had a clear mouse problem and didn't inform me before hand.",,Under the living room couch cushions was very gross. There were liquid splash marks on the walls

Sorry that you had an issue with the bedding.  ( I would post pics to here if it will allow )

Checking in was easy enough.  We were given step by step instructions.  

Now to my complaint.  When we first made it to the room it was so hot in there.  Ok no biggie just need to turn air on.....wrong.  There was an issue with the ac.  Snapped a photo of the thermostat and the temperature to see if maybe we were doing something wrong.  Over an hour later after a 2nd message I finally got a response.  “Oh that’s unfortunate sorry it’s hot. Maybe set the temperature see if that helps.  It’s after 5 on Sunday and maintenance won’t be in til tomorrow.  Sent another message.  No response.  Sent another photo at bed showing the temp the same and what the thermostat was set on.

Hope you found the extras. ( I did but not the point ) maintenance finally knocked on the door Tuesday morning.  The ac issue was Sunday at 445 .

This is a part of down town so if you don’t like noise , (sirens, horns, cars people etc) you may not like it here. We are from a small country town and that did not bother us.

They were also on a tight schedule and still cleaning the apartment when I attempted to check in, ~1.5 hours after check-in time. It also would be awesome if they stocked detergent for the in-unit laundry machine (I did buy some and leave it behind for others!)"
29386356,582172033,2019-12-26,16624627,Deward,"Great location for Roscoe Village, North side visit. Easy self check in with code lock. Unfortunately, once inside the unit was disappointing. No pictures on walls or decor of any kind. Two couches and pool table, no coffee tables at all. Dining table was small outdoor type table with 4 metal chairs. The main room literally had at least 24 recessed lights?? No coffee maker, incomplete dish set (only 1 bowl). Just no Chicago charm at all.","Brian, please see my notes for why the value was just not there for this rental. Just take one weekends profits, do a little cleanup and some minimal decorating and tour place would be sooo much nicer and worth the rate.","We were surprised bu several aspects of cleanliness. First, even though it was not necessarily dirt, all of the main windows still had half scraped construction labels on them and none of the exterior glass had been cleaned in quite a while. The floors which the owner made a point to ask us to take our shoes off for, had not been cleaned very well at all. Visible dust and dirt along the walls. The most unacceptable though was food debris on the dining room table. I have pics of all of this if you would like."

Such as, hand towels, bar soap and a little more detail to the cleaning crew. It was a five night stay and I’m of the opinion that was missed by housekeeping. To be clear, I would rent again and make my expectations clear.","This isn’t meant to be a critical review but, honest. These are details that would have made this rental more attractive. Thank you","I should preface that this is my first ever Air B&B experience. Shower surround and curtain had something splashed on it. I was able to wipe it and it was removable. Indicates to me that it wasn’t thoroughly cleaned before my arrival. No bar soap or hand soap in the bath area. The kitchen floor had been mopped before my arrival and appeared wet. Although, it could have been that the trash can was washed and never dried because when I came back from the market there was a two foot trail of liquid seeping from below. Which forced me to use the one and only hand towel that was provided. That seemed odd for a five night stay. I brought this to mgt. attention. Two days later there were new bath towels and a dish towel provided."

However host upgraded me to absolutely beautiful unit a couple blocks over for the issues and was very helpful in resolving issues! Like technology can be unpredictable and it’s not really his fault for the keypad not working. 10/10 recommend staying with zencity!!,The window farthest from the tag won’t close and the couch area was quite dirty with stains. My recommendation would be to put some kind of sheet over the couch? And also one of the rugs was coming unattached from the ground so it needs to be taped down again. And the couch’s back leg was slightly broken I believe. I didn’t have much time to use the living area it the whole unit was absolutely beautiful!!,Couch area was slightly gross and one of the windows wouldn’t close but for the most part it was really clean and amazing!!

I also had a rat in my unit, but within 3 hours of notifying the host, they had moved me to another unit.",,There was a rat in my unit.  The unit is in a basement and it rained heavily so I believe this was due more to weather conditions than cleanliness.

Other than that I would consider staying here again.,Communication was great!

39334565,635978393,2020-07-08,351881917,Yanira,"This is a very stylish, minimal apartment. It was nice place during my week-ish stay. 
Cleanliness: I am disappointed that although the places stated 'enhanced cleaning measures' to combat COVID, I still found crumbs on the stove, left over coffee creamers in the fridge, and even hair on the 'clean' pillowcases in the closet. However, I had my own sanitizing supplies and after I gave the place my own wipe down, it was okay.
Amenities Used: The host has a Netflix account set up already, which is nice. The internet connection was solid, which was great for all my zoom calls. I made use of the gym and laundry facilities while I was there. The gym was nice and there wasn't many people in it so I felt safe. They don't have any policy in place for COVID about restricting the number of people in the gym at one time, so just try to go when no one else is there. The laundry room was empty when I used it midday. The washers were pretty clean considering they are shared.
Parking: There is plenty of pay-parking on the street Laclede. You can pay either via app or using the pay station. Its free after 7pm but I didn't feel comfortable leaving my car on the side street overnight so I would park it in the hospital located down Laclede for $15 overnight. The hospital parking is a quick walk from the apartment so it was very convenient. 
Area:  Keep in mind this is in a busy area, very, very close to a hospital, so you will here a lot of ambulances, firetrucks, and main road traffic day and night. But, like trains, you quickly tune it out.
It is in walking distance to a Whole Foods, Shake Shack, and other yummy places.

Overall a nice stay.","The place itself was so stylish and the furniture was minimal and perfect for me. Having full control of the air conditioner was a plus too!
I will say that the check out process left me a bit uneasey. It says to leave the key inside the room, which means I could not lock the door on my way out to check out. It just made me wary about leaving it open!

Also, I am so sorry about breaking a cup. I was trying to navigate the dark and was unsuccessful.","On AirBNB website, this place was marked as doing more cleaning due to COVID-19. However, when I came in, I found food crumbs on the stove, left over creamer packets in the fridge, a string bean in the freezer, and hairs on the 'clean' sheets and pillowcases that were stored in the closet. The extra comforter was also on the floor of the closet. The bathroom tub was clogged and drained so slowly for my entire trip."

Now on my recent visit was different. Upon arriving inside unit I went to bathroom and notice shower was not cleaned and had old used bar of soap on soap holder inside shower. I was very disappointed I refuse to shower in a unclean shower. So I bought cleaning supplies to clean myself. The other issue was the front room couch it was finger nails clippings on couch seat cushions and a  lighter stuck inbetween pillows. I knew this place was not properly cleaned. Its a beautiful place but wish the unit was cleaned properly. The kitchen floor needed a good sweep and mopping also. Other than that I would recommend if unit is cleaned.
22320506,231309932,2018-01-31,46342366,Julia,"This is probably the worst place and the worst experience I have had in using Airbnb.

1). I had to stood in freezing Chicago winter night for over half hour because the check-in instruction does not work. He did not want to give the backup option until all the efforts he told me to try failed, including to warm up the lock by rubbing, breathe and banging it. Imagining doing all these after a long flight in the a freezing night of winter Chicago.
2). Despite I told him that my phone with Airbnb app was going to battery out, please call me on the other phone. He stayed on Airbnb msg only. Luckily, my other phone just had data plan in. Otherwise, I might have to stand in the cold all night or arrange alternative. 
3). The interior room is not as clean as the picture. It is probably due to old units and poor house keeping. Some of the things on the wall, for example the intercom, is half falling. The hallway, stairway, and elevator are just unbearably dirty and scary. When I come back from work (I work late), I felt like in a horror movie. 
4). I regret booking with 2 weeks up front. He charges 50% of payment for all the rest night if I check out early, disregarding how many days ahead of the final check out date. 
5). On the last day, my meeting went longer because we need to surely wrap up some works. I missed the check out time by an hour and half. He charged additional fee right way when I arrived airport. I acknowledge that check out time is a a upfront rule. However, given a 2 weeks good deal for him, it is not unreasonable to expect him to have a bit grace. ","The check in incident and the shabby hallway, interior were bugging already. On top of that, despite a great deal for you with my two weeks’ stay, you want to charge additional for I missing the check out time. I will just return a straight frank host with frank honest comments .

37082054,653877363,2020-08-20,10436640,L G,"We hope to be back! This unit wins for Best Location! Walkability factor is pretty high – close to many good bistros, coffee shops, casual & fine dining restaurants; stores such as Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Michaels, Target, CVS; the University of Chicago (a bit of a hike but still walkable); Lakeshore Drive and the Promontory Walk at Lake Michigan. 

Beautiful art deco building with a large, cool, private courtyard for social distance visiting. Unit itself was a bright, breezy corner unit on the fourth floor, so if you wanted to avoid the elevator, taking the stairs was a viable option. Bedrooms are in opposite corners which was nice. We didn’t really use the kitchen, but the fridge, toaster and microwave were nice to have. Water pressure was strong. Bed linens were super soft, I think they were the bamboo kind, with a good number of pillows. No parking spot but lots of free street parking. 

What I wish I had done was to bring my own Fire Stick (or a Google Cast or equivalent) so that I didn’t have to sign-in (and sign out) of my favorite streaming channels. They had Netflix and Sling available, so there was still a wide variety of streaming shows.  

IMO, the unit was a bit tired looking. Negatives were – toilet was an old model, small and almost toddler height; there were holes in the sofa (they brought in a band new sofa on our last night!); one side chair’s coils were unraveled; the dishwasher wasn’t attached to the counter, so it would alarmingly tilt out of the counter; sink in kitchen and bathroom had some mold; very limited kitchen plates, glasses, utensils. 

The cleaning job wasn’t the best – dirty vents, cobwebs, dusty tables, windows were so dirty you could hardly see out of it. As a precaution, I brought my Lysol to wipe down & disinfect the place anyway, so this wasn’t really a bother for me. Unlike another ZenCity property that we rented last year, this one forgot to leave coffee, salt & pepper, paper towels, face & hand towels and a kitchen towel. For a twelve-day stay we were given one bath towel each (3 total). From our experience, we think ZenCity has some nice properties and is terrific value. We can highly recommend this place.","Sweet unit but it would be really helpful to clean the windows. It's a corner unit but you couldn't see out because of the dirty windows. 

Our building code didn't work on our last night. We were about to check out early the next morning but what the heck? Too much hassle to contact you to let you know, but we shouldn't have to since we were paid for that night. 

Your note ""Nice and Clean"" by Clariza only works if it's true. Otherwise, it seems it's better not to put up a sign if you can't keep the promise. :-/",sink had mold. cobwebs in living room. baseboards were not clean. windows were so dirty you couldn't see out of them.

Good: location, price, building is nice, has a pool and gym. Washer and dryer in unit.
Bad: internet is 5mbps which is slow and they will not increase it which is sad because it's a Google fiber network with possible speeds of up to a gig (1000 Mbps). This made it hard to work remotely. Communication with this third party management company is poor. I had to send multiple emails to get them to respond and they're dismissive. I find when an owner is managing it is a lot better in terms of response and action taken.",,The rugs are girly and need to be deep cleaned. There are stains all over.

I would expect a lot more professionalism for something like zencity. I would have been much more accommodating if the host just said that he couldn't provide anything and acknowledged the smell in the place,"As I walked into the bnb the entire place smelled like dirty water, which made it very hard to believe if it was disinfected or cleaned at all.

The bad things about this location where they at I got stuck in the hallway for an hour waiting for the a response to change the code on the door. I also received 10 tickets in the 11 days I was there even though I was paying the meter. If I had not taken the time out to go to the place where you pay tickets I would have been stuck paying all but one of them. Also you have to make sure all the bills are paid. First the electric company came out and put a disconnection notice in the door. I had to communicate with the host wow the man was in the apartment so he didn't cut off the electric. Also the Wi-Fi got cut off and I had to call and get it cut back on. The place was not clean for us to be in the middle of a pandemic I would write the cleaning 4 out of 10",Make sure bills are payed up.....I had to deal with electric company and disconnect issues,There is a layer of dust on the base boards and on top of ledge in shower. Ashes in window ledges. You can tell the floor was mopped with a dirty mop.

No chairs in living area.  No table for eating or for entertainment (board games, cards, etc..).  No REAL coffee machine like a Keurig or Mr. Coffee.","If you are promoting your property as ‘can accommodate 4-5 people’, then provide enough furniture to do so. My daughter and her friend came to visit and each brought their own outdoor folding chairs so they had a place to sit in the living area.  Also, how about a small table in the living area for people to play cards, games, etc..  No closet hangers provided. No ‘real’ coffee maker provided (like a Keurig or Mr. Coffee).

Bed is comfortable, but a tad awkward to get into since you have to step up and onto the end of it. Kitchen is nice, but the drawers are a nightmare to use; don’t plan on cooking much aside from maybe making instant ramen or reheating takeout/delivery, since there isn’t much to cook with. Comfy couch and chair in the living room. In-unit washer and dryer is a huge bonus if you have an extended stay; remember to bring your own detergent and fabric softener.","Thanks for the stay; the pictures online don’t do the place justice! However, there were no paper towels to help me clean up after myself, so I needed to buy some for the duration of my stay.

There was a musty body odor smell on the couch, it is time for that fabric to be washed. The pillows were musty as well as the back up linens of another blanket and the sheets. It’s gross and an important part of any accommodations is clean linen. Linen really needs to be cleaned in between stays it seems it was skipped before my stay which is disappointing. The bed linen looked and smelled fairly cleaned out of all the pillows two didn’t smell musty.",I am happy with my 1st Airbnb experience I would book this place again. Hopefully límeme will be more attended to. I just can’t believe I packed up all of my things except for my toiletries I forgot which is disappointing. I didn’t realize until later I didn’t think there is anyway for me to get them back but if there is please let me know. Thank you.,"The place was at a quick glance clean my biggest issue was a lingering musty smell in the air, the place was stuffy. When you sit on the couch it smells musty in which I mean a body odor musty. The couch fabrics need to be cleaned. Then to make it worse some of the bed pillow cases were musty. I checked out the back up linen in the closet like sheets and an extra blanket and it all smelt musty. So pretty much seems the linen had not been cleaned since after previous occupants. The place was clean but linen is important we have to sleep and sit on these things it’s gross thinking your sleeping in someone’s sweaty bed."

There was also a large amount of light bulbs out. Definitely a cool place and I don’t regret staying there, I just suggest those fixes.","It was clean for the most part, the bathroom toilet could’ve been a bit more clean.

- There were handprints all over the walls of the bedroom, and the furniture in the living/dining room was extremely old, worn and dirty-looking. It also smelled like chemicals - and not in the clean way. 

- One of the windows in the living room is missing (??), with only paper taped over it. Additionally, none of the windows have screens - so they can't be opened - and guests are not allowed to adjust the thermostat on their own.

- TV is EXTREMELY slow (at times unwatchable) and you can only watch Netflix - no regular TV. The input was constantly disconnecting and/or buffering due to slow internet. I also had to replace the batteries in all the remotes, which the host did not reimburse for or acknowledge when I reached out.

- There was a fire alarm in the unit chirping for THREE ENTIRE days (kept me up all 3 nights, too). It took the host multiple days and multiple reminders/follow-ups from me before it was fixed. I couldn't reach the fire alarm or find a ladder, otherwise I would have just done it myself.

- Lastly, neither of the front gates leading to the apartment building lock. This is dangerous. There were strange people/homeless people wandering all around and through the entrance/front alleyway during the night. It was also very loud.",,"There were handprints all over the walls in the bedroom, and the furniture in the living/dining room was very worn and looked dirty.

It was noisy at night.  There is a club across the street that was outdoors in the street (the street was blocked off due to social distancing,  I suppose).  It was nice to hear a DJ the first night, but every night of my stay was a bit much....especially from the yelling and screaming of partiers. 

Lastly,  the common area at the rooftop was not clean.  

Overall,  this was a good experience.","Please remove the automated thermostat to give guests an opportunity to set the temperature of the room to what is comfortable for them.  I was able to adjust it, but it only would stay the adjusted temperature for 2 hours.  68 is far too cold for me.",There was a couple of dust balls around as id someone swept and left a small pile.

The bedroom carpets and linens were a bit dirty, and so were the wood floor in the living room and kitchen.

About half way through our stay, the smart lock on the door stopped working.  After spending a few HOURS on chat with the hosts, trying several different resolutions, they hired a handyman to come the next afternoon. For that period of time, I could not leave the Airbnb because the door would not lock behind me (and if it did. I'd have no way of getting back in). There is no physical key.

Not enough trash in the house, only 2 small bins upstairs (1 in the kitchen, 1 in the toilet). Hosts seem quiet picky, my friend's and I cleaned the house when we left, there wasn't a big trash outside the airbnb so we neatly put all the trash neatly in a corner but the host still charged us for not disposing it.

While this unit does not allow smoking, it has been smoked in previously and the smell of stale cigarettes was strong and permeated our clothing after staying there. The neighborhood is awesome and the kitchen is a little bare (no measuring cups, for instance, but there is a toaster and coffee pot), but has new appliances. The dishwasher won't run unless the switch on the wall is activated. Good place to stay if the price is right, but there are lots of (pretty thoughtful) college students around so things can get a little lively on the weekends.","They neighbors were really friendly and helpful when we had issues unlocking the door of the unit and the neighborhood is great. The floors throughout the building are incredibly loud (you can hear every movement in the upstairs unit). Perhaps this is already priced into the unit, but it certainly wasn't obvious when we were booking. Also, the light fixture in the main (living) room would not full illuminate on our last day - it could be the lightbulbs, as they would glow slightly but never fully light up. 

Thanks for letting us stay at your place -","The apartment smelled of stale cigarette smoke which was apparent when first entering. Upon returning to our own home, all of our clothes and belongings also smelled of stale cigarette smoke.

Location was perfect for us and the neighborhood is nice and it is an easy walk to many shops and restaurants.  Parking is free on the street - but it is difficult to find a spot.  We found a spot on the street on day#2 of our stay and left the car there for the remainder of our stay.  We did use SpotHero the first day and were able to park in a lot that was very close to the apartment.  The unit is spacious with plenty of room for two people.  Bed is comfortable and bedroom closet had plenty of hangers and a luggage rack which is always a nice touch.  Building is quiet and we never heard any noise from neighbors.  Wifi worked great which was appreciated due to having to work remotely a few days during our stay.  The A/C unit was loud when it was running, but did adequately cool the apartment.  The couch in the living room looks great and appears to be new, but is is extremely uncomfortable.  Kitchen is minimally stocked.  This wasn't a concern for us as we were not planning on preparing any meals n the unit.  Only a thin dishtowel was provided in the kitchen - no dishcloth, pot-holders, or detergent for the dishwasher were provided.  The grout in the tub area as well as the shower curtain could be cleaner and the back of the bathroom door was cracked.  Only one hand towel, 3 bath towels and 3 wash cloths were provided - which is minimal for 2 adults staying for 7 days.

They eventually did, on the second day, with no warning, and he fixed it immediately. He also checked other kitchen water features to ensure they were working. I had to ask for a partial refund for not having a kitchen for two nights and a whole day.

We didn't get a response so we waited in the car until the 3pm check in time. We went up to the unit (through a very dirty building and elevator), we arrived to the unit and followed the checkin instructions for the keypad. It didn't work. We tried multiple times and the door alarm started going off (because of too many failed attempts I'm assuming). I messaged zencity to see what was going on and we waited again. No response, so I called to see how we get in... while on hold we tried the door a couple more times and it finally allowed us in. We finally got a callback from a zencity representative 25 mins after my initial message about the entry issues. 

The first thing we noticed on entry is that there are no locks on the doors other than the keypad lock. There weren't even handle locks on the main or patio door. That didn't make us feel very safe. When zencity finally contacted me about the entry issues I asked them about the sofa bed (we were under the impression the sofa was a bed as well, as there were two of us traveling and a need for two sleeping accommodations). The rep said to remove the cushions from the couch and the area creates enough room for someone to sleep. I told him a small child could not even fit on the couch comfortably as it was maybe only 4 feet long. Then I was informed that the unit we booked was the smaller couch unit and wouldn't work. So that was disappointing.

Of course one thing piles on top of another at this point and we started noticing the cleanliness issues in the unit. We expected more cleaning practices since COVID19 has created higher cleaning standards. The floorboards had dust build up, which meant they hadn't been touched in some time. There were fingerprint smudges on the mirror and glass door to the patio. The bathroom sink had soap residue as if the the dispenser was recently used, the toilet had stains and residue on the outside of the toilet and the inside rim, and there was dirt buildup in the corners. The walkthrough closet between the main area and bathroom had a broken table chair (which means our table only had one chair) and several other items stacked up in the space. Upon our discovery of the cleanliness issues on top of the lack of locks and sofa bed issue, we decided the place was not fit for us to stay as health and safety standards were not appeasing. Upon speaking with the host (and escalating it to Airbnb for support because the host refused issues) about the issues, cancellation, and possible refunds because we even had picture evidence of our issues... the host only agreed to refund half of 1 night of a 3 night stay and Airbnb was able to get them to agree to refund the cleaning fee.

The building itself is 15 blocks from downtown, so it is not ""close"" to the touristy areas of the arch, Busch stadium, or the river and the neighborhoods between are not the best to walk, especially at night. We had asked prior to our arrival about dining places around the area as we are avid foodies and so we could get a better feel for the area, but there was never a response to that message. I'm assuming because the host is not actually onsite or possibly not even located in St Louis, they are an offsite property management company. If you do stay here, I'd recommend you drive or use a rideshare to get downtown safely as there were no dining options in the direct vicinity of the building. Which had we known prior to arriving (by means of getting a response about the dining options, which we never got) we would've cancelled well before arrival and zencity would've been required by their own cancellation policy to refund us more than $30 for 3 nights.

Overall, I would not recommend this or any Zencity unit to anyone  as the cleanliness and safety standards were less than needed to be and the lack of communication, guest service, and resolve were unacceptable.",,"The mirror in the room had hand smudges on it (which means it wasn't cleaned).

I hope this review will save EVERYONE from ever having to deal with what we endured on what was supposed to be a fun family getaway. I have NEVER taken the time to write a review, but this experience was so unbelievably awful, that I won’t waste the opportunity to help warn others about this terrible company. 

We purchased a unit that specifically  listed it had 3 queen beds to accommodate our family. Zen City posted a listing for a unit with exactly that in an area that was relatively close to the things we wanted to see and do in downtown St Louis, so we purchased the unit.

As soon as we get to the unit, we knew something was wrong. The first thing we noticed was that the place was absolutely filthy. Hair and dirt EVERYWHERE. So what does that hefty “cleaning fee” they charge go towards I wonder? Certainly not CLEANING THE UNIT.  So, right off the bat, that was disgusting. 

Next thing we noticed was that we didn’t have the 3 queen beds we were supposed to have. We got in late, but we contacted the host right away to tell them these things. They ended up trying to go into the listing and CHANGING THE LISTING, to the unit they had put us in! Luckily, we still had pictures of the original listing we purchased and our confirmation email showing everything we were supposed to have. 

This company repeatedly try to put the blame on us saying several times “Oh, I see how you could have been confused” and “Sorry, you must have overlooked and bought a different listing.” after we kept providing proof of what we originally purchased.

As you may have already guessed, this host refused make the situation right, hung up on us, and told us to go through AirBnB. So, we did! AirBnB immediately saw right through this deceitful company. They saw that they tried to update the listing AFTER we initially contacted them, as well as the lies they told through the messenger. We ended up receiving a FULL REFUND, and immediately got our belongings out of that nasty dump and went to a nearby hotel, where we were able to salvage the rest of our trip. 

Of course, this company will do anything other than accept responsibility and be accountable for their deceitful actions, so I’m sure we received a delusional review in response to this one (reminds me of a 12 year old child throwing a tantrum screaming “I know you are, but what am I?”). 

However, if this review can save ANYONE from having to deal with this God awful company, then taking the time to write this review will have been well worth it!

According, to Zencity the place recently underwent a renovation which is why the pictures differ from actual apartment. However, the said “renovations” made the apartment look worse. The apartment was not clean to my satisfaction. The apartment window seals were dirty and the blinds were COVERED with dust! The toilet was broken (I have a video) and a light was blew out in the bathroom. The apartment is located in CWE (loved that) but they are doing construction. Construction workers wake you up at the crack of dawn (if you’re in to that kind of thing.. GO FOR IT). The people who represented Zencity were anything, but helpful. They were snippy and rude. You can see them argue with customers in the review comments under other postings. You can count on that they AREN’T going to do the right thing by their customers. All they can offer you are excuses and insincere apologies. Do not book with Zencity!",,"The apartment was not cleaned to my satisfaction.

It wasn’t sparkling clean as there was debris under the bed and around the couch. The ceiling fan didn’t work. Either they took the remote to limit use or it’s broken. It made it too hot to sleep comfortably.,Thank you for sharing your space with us for the weekend.,"There was a lot of debris under the bed and around the couch. The ceiling fan wouldn’t work.

Beds very comfortable. Location couldn’t be better. Just a few blocks from 18th street and all the restaurants and shops which we took advantage of. I ate the best tacos I’ve ever had. Only thing is walls are thin and a barking whining dog bothered us on the last day. Overall really modern beautiful place,We really enjoyed our stay. The place was perfect for me and my daughter. We both sort of got our own space. Location was amazing. We enjoyed local restaurants and shops the only thing I would say is to pay attention to cleaning. Especially floors and walls. Dog next door barked and whined almost constantly on our last day. Couldn’t sleep walls very thin! Overall nice place and we’d love to stay there again,"The floors and walls weren’t as clean as expected. Smudges of bathroom wall,  etc. but overall the please was clean and beautiful"
42103944,673955924,2020-10-12,147639467,Veronica,"The 46 Penn units are luxurious and with a great location towards the Plaza , walking distance. 
It has a lot of amenities but I was only able to use the gym due to COVID-19 even though  all the amenities are open. 
They assign you a private parking so you don’t have to leave your car outside. 
I found the apartments are in a safe zone and the building has personnel checking out people that comes in.
At my arrival to the apartment, I noticed the COVID-19 cleaning protocol wasn’t employed. 
Under the couch there was a takeout sushi lid, the bathroom had hair residues in the cabinet and towel closet . I had to take care of the cleaning myself.
The apartments are great, the problem is the Zencity Co. as the hosting entity.
I had an accident at my unit and first it was a challenge to communicate with Zencity and when they did communicate, they tried to relocate me to a place that I previously told them was unsafe.  
Meanwhile they where handling the damages caused to the unit by the accident, I had to move for 2 weeks and pay for hotel stays while they were trying to get an available unit for me.  
They never got the safe unit I asked and stalled the process of finding one. 
Because my stay was time sensitive, I had to book another Airbnb. All because I wasn’t provided an alternate option or accommodation in a safe location by Zencity. 
Thus, I ended up having to pay for 2 Airbnbs and a hotel room at once because they didn’t provide a timeline on the repairs or even communicating what was being done. 
At one point, Airbnb had to become involved in the process. 
It has been one of the worst experiences I’ve had with an Airbnb host.",,"In COVID-19 times there is a CDC  protocol on how to handle the cleaning. 
It wasn’t followed when I arrived to the apartment. At the moment I let them know and they apologize for it."

The garage entrance instructions that were given to us were incorrect. The gate was broken and we had to call security to tell us where to go. We ended up having to pay $12 just to drop our bags off at the room. 

Then apartment was very minimalistic and had everything you would need for your stay as well as a great view of downtown BUT...

There was a drainage issue in one of the bathroom sinks. The water would not drain and there were tons of black flies coming out of the drain area. My husband thinks they were coming from the sewer line. I messaged the hosts and they responded saying that it was probably because we left a window open...we were on the 12th floor and no windows were ever opened. 

All in all, it was a fine place to stay and in a good location. Hopefully they fix the sink issues before the next guests arrive.",,There was a drainage issue in the bathroom that caused a lot of flies to appear.

Inside, the place is nice and spacious and perfect for a large group. The only thing I will add is that cleanliness could be worked on a bit. The showers weren’t cleaned very well and there were no cleaning tools for the floors. We ended up bringing our own cleaning supplies to ensure we could spruce the place up a bit, especially after reading some of the prior reviews. The trash can pedal was broken when we arrived but other than that, we enjoyed our stay. I like the area because it’s a kind of busy neighborhood but the apartment is out of the way.  I would stay here again and I would recommend.","Brian, I appreciate your hospitality and quick responses. I would suggest offering a few more cleaning supplies like a broom or a swiffer for your guests to keep the floors clean.

Brian/Host did great allowing us an early check- in as we all came in to Chicago for my sons wedding weekend.  Brian informed me a couple hours prior to arrival that the some of the shades & a bedroom door had been ruined by guests the night before. He also told me later that a towel rack had been torn down by them.   Brian said he tentatively fixed all those items but had to get special parts for all before they could be permanently fixed.  Unfortunately, the towel rack wouldn’t stay up, the door wouldn’t shut & the windows in the common area didn’t all have shades. 
Shortly after we all arrived we realized that there were only 4 place settings of dishes (cups, plates, cereal bowls). I sent my husband to the store to pick up some paper products to get us by.  When he returned we realized there were no serving dishes or serving utensils!  As we started to get ready for the rehearsal dinner, we found only 5 bath towels, no wash cloths & 1 hand towel in the 2 bathrooms.   I messaged Brian on this right away and reminded him we had 7 people staying there!  Brian never responded!!!!   Later we also realized the only bed pillows were the ones in shams not pillow cases. For the 2 sofa beds we were only able to find 1 set of sheets. There were 3 pillows found but only 1 pillow case.  
It was bad enough that the towel rack, shades, door had been ruined but then not to have the necessary towels, linens & dishes was unacceptable for a unit that was available for up to 9 people!  Then to have the host not acknowledge my message on the shortage of bath towels, washcloths & dishes was very unprofessional.  It really makes me question the integrity of the host.  I am very embarrassed that I asked special friends to stay with us at this Airbnb. ",,"The place smelled like paint when we arrived,.

Brian was nice enough to let us check into the front condo and hour early while they finished cleaning the back condo. Brian was also very up front with me about some issues and things that were broken by the group before us. They did a great job not only fixing what the previous group broke but also getting the place clean in a short amount of time. Only have a few complaints, first is that it would have been nice to have more than one pool stick. Out of all of them only one wasn't broken. The second is it would have been nice to have cable in the back condo living room like there was in the front condo. I mentioned this to Brian and he already said he's getting it resolved. Would definitely recommend staying here and enjoying Chicago. ",Thanks again for having us. I appreciate you letting us check in early. I also appreciate you being up front with us and letting us know about all of the issues that the group before us left. Overall we had a great time. I hope we didn't leave to much of a mess.

The beds are very comfortable and the location was great for getting a quick Lyft ride. Brian is an excellent communicator and did all he could to help us with a few issues we had.","Brian, your place has great potential, but definitely some details to work out to match the level we are used to with AirBnb. For example, there is a ton of dirt under the sink in the front bathroom. It looks like construction dirt that is still there. There is no where at all to put your toiletries so that space is needed and it was pretty gross. Both bathrooms had a lot of hair and dust around the baseboards and the corners. 

We would highly recommend some boot racks, rugs, towels by the entrance. It was impossible to keep that area dry with nothing. Weather in Chicago will require those most of the year. 

More towels would also be really great. We had one large towel each and no personal hand towels or any washcloths. 

Last, just a reminder that the couch is broken, so we had barely anywhere to sit. We left the broken stool in the closest so no one would fall and get hurt.","Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas: bathroom, dust."

34977420,669933110,2020-10-01,83866768,Ryan,"I wish I could say I enjoyed my stay. 
Let's start with the good: The location is awesome - Just a short uber or even walk from downtown, and there are bike rentals 2 mins away so I rented a bike and biked to the museums and around Chicago. There is also a great Thai place STEPS from the building.

Bed - The bed was quite comfy, like other reviewers say.

Price - Obviously this is a cheaper listing in the area, so that's nice.

Now for the bad....

First off, walking in to this airbnb is like walking into a pre-owned vehicle owned by a smoker... Maybe no one had recently smoked in there, but the whole place had a horrible smokey odor. Ironically there were TWO no smoking signs in the space... 

Second, there were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been cleaned for some time. Huge buildup of dust and dirt etc in the corners of the room, baseboards and cracks in the stove had food in them. These things made me question how well cleaned the rest of the space was.

Third, the tub / shower had very little water pressure and took a long time to get hot, and every time you shower the drain backs up after about 2 mins of running the water, so you have to stand with your feet in disgusting shower drain back flow while you try to clean yourself. 

Finally, the bedroom also had top sheet - Only a duvet. Since most of the time a duvet doesn't get washed every guest, this was an additional gross factor. 

Last, you should know that street cleaners and construction vehicles of various kinds might wake you up in the morning. This might be seasonal, but while I was there at about 7am every morning there was some kind of beeping construction or city vehicle that slowly drove by the building. Because the AC unit is in the window, it lets all the sound in. 

Oh and one more thing - Host says there is street parking in the listing. I attempted to park on the street and wound up with a $75 ticket. Clearly I missed a sign somewhere and so this is not the hosts fault, but I wouldn't stay here if you intend on having a car.",,"There were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been cleaned for some time. Corners of the room, baseboards, cracks in the stove had food in them etc. These things made me question how well cleaned the rest of the space was.

We appreciate you addressing our concerns in a very timely fashion.  I am sorry to be so ""high maintenance"".   One other thought to consider would be to hose off the front porch from time to time.  I have a front porch at my home and I have to do this several times a summer to keep it clean.   Oh, and the front door seems like it should be replaced or refinished at some point.  Just a suggestion... not a big issue for us that affected our stay.  

Thanks for sharing the walking / running route with us - very helpful.  My wife and I enjoyed our walks together and I enjoyed my run.  Maybe consider sharing a map in your unit for others in the future? 

I can see why you are a top-rated host!  Keep up the good work!",Rating it a bit less than 5 due to ant issue.  Thanks for addressing in timely fashion.

-table had a crack prior to our arrival which might have caused it to eventually collapse.
-remote batteries were missing
-not sure if it was the design, but bed frames/bar stools/dining room chairs look like they are in bad shape and will eventually break as well. A couple of the pool sticks will probably need to be replaced soon.

Overall, disappointed with our stay and the lack of service provided by Zencity (didn't feel very ""zen""-like..). The apartment felt a bit more run down and dirty than expected. We had a difficult time accessing the AC controls because they are locked by the property manager making it a very uncomfortable sleep on the very uncomfortable beds even with the partially working fans on and windows open. It should be common knowledge that people's comfort and sleep during their stay is top priority, would you agree Zen? (insert 'YES' neon sign here ..)

Besides the fridge and dishwasher not being cleaned out, the toilet also did not work for the majority of the first day. I understand that these things happen, but it would have been nice to receive some sort of small refund, since the amenities were not working as advertised. 

If you’re looking for a cheaper place to stay, and you don’t mind the chance of having loud neighbors and lazy cleaners, I’d say this is a good one to keep in mind.

The apartment could use a upgrade ESPECIALLY the bathroom (the tub was peeling). The only new thing in this apartment was the bedroom and living room floor. This place had a very unpleasant odor, I’m not sure what it was but you should definitely consider a new house keeper and plug-ins. This place had the bare minimum just a heads up! You might want to bring your own towel and washcloth, they only provided 2 of each. I do NOT use the same cloth on my face that I’ve used to wash my body. No full body mirror only the bathroom. This place almost seems like a college dorm. I’m being honest it wasn’t what I expected, I booked based usually based on the reviews and this was inaccurate. Parking is HORRIBLE! The only 3 positive things about this place was the view of Lake Michigan, it’s definitely a safe place, and the location was close to food spots. Other than that I wasn’t satisfied, I’ve stayed in much better Airbnb’s in the past. I hope you take a lot of these issues into consideration to help avoid complaints. Please consider a apartment upgrade, not just the floor.",I was very unsatisfied but I had no choice but to stay. Thank God it wasn’t for my entire trip. Never again !,The bathrooms needs to be upgraded ! The shower peeling is unacceptable. The entire apartment had a funky odor!!!! Consider plug ins! This place wasn’t the best. The pictures doesn’t add up.

We enjoyed our first visit to Chicago very much and staying here was a good way to enjoy the city. There is easy access to the riverside walk and city centre, the restaurants around Fulton market and good transportation to other parts of the city.","Hi Chris,
Thanks again for hosting us, we enjoyed Chicago a lot and staying in your apartment in such a great location really made the trip special. There were a few issues however:
When I booked I advised that my daughter would use the sofa bed. Whilst there were sheets and pillows there was no duvet or blanket to be found. Lizzie ended up sleeping under our coats which really was far from ideal.
In the kitchen there was a sticker on the dishwasher which said 'Clean dishes drying. Please do not run'. We looked inside and the machine was empty but given the very firm instruction and as there were no dishwasher tabs to be seen we didn't use it during the whole stay. We cooked a lot and so had to hand wash dishes and cooking equipment twice a day. Not much fun on a vacation when you are used to having the use of a dishwasher on a daily basis.
Some help with information on the situation about leaving bags after check out would have been appreciated. We had heavy bags and wanted to make the most of our time on our last day in Chicago before our flights home late evening. Just an indication or suggestion on what to do in a strange city would have helped.
Thanks,
Martin.",Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas: kitchen. Additional comments: “Refrigerator interior could have been cleaner ”.

I just think there are a few things that need some attention: if we’re paying for a cleaning fee (and others too) there really shouldn’t be cobwebs on the windows. The shower needs some attention too - mold on the bottom corner of the shower curtain was a little off putting. There were some areas where the wood was separating from the foundation which didn’t look great either. Some of your cups/dishes that were put away weren’t clean and some were even cracked. It also wasn’t a big deal, but if you’re going to advertise things like Sling TV, you should probably make sure guests have the credentials to log into them.

39484985,583325465,2019-12-28,206003118,Courtney,"Overall this truly is a really beautiful place to stay! But there were a handful of things that didn’t work properly that we really, really wish had. I feel like this place has potential to be an even higher value with the following:

Ensure kitchenware is truly clean before allowing a new tenant to come in. Oil on cookware is unappealing. Also you should look into putting oven mitts in the space!

Bathroom: just invest in some bathroom spray for after poops and a full size shampoo, conditioner & body wash. It won’t be much more expensive than buying all the tiny single use ones and makes it feel much homier and less like a cold hotel. Also, the toilet was installed improperly on the spring and therefore lurches every time you sit down. Id get that checked out. Also recommend two ply toilet paper and paper towels. The rest of the place is so plush and nice- don’t cut corners on these simple and easy amenities!

Not sure if it’s just because it’s a basement unit but the WiFi does NOT consistently work! Cuts out and boots you off consistently. This is something I had asked about before so it really shouldn’t have been a problem, but it was. If the basement has a hard time holding onto WiFi, invest in an extender! Nothing worse than needing to get work done and not being able to do it from your Airbnb.

It was not evident to me from the listing that it was an underground unit. There are windows lining the top of the walls that go to the street. Black out curtains were great in the bedroom- I suggest them for living room as well. Had someone stop and look in (crouch) while we were inside and not clothed. 

The door connected to the parking lot did not lock (fob access) and it took 3 ish days to actually lock after we complained. Did not make us feel safe as one night when we left, we noticed a man in the lot checking cars for valuables to steal..! Safety is a huge priority. This is why we weren’t keen on soulard originally but the door should’ve been locked. I believe it was due to construction, but it still should be secure 100% of the time.

Should really make an effort to make it transparent in the listing that there’s currently construction... especially since this affects doors being left unlocked, noise during the day, and the place being generally littered with flecks, dust, construction bits, etc. Also dog poop all over the front entrance carpet the first two days... it’s so important to keep the place clean. And dust free or at least be transparent that there will be dust for asthmatics. 

The water in the shower does not stay cold for long- I would try to find a way to fix this. Impossible for two people to take subsequent showers. We showered together to keep the water hot long enough but that’s not everyone’s situation.

Washer does not drain water. This can be a real stick in the mud if you’re trying to wash your clothes and get somewhere.. issue wasn’t resolved during our stay sadly. We had to wring out our wet, dirty clothes, hand wash, and then hang all over the shower to get them to dry. That’s a basic amenity I was disappointed we did not have for our stay during the very busy holidays. 

Vent is exceptionally loud and the apartment for some reason will not change temperature quickly. Our thermostat was at 76 most the time and no matter how much we tinkered with the settings, we couldn’t get it down to a more comfortable temperature.

Finally, it’s an underground unit and there must be access somewhere as there are ants around in the kitchen..  

Overall it is literally a beautiful space. The kitchen is gorgeous. The bed is SO comfortable. It’s aesthetically so pleasing. But if you want to make it a true value, please address those issues!!! 

On a positive note, if you are looking for a visually pleasing place to stay and don’t need very reliable WiFi or washing machine, the rest of this is pretty okay to deal with! The listing isn’t one of the most expensive in the area and you have to take that into account. The TV will buffer from time to time but the kitchen appliances work and I cannot express how comfortable the bed is! If you can deal with a very minor inconveniences (the main safety issue of the door is now fixed!) and a big of construction, I’d stay here again! Unfortunately, it didn’t quite suit all our needs and I think if some of these issues get addressed, it could be a fantastic spot!!!","Overall this truly is a really beautiful place to stay!

22970180,413518084,2019-02-17,110086967,Jeff,"The Good: 
Apartment was in a great location in Hyde Park. I was visiting UChicago and it was an easy walk to campus, with several restaurants, cafes, and a drug store also nearby. Accessing the apartment was easy, with clear instructions and a lockbox in place. Zencity was prompt and helpful with communication throughout the process, and was quick to answer any questions or concerns I might have. The apartment was well-stocked with amenities, including an iron, a steamer, a lint roller, extra towels, etc. It is well-sized for one or two individuals with a small gas-stove, a full-sized refrigerator, and a small breakfast nook. I enjoyed the low-key decorating style. 

The Bad: 
Water pressure in the bathroom wasn’t great—I usually ended up washing my hands in the bathtub because the waterflow in the sink was frustratingly slow. There was some hair around the bathtub and toilet, which didn’t bother me, but I can imagine other future guests may be particular about that. As other reviewers have noted, the lighting in the main room is unusual—the kitchen lights need to be on to use the outlets on the far side of the apartment, which is where the television is located. This wasn’t a problem for me, but again, I can imagine other guests wanting to be able to watch television without the lights on or wanting to watch TV right before they go to sleep. 

The Ugly: 
My phone charger and headphones inexplicably went missing on my second day here.

The room came stocked with a phone charger, and a charitable explanation would be that someone came in while I was gone to retrieve that charger and accidentally mistook my charger for that one. It is also POSSIBLE that I may have put my headphones in my pocket and subsequently lost them outside of the apartment. I think this is the most likely explanation for how both items ended up missing.

A less charitable explanation would be that someone deliberately took two items that were placed right inside the door of my room.   

I spoke with the Zencity management about this, and they assured me that no one on their crew came into my room while I was staying there. And I can understand how ridiculous this sounds from their perspective: if someone told me that his phone charger went missing, I would assume he had misplaced it and it was somewhere in his bag, or he’d left it in the bathroom, or left it at Starbucks or something. But I am clinically OCD about my stuff. I rarely misplace things, let alone lose them, and I spent several hours scouring the apartment, unpacking my luggage over and over again, and even sorting through the trash can multiple times in an effort to find these items. I am quite confident that I do not have these items, and I am genuinely perplexed as to how they went missing. It seems unlikely that anyone on a cleaning crew or a landlord with an extra key would take the time to come into my room and take these two small things. But any other possible explanations I can think of—a burglary with no signs of forced entry? A previously-unknown occasion of sleepwalking where I took these items outside the apartment?—seem even more far-fetched.

I don’t mean to be throwing around reckless accusations. I chose this apartment because it was well-reviewed, and it sounds like most guests have had a really positive time staying here. But this was my experience. I left feeling uncomfortable and unnerved that someone had gone through my stuff. This is the first time when using Airbnb in which I feel like my trust has been violated, and while I don’t think it was prompted by any personal animus—again, I think the most likely explanation is that someone came into my room and took my phone charger by mistake—I would not stay here again.",,"Some hair in the shower, and around the toilet base."

27130224,508873974,2019-08-13,45196380,Willy,"My first weird experience on Airbnb. I made a mistake when booking since I needed a place where some friends could spend very briefly before going together to a friend's wedding, I assumed that that would be not a problem since this place is published as ""entire apartment"". I understand that customer is supposed to be an adult and responsible person and they can act as if it were their home, this is not the case in this place so I think it is something that future visitors should consider. There is no such assumption of good faith here. I was even warned that I could be taken out at any time if I dared to take a visit, so if you are not used to these kinds of extremely conservative rules, it may not be your place for you. The worst part was when I proposed to change my reservation for two weeks later that I would return to Chicago, it seemed like a fair proposal since I would stay with them for the same price and I could look for another more convenient place, they simply ignored my proposal and after my insistence they told me that I could cancel (losing more than half of the money).
The location was quite good, it is somewhat far from the center (loop) but it can be easily reached using bus and the Uber pool is less than 15 dollars. Also the apartment is quite comfortable and well decorated, the towels and sheets were quite clean. Only two small details: the air conditioning is in the main room and it is not good enough to cool the bedroom, and although I did not use the kitchen, on the last day I saw a small cockroach walking there.",,All the place was clean except because there was a cockroach in the kitchen. I saw it the last day before leaving. Not really an issue because I did not cook but definitely it can be annoying for other people

My only negatives were that you are definitely dealing with a corporation, and not someone renting out their place. Had an issue with the drier and took a while for a response and was like calling a customer support hotline. The suggestions that were then offered almost via email were almost bot like. I figured it out myself but to their credit they extended our checkout by an hour since we had wet clothes.

I know when things are clean and when they’re not. Given the fact that this unit as well as most of this companies units are low cost, I don’t believe this means that the units get to be disgusting. ESPECIALLY, when I’m paying almost the same amount I’m paying for a nights stay in cleaning fees. I had to vacuum the unit as well as use the disinfectant spray on all the surfaces. I went to the target around the block and got air freshener and candles, ran the fan for hours just so it wouldn’t have the musty smell it had when we got there. This was our second unit with zencity after staying in another unit in the same building and having to add another night. The bedroom doer was broken. The bathroom door doesn’t close as well as being a very outdated and dirty bathroom. The fridge wasn’t clean and had old milk from the previous guest in it. The linens and the towels had an excessive amount of random lint and hairs in it. The whole stay I was very uncomfortable and this is by far the worst experience I’ve ever had with Airbnb",,"As soon as you walk into the unit it smells unpleasant. The couch in the living room as well as the rug need to go. They’re dirty and disgusting. The fridge looked like you had never cleaned it out ever. The kitchen sink was dirty.

Thus, in temperature that dropped to 12 degrees, I was expected to sleep in said room. When I complained during the 8 o'clock hour, the questioning I received, inferred that I was at fault for breaking the window. Seeing that I don't smoke and it was freezing outside, I had no reason even to think about the window, yet alone opening the window. When I requested maintenance, I was told that they were gone for the day, and would have to bundle up and wait until the morning. Again, it was 12 degrees outside. When I complained more, I was told to turn the heat up, in the midst of 12 degree weather coming in. To make matters worse, the radiator worked when it wanted to, barely emitting any heat. After asking for a refund, they said they'd only be willing to offer a refund on half a night stay. When I said that was unacceptable, Zencity ceased communicating with me. Needless to say, I will never stay in this property again, because they don't consider the health and safety of their guests.","After staying in your property in March of 2018 and referring to classmates to your property this past week; I was extremely disappointed and offended by the way you handled the situation with the broken window last night. Unfortunately, I would no longer use your properties when I come to Chicago or refer people to your properties. To expect someone to sleep in a room, with a window open, allowing 12 degree air in is not only ridiculous but dangerous.

It's clean but an old building, so it comes with squeaky floors, an elevator with a grill and door (a little hard to open with a suitcase in one hand), an older style toilet and no thermostat. But it's located a few blocks from the Metra, has fast wifi for streaming, a smart TV, and clean towels and sheets. Check in with lockbox and communication with Chris was great.","Thanks for having me! It was a good stay. There was a slight odor when I walked in the door, a bit of mold on the bathroom windowsill, and the mop and cleaning products outside the bathroom took away from the ambience.

There is also plenty of great nearby restaurants, museums, and convinces within a 10 minute walk (we didn't rent a car - just Uber'd). Since it was mid-July when we stayed, and being from Colorado, we didn't anticipate how hot and humid it would be there. Considering it was built around the 1920's, the little swamp cooler could only cool the living room; everywhere else was just a sauna.

Noise machine & portable AC were a plus. ","Hey Chris, I really appreciated how quickly you responded to my question and the ease of check in/check out. Also, the bed was very comfortable.

I gave 3 stars instead of 5 because the space is really cool but has SO much more potential. I've spent lots of time in warehouses & artist spaces and there a few things that could make the place more inviting: touching up the holes in the walls & repaint (if the walls were a neutral color they wouldn't be noticeable & could even look cool. The extension cords running across the floor were a bummer...I ended up rerouting some chords to not trip. Also, the outlet that the ball-shaped light was plugged into was out.

The noise pollution was mentioned in in the listing but since the bed is directly underneath your neighbor's living area there was cigarette smoke all night, too. This can be helped if you moved the bed to another wall or down the wall. This would help solve some of the lack of outlets near the bed too. Dust & slight odor in the bathroom was unfortunate...I took a broom and knocked down a bunch of cobwebs.

Easy to access with many parking options nearby. You might have issues with the stairs to the third floor if elderly or out of shape. Would stay again.","This rental was pretty much what was expected knowing that it is in an older building. Besides the items we've already listed there are a few other safety things to list. There is exposed electrical connections in the under sink area in the kitchen (wires with wire nuts possibly being exposed to water). Some of the ceiling fan lights remained ""on or flickering"" when either turning off or on, or shutting just the lights off on the fans in both the living room and front bedroom. Thermostat is loose in the wall. Most smoke detectors missing,  just the brackets remain. (only one working detector noticed, 3rd floor apt). Hollow core door is used as the main door into the apartment, easy to be broken down/through. 

Even with the mentioned issues, this is a very appealing apartment. It has alot of character and with a little TLC and elbow grease as far as refreshing wood work, paint, nail holes in walls, bathroom vanities, it would be a shining star. 

Also, not knowing who owns the building the main entrance into the building needs cleaned. Trash, wood planks, bucket, etc is behind the door when it is opened to go inside and the area including the carpeted stairs is very dirty and dusty.","Dusty in many places,  heat and return air vents need cleaning. Dirty/greasy broiler pan in oven. Dirty/sticky eating utensils in silverware drawer. Gnats in the bathroom. Plastic over the windows for heat/cold air control needs re-adhered to the frames.

Unlike most of Chicago, we found free parking located on various streets around the building. The whole building has a keyed entry, so we felt quite safe. Both of the building front desk women that we had contact with were very friendly and helpful.
We used the gym in the basement, which was very nice and had a good selection of equipment.
The actual apartment was very nice with a well-stocked kitchen. It even has a coffee grinder, so we walked to a local Whole Foods and bought some locally roasted coffee beans. 
The bed is quite comfortable. The TV is a decent size and we enjoyed watching Netflix.

When I got to the residence not only did I struggle to find parking, the keys were not in the lockbox. I sent a message via the app but then I also called to get a call center who didn't really show any empathy that there were no keys in the lock box. The agent said that she would make it an urgent message but couldn't say when someone would call me back. In the meantime, Chris responded and asked me to try the backup lockbox which was also empty. He then asked me to try the cleaner's box which had multiple sets of keys (I am guessing that they own multiple apartments in this building). One set of keys allowed me to get into my designated apartment. Please note that ALL 3 lockbox combinations were set to just one number difference than the actual combination.

27962066,367367495,2019-01-04,126675802,Porter,"Overall, I think this is an absolutely wonderful place to stay if you’re visiting Chicago. About a block from Lake Shore drive so it was super easy to get pretty much anywhere in less than 20 minutes. The kitchen was clean and plenty of kitchen utensils for cooking. Whole apartment seemed very nice and clean. I only have two complaints about this rental. First, it says that you get a key fob because they lock the doors to the main entrance after a certain time, so we got locked out on Thursday night. Secondly, I had some serious issues with the bed. The pillows really suck. We always travel with our own so I would suggest doing that. The bed itself had wooden slats (like ikea beds) and some of them were broken or just missing so the mattress sunk in several spots which was annoying. Lastly, the sheets seemed like that hadn’t been changed but just lint rolled (poorly) lots and lots of little black hairs and fuzzies which is just a little unsettling. Luckily, there was an extra bedspread in the closet and we brought a blanket so we were good to go. 

Usually could find close street parking that was free and seemed like a safe area. close to some good restaurants and the Industry museum. Friendly staff. Close to the shore and it’s a quiet neighborhood. 

I would definitely stay here again. Just ask for fresh sheets and maybe a spare...",The sheets seemed like they weren’t clean.,"Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas: floors and carpet, towels and linens. Additional comments: “It didn’t seem like the bed had new sheets on it. Lots and lots of little black hairs all over and they didn’t seem too clean. ”."

The on site gated parking is excellent. Also you are minutes from all major attractions. Bring your own soap and shampoo for bathroom as none are provided. The only I had was the noise. You can hear extremely loud footsteps from the unit above, I mean really loud, and the unit on the same floor next to this unit. Shouting from someone upstairs one evening, and their washer/dryer you can hear. This was almost constant for my entire stay except for when the people were gone or sleeping. If you are bothered by this I would suggest looking elsewhere or bringing earplugs/ headphones. Otherwise great stay.",,"Long black hairs, kitchen counter, bathroom floor, shower stall"

Thank you for allowing me to stay in another one of your properties.  However I was a bit let down with this last property.  I would highly recommend checking out the area prior to listing and ensure that they’re actually as clean as listed because I found the bathroom and linen as well as the couch were not that clean.

For example:

The linen was not very clean as I am use too seeing or dealing with Zencity.  I noticed stains on the couch in the living room and stains and hair on the linen in the bedroom plus the bathroom was not that clean as well.  The tub had blonde hair in it as well as.

The rooms and bathroom were clean, and the apartment was attractively decorated.  Check in was a breeze!  There was a little confusion on my part about where to leave the keys at check out, but the Zencity team was proactive about communicating.

The only down side is that the building was unusually warm (other residents mentioned the same thing so it wasn’t just one apartment) and the mattress cover under the fitted sheet didn’t breathe, so we woke up sweating several times each night (wasn’t what I was expecting with nighttime temps in the 30’s).  The window AC’s worked fine, but if we closed the full length curtains to block out light in the bedroom most of the cold air was redirected toward the floor.  Eye masks solved the light problem but the bedroom still didn’t get cool enough to prevent some sweating, and the window AC made a moderate amount of noise.  I bet if the building wasn’t unusually toasty we wouldn’t have had a problem.","Thanks for hosting us in St. Louis!  Not sure why the building was so warm, but the window ACs were pretty straightforward to use.  If you could please be a little clearer in your email instructions about which table to leave the keys at for check out, that would be lovely!  I assumed it was the front desk but they had no idea what to do with the keys and eventually I just tried to put them back in the lockbox.","I’m not sure if y’all regularly wash the mattress cover, but it smelled slightly sweaty.  It also doesn’t breathe at all and the building was rather warm even with the window AC running, so we were waking up several times a night trying to cool off.

27957424,436650277,2019-04-13,153646644,Easlin,"Great space! Much larger than it looks in the photos and it has nice big windows with plenty of natural light. There is a HUGE closet that is not pictured. It’s walking distance from u of chicago and around the block from a number of restaurants. if you’re coming for quick visit you may have found the perfect place.

My main issue with this spot was the smell. There was a really awful sewage-y smell in the bathroom and the closet (and the odor changed throughout my stay, so I know whatever it was, it was “fresh”). 
The smell is easily contained in the bathroom/closet area by a door so I had no odor issues in the rest of the space.",,There is a really awful smell in the bathroom/closet area

38647250,548037532,2019-10-16,59793077,Rosella,This was a great space.  It was perfect for relaxing after a long day at a conference.  The host was quick to respond when I had issues with the internet.  They assisted the night I arrived to get my electronics connected and had the TV/Roku working when I returned the next day.  I would definitely stay here again and recommended to others.  Since I made this trip alone it was an surprising perk that this was in a gated apartment complex  which added an extra sense of safety.,This was a great space and perfect for what I needed.  Thanks for putting forward the  extra effort to assist me with getting in and the internet issue.,There were 2 used washcloths in the tray of the shower caddie.  They were from previous tenant.
27130315,429649561,2019-03-28,233374787,John,I would definitely recommend this place. Street parking is available for free if you can find a spot.,,Floors weren't as clean as it should be
39485075,599294734,2020-01-29,7652908,Jessica,"I was wowed by the price and style of this place!  The location was great. Check in great. The modern style great.  
But if you are particular about cleanliness, then DONT stay here. Hairs all over bathroom, shower, and rugs!  Like a lot!  And even pubic hairs.  The elevator was out so we had to carry our heavy ice chest up three flights of stairs. Won’t stay here again.",,"Lots of hairs all over bathroom, shower, rugs"
38647176,595751820,2020-01-20,36118718,Leanne,"Pros: The place is big and open.  2 bathrooms was nice.  
Cons: It hadn't been cleaned the best, I could see dirt on the rugs and floors.  Frozen beer in the freezer and beer was spilled all over the ice. I wasn't really concerned with any of that until they tried to make me pay a $398 fee for something on the rug.  I hadn't even been in the place but to sleep!  So consider yourself warned, they may try to blame something on you and get you to pay a ridiculous amount to replace it.",The spill wasn't mine. For you to say it was a stain and try to make me pay $398 is ridiculous.  Anybody could have cleaned that up. You should probably reconsider your cleaners.,Frozen beers exploded in freezer and carpets hadn't been vacuumed and floors hadn't been swept.
25983838,428729374,2019-03-25,44932372,Tamika,"Let's just say I love the location it was available to me the whole weekend when I totally did not expect it to be. Really nice quaint amenities were great, great location and I would definitely book this spot again",,Just a little dusty but understand if no one is in it for a week or so..
39485091,700435530,2020-10-14,307139373,Juan,"This might get long winded so bear with me. The first thing you’ll encounter is that the check in instructions to get in aren’t accurate. You’ll have to wait for someone to eventually leave for them to open the door to the hallway you need to get in to access the elevator. Once you overcome that hurdle, you’ll be let down when you walk into your room. The unit has a prominent smell of cigarette smoke. This is strictly a non smoking until so if you have health reasons or just want a smoke free room for comfort this place is probably not for you. If you are a smoker, you won’t be the first to smoke here and will probably get away with it by the look at the response that I got when bringing up this issue. The rug had bread crumbs/trash on it. The floors felt like there was a layer of grime on them. The comforter had a yellow stain on it. Speaking of stains, the bedroom and bathroom walls have stains that appear to be from bodily fluids. The shower floor was stained where one would typically stand while showering. Had to get one my hands and knees to scrub the shower floor so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out. Horrible water pressure in the shower by the way. The thermostat was locked so I couldn’t make it colder than 75 degrees. After I contacted the host about this issue it took them two days to lower it to 72 degrees. By then I had figure out a way to make it cooler, just gotta be a little creative. Another annoying thing was that the light switch for the kitchen also controlled the outlet where the tv was connected to. So you could only watch tv with a huge glare on it. Another workout was found for this issue. Got one of the two extension cords behind the couch and connected it the outlet in the room and ran it under the door. Unplug the tv from the outlet and take the cord out of the plastic cable hider to have enough slack to connect it to the extension cord. Another inconvenience was that the key fob they provided at first didn’t allow access to the parking lot or the roof. After the second day they did provide a secondary key that worked for everything but they didn’t request permission when dropping it off and just helped themselves in. Even though we weren’t in the room at the time, it’s common courtesy to ask when entering the until like other hosts and handy men have. It felt like a violation of our privacy and made us feel uneasy. Other than that the location was good and the aesthetics of the renovations were nice.","Please get rid of that awful smoke smell and do a deep cleaning. Update the check in instructions as well as the first key fob that was given since it doesn’t give access to the parking lot or the rooftop. Change the stained comforter and clean/repaint the stains on the walls. Give better access to the thermostat, 75 degrees is horrible to sleep in.",The worst out of a few things on this list was the horrible cigarette smoke smell. Despite being a non smoking unit the smoke smell was obnoxious and undeniably coming from the room. The building and halls didn’t smell like this until you went into the apartment unit. Had to go to the store and buy odor eliminator and air freshener. The rug in the living room had physical crumbs/trash on it. The couch was just simply dirty when we had to remove the cushion due to the remote falling in the crevice. The whole floors felt like there was a layer of grime on them. The shower floor was brown in the area where one would stand to shower. I had to get on my hands and knees and try to scrub out as much as I could so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out. The white comforter had a yellow stain on it. The walls in the bedroom and bathroom had stains that appeared to be bodily fluids when using a black light. The laminated card on the little chalk board that says “cleaned by” didn’t have a personnel name or a date. For all I know the place wasn’t cleaned before my stay.
39485040,580442055,2019-12-22,244930281,Jessica,Nice place! Decently clean,"Overall the place was really nice and clean.

Toilet, bathroom and kitchen sink did not drain, sewage/pipe water bubbles up from the kitchen sink, giving the unit a foul raw sewage smell. Toilet did not drain, so we were not able to go to the bathroom in the unit, a basic expectation for a habitable unit. We were told a plumber would arrive, but never did. Hosts demonstrated extreme negligence for a serious maintenance issue. Again, we arrived to the unit to these conditions.

Thanks!","I had to actually go out and buy a shower curtain liner for the bathroom.  It had mold and mildew on it.  And there was a lot of hair and dirt at the back of the tub that had to be cleaned.  The two stars reflect my having to leave the unit to purchase something for the unit.

It was 4 stars experience though  and I didn't want to leave not perfect review at all, but Chris specifically asked us to leave 5 star review, so...
Super easy check-in/check-out procedures. Rather spacious. Big smart TV with Netflix etc. Nice Neighborhood. Close to the bus and metro stops. Kitchen area was clean and surprisingly well equipped. 
Chris answered all of our questions quickly.
Floors in the rooms and bathroom could be cleaner. Bathroom needs several updates (broken toilet paper hanger, small chips in a sink etc)
Soundproof could also be better, it felt like our upstairs neighbors were giants with cases made of stone.
We weren't happy with the cleanliness of our bed linens, but Chris told us where we could find a new set (though he sounded a bit sceptical about that problem, I feel like I had to send pictures of every hair and mark, not just one). Comforter case needs washing ( huge yellowish stain) and we couldn't find extra comforter case in a new set of bed linens. It was the biggest problem for me.
But as I said it was nice apartment overall, good value for money.","Could be cleaner and also needs couple of updates, but overall it was nice apartment, thanks.","I already told about bed linens imperfections. Comforter needs washing( at least comforter case, it has huge yellowish stain right in the middle and we couldn't find any extra comforter case to replace it).

For cooking a few things, the kitchen is definitely well equipped: stove, fridge, freezer, toaster. I think a mixing bowl would be good though and perhaps a water cooker. I make tea every day...
If one comes to Chicago for the university, the location is great because the Campus is in walking distance. Unfortunately the supermarket close by just had closed (for good) when I arrived but there are possibilities to shop if one walks a bit.
One can take the train to Downtown, which takes 20-30 minutes to Millenium Building. That's quite good in Chicago. 
I really enjoyed the included Netflix and modern TV with couch for the evenings. So I would book it again!","Hi! I really loved my stay at the flat in Chicago. Thank you again for the good communication and for fixing the internet relatively quickly.
For me as a woman travelling alone, I would have felt a bit safer though, if one could lock the appartment from inside. The day the man from maintenance just showed up in the flat made me feel a little uncomfortable because I don't want someone to just enter the flat when I am perhaps changing or sleeping. I said that already that the communication on this could have been better, but I guess that came through.
Also: I know the building is quite old and this is not easy to work on, but the shower only from the top is not ideal.
And: it was quite hard to get a stable temperature in the flat, because the heating, when turned on, would heat like crazy and sometimes one couldn't properly switch it off. But I grew up in an old building like this, so I know it is quite difficult to do anything about that.
Thank you again for your hospitality!","Cups and plates were perfectly fine, but the drawer with knives and forks needed a little clean-up. Also: I find it great when there is a little bit of salt, pepper, oil, because that is really annoying to buy. But there was lots of food in the fridge. When I finally decided to take some of the ketchup I realised it was expired in summer 2017! It would be great if someone could check on those things. But I have to say: I hate throwing things away, so I think it is a good option to leave something for the next person. It just requires Zencity to check from time to time."

The bed was very soft and had an exceptionally warm comforter. Those may sound like good things, and for some people maybe they are, but the result for me was that every morning I woke up drenched in sweat and with severe back pain. Any amount of the comforter covering me would cause that part to sweat because it did not breath at all.

I would recommend immediately purchasing a firmer mattress and a more breathable comforter. I've stayed in many hotels and Airbnbs, and this is the worst sleeping experience I can remember.

The shower barely drained. I complained the very first night of a week-long stay, they said they'd ""filed a maintenance request"", and I never heard another word about it. Despite cleaning the incredible easy to clog drain grate twice myself (which was disgusting), I never managed to take a shower with less than 3 inches of water pooling at my feet. A disgusting way to start every day.

When my wife and I were first contacted by Chris we felt a bit misled since the apartment we stayed in is on the first floor, but this is not described anywhere. The only piece of info to indicate this is a photo of the balcony which seems to be more than a story up, but it’s in fact just a couple feet off the ground. As we are not very familiar with this city we would rather have been above the first floor, so this indication would be important for future guests.

Within 30 minutes of arriving we heard noise on the room adjacent and one above us. I gave it some time, but then contacted Chris when nothing changed. He responded that he has never had problems with noise, and was regretful that we are experiencing it. Peace and quiet are extremely important to me, and I did not find that here. I understand that in the city you’ll hear people outside/police cars, but there was little of that here. Constant banging from above and beside us. We could actually listen to conversations from people in both of these apartments. I’ve honestly never been to an Air BnB, or even hotel rather, that has been this loud.

Aside from those issues the apartment was very clean. All the appliances were working except for the water and ice dispenser on the fridge which isn’t a huge deal. Plenty of hot water, and good water pressure from the shower. A small addition that l enjoyed was the automatic soap dispensers in the bathroom and kitchen!

(This is my first negative Airbnb review; apologies.)","Please do not use existing cleaning product. It reeks of cheap chemicals, forced me to vacate room for long stretches, and never went away over the course of entire visit (and I'm not particularly sensitive to smell). 

Also note that fridge, even when unused and seemingly on a low setting, roars idly (both unpleasantly noisy and energy inefficient).

Last, pillows are about the cheapest you can find. Lumpy, synthetic, insubstantial.

Your place is great and we had a fantastic time!!!  I loved it! Only comment is for a deep cleaning (just a suggestion) and the Nest was very difficult to control.

However, the place has been  neglected, the furniture is uncomfortable, and it needs a very deep cleaning, paint touch ups and some repairs. I cannot recommend this place for future stays unless it is properly refreshed. At this time it's pretty obvious that Zencity is just maximizing the profit from renting the place out and is decidedly not focused on providing what I have come to expect from 40+ stays in various AirBnBs over the past 10+ years.","You really should take this place off the market until you do a very deep cleaning and touching up of the unit.

38793816,607243255,2020-02-17,46569820,Mark,"It's hard to write a review due to the unique circumstances of the stay. Apparently the night before we arrived the upstairs neighbor had some sort of a water leak which made its way down to our apartment. Now by no means do I fault Zencity for that - it's totally out of their control - but what confused me is that there was no communication about the issue until we showed up. So imagine my surprise when we open the door, there's a horrible odor coming from the kitchen, the heating was off (on a day that was 25 degrees), an industrial fan is blowing on the floor, and there's a mop and bucket sitting there with a strange liquid inside. Additionally, while sitting on couch a few minutes later, a man barged into the apartment (without knocking) and started asking me questions about the aforementioned water leak (which I still had no clue about at this point). Again, while I don't blame Zencity at all for the leak, I would have appreciated a heads up about the situation before I had arrived and more clarity on what was being done to clean it up.

Beyond that, the apartment was mostly as expected and advertised. Location was great - we walked to many restaurants, bars, and the Whole Foods. Unfortunately there was a horrible smell in the kitchen our entire stay which I assume stemmed from the leak.

We were able to have an air mattress delivered to make things more comfortable for our friend who was planning to sleep on the sofa bed. Also, temperature control was difficult. The downstairs would be very cold and the upstairs was very hot which made sleeping comfortably difficult. Finally, we were not made aware of the large ceiling issue in the kitchen.

However, be aware of issues involving parking and the neighborhood.","The parking situation and neighborhood are the downsides to this otherwise great space. It would be great if there was secured parking someplace the building or in a gated spot nearby. The sketchy people on the street at all hours of day/night, usually pan handling for money or making inappropriate comments about my wife, were not only annoying but a legitimate safety concern. Numerous times, police arrived at the gas station nearby. On one occasion in particular, the officer pulled up to us as we left for dinner asking if we had heard ""two shots"" in the past few minutes.

The fact that the kitchen light (overhead light) must be on at the same time the TV is on is very annoying from the angle one watches while sitting on the bed. Oh, and a couple things that would be over the top... 1) Provide coffee for that french press in the cupboard. ;-) 2) Provide a drain plug for a long hot bath... and maybe a rubber bath mat too since the service that refinished the iron tub left some grit in surface finish at the bottom.

39484967,587885468,2020-01-03,50746941,Jessica,I think this apartment would be best for business travelers.  Not ideal for holiday travel or light sleepers.,"Hi Zencity
There are a few things that lead me to believe the apartment wasn’t quite user ready.  
- the address was not correct.  I arrived very late after dark so this gave me a bit of anxiety when checking in.  
- it was very very cold in the apartment and it took quite a while for the temperature to rise
- the hot water runs out VERY QUICKLY.  My boyfriend took a very quick shower and i was not able to finish my shower afterwards before the hot water ran out.  
- I arrived very late and so went to bed with intentions of sleeping in.  Please note this trip was for personal vacation/holiday travel.  Because of the construction in the building, the fire alarm in the complex went off around 6:15 am.  It was VERY cold outside and I had to sit in the car until about 7:30 when the fire department was able to turn off the alarms.
- very loud construction noise continued the first morning until around 11am.  For a business trip this would have been fine but I was very unhappy about the noise because my plan was to have a relaxed vacation with lots of sleep.
- some how water is escaping the shower stall and runs all over the bathroom floor.  I have a photo of where the water seems to be coming from
- Thursday morning there were construction workers doing electrical work in a closet just across the hall from the apartment door.  The actual work did not create much noise at all BUT They had a boombox radio on very loud.  That is very inconsiderate. 
- constantly finding hair on the floors and couch was very unpleasant.  
- I kept my gym clothes on the floor in the closet.  When retreating them I found layers of saw dust all over my clothes because the baseboards had never been wiped off from the renovations. 

 I really didn’t like that the apartment unit door does not meet the floor.  There is a pretty wide space at least an inch between the floor and the door for cold air, noise, and if any pests or rodents are in the building they now have easy access to your apartment.  

Lastly,  I would have liked to know in advance that this until was in the basement of the complex and also a corner/garden until where all the windows are facing high foot traffic areas

It could be a nice 5 star rental but these details prevented me from having a seamless, relaxing stay.  More than happy to discuss if you have any other questions.","Building hallways were very dirty, building materials were sitting in the halls. Lots of hair on the floors, carpet, and area rug inside the unit.  There were layers of saw dust along baseboards inside the unit."
22265339,248057768,2018-03-30,179816848,Leiko,"Comfortable and a great view. The area is more business-oriented rather than neighborhood-y. There aren't many cafes or cool restaurants right nearby, but it's nice to be on the river and you can Uber to more charming neighborhoods. It's in a high-rise building so you can't open the windows, which may be an issue for some. The building has very nice concierge service. The bed was very comfortable.

22265266,246890119,2018-03-26,174950954,Demond,"My trip started well yet ended unpleasantly. Chris is responsive via email. The unit gets good natural light and the minimalist decor is nice. But when I got locked out of the unit, he was no help. I asked him to provide a number to maintenance and he didn't. Luckily someone saw me helpless and standing in the hallway for over an hour and told me whom to call. The building maintenance staff had to drill and remove the lock, but they finally let me in. I was locked out for over two hours. I prefer to leave more positive reviews, but I want to be honest and help others so that you don't have my same experience. I feel that leaving this negative review may result in my receiving a negative review from the host. But I am ok with this because my review may help other potential guests. I prefer to be honest and transparent. The much longer version is below. The positives: The unit has so much natural light. The unit is a corner unit so there are lots of windows. The unit's minimalist decor is nice too. Chris was responsive via email. When I told him about a mildew-like odor in the unit, he sent three people to check on the odor. However, none of them were able to fix it. The area rug in the bedroom reeked of the mildew smell, so I folded it and placed it in the closet. I decided to check out early because the odor was too strong. Even one of his staff confirmed the foul odor. Chris let me me check out after 11 am, which I appreciated. When I told him that I wanted a refund for the remaining nights, he messaged me, ""I am happy to refund you the remaining portion of your stay, however, I ask that you leave a positive review. I have hosted many guests here and have not had an odor issue before. If that is acceptable to you, I will have Airbnb cancel the remaining portion of your stay and issue the refund."" I found this odd because reviews should be honest. And I responded that I would leave an honest review. I previously emailed Chris that the key to the unit wasn't working properly to unlock the deadbolt. And guess what? I ended up getting locked out of the unit right before I checked out. In desperation, I emailed him repeatedly and asked for a number to his staff or maintenance. He would not provide any phone number and his response was to jimmy the lock. Chris did not offer any support beyond jimmying and playing with the lock. After finally finding a phone number to the building manager, two maintenance staff drilled and removed the lock from the door. Luckily, this happened during the daytime. What if this happened at night? I might've been stranded. Chris never emailed to see if I got in. I do not see myself renting...",,Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas: strong odor.

PROS: Amazing location - 5 minute walk to cute restaurants and bars, cute apartment, super comfortable bed, quick responses from Zencity, apartment lobby staff were so nice and helpful. 

CONS: Shower was dirty and didn't drain. Had long black hairs on the shower wall and tub floor. Stood in 3 inches of water while I showered. When I brought it up to Zencity they said ""thanks for your feedback, we'll inform the cleaning service"" and never apologized. 
Parking was not ideal and was not described accurately in the listing. The listing states ""no on-site parking"". What it doesn't list is that your options are street parking or garage parking. Street parking is impossible to find and is not always free. We NEVER found street parking. Garage parking is $15 per night. So, be prepared to pay for your parking. Guests should know this before booking, and it was pretty deceiving on the listing. When I brought this up to Zencity, they said that they do state ""free parking is available off-site, but they will work on making it more clear in the listing"". Know that finding free parking is about like finding a winning lottery ticket, so, although it may be ""available"", you probably won't find it.

OVERALL: Parking and shower aside, we really did love our stay. The location is top notch and the apartment was really nice. However, I'm not sure we'd stay here again.",,"Apartment overall was clean and tidy, but the bathroom was not cleaned, particularly the shower.

It lacks the basic necessities like tissues paper, aluminum foil, saran wrap, foot towel, coffee & tea.  Your tea kettle is broken.  We couldn’t make hot water for our tea.   The foot rug in the bathroom didn’t look clean so we didn’t want to dry our feet on it.  We loved your foam mattress so much that we’ll buy two for our home.  Thank you","Bathroom floor, shower curtain, soap dish & rug"

1. No books of instructions so I couldn’t work TV - and when I informed Chris he just said sorry - didn’t bring it
2. You are actually facing multiple train rails- loudy
3. Close neighborhood not interesting nor feels good to walk around
4. Kitchen dirty with no essentials - salt/ knife 

Overall disappointing- I am sure Airbnb didn’t mean for this impersonal attitude","It was very insulting for you not to react to the fact that I had no explanation book - no way to work tv
You were notified - but did nothing about it","Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas: dust, kitchen. Additional comments: “Greasy cultry ”."

The only thing was there was a weird odor in the apartment building (not the apartment itself). Also there was a wine glass that had a lipstick stain on it as though it hadn’t been washed.

We appreciated having Netflix available after a long day of exploring the city. Check in was very easy and the building is pretty cool. There is a bus stop right in front of the door for easy access to green and red lines, but on the nicer mornings we opted for a quick 30 minute walk to the green line. Neighborhood feels safe and has great restaurants, coffee, grocery store, and Walgreens within a 10 minute walk. Last time I was in Chicago I stayed downtown and it was very loud at night. This neighborhood is much quieter and it only takes 30 minutes to get downtown via transit, and 15 with Lyft/Uber.

Otherwise the neighborhood is uninteresting- but most people don't come to Hyde Park for the neighborhood.,"Hi Chris, the place was pretty much as described and served us well. I reviewed it as we found it. However, I must say, I was a bit put off by the request for a 5-star review as this really distorts the information that is given to other renters (like me).

Overall, a good place to stay in a pretty convenient area. Would recommend.","Thanks for the quick responses on our issues. The space was really nice and comfortable. 
We were really unhappy on our first morning, especially with all of the warnings about noise levels, decibel readers, and quiet hours only to find that our upstairs neighbors clearly had an after bar party from 4:30-6:00 AM. 
I don’t want to leave a bad review, because most of the experience was good, but the noise and the bathroom situation was less than ideal. 
Just honest feedback. Thanks for letting us stay.","As I had mentioned, the cloudy, standing water in the clogged shower was really gross and off-putting. It led me to believe that the shower floor had not been cleaned between guests. The toilet seat was really loose and wobbly (like, extremely) , so my husband tightened that and plunged the shower drain, which was quite gross."

I located those AFTER I purchased paper plates and cups. The living room and bathroom needed to be cleaned, as it hadn’t been swept, and there was long brown hair in the tub. On my last day, I cleaned the entire apartment and washed the linens, as I assumed I needed to because the apartment hadn’t been cleaned after the previous guests. I came out to find that my car had been towed. It hadn’t been specified by the host nor in the listing that parking is PRIVATE and paid for by residents.

This is an excellent location, a cool suite, all at a great rate.","Bedroom: The grey throw and pillows on the bed are worn, dingy, and dirty long.

I immediately pulled back the comforter to check the sheets, which were crisp, clean and smelled wonderful. Get rid of or update the throw and pillows for a better first impression.
Kitchen: The top of the fridge needs to be cleaned. It is a compact fridge with the top being visible and there is a thick layer of dust on it. Again, a bad first impression. The rest of the kitchen was clean and up to par."

The skyline view from the 9th floor of the Chicago high rise building was spectacular! The price was phenomenal when compared to using a traditional hotel.

The bottom bins also needed some cleaning as they both were soiled. I took photos just in case these areas were an issue once we checked out. I didn’t want to be blamed for the uncleanliness.

I address the issue with Chris and she had the maintenance guy to come over the following day so that he could drain the tub’s drainage.  I also cleaned up some the areas of the tub that had some hair and dust around the top of the tub.  It wasn’t major just some areas that I noticed that needed to be cleaned.

I went ahead and cleaned it up and found a glob of hair in the shower’s drain.  Which was part of the reasoning of the tub’s slow drainage.  I would highly recommend purchasing a cover for the bathtub’s drainage system (i.e. Danco Perfect Match Tub Hair Catcher).  

This way it catch any excessive amounts of hair.  Plus help in cutting down your cleaning time."

24454493,326616781,2018-09-22,1337092,Mawiah,"Needed a place to stay in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood, unexpectedly. Was delighted to find this listing as the location was perfect.

PROS: Centrally located, on a quiet block, in a great neighborhood. It is a two block walk to 53rd street which has many stores and restaurants, including a Target. This listing also has an in-unit washer and dryer, with detergent and bleach provided. There was a smoothie blender, coffeemaker, french press, and all the basic kitchen utensils. Salt, pepper, and cooking spray were also provided. The unit was well stocked with toliet paper, paper towels, and cleaning supplies. The space was large, uncluttered and easy to maneuver. The bed was well made, comfortable, and provided a good night's rest. The tub had Jacuzzi style jets.

CONS: The listing was not as clean as one would like. There was a thick layer of dust on all the light fixtures, the fire extinguisher, and the windows. The hardwood floor, in the kitchen area, was gritty. There was a large spider in the corner of the bedroom, to the right and above, the bed. There were two large water? bugs in the shower. The tub was discolored, which made it look dirty. When a $68 a night listing is almost doubled in price because of a $42 cleaning fee, one expects things to be clean. In addition to the regular and expected displeasure from finding a rented space in this state, it was doubly bad for us because my partner has asthma. She had to go find a cafe while I cleaned the unit of dust, before she could come back in.

Over all this was a nicely appointed space that would be perfect for up to 3 people to stay in for as long as was needed. The convenience of an in-unit washer and dryer really set it apart, above, and beyond.

It would be a four star listing if it had been properly cleaned and was a little less expensive. As it was, I give this unit 3.5 stars.",Whomever is doing your cleaning at this location is not doing a great job. Otherwise the space was lovely and just what we needed.,"Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas: dust, shower, bugs, floors and carpet.

We really appreciated the detailed instructions for check in, the spacious layout, and a comfortable bed. 

We had a few issues that I've mentioned elsewhere, that made our stay a bit below a 5* experience for the price (we do appreciate that it was an extra pricey weekend everywhere due to the conference). I did want to mention that considering you have lockbox entry, I felt a bit stressed having to advise exactly when we'd be checking in, on top of fairly rigid timing in the first place, plus then you didn't respond back once I tried to offer multiple best answers possible. With no context/response, I couldn't tell if there was an issue, or if this was just a gentle inquiry. On the whole, our experience was solid and our public review will reflect that.

It’s about a $15-$20 Uber to downtown.  
It seems like a very safe and friendly neighbourhood.

There were just a lot of little things that caused me to not enjoy it 100%.

18432699,164307513,2017-06-26,9710624,Rhett,This unit is very much a corporate rental as opposed to staying in someone's home and rather sparsely furnished but all in all it fit the bill for a nice long weekend. Chris and team were easy to communicate with and the building has a lot of amenities and is centrally located in North Loop. ,"Thanks again for the stay Chris. I previously mentioned the coffeepot and construction noise issues. Beyond that...

We would stay here again! Thanks so much Chris for a great stay. ","Thanks so much! We appreciate the stay! The location was wonderful and we had a great time. My one piece of advice for future guests is just maybe to freshen up a little just before guests come. The apartment seemed clean overall, just a little musty/dusty when we first arrived.

Chris responds to your questions in a timely manner. There is an instruction manual that helps explain everything. 

Cons: The unit could have been cleaner. We found old socks on the kitchen floor and next to the bed; dust on top of the refrigerator and on shelves; woodwork around doors and base boards are dirty; I found a half empty pop bottle on the window sill next to the bed. Water pressure is low (maybe it was just on our weekend) and I went to take a shower and the diverter wouldn't stay up, thus no water came up through the shower head. No showers this weekend!

Pros
- Location, this is a great spot in Lafayette park, it is very close to nearby restaurants and a Coffee shop if you want to walk. I visited Bellwether, Polite Society, Planters House and Park Ave. Coffee all via walking. Likewise, close to downtown, a short uber ride away from stadiums and Washington Ave.
- Overall Value, the nightly rate I paid made this place totally worth it. 
- Secure Parking! - This is a rare find, parking in STL City is often precarious as you have to totally empty out your car. Not so here, was so nice to have the gated lot. 
- Recently built out interior from an old factory, it's nice and new on the inside. 

Cons
- The Floors were simply not clean 
- Window shades are more like sun shades and won't keep light out at night. 
- Walls are thin, can hear neighbors and can hear Televisions on from the Hallway 
- The listing implied the Roof Deck was open, it was under construction while I was there, it was not yet complete. 
- One of the most concerning things I experienced was a leak in my unit during my stay. It rained on the last night and was leaking from the ceiling down to the floor. I chalk this up to the new construction, it wasn't the worst thing in the world, but kind of annoying. I was very thankful this was not in the bedroom.",,"The place appeared to be generally clean upon arrival. Once I was there for a bit, I noticed the floors were very dirty, as though they hadn't been properly swept and mopped, the coffee table was covered in a layer of dust and the bathroom showed dirt not he dark gray tile."

We also found crumbs under the couch cushion as well as a condom wrapper and small trash under the sofa and bed.

In this private note, I just wanted to let you know that after maintenance came in a couple of times, the floor of the kitchen was dirty, dust and wood chips were on the ground and few boot footprints (not muddy).

Check-in was super easy, and the host was very accomodating to our last-minute booking. We highly recommend this apartment!","Thank you for allowing us to stay in your apartment. The apartment itself was amazing, and the location was perfect, but we did find it to be a bit spartan as far as furnishings, comfort and decor. We would have loved to have a couch that was comfortable enough to actually sit and watch TV, and maybe another comfy place to sit in the window in the next room, instead of a room devoted entirely to a record player that doesn't work and doesn't even have speakers attached to it. A few more (and larger) wall hangings and pops of color would help the place to feel less sterile. But the location was perfect, and the price was very reasonable.

I got into rental property place at roughly 1AM and was told by the staff I was not on the list of guests by Zencity to be staying in the apartment for the night. I showed them my airbnb reservation along with my receipt of payment. The rental property staff tried contacting Zencity where they said they were being answered and then told they would get back into contact with them before getting hung up. It took until 4AM for them to get back into contact to let the rental property know that I was approved. I had a meeting this morning in Chicago that I only got 3 hours of sleep for. I leave Chicago Saturday morning and now my trip is ruined because I am exhausted from last night. I had paid for a service that was not met, I had planned and notified them of a late arrival and was told it would be ok.

However if you’re staying awhile I would suggest bringing more dishes and silverware!,Thanks so much for hosting us! We had a great time,Shower looked like it hadn’t been cleaned
22804115,492841741,2019-07-21,94271826,Megan,"Very cute place to rent and stay.  Bedrooms were very nice and comfortable.  Good neighborhood with lots of good eats around.  Quick walk to L to downtown, good bars near the area as well.",,"No toilet paper on roll when we arrived and dirty cup of sunflower seeds found on windowsill.  Towels still in dryer. Also the fans don't work in the entire place, if they are on you can't turn them off and if they are off can't turn them on."
40483459,592213464,2020-01-12,324350942,Catherine,"Location was convenient, apartment was furnished well for a weekend stay, however - if you are staying here during the winter either the heat doesn’t work or was broken during my stay...uncomfortably cold in the apartment the whole time at 59*.",My only issues were the excessive crumbs/etc in living room & kitchen and then no response on the heat. Either the heat was broken or doesn’t work - if it doesn’t work it would be nice to know that before staying there in the winter...it was snowing during my stay and very cold. Making the inside temperature of the apartment very uncomfortable at 59*.,"There were a lot of crumbs on the rug in the living room, as well as the kitchen floor...the rest of the air b&b was clean"
19788566,222406570,2017-12-29,60114947,Carla,"The place is big and nice and has a good potential. We did have some problems though, to start with a problem getting into the apartment. The caretaker (not owner) was unwilling to come and assist when the key box was not working. After 1.5 hours we got in as the owner picked us up. Sheets were dirty and floors needed vacuuming. This was fixed though rather fast after we pointed it out. The kitchen was nice and modern but missed many amenities and cooking equipment, broken glassware , one wine glass, no wine opener etc. The apartment is missing chars so not all can sit around the dining table and eat. Bed covers and towels were too few.
Although it cannot be expected we could not get 1 hour extension on checkout. 
All in all we did have a good time at the place but a lot of time and trouble went with the issues that needed to be solved. Again the apartment is nice, newly renovated etc but currently not worth the high price.","The place could become really nice with smoother checkin, fixing the lack of amenities (kitchen items, chairs, towels, bed covers to mention some). In the current condition though we didn't feel it was worth the money.","Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas: floors and carpet, towels and linens. Additional comments: “Bed linens were dirty and the floors had visible dust and other items lying around.”."

After a 9-hour flight with a toddler, this was the last think we expected: Zencity simply forgot to clean the place. When we called, no apology was given and we had to grab sheets from another unit and do laundry of some of the existing sheets. Nobody came for an exceptional cleaning (the cleaner came the next day for a mediocre cleaning job) and we had to shower in dirty bathrooms (hairs on the floors, in bathtubs and toilets). Quite unfortunate as the place is nicely located with a great view. Also, no reply was received regarding our request on reimbursement of the cleaning aand service fees. As a result, I do not recommend Zencity’s services.",Unfortunately we cannot say we enjoyed our stay and will not be able to recommend your services to friends.,Upon arrival we quickly notices the whole place had not been cleaned.
39485040,620941313,2020-03-26,138561396,Kenleigh,Check in code was incorrect but got a very quick response from management to fix the issue. I always stay here when I come to STL and will continue,,There were a lot of hairs in the bathroom that weren’t mine
40483452,610612690,2020-02-24,28828597,Laura,"Great place to stay, super close to the down town action! The only thing is that the first bedroom when you walk in has a large window that looks into the apartment (the only source of natural light for that room) and there are no blinds or curtains. So everyone in the kitchen can see into your room haha",The place was great! But I would for sure add some curtains or something for the bedroom you can see into from the kitchen. Thanks!,A towel hook had fallen off and was lying on the floor with paint and drywall (before we got there) there were large scuffs on the walls.
27130224,620554058,2020-03-22,341827884,Austin,Great location nice building,Thank you for hosting us in this time of unknown.,"Apartment was mostly clean except oven was smoking, I believe there is-caked on grease that causes the oven to smoke when it’s turned on. Bath tub also was coming apartment."

18432699,614546323,2020-03-05,169380812,Taeja,I loved this space the view was amazing! The place is very much a home away from home! Super comfortable and would definitely stay again!,The view was amazing! I absolutely loved the downtown view!,Shower wall grout lines
42102965,619173463,2020-03-16,78325458,Amy,Great apartment in a great location!,,Smelly trashcan
29386356,494125006,2019-07-23,216146287,Livi,Great location. Cleanliness needs a lot of work.,I’m extremely disappointed by lack of cleaning. The amount of dirt & debris is unacceptable.,"At first glance everything was fine there needs to be more attention to detail. Floors were not swept or vacuumed adequately, there were Plastic beads all over the common space from a previous guest. We swept the space ourselves it was so gross feeling. $130 cleaning fee is a joke."
