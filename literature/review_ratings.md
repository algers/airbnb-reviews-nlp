Distinctive attributes of Airbnb whencompared with hotels were pets, atmosphere, flexibility, value for money, quality assurance, the need toclean the place before check-out, pressure to write good reviews, sharing room amenities with strangers,and accessibility for disabled people [35].

A study of American and Finnish peer-to-peer guests foundtwo distinctive factors that drive the use of such accommodation options: social appeal, and economicappeal [40]. Social appeal refers to the desire to interact with the host who is most likely to be a local.Thus, guest–host interactions provide the opportunity for guests to ask for recommendations andguidance. On the other hand, the economic appeal is simply the price competitiveness that Airbnboffers when compared to hotels. Authenticity was found to be another significant contributor to theunique Airbnb experience. The exposure to local hosts, staying at a local residential home, and gettinga local’s recommendations on local attractions helps form the perception of authenticity, which is foundto offer that unique experience appeal  [41–43].


Both social appeal and authenticity highlighted the integral role of the host in fostering the Airbnb experience. In contrast to hotels where service interactions are often faceless, Airbnb guests usuallydevelop a much closer relationship with the hosts.   The interaction with the host starts from theinformation search stage because unit descriptions are usually written by the host. Bookings are thenconfirmed by the host, and all subsequent communications will also be with the same person. Previous research has also been found to empirically support the role of hosts in online text reviews. An analysis of over one million Airbnb reviews in New York City found that hosts were prominently featured asa topic of discussion [17].  Similarly, the host was one of the four themes among Airbnb reviews of properties in Sydney [26]. In contrast, reviews analyzed using topic modeling of hotel accommodations on three prominent online travel agencies did not find a host to be among the topics of discussion [18].Likewise, reviews on TripAdvisor of various hospitality sectors also yielded no topic related hosts [19].Hence, Airbnb hosts are both critical and unique in the peer-to-peer accommodation experience

Topics  related  to  listing  management  and  hosts  are  unique  to  peer-to-peer  accommodationexperiences.  While the vast variety of accommodation options is an advantage, the challenge is toestablish trustable and accurate listing descriptions. Listing accuracy has been discussed in the contextof online travel agencies before but the issues do not feature as prominently among hotel guests [64].Closely linked to listing management is communication with the host. Specifically, the responsivenessof the cost and flexibility. Superficially, hosts and hotel staffmay be thought of as playing the samerole. However, in the Airbnb context, interactions with hosts started from the information searchingstage until the end of the experience. The relationships are forged over a much longer period and aremore in-depth. Thus, it is no surprise that topics related to the hosts featured prominently in manypeer-to-peer experience research [27,31,35,40,42]. Consequently, social interaction with local people isclosely related to the perception of authenticity. Thus, marketers and hosts could use this element as akey differentiator in their marketing materials



Thus, the topic affective evaluation extracted from Airbnb reviews showed a levelof consistency with prior research findings. The topic of perceived value is also a commonly foundconstruct in prior studies [69,70].  Lastly, the topic of evaluation of hosts has been consistent withprevious findings among peer-to-peer accommodation experience, while not sharing this similaritywith hotels [17,38,40]. Arguably, the discussions about Airbnb hosts and hotel staffcould be consideredidentical, however, the difference is due to the context and how the communication is established


Peer-to-peer  accommodation  hosts  can  learn  from  the  research  findings  in  that,  althoughreviews  are  written  during  the  post-trip  stage,  the  content  and  sentiments  reflect  not  only  thetrip and post-trip, but also the pre-trip as well (e.g., communication with the hosts, etc.). Therefore,any hosts of peer-to-peer accommodation should not only focus on delivering quality service onlybetween checking-in to checking-out but from pre-trip to post-trip. In other words, listing accuracy,comprehensiveness, and completeness are not just important attributes leading to overall satisfactionbut can also attract more prospective guests.

"what Airbnb Reviews can tell us an advance dlatent aspect rating"
Both luxury hotels and Airbnb hosts must design the customer experience to deliver their hospitality products/services with a focus on the customer perspective (Bharwani & Jauhari, 2013). Providers cannot view the customer experience as a static or passively, provider-designed entity. Rather, customer experience is a personal, dynamic, and proactive co-creation built by hosts and guests alike in unique, real-time service encounters (Neuhofer, Buhalis, & Ladkin, 2014).



Currently, online reviews left by customer could be accessed for an extensive variety of product/service categories, including experience goods (e.g., videos) and search goods (e.g., cellular phones) (Ye, Li, Wang, & Law, 2014). These reviews offer users information not only about products and services, but also about the post-consumption experience (e.g., value for money, quality, and overall judgement).



This figure lists the aspects with the emotions most expressed by customers, obtained from the ABSA. For example, it was found that customers often experienced the mixed sentiment of joy and surprise (nearly 50/50) with the communication aspect, whereas the experience aspect was highly associated with the emotion of surprise. 



For example, for the aspect of communication, sometimes anger about potential fees and a sense of disconnection between the host and the guest was expressed in the reviews and was therefore extracted. Furthermore, customers often expressed disgust if their hosts abandoned them after arrival or payment, as well as when guests had to cancel their reservations. It was also noted that customers typically expressed sadness in their reviews when they felt that their complaints weren’t resolved by hosts, and that customers reviewing product/service often expressed anger when their listing facilities were inconvenient. Finally, insufficient cleanliness of listings was frequently acknowledged by customers in their reviews with the expression of fear.

 However, generally it was found that customers preferred to rate experience higher than other lodging aspects, because of the unique experiences that customers obtain from their stays with Airbnb.

 Specifically, customers value the aspects of location and experience more than any other lodging aspects.


 Within the aspect of communication, “fee” and “cancel” were found to be the key words that were most salient to customers

 Although product/service was found to be the least important aspect to customers, based on the reviews, hosts should nonetheless pay close attention to issues such as cleanliness and Internet reliability. 


 Certain positive key words were mentioned in relation to each aspect with issues such as hosts’ responses to customer questions and host resolution of customer problems, both of which were found to be the points that elicited positive emotions in customers. Thoughtful suggestions and special services provided by hosts are important considerations in developing customer experience improvements. Prompt action that fulfills customers’ needs and resolves problems during the stay; friendliness and smiling; and being readily available to help are all ways for hosts to increase the positive feelings of customers. Reasonable pricing within various customer segments can also contribute to customers’ positive attitudes about accommodations. 


 However, these studies have proven the critical role of complex emotions in customer rating behavior. Thus, the findings from this study empirically underscore the influence of different emotion levels according to various lodging aspects on customers’ rating behavior formation and extend an empirical understanding of customer experience

By comparing aspects between those extracted from customer reviews and those provided by the Airbnb website, this study highlighted the importance of identifying the correct lodging aspects in order to provide valuable information that customers pursue. Based on the findings, it was determined that location and experience are the two lodging aspects about which customers are most concerned. Since customers seek the experience of “living like a local” in certain desired neighborhoods, the results reveal that location is particularly important in terms of the five lodging aspects and how they shape customer ratings of listings.



 For listings located in less desirable areas, it is important for hosts to market their offerings by describing convenient area transportation. Features such as parks, bodies of water, airports, and trains are also highly important to travelers evaluating sharing accommodations.




 Value is the third most important aspect that matters to customers. From the in-depth ABSA, it was found that, while customers care about price, they are more concerned with whether or not a listing meets their expectations or is worth the money spent on the accommodation. Thus, hosts should pay close attention to providing cost-effective listing settings and services. With regard to the aspect of product/service, since the majority of customers rent an entire room or apartment, as long as the required facilities are provided by the host (e.g., bathroom, towels, kitchen, and cooking equipment) customer are less concerned about this aspect.


 In the same vein, renting an individual room or apartment limits opportunities for communication between host and guest during a stay. However, customers are considerably concerned about pre-sale communication.  



In addition, sharing accommodation hosts should take immediate action to address reviewers’ distress as conveyed in reviews before such customers become increasingly disillusioned.


**According to the service recovery paradox, customers give higher rating to a hotel if it successfully addresses its failures than they would if perfect service had been provided in the first place (Kau & Wan-Yiun, 2006). **

Specifically, on Airbnb, fewer reviewers care about service as opposed to experience.



The importance of experience and communication play an important role when customers evaluate their experiences staying in sharing accommodations. From this logic, sharing accommodation platforms should add more information about other customers’ experiences, and describe more of the local customs and activities. For sharing hosts, it is essential to have more and exceptionally positive interactions with guests
