627353853,Great place to stay
618658345,its in a great neighborhood and close to a lot of cool places  theres quite a big price jump at the end of checking out so be a bit weary of that  also the heater was not working as well as the couch outside near the heater not being the cleanest  the street parking seems to be free but its a bit confusing on when you can use it   obviously the weekend is fine  but during weekdays we werent so sure  other than that I had a great stay here and would love to come back with some things being closer paid attention to  just pay a little closer attention to detail  the guests before me I assume had leftover food in the microwave  the shower had quite a bit of mildew on the wall  as well as that weird older piece having some  the bathtub was missing a knob so I didnt feel comfy using it  it would be nice if the heater outside worked as well as the couch being a little cleaner so it was more useable  also the odd price jump to almost double was a bit disheartening and im not sure why it happened  other than that its in a great neighborhood and close to a lot of things that were very handy  I would love to stay back here with some improvements and a better understanding in the change of price  thank you  the price about doubled when I checked out  wasnt sure why especially with there being some knicks and dings on the walls  as well as not having a working heater outside that we assumed was in working condition
616427415,Our stay in this place was supposed to be a joyful one  We came for a few days to celebrate my daughters birthday  This place is very close to Barnes hospital which made it a perfect location to get together   It was very disappointing from the beginning  The bathroom was not cleaned and full of hair from the previous guest  A set of dirty linens was thrown in the closet if bedroom number one and in bedroom number   the linens were full of hairs  The companys response was slow and unapologetic and they did nothing to remediate the situation  We had to buy our own sheets  The next day they came to clean but  in spite of our request  they did not leave toilet paper  Avoid this place at all cost  The WiFi was not working  The username and password was incorrect The unit was not cleaned after the previous guest left  The linens were not changed and the bathroom was full of hairs from the previous guest  We had to buy our own toilet paper The host kept avoiding the issue of dirty linens and bathroom  They insisted that we make the bed with a non existing spare set of linens  Actually there were dirty linens crumpled up in the closet  A clean space and a more responsive host  We will never again stay with this company 
624952307,good for the value Cabinet
669395024,I had a Great stay felt secure comfortable and was also convenient  Very nice location even though it is near the train it was not too noisy Need a new stopper for the bathtub  Overall had a great Stay and felt secure and it was convenient to everything
441243680,GREAT place to stay  Very clean and has everything you need  Responsive hosts too  Thanks for being a great host and being so accommodating  Bathroom was great  But there was an issue with the toilet and the fact that maintenance wasnt available was the only down side
617317015,Stay away  These places are not clean like they are said to be  I have videos and photos on my phone of how nasty the rooms were  I had   different rooms  Also  my wallet and license and ID along with   bank cards of mine were stolen from my room  I was the only one I my room besides Zencitys house maid  I spoke with Marty who is   of the owners of the apartment and he had a total attitude and did NOTHING about my things  He was suppose to call me back but after waiting for his call for almost a week I decided to call him back just for him to not even remember who I was  That showed right there that he didnt give a damN about my items missing from my room with only his personnel having access to my room    Makes me wonder if they go around scamming   frauding people  I will never stay in ZenCity properties again  I will also tell my friends   family to avoid them as well  So much  too frustrated to write  Bathtub wasnt clean  Inside of microwave wasnt clean  The refrigerator wasnt clean neither was the bed sheets blanket or the hangers  So much more besides an unclean room has made this the trip from hell  Today is Friday  I have literally been waiting on a call back from Zencity since Monday March  TH  Ive made at least    calls to them and even spoketo someone named Marty who was suppose to call me back on Monday as well and I still have yet to hear from him  My wallet  license and ID stolen from the room yet I was there alone  The only person that had access was the cleascleancleaning lady or maid so she called herself  After my wallet was stolen from the room I left my ID in the room hidden since it was the only identification I had left   when I checked out of the room I accidentally left it in there  The same day I went to get it but the security at del prado werent allowed to let me in to get my ID so I called Zencity management and spoke to Marty  Owner Manager  letting him know the cleaning guy for the apt was right across the street cleaning another apt   if he could give him the okay to go in the unit I rented and he said NO  After he asked me exactly where I left my ID and he said no theres nothing he can do     I believe he could be using my information   committing fraud  I just dont understand why he wouldnt let the cleaner in so I could get my stuff  I will NEVER stay in any ZenCity properties again  I will also let my friends and family know to NEVER stay in them as well  I also took videos with my phone on how filthy the place was and I had   different rooms  They both were dirty  The location was fiNe  A clean apartment and honestly a few more things Im just to frustrated to write about right now 
596072465,Great but parking was tight 
615273114,It was an alright stay  Location is fantastic  but could have had better amenities and the cleaning lady was still there after check in  The lady responsible for cleaning the place was still in there around     pm when the check in time was  pm  Not the biggest of issues  but does cause doubt and concern in the place  Better amenities 
438842802,Overall  the location is great and there were plenty of restaurant options  especially cafe like restaurants   I do not recommend staying here if you are not willing to pay for parking  It was hard to find a free spot and the meters are only for   hours at a time  My friends and I stayed one night and we got a very close spot through Spot Hero for     for a full day  It is a good space for a quick stay that is close to the city  but not in the midst of the hustle and bustle  Zencity    I think you property was in a great area and the check in was flawless  We felt very safe and we thank you for keeping up communication with us and responding to our needs  We ended up finding parking and working it out with you all and Airbnb  but I really feel that free parking should not be included as an amenity option  The rooms and kitchen were really clean  but the common areas just missed the mark for us     Thank you for letting us stay  it was a pleasure   Parking description was misleading and could be elaborated on for future guests   The furniture and the rug in the common area was not completely clean  there were small hairs  and residue on the window area and table  not wiped down   In the bathroom  the shower lining curtain was a little dirty  Couch could have been vacuumed and touched up a little more as well  Cleaner common areas for a fee thats more than the rental price 
617006922,For the price this was an excellent place  if a little sparse  Hyde Park is a great neighborhood  lots of amenities nearby including a Whole Foods a few minutes away  On our second day there was a crew who let themselves in to replace the air filter  This caught us off guard and I wish the hosts had communicated with us regarding this beforehand    Parking is not a problem if you get there in the middle of the day while people are off at work  We got there pretty late and had to park in the buildings overpriced parking garage      overnight   but moved our car afterwards to street parking    Overall this was a nice stay and Zencity were good communicative hosts  Would recommend  Thank you so much 
611314369,I checked in after      PM as I was instructed  However  the apartment was still a mess when I walked in because the cleaning lady was still working in the apartment  Need to improve your internal communications between the host and the cleaning service   A window blind did not work   The room was still being cleaned when I checked in  at     PM   The cleaning lady said she was not aware of a check in on the apartment  She spent almost another    minutes to finish the cleaning  I received a message from the host that the apartment was being  touched up  because it was unoccupied for a while  I did not really care who was telling the truth  but I was disappointed when walking in the apartment that was still messy as it was being cleaned  Dishwasher was still running when I checked in
626688366,Great location  overall good apartment  but bathroom needed some maintenance before we got there   Just wish the bathroom didnt smell  The bathroom smelled like sewage and we had to close the door to the bathroom or else the whole apartment stank  Kitchen had some half used food supplies from previous occupants  clean bathroom
435834050,Spacious apartment with bonus bathroom off the bedroom and lots of closet space  Found parking right out front of the building which was great    minute walk to the train station  Very nice neighborhood  Bed was comfy and the tv had everything on Roku that you could imagine  Had a great stay    Little bit of hair in the shower 
434319501,This is a lovely apartment with a wonderful view   The elevators in the building  however  are not all working but they get you there with some wait   There is no parking on premises but mostly its fine to park on the street  Would have loved to give this a   star but couldnt because the kitchen is ridiculously under provisioned  Only two forks  two knives   Not a salad or mixing bowl to make a salad  I had to use a pot  One small limp towel to dry  Worst provisioned kitchen in all my AirBNB stays  and that includes a disappointing stay in Istanbul  The kitchen is ridiculously under provisioned  Two forks  Two knives   Not a salad or mixing bowl to make a salad   No cleaning liquids to clean the counters   Not even pepper or regular salt as basic provisions  Worst provisioned kitchen in all my AirBNB stays  and that includes a disappointing stay in Istanbul   When you list you have a kitchen  it should be properly provisioned   Confusing address and directions to the building A better equipped kitchen
614600849,The biggest advantage of the place is its proximity to convention center  Thanks a lot  The sofa in front of TV has too many stains and could have been kept neat  The Chair at Balcony was too dirty   Sofa could have been cleaner 
606791298,The location was the best part of this Airbnb property  Lafayette square restaurants and bars are well within walking distance  However one issue that I will remember in the future was with parking  The ad stated a gated parking lot was provided to guest with access from a key fob  When we arrived the fob was not there  I called Zencity and they told me previous renter took it and they didnt have a replacement  I was told sorry for the inconvenience  We had to park on the street for the two day stay which can sometimes be tricky in busy St  Louis neighborhoods  The apartment was very nice but one thing I noticed was that the floors were dirty  There was drywall dust on several places and I wouldnt call the place sparkling clean  Nice appliances and kitchen but beware of the limited hot water supply  Its a small tank and forces a very quick shower  Kind of a bummer if you need to relax or shave  Pluses and minuses for this place  The location was convenient and the building seemed safe  For      a night it would have been nice to have a sparkling clean place  parking as listed  and extra towels   Gated parking was listed and a selling point however  the fob was not there and a replacement wasn u    t given  I realize this was an issue with previous renter but plans should be in place to provide a backup to next guest  I u    m sure there u    s s fee for lost fobs that covers this expense for owner   The floors didnt looks like they were swept very well  There was drywall dust still on floor in several places  Gated parking was listed but fob was not there and no replacement was given  On the street parking is fine but doesnt guarantee a spot close to building or safety of vehicle  A bit cleaner  more towels  and parking issues accurate and correct 
671257644,Soild place in a nice neighborhood
104790938,Great overall 
604558659,The place was large  pretty clean  although it could use some remodeling  The water pressure in the shower was pretty low  The main issue I experienced was the failure of the management to provide WiFi  as promised in the description    I contacted them immediately about that  and  unfortunately  they did not fix the issue until the final day of my stay  While their responses regarding this issue were relatively prompt  they were unprofessional  In fact  they provided   additional passwords for me to try  and they assumed I was not competent enough to select the right network and enter the password correctly  The last straw was that on the last day  when I informed them that the WiFi was finally working  they claimed that nothing had changed on their end  and that the WiFi was working during the entire stay  which implied that I was lying about the WiFi not working earlier    If you are looking for a bargain basement price for a stay in Central West End  this is a good place to stay  However  if you need to be confident about having working WiFi   or if you would like competent management in case another issue arises  look elsewhere  Everything was good  but your failure to provide WiFi was a material breach of trust   WiFi was  listed in the description but not available on the first two days out of my   day stay  The entry code was changed last minute  and I only found out because I messaged the host about checking in early  Providing WiFI as advertised

636925060,This apartment is part of the Lafayette Square neighborhood   easily accessible to downtown  Union Station  and Soulard  Great location   Incredible gym in the building   free weights  barbell rack  TRX  Stairclimber  two treadmills and an elliptical  Peloton bike   and it was NEVER busy     The unit itself is a basement unit and requires a bit of navigating to get to it  We found we missed a window in the bedroom  and lights must be on at all times when there  Very contemporary modern decor  quite attractive   roomy   bedroom  high celings  and well equipped kitchen  Paper towels  dish dishwasher soap  and bathroom  sample size  toiletries provided  Some minor issues with furnishings  and the apartment had some small maintenance items attributed to normal wear and tear   Zencity has a   x  customer support line  which we used when the keypad to our unit stopped working  They had us back into the place within    minutes of reporting the issue  We had good communication with the organization before and during our stay   If youre looking for a prime location for your St  Louis trip  this is a great place to consider  Thanks for hosting us  Everyone we dealt with was helpful  The apartment had nice look and amenities but was a bit rough around the edges  paint  some maintenance items reported during our visit  The toilet seat was very loose   I fixed that for us  And our wifi issue was never resolved    instead  we just piggybacked on another units wifi  Our need to refresh the keypad with the bluetooth app was irritating  glad it was resolved  just wish it had been sooner than    minutes    For the price we paid  the unit was worthwhile  If we had paid full price  I would have been rather disappointed with the experience  We just had too many little problems   all were worked around or managed  but they detracted from our overall experience   The basement of that building is confusing to navigate  The checkin description could be improved by telling people to enter the door leading to the gym  and turning right   We spent about   minutes wandering around the floor until we figured out the door leading to the gym didnt enter INTO the gym   The touchpad lock on the door is difficult to navigate   took     times of keying in the code to get into the apartment  Final communications not acknowledged  Did not explain how to reach the dumpster for our trash  Otherwise worked well 
618131478,T V barely works and clean up fee is a lot especially for the size of the unit T V barely works and the clean up fee is a lot especially for the size place
672418662,Average stay  looks exactly like it is  Floor and bathroom are dirty however  Make sure to clean  Looked exactly like it is  Floor was very dirty when I came in and bathroom had bugs
626651694,The place was nice and clean despite a few mishaps  Communication couldve been better as well  The place was nice but the few mishaps couldve been prevented or handled a little better  The window was literally loose off the hinges when it fell with one simple touch  Also  I was not at fault for the tv table  I was barely even there let alone using the tv or the stand  I do apologize for the mishaps and wish everything couldve went smoother 
620505264,Nice clean place would recommend for the price it was given but pretty sure it womt be thst low once the economy rises
600970586,Beautifully decorated and clean home  in a great location close to the main things you need  Easy check in and great communication  Street parking was a bit of a pain  Only free on Sundays and in the evenings  which can make it difficult to find a park   and you have to top up the meter every   hours  We used the app to save us having to keep going back to the car  Beautiful and clean home amd great communication  For someone that wants to have a meals at home though I would add a few kitchen essentials like a microwave  oven mits  and dish towels   Parking was only free Sundays and in the evenings  which then made it difficult to find a park as well   Description says free parking but I feel like there should be more info about this as it was a bit of a pain the whole stay  
599265857,Great location for staying near BJ hospital     things keep me from a     No internet in the room   Router didnt have power cord   Assume that will be fixed but frustrating to try to run business without a solid connection   Lack of kitchen utilities   really only   forks   Everything else was fine   Fire alarm going off in the middle of the night and nobody from apartment complex on site to turn off   I would stay again  people were friendly  clean  safe and Location to hospital was such a nice feature  Great location for staying near BJ hospital     things keep me from a     No internet in the room   Router didnt have power cord   Assume that will be fixed but frustrating to try to run business without a solid connection   Lack of kitchen utilities   really only   forks   Everything else was fine   Fire alarm going off in the middle of the night and nobody from apartment complex on site to turn off   I would stay again   Location to hospital was such a nice feature 
671161306,We really enjoyed our stay and felt safe the entire visit  It was fun to experience staying in the loft  I would love to know more about the history of the building  The carpets and the couch are due to be replaced  The fireplace is only for show  The stay was very enjoyable for us  thank you for your hospitality  My recommendations are to replace the carpet  couch  and repair the washer and the spare bathroom leaky toilet   Fireplace does not work   It felt a little like a puzzle  but it was fun to figure it out  Its accurate  but unfortunately Washington St  Is in a bit of a depression  It was a good value  but not a   star value 
613224745,The location was very convenient  there are food options in walking distance  Comfortable beds and bedding  Price was fair   Cons  There is only one set of keys available so if you are traveling with others you all have to be on the same schedule  coming and going   The place wasnt cleaned thoroughly  The floors had dirt dust  and the showers hadnt been wiped down  There was no coffee pot  but a grinder      A lot of light comes into the larger bedroom which makes it hard to sleep in nap  The gym is in the basement and the equipment was nice but it was all dirty  Please pay attention to cleanliness  add a coffee maker  and two sets of keys should be standard for a   bedroom place  The floors were dirty as well as the bathrooms The host responded but didnt help with my issue 
428063106,Good location  Unfortunately the neighbors are super sensitive to noise and at  pm on a Saturday  they complained about us playing music through the tv at     volume  Being let in was the worst issue we had because the call box wasnt working and the company said there wasnt anything they could do for us  Once we finally made it in  it was pretty smooth otherwise  Be prepared for a leg workout making it up all of the stairs though  When I called from the directory box to be buzzed in  the person on the other line couldnt hear me  I tried calling multiple times to no success  I tried calling the host but I was connected to an operator for the company and he said there was nothing he could do about the situation 
598695634,The previous reviews were all fairly accurate   Its a cool unit in a cool building   but the thin walls   constant noise from people running up the stairs and in the apartment above   made it not the best stay   Lots of construction   hallways dirty and in disrepair   and for a new unit there was also a lot of damage to the walls in the unit   For the price it was acceptable but I wouldnt pay more   and it cant compete with high quality places in other locations  Just lots of marks in surfaces   dust and dirt on floor from construction  Noisy   still lots of construction   fir a new unit it had a lot of damage to walls 
637453214,THE GOOD  Gorgeous historic building exterior was fantastic for our photos as we are celebrating a girlfriends upcoming wedding  Park and beach just across  plenty of room with laundry    THE BAD   We sanitized the whole kitchen area and living area that we had to touch as weve noticed that it wasnt clean  Host was veeeerrryyy slow to respond and offer no help  Sofa was very dirty and stained  hair  pieces of candy wrapper under cushion  we had to put over a comforter to sit on it  Kitchen was not cleaned  fridge smells  microwave splatters all over inside  oven handle and front is sticky  Tons of dead bugs in window sills  NO WIFI our entire stay  Their router modem was faulty   nd bedrooms bed was very light and slides on the floor everytime Sofa was very dirty  hair  candy wrapper  stained  Kitchen was not cleaned  fridge smells  microwave splatters all over inside  oven handle and front is sticky  Tons of dead bugs in window sills 
707167249,This was a great place to stay for a quick trip to KC  If you are planning to cook your own food  the kitchen is not fully stocked but it was super clean and had everything else that we needed 
618739344,Clean and close to Power   Light  Spartan accommodations  Slow WiFi  Include info about how to use card key  Also have a guest book with information about the space  I was told  when I called  that there was bag of coffee   it only had   beans in it     A maintenance person showed up during our stay but we had no knowledge of it and didnt let them in  Difficult to use lock box  No instructions about keycard  A maintenance person showed up with no prior announcement  We didnt let them in  Place with better sound proofing 
706740163,The location was good but is it worth the hassle   The keypad info was wrong and there was no fob in the room for access to the apartment and parking garage   I had to find a place to park my car for the night because there was not a fob to get into the parking garage   Even after contacting the host  no fob  The keypad info was wrong and there was no fob   I had to find a place to park my car for the night because there was not a fob to get into the parking garage 
424006464,The area was nice I had no problem with finding things to do but the host responded very slow or not at all  There was just a lot of holes and cracks in the walls in the bedroom but everything else was fine I had an emergency that I had to attend to at home so I was going to leave a day early but they refused to give me any money back  they also never responded to me when I asked them why I couldnt receive any money back being that I let her know the day before I was going to leave  I also messaged them letting them know I was leaving at about   and no one responded till    am the next day  I just feel like the communication should Have been a little better and I should have been told why I couldnt receive any money back but I didnt even get that 
638181673,Was not exactly worth the price  Kind of dirty  But if you like a good view the rooftop is really neat  The decor of the apartment was nice  it just wasnt clean  and there was a bad smell the whole time in the kitchen  It was okay  but there was a horrible rancid smell in the kitchen  There was very long dark hair all over the bathroom and shower  The air conditioner in the living room is pretty gross honestly could use some good cleaning  Both of them need filters changed too  Your floors definitely need mopped  we could not walk on them with bare feet without our feet becoming black  But we loved the rooftop view  and the decor of the apartment  If it had been clean  Was not very clean at all
427371823,The interior of the house was lovely and clean  It was beautifully restored and decorated  The linens were very pretty and comfortable  The house is lovely and very clean   The only problem was  the upstairs bathtub drains slowly which makes it very slippery when showering  I almost fell in the tub and there was nothing to grab on to to steady myself   The photos of the backyard were lovely  the actual backyard was not   The neighborhood looked a little rough  There was a boarded up house right across the street 
623347108,The unit was fantastic  Price was cheaper than expected for the unit  It was clean  nice furniture  comfortable bed   Location was great  Check in instructions were perfect   Dishes were sparse but sufficient  I would have liked wine glasses and they didnt have any but maybe thats expecting a bit too much  The view was amazing   The only downside was that communication was bad   It took the host about a day and a half to respond to a question I had about amenities   Next  the dishwasher didnt work  I discovered this on a Saturday and messaged them about it   They didnt reply until      on Tuesday which was   days later  Plus  my stay ended Wednesday  and I had to be out by    so obviously the dishwasher wasnt going to be fixed during my stay  I had to do dishes by hand which Im not a fan of  There was no drain plug for the sink so I used a pot to wash the dishes in  There was only one hand towel  and I was using it to dry my hands so I used a bath towel to let the dishes air dry   When Zen city did reply about the dishwasher not working  they said   perhaps there is a switch in the kitchen which will turn on the dishwasher since it doesnt seem to have power  Let us know if we can do anything else for you during your stay    You could have replied much sooner  tried to fix my dishwasher much sooner  and DURING my stay  So you havent done anything for me in the first place  let alone  anything else      Perhaps there is a switch     Because you DONT KNOW your own unit     So they obviously had not called maintenance yet since now they were attempting to get me to trouble shoot   I had looked for a switch everywhere in the kitchen  as well as finding the fuse box  flipping the breaker off and back on  as well as looking for the plug in for the dishwasher  None of that fixed the dishwasher  There was no switch   Lovely how they contacted me so late after my issue that my stay was now nearly over  They didnt resolve my issue   It felt like they didnt try to resolve my issue during my stay and they didnt seem to care or act concerned  For this reason  I reduced stars  Its a shame because the place was great   Zen City contacted me a few hours before check in to move me to a different building stating there was a maintenance issue  I didn u    t mind this too much as it was a nice place  But  considering I had a maintenance issue that wasn u    t resolved during my stay  it made me feel they do not address maintenance issues promptly   It took the host about a day and a half to respond to a question I had   Next  the dishwasher didnt work  I discovered this on a Saturday and messaged them about it   They didnt reply until      on Tuesday which was   days later  Plus  my stay ended Wednesday  and I had to be out by    so obviously the dishwasher wasnt going to be fixed during my stay  I had to do dishes by hand  There was no drain plug for the sink so I used a pot to wash the dishes in  There was only one hand towel I was using to dry my hands so I tased a bath towel to let the dishes air dry   When Zen city did reply about the dishwasher not working  they said   perhaps there is a switch in the kitchen which will turn on the dishwasher since it doesnt seem to have power  Let us know if we can do anything wise for you during your stay    You could have fixed my dishwasher much sooner  and during my stay  So you havent done anything for me in the first place  let alone  anything else      Perhaps     Because you DONT KNOW your own unit     So they obviously had not called maintenance yet   I had looked for a switch everywhere in the kitchen  as well as flipping the breaker off and back on  as well as looking for the plug in for the dishwasher  None of that fixed the dishwasher  There was no switch   Lovely how i was contacted so late after my issue that my stay was now near over within less than a day until check out 
623553552,The most generous review I can give is that there are safer  more secure neighborhoods just blocks away  with hosts that go out of their way to make sure you have everything that may need  not to mention thats listed    This is unfortunately  not one of them  and I would have to question any listing with this management team behind it  Three days without access to a bath towel is really unacceptable  And with everyone overdue a trim a hairdryer is almost as much  No big deal if I would have known  please dont list it if its not going to be there   My apologies for breaking the French press that was in the unit when I arrived  btw   French press is not a coffee maker especially to those that dont know how to use one  but youll find I did replace it with a better model at least its not missing parts allowing it to come apart and break  And if the Monarch was supposed to be a solution for coffee   those prices are higher than Starbucks and an insult to your guests and to the community when people are eating out of dumpsters right behind the building  I cant recommend this listing at any price  BTW  your cleaning team arent cleaning the drawers  desk drawers  or under the bed  And   gauze squares doesnt make a  st aid kit found that one the hard way when trying to clean the French press and  lose the white bedspread  its stained near the top  center under the pillows  you can see it when the light shines thru the uncurtained windows  I do thank you for adding the extra day  I did appreciate the gesture even when you charged me almost double for the convenienc   Good luck to you   There werent any parking meters near the building  but it is limited to   hr between  am and  pm M F but thats only IF you can find a spot to park parallel against the curb and good luck with that if you drive anything larger than a sub compact   Several different people communicated with me  only one introduced themselves  And I dont think they share notes with each other about issues or what exactly is going on  They really should update their listing to let guests know that they are building a large apartment building about   ft away from one of the exterior walls  This apartment was on the opposite of the construction and it woke me up every morning  Behind the apartment building is also a very large  boarded up  vacant building that seem to be a gathering place for the homeless at night  The police do come thru and clear it out at least once a night  I guess you get what you pay for   so be prepared to bring towels  a hair dryer  an extra blanket  coffee  a coffee maker  sugar  dishwashing tabs  a mattress pad   there arent even any curtains  Dont forget earplugs as the walls are very thin and your door is right next to the back exit to the stairwell  Those steel doors with the bar across the middle you compress to open like you might find in a school   and just as loud 
444920817,NA Hi Brian thanks for letting us stay at your house  The only suggestions I have is more blankets pillows towels  Other then that the house just was not very clean  Hope this helps you in the future 
630076064,Nice place to chill  Bathroom had a leak  There was a pot catching the water  It smelled like mildew in there  Bed was comfy  Couch very sunk in  Appliances and kitchen was nice  Overall if they fix this place up a bit it would be a wonderful stay 
589152967,Awful experience  inaccurate listing  Hosts were helpful with initial issues but once the issues grew  They went silent and were no longer helpful  Apartment was dirty  no trash bags  no actual coffee maker  dryer did not work  I would not trust Zen city with another trip of mine  You were quick to respond to any initial issues but once you were asked for a partial refund you went silent and no longer were so helpful   We initially had no trash bags in our unit at all to throw any of our garbage in  They didn u    t deliver any until the next day around noon  Coffee maker was a French press which we had no idea how to use ad said floor to ceiling windows but they were not  It did have a dryer but the dryer would not stay on for more than five minutes at a time before it turned off I had to keep on turning it back on to get our clothes dry  Also the Internet lagged and it made it difficult to stream anything on Netflix  I did reset the router but it didn u    t help   The address given on the Airbnb reservation was different than the one on the check in instructions which made it confusing  Also  The deadbolt would not lock so we had to rely on the handle only  Bathroom floors were dirty urine residue on bottom near toilets and tile floors were dirty with residue not mopped  Kitchen stainless appliances were smeared all over  The host responded to issues at first but once I requested a partial refund they asked me to send pictures so their cleaners could come by and clean everything up and I said it was unacceptable that it shouldve already been clean when we walked in  They stopped responding and never gave me any refund  There were a lot of bums that resided on the sidewalks around this hotel 
710988449,Gday toeat cute place that is easy to access  the hardest part really is street parking  This is an old building so it will be very drafty  It was a bit cold during my stay  Grub Hub also refused to read the address as accurate so I had to o get things rather than have them delivered The washing machine only runs hot warm water  so dont mix your colors    The first night I was there  a pipe leaked all over the kitchen  It was a mess  The repair guy took half a day to get there  and left without fixing it  Host wanted me to confirm it was no longer an issue after I repeatedly asked for another repair man to be sent    As the kitchen was still a soapy swamp  They eventually did  on the second day  with no warning  and he fixed it immediately  He also checked other kitchen water features to ensure they were working  I had to ask for a partial refund for not having a kitchen for two nights and a whole day    The blinds in the space were mostly damaged or dysfunctional  and one of the bedroom doors had no functional hanle  lock or catch  It was also hollowed out  Host was made aware of these issues  but check your doors before you settle in  Thank you for working with me on the pipe leak   Washing machine only runs hot   Paint splatters  resin drips  and something I hope was pizza sauce smeared on the walls  Host asked for confirmation that a repair man fixed a pipe  after I repeatedly ask for them to send another because the first didnt fix it  A major leak sprung in the kitchen and it took forever to get fixed 
584025767,Not great  Skip this listing for now until they get their systems improved  First negative review Ive written over dozens of stays  Cigarette marijuana smoke really triggering our breathing at night  Check in was not smooth  Waited about an hour to get the key problem figured out  No shower supplies  The place is bare bones   a bed  a few glasses  and a tv  Awful refund policy since we had to cancel     back  Really negative stay  well choose a hotel next time   Listing said washer and dryer  none in this unit   Shower supplies  better check in  all around could be improved 
586332593,Great location  great value 
716064086,I had a great stay with Zencity  The apartment is a great setup in a great location clean  serviceable  and comfortable  with some nice touches  The apartment doesnt have much of a view or sunlight  and there was some pretty loud and persistent remodeling going on in the apartment next door during much of my stay  But that should all be through by the time you arrive  Haha  Elevator building  sixth floor   needs a card laundry down the hall  and the folks at Zencity were helpful and professional  Recommended 
577508446,The Airbnb looks accurate and is within a great neighborhood  The subway is a short walk and the buses run straight into the city core  However  the inability to adjust the building heat resulted in a slightly uncomfortable sleep as the room was small and unventilated  Windows can be opened but the noise will force them shut  The bathtub works but only for short periods as the water leaks  As stated in a message sent  The Airbnb was accurate but has some features and problems that made our stay less comfortable than expected 
419171325,Fantastic place to stay  Its right in the middle of Milwaukee Ave so waking distance to everything  About a     min walk to the blue line so easy access to downtown ohare  Please is sparkling clean  I would stay here    The only draw back are the floors creak quite a bit  and when the heater turns on  it makes a metal clashing sound  I feel these are minor for me ear plugs solved these  but just a fair warning  Fantastic place to stay  Amazing location and spot on directions to check in  Towels werent all clean  Some had spots  others hard hair in it
709619727,Very nice in many ways  such as being large and spacious  However  the bathroom and kitchen were not clean  If the apartment was fully cleaned it would be an incredible place  The shower curtain had bits of hard soap clinging to it and the bathroom in general was not clean  The kitchen had dirty countertops and the kitchen floor was quite dirty 
258810121,Hosts were communicative and quick to respond  This place was great for a short weekend trip with a large group 
587801001,Lovely space  Very modern aesthetic and close to some good restaurants  Close proximity to some landmarks within St  Louis  Just had some trouble finding the room at first  A little loud due to construction that was going on at the apartment complex  Overall  great experience  Thanks so much for the stay  The room was beautiful  Only had a brief set back trying to find the room at first   Had a little trouble finding the room  
587113026,The only issue I had was that the roof top was not accessible  Had it not been for that  this would have been a   star review  The location is great  great price point  and the staff responded quickly to my e mails  and were very forth coming  I would gladly stay at this location again  I know I had some less than flattering remarks  but the room was amazing  comfortable  and if not for the things mentioned it wouldve been a   star rating from me  If I ever find myself in this area again  I would gladly stay at this location again   The host was upfront that some common areas were being remodeled  The main issue for me was that the roof top access was not available and that was not mentioned   The check in process was okay  but the directions to my room left much to be desired  Just clear up the directions to each room or have a better directory in the lobby 
646393528,Good
584846090,The apartment is brand new  very clean and stylish with a secure parking lot   Great location close to Lafayette Park and a short drive from downtown   However as of December    the building itself was still under construction   Everything works but there may be some early morning construction noise  The space and location are great  but you definitely should mention that the building is still under construction   We were awakened at   am on Friday by loud banging and there was a lot of construction noise during the day on Friday and Saturday   Also the fitness center is not complete   Description didnt mention that the building is still under construction   Again  it should have been less for a building still under construction 
618065045,Nice modern unit with great location for downtown Live Music Bars P L District  and Sprint Center    block walk to trolley   Have all apps on TV but no Cable   Beware of parking cost availability especially if there is a major event happening downtown   We were staying for Big    Tourney and closest parking for was about   block South of Truman Road I    at a cost of      for   nights and you could only bring your vehicle in once and leave once so basically could not use it   May be better if no major events going on downtown   We just parked in North Kansas City and too a bout a    Lift Ride to the Building   Unfortunately during our stay there was some construction going on right above us and all they host said was sorry  if we knew  we would have warned you   Woke us up every morning at   am    For groups of more than   adults  they should provide more fobs for access into the building elevator and provide more than   key into the actual unit   Not good when a couple people want to stay out later and then when come in have to wake others to unlock door  Construction every morning at   am woke us up   More fobs to enter Building Elevator and actual keys to get into unit need to be provided if   couples or larger group is staying   Not enough info about how much parking would cost or only giving one key for a group of   Adults  Late response when asked for additional fobs to at lest get in building elevator and still only   key to get into actual unit 
709154835,I had high hopes from the reviews  but this Airbnb didnt live up to expectations  We spent    minutes standing in the hallway trying to call Zencity because they gave us the incorrect door code  We had the same issue one other time where we spent    minutes waiting for their help because they had changed the door code without letting us know  Some of the pans in the kitchen were very dirty  and they only have salt and pepper for use which wouldve been nice to know we had to bring other basics like olive oil  Neither the heat or the AC would work at all  causing us to prop the balcony door open all night to keep proper air flow  I was disappointed and wouldnt stay here again  We spent    minutes in the hallway calling the host because the keypad wouldnt work  Same at check out  Crumbs on the counter  Weird smell coming from bathroom 
415085896,This space is all about LOCATION    So great and walkable  Over all Id say this space is pretty good      Very clean   Jacuzzi tub was a PLUS but now that there isnt a ton of hot water so you might have to boil a couple pots and throw them in   but really not an issue    I do like the charm of staying in someones actual home  which this isnt  but Zencitys management keeps it really clean and posh    The heat did make banging noises quite loudly when being turned on and off   if youre a light sleep this might not be ideal   The couch was broken when we arrived so we couldnt sit on half BUT Zencity quickly responded they didnt know of the issue   hopefully its resolved now    Enjoy the neighborhood  haaaiiiiii  I know that you guys dont live there but I think with more stuff in the space would be beneficial  though I know the risk of just putting stuff in a space just means some idiot will steal it eventually   so I get it     the banging for the heat would be muffled more though and neighbors noise would likely be quieter as well  The hot water situation was pretty wack  even without using the jacuzzi  but i appreciate the responsiveness and obviously the location is the shhhiiitttttt   Thank yoooou   Showed really cute lighting fixtures on the bed sides but      of them werent plugged in or able to be plugged in  SHOULD def mention that Jacuzzi tub  Was really great the second night when we boiled water to have it be a reasonable temp  
708197839,    I am waiting for a response to my email that I sent with pictures of all of my issues with the apartment 
584835736,Overall an ok space  The shower ran out of hot water after   minutes  and there were a few spiders in residence  Its a basement apartment though so thats probably to be expected  The previous guests left with the parking lot key fob so we couldnt park safely in the lot like we hoped  The hosts responded quickly but were unable to resolve the issue until our final night  We probably wouldnt stay here again  It would be a good idea to have more than one parking lot fob on site to avoid issues like we had   The address given is not shown anywhere on the building  you have to look closely at the screen by the door to be sure you u    re in the right place   Access to the parking lot that was advertised 
584825768,A clean cute up to date space   For the price you will be pleased   If its winter  you will have a walk to parking   No on site parking   I would stay here again for sure   The ambulance noise is a lot but  nothings perfect    Cleo   I loved the coffee touch   even though it was broken the last day we were there    the price of the unit was great       I didnt like the fact that we couldnt have visitors  friends or family   that didnt feel good to me   Also you should have a booklet inside the unit explaining everything about the space   Then we wouldnt need to email or call   Thanks for allowing us to stay   Cleo King    The noise from the hospital  ambulances was too much   Parking was difficult   I didnt realize I didnt have on site parking   They should mention that  Only communicated through email    Hated that   Even though I asked for a phone number   they gave it to me  every time I called it went straight to voicemail   So frustrating  I liked the location a lot  just the noise from the hospital was annoying   Ambulances 
584183516,Great stylish loft in downtown St  Louis  It was very clean   There isnt a coffee pot as described so be prepared to walk to McDonalds  Washer filled with water but did not work  We found this out the hard way and had to wring out our clothes by hand  Other than that we really enjoyed staying there  We enjoyed staying in your loft  It was very clean and stylish  Your listing said there was a coffee pot but we couldnt find one  We also used the washer but it would not wash after it was full of water  We had to wring out the clothes by hand   There wasn u    t a coffee pot and the washer did not work   Check in was at       I text the host several times letting them know we were there  It was about      before we heard back with instructions on how to get in  Took awhile to hear back with instructions on how to get in 
706588293,Cozy spot in a great area 
644797918,Lovely  clean place with all the appointments of a   bedroom apartment in the city  Stylish  modern look and feel made me feel right at home 
584018425,Zencity is a fantastic place to relax and unwind in the heart of the city  Parking was convenience  but make sure to brush up on your parallel parking skills   the space has really cool amenities that airbnbers can take full advantage of  Hot tub is not available in the winter months but the outdoor patio was awesome and would be fun for warmer months  The staff at the building is helpful for any on site needs during your stay  We hope to stay with you all in the future hopefully during a less busy time   The room was super far from the elevator which made it somewhat inconvenient  The pool  hot tub were not available for use and that could have been put in the listing so we knew ahead of time since this was a large reason we booked this space  The bed was super comfy and the wifi was wicked fast   We requested a slightly earlier check in and got a response to how to enter the door only to be told we couldnt enter until    after arriving at   the cleaning staff was still cleaning the space for about an hour  We didnt have a key fob upon checkin which was an inconvenience but management at the building helped get us one  Our room wasnt clean upon arrival due to a mixup with the cleaning service  Zencity accommodated by extending our checkout by the amount of time the cleaning staff was there upon arrival    We didnt have enough towels for our stay but laundry soap was provided  Basic soaps for dishes and bath were provided  Zencity staff was initially difficult to get ahold of  likely due to the holidays  but after the first day they responded pretty much immediately  We didnt get full use of the amenities listed 
621467578,Dont stay there  
414048315,the building is clean and modern  the one and a half bathrooms were a pleasant surprise  the apartment has the feel of a hotel room  rather small and spare  the space met our needs at a reasonable price  thank you for a seamless stay  there were extra linens for the futon  but no extra blankets   it was basically just a hotel suite  small   it was fine  just not the most convenient we just werent impressed  we didnt spend much time there  but it was sparse and didnt feel comfortable 
646434544,The place looks just like the pictures  It was very quite and relaxing  Very close to shopping centers and restaurants  My only problem was with parking  which had nothing to do with Zencity but others who lived there  Thanks for allowing us to stay in your home 
627461356,nice stay  you were a great host and I appreciate the stay   the wifi didnt work   there was broken glass cup in the kitchen  the sink became stopped up and had the entire floor wet 
413506403,Great location  basic space outfitted well for a weekend visit  The layers of people involved in the check in process  from the front desk staff to the customer support reps  didnt know how to help us  I couldnt fault them  but Id suggest setting them up with the right info for them to be successful in helping guests  We followed the instructions to pick up keys at a building across the street  but at     pm they hadnt been returned by the cleaning service yet  When we called Zencity support  the representatives didnt seem well equipped to help us  They were confused by the situation  referred us back to the instructions  and told us there was nothing they could do about the keys  The keys showed up within an hour and once we had them getting into the space was no problem  sheets did not appear to be clean When we had check in difficulties we messaged through the app  in addition to calling  and did receive a response  but not until after the problem had already resolved itself 
412440224,You can expect a neat   tidy location  If I were to judge all rentals from Zencity by this apartment  Id be willing to rent every single time as long as its clean and dust free  It was EXTREMELY dusty at this location  Looked like it hadnt been dusted or cleaned in months  Everything was neat and tidy  but the dust was really bad  Gladly there was a mop  broom and a vacuum cleaner  Thankfully I carry tools on me as well because the vacuum cleaner was literally jam packed with dust  Once I cleaned out all the dust I was able to clean up even more dust that was embedded into the carpets  Place looks clean now though  Pretty sure the new visitors will enjoy a clean and comfortable space       
645924524,Worth every penny
580991764,Property is very roomy for the location  three large bedrooms and two full baths  in the CWE  Condo building looks like a St Louis    family or so  Property was mostly clean  bathrooms were fine  but kitchen floors and some other areas had some debris from what looks like a recent paint job molding woodwork  Location is amazing for getting to Forest Park attractions and CWE retail  walking distance from WF and Straubs grocery stores  Parallel parking can be found on street out front  large and sometimes loud surface parking lot on alley behind Euclid bars adjacent to two of three bedrooms  In unit stackable washer and dryer very convenient  Somewhat utilitarian feel to property  but reasonable for the price and perfectly acceptable 
643035881,The location cant be beat  Fre after parking a bit plus in my book  Building has character  Second time I have stayed here  first time significant maintenance issues that should have put the unit out of service prior to my check in  Manager tried to resolve the issue  I get a lazy maintenance man    Give the building a second shot  Unit had a bad smell  if youve been around farms  think damp hay in the barn    there was an air freshener in the closet so someone was trying to address the issue  However unit needs a deep cleaning  Email issues to manager I worked with on the prior visit  no one from Zencity responded  I have pictures of the issues  other than the smell  leave to you imagination  if you want to message me    Awesome location guys  Was hoping you would have shown me your best foot forward after the leaking ground floor mess last month  Gave me a unit that smelled of dirty diaper  Mound on the base board in the bathroom and when I emailed the issues  no one responded  I dont get it  Paul My second stay in bldg  if I hadnt  been there prior  would not have know how to get past security doors Unit had a  wet straw barn like smell  Mold on bathroom base boards  Sent email to Zencity manager  did not respond during stay  Sent email to manager with cleaning issues  did not receive a reply  My second chance stay  Maintenance issues first time  Youd the Zencity would make an effort to make this stay perfect   
700614644,I do not recommend staying here  My experience was riddled with issues and frustration  and the host was rarely helpful  or timely  with his responses when I reached out for help      There were handprints all over the walls of the bedroom  and the furniture in the living dining room was extremely old  worn and dirty looking  It also smelled like chemicals   and not in the clean way      One of the windows in the living room is missing       with only paper taped over it  Additionally  none of the windows have screens   so they cant be opened   and guests are not allowed to adjust the thermostat on their own     TV is EXTREMELY slow  at times unwatchable  and you can only watch Netflix   no regular TV  The input was constantly disconnecting and or buffering due to slow internet  I also had to replace the batteries in all the remotes  which the host did not reimburse for or acknowledge when I reached out     There was a fire alarm in the unit chirping for THREE ENTIRE days  kept me up all   nights  too   It took the host multiple days and multiple reminders follow ups from me before it was fixed  I couldnt reach the fire alarm or find a ladder  otherwise I would have just done it myself     Lastly  neither of the front gates leading to the apartment building lock  This is dangerous  There were strange people homeless people wandering all around and through the entrance front alleyway during the night  It was also very loud   This was a disappointing and inaccurate experience  from top to bottom  In addition to the issues Ive listed above  one of the windows in the living room was missing  with only paper taped over it  and there were no screens on any of the windows  so they couldnt be opened  Guests do not have control of the temperature in the apartment either   you have to contact the host  who doesnt respond   n nThe TV is also EXTREMELY slow  to the point where it is unwatchable at times  and only offers the option to watch Netflix  no regular TV    I had to pay for and replace all the batteries in the remote controls  and even still  the TV was disconnecting  buffering the entire time   n nLastly  one of the fire alarms in the unit was chirping  for   ENTIRE days  kept me up all night  before someone came to fix it  There was very little to no communication from the host when I reached out  and I had to follow up with them MULTIPLE times  over multiple days  before it was fixed   There were handprints all over the walls in the bedroom  and the furniture in the living dining room was very worn and looked dirty  It also smelled like chemicals  and not in the clean way   The host did not acknowledge any of this when I reached out  I even sent pictures of the handprints  they were that obvious   The host was not helpful  nor timely  any of the times I reached out for help  which were multiple   Neither of the front gates leading to the apartment building lock  This is extremely dangerous  especially given the area  There were strange people homeless people wandering all around and through the entrance front alleyway during the night  It was also very loud 
580502375,Pros  Nice safe location  new construction building with modern clean and minimalist design of furniture  Beds  pillows and towels were comfortable and plush  Nice extra touches like clothing hampers in each bathroom  luggage racks  extra pillows  blankets and towels  Plenty of hangers and closet space  Conscious effort to make plugging in cell phones for charging in bedrooms and living room easy  Blue tooth speaker and iphone charging dock  although I have a Samsung and couldnt use it   Washer and dryer with detergent pods available    no dryer sheets    Cons  the entire building is deep in the middle of construction  On our lengthy walk through the building to get to the apartment door  we came across a bunch of construction debris piles  Everything is dusty  Including a thin layer of white construction dust on many items in the actual apartment  I woke up every morning with a stuffy nose  Also  even though we took our shoes off right at the door  we were tracking white dust into the house on our shoes from walking around  The gym is advertised as being on premise  but it was not installed yet and not in working order  Kind of messed up my work out plans for the weekend    Our apartment was also without a key fob  previous renters didnt return and zen city doesnt carry extras for this situation   The benefit of the key fob is to use the entrance that is closer to the elevator and park in the parking lot  So  we had to park on the street and take the long route to get in and out each time  There is also only a ramp to get in and out with rolling luggage or for handicap purposes  through this door  Had to go up and down about    stairs with luggage when entering and leaving  Not a huge deal  just an inconvenience    Our apartment also did not have a tv remote  So I was instructed by zen city to install the roku app and use that as a remote on my phone  It worked and it was an ok fix  but it was annoying  I didnt want to have to download an app on my phone and I couldnt charge my phone while needing to use it as a remote  Also  listing says coffee maker  There was NOT a Keurig or even a simple coffee machine  What there was   was a coffee press which I had no desire to figure out in a hurry in the morning  I dont use a coffee press at home and just wanted coffee quickly  I had to get dressed and go down the street to get a cup for breakfast every morning that I was there   The walls are also very thin  We could hear the TV as if it were playing in our own room from the apartment across the hall    Most of the cons can be fixed once the building is finished being under construction and therefore I would stay here again in the future  Overall a great place that needs some kinks fixed  Other than a few issues like no remote for the TV  no key fob for the parking garage  and no coffee maker or working gym like mentioned in your listing as an amenity  our stay was nice   No coffee maker  just a french press   Gym not in working order yet   Construction dust everywhere  Shower stall had hair in it  freezer had some old food dripped in there and wasnt clean  One of the kitchen chairs had food or something rubbed on the leather part where u sit 
625245065,When you stay at this place  Just know that the host will respond really quickly and they are there to help  However  the place is not the place that is on the photo  although nicely furnished  with the exception of the   seat sofa   I enjoyed the cleanliness of the linens in the bedrooms  The place had everything we needed during this pandemic time  so we stayed    The  surrounding community  to the apartment is not that great  Theres a park across the street filled with homeless people that camps there using drugs  leaving trash  and  using the bathroom everywhere  Itsnot a pretty site  Other than that  I will be back in St  Louis in July and unfortunately I won t book this place again  Just the area  was a bit much for me  Other than that I could live with the other things  The host was Amazing with a capital A  I just have to be honest  I really appreciate staying at your place  Although I have a few things that I was a little bit uncomfortable with  I still stayed because I didnt want to hassle you or myself  Thank you for being a prompt host   It wasnt the same place on the advertisement  However we  had a long flight and  didnt arrive until late after      p m Plus the host was very helpful in a timely manner   The common area couch had all kind of left food particles and the bathroom had was not swept  We just found food under the air condition  It was horrible  I had my teenage daughter with me and we witnessed people shooting drugs in the park just right across the street  There is tons of homeless around and so we had human feces at the tail end of our truck one morning with tissue  I wish I would have known the area  I would have never picked that location  Also the neighbor on the left side was very rude to us at first  Its not worth the value I paid 
428631482,The only thing I enjoyed about this property was the memory foam mattress  Other than that it was a total miss  Check in was very easy  And location was great for us  However  every night as we tried to fall asleep there was constitution sounds like hammering all throughout the night  There was food left over in the dirty refrigerator  The bathtub was covered in hair  The floors had not been swept and the rug had not been vacuumed 
580439912,This apartment was in an amazing location  the central west end is very popular and we were within walking distance of so many shops and restaurants  Check in was very smooth  all codes worked and the instructions were clear  The decor was exactly as pictured and the beds were probably the best Ive ever slept in  Kitchen was beautiful  We did have an issue with the cleanliness of one of the bathrooms as there was a good deal of hair left  I would also suggest calling instead of messaging or sending alteration request as I didnt receive a response to any messages or request but did get resolution after I called the second time which was fine because I was just adding a third person and this unit can accommodate    Overall the place was in a great high end neighborhood and we enjoyed it very much  The location was amazing we were able to walk to a very popular area of town    The apartment decor was very nice and the beds were extremely comfortable  Kitchen was beautiful   I did feel the pictures were accurate based on layout and furniture however  there were many imperfections that seemed to just be painted over  It u    s clearly an older building so some things are to be expected however  I do feel a better job could have been done on some repairs   One of the bathrooms were super clean but the other had hair all over the floor  The rest of the space was quite clean  I didnt receive any responses to my messages or to my alteration request  The first person I spoke with was unhelpful however the second person I spoke with a few hours later to get help was great and resolved everything  More attention paid to covering imperfections
709497704,Nice place with amenities  I was warned by the Lyft driver that the location of the apartment isnt great  especially at night when I arrived from the airport  Overall nice place though  Thank you  Hair  dust and dirt
409386660,In general a nice place that was clean  in good condition with good communication with the host   It was unfortunate that the WiFi was down during my trip  I think the location could use some better general maintenance and those were some suggestions I gave to the host for improvement  Zencity  thanks for the stay at your place  It was very clean and a good comfortable place to stay  It was of course very unfortunate that the two things important to me that I asked about ahead of time WiFi and coffee were not available  I do appreciate the offer for a mifi on the last day and I understand its a bit out of your control for the WiFi  but it was important coming to Chicago working in IT needing the WiFi  I just ended up working longer hours at the office  In addition  I think you need a little more attention to general maintenance  Every single drawer in the bathroom and the TV stand were broken  Batteries were out in the remote  some light bulbs out  the wire routing was just kind of junky  some cheap falling apart furniture  understand some of these are petty  but they add up and wanted to give you an honest report so that if you do feel you want to improve for others  these are some areas for improvement   It was unfortunate timing that the internet was broken during my trip  Also a disappointment was my post inquiry  asking if coffee was stocked  which was yes  but there was only instant coffee supplied for the French press  
619710114,This place needed a deep clean  Kitchen utensils and appliances as well as cups and bowls had actual dirt and dust on them  Different layout than pictures   Completely different apt setup than anticipated  Pictures looked far better than actual space   furnishing and layout were different than advertised   Access to building was only available through key card  which we were not provided with or informed about  We got in by chance with another group  but wouldve been left out on the st if not because of the hosts unresponsiveness  None of dishes were appliances were clean and had actual dirt in bowls and cups  Did not respond to messages  Better cleanliness and responsiveness from host 
618579983,Location is very safe  with many places to eat surrounding the area  I think the cleanliness can be better  but otherwise a great Airbnb  The check in process was very easy to understand  Thank you for a great stay  Corners of walls had noticeable dust and dirt  Strange sewage type smell lingered from closet area    perhaps from water mains   Better cleanliness
611633882,Noise  The apartment itself  is quaint  check in is easy  location is good   except for the bar directly below  The music from the bar plays until   or   am every night without fail  and is unceasing  The situation needs to be dealt with  Its a bummer because without this major major drawback  this would be a nice place  Unless you plan on only sleeping from   am to    am every day  do not plan to stay here  You need to disclose the bar directly below the apartment as well as the noise  and add a white noise maker to help counter it   Apartment is located directly above a very loud bar  Description deliberately skirts this fact   See above  Situation is almost unlivable  Loud music at all hours  Not their fault  but their fault for not disclosing 
405211776,This host appears to be a property management company  If thats what youre looking for  then go for it  Otherwise  you might as well stay in a hotel  The hotel I and my father ended up having to book at   pm  due to the misrepresentation of sleeping arrangements in this apartment  was cheaper and had   queen beds and a large bathroom   This space was advertised to have sleeping space for     people  The real sleeping capacity is     people  if you share the bed  The  nd sleeping spot was advertised as a sofa bed but was just a broken couch  Not big enough for a grown adult   The host  Zencity  was unwilling to make up for their misrepresentation and did not refund  nor rehouse us for our stay in Chicago    Overall  the place was clean and quaint  The bathroom sink was updated but the bathroom itself was very small  The kitchen was nice and good enough for a short stay  If the sleeping arrangements would have been as stated  this would have been a nice space  However  false advertising and poor care by the host company  Zencity  left small margin for a good review   The photos project the place to be much bigger than reality   nThis apartment only sleeps a max of   ppl if they share the bed  The listing said      There was no sofa bed   With all of the fees and how small the bathroom is  it was cheaper and better quality to stay in a hotel 
609268638,This is in a great location and was a last minute booking for a surprise visit my family made for my birthday  While the space was clean and spacious  we had one major complaint with the communication from the host  This space is listed through a separate rental company so a lot of communication was an auto response  They were still helpful except that their check in directions listed parking overnight on Division St for free  midnight to  am  but to follow parking regulations   Please do not do this unless its April October  You canNOT park overnight in the fall and winter on Division St  This is a very confusing parking regulation due to its    inches of snow OR Nov April  restriction  that has caught many in its towing trap   It should be expressly stated when the host suggests to park there that it is for spring months only  My fathers car was towed and ticketed overnight  As an out of town visitor he was not familiar with the confusing Chicago parking signs and he followed the hosts suggestion to park there  This is a common enough confusion that I strongly urge the host to remove the suggestion  I have had no response from the host so I caution anyone unfamiliar with city signs to ignore their suggestion when booking  I strongly urge you to remove the Division St parking suggestion from your automated check in message  Out of towners are unfamiliar with Chicago street signs  While I understand that it is the visitors responsibility to follow all regulations  the Division St parking regulation signs are very confusing to most people until they get their first tow  It is misleading to suggest parking overnight on Division      outside of the spring months      since the sign entails that November to April there is NO OVERNIGHT PARKING  This parking sign has always confused many people as its restriction states  OR  during these months  Due to the hosts suggestion without strong warning  my fathers car was towed during the only visit my family will make to Chicago   The free parking information needs to be removed so there is no confusion for out of town visitors  There is NO parking on Division St from midnight to  am during this time of year  The sign can be confusing but my father read the host u    s suggestion to park on Division overnight and his car was towed   I messaged the host about my fathers car being towed and that the parking suggestion is very misleading  they did not respond 
609209647,The apartment was a great value and clean  but was above a bar which was very loud until   AM each night   I feel you should have disclosed it was above a bar that plays loud music until     am everyday   Problems with the lockbox  I would have appreciated full disclosure concerning the proximity to the bar 
602725341,Beautiful location  Very convenient with a lot of restaurants and bars in the area  Multiple groceries stores within a few minutes walk  The only issue we had was with the wifi the first day  Which was fixed by the host a day later   Wifi was a disaster the first    hours  
575823415,Great location and handy to everything downtown   Clean place in a nice safe building  Quick response from host too 
600424188,Awesome value location walking distance to UChicago campus   Clean  a  bit sparse  Adding an extra comfy chair to the  living room would be nice if there is more than one person staying there  Decoration and furnishings a bit more sparse 
572981534,I am sure this place will be amazing once renovations are complete  but I had the misfortune of coming  during a major renovation  There were a couple issues I needed which forced me to have to move locations  You may want to double check when booking to ensure renovations are complete  First before even booking I had asked about gym and being able to use it prior to arriving and they stated that it was in the building and I could use it any time  When I arrived I had to keep asking about where the gym was  then come to find out it was not available due to renovation  They also did not tell me they were going through a major renovation  which was too much to handle  The noise started about      am in  the morning and continued through the afternoon  I had to move apartment complexes because the renovation was right outside my room and they didnt have any other space available in the building  They said they would give me a refund if I booked with another location through AirBNB with them  which I did  but the refund was a fraction of the cost  I suppose I should have validated the refund amount prior to booking my new stay with ZenCity  The other place was further out  but at least I could rest well  Please next time try to be more accurate with your description and if doing renovations make sure you have disclosed that to the person reserving space  This was hugely disruptive for my business trip   I had asked about gym and being able to use it prior to arriving and they stated that it was in the building and I could use it any time  When I arrived I had to keep asking about where the gym was  then come to find out it was not available due to renovation  They also did not tell me they were going through a major renovation  which was too much to handle  I had to move locations  They said they would give me a refund if I booked with another location  which I did  but the refund was a fraction of the cost   The place was under major renovation and there were no clear signs to my room  I spent about    minutes walking around to find it  The apartment had just finished renovation  There was a little dust and it looks like someone used the toilet and forgot to flush  They were slow to respond to me and when they did it wasnt really answering my questions  I even posted a message complaining about the noise with the renovations and they send me a welcome email to check to see how my stay was  It was like they did not even read my message prior to emailing me  It was a descent location  there wasnt very much really close by  Super inexpensive  but that was probably due to the major renovation going on  I hope it is better once complete 
402762132,I enjoyed the concierge services provided and location   However I found that a lot of the items advertised were not in the apartment  i e  microwave oven and dishwasher  and ample supply of cooking ware and supplies    I didnt see an ample supply of cooking ware as mentioned from previous reviews and I do agree that the pillows were too soft  as well as the fact that you have a second bathroom in this location is great   The parking on the street can be a pain at times but  you can find parking a couple of blocks away   I found the workout equipment to be a bit dated   However have membership with  Planet Fitness      Overall I would recommend services with Zencity  The pictures and descriptions states that you have a dishwasher  microwave and theres boasting about having plenty of cooking ware when in fact it is false    I was asked what you could do to make my stay better  I requested a microwave oven and I received some generic response of  Thank you for letting you know   You are going to get this resolved for future customers    I was completely disappointed  Especially considering that I have been a repeat customer and faithfully spoke about your organization to others in order to help you maintain business and the disregard for the fact that you are advertising what you do not have to excuse the situation with you will have this for your next customers   Does not resolve the issues that I was dealing with at the time   Lets try to make smart and simple solutions to small matters   In order that you dont leave a stain or distrust in your customers mindset   Thank you  Shae  The listing states that it has a microwave and dishwasher and the kitchen doesn u    t have any of these items   Plus very limited kitchen supplies and cookware   The cleaning supplies were limited as well   Honestly it could have been offered at a lot less than the price requested on the weekend 
592164656,Watch for the final price as it was much more than originally listed on the final calculation before paying   The location is wonderful and the house is quite beautiful and spacious   Queen size beds are very comfortable   The heat floats upstairs so you will want to turn it down at night  Did not feel welcoming as signs listed reminders of being quiet and no smoking   Please note that on Saturday night the marijuana smell from next door was very  intense and wafted into the master bedroom   There was no soap in the soap dispensers anywhere downstairs   No instructions on how to operate the television   It would have been nice to have your suggestions of favorite diners and how where to pick up public transportation   Most of all was the price being listed so much lower than actual   The price should reflect the actual price on the dates   Some mold around shower  No soap in soap dispensers in kitchen  downstairs bathroom 
402758169,This place was great  It was easy to find and very clean  I booked this for my parents while they were visiting from out of state  They said the bed was very comfortable  The only issue was that the furnace was really loud when it kicked on and off  and they did not have hot water during their stay  I messaged the host about the hot water and did not hear back  Other than that  it was a perfect stay and they really enjoyed themselves  I gave four stars because I let you know that my parents did not have hot water during the stay and I did not receive a response   There were two big sets of staircases to get up to the apartment  I don u    t believe it listed that in the posting when I booked this for my parents  My mom is handicap and had some difficulty with the stairs  It may have been listed and i could have missed it because I booked it quickly  
590797389,Do not try to change your dates  Marty will say   No Problem  Then Marty will say   just cancel your reservation and i will rebook you for the dates needed  Then marty will tell you that RIGHT AFTER you cancelled someone swooped in and took your dates  Sooo sorry  BUT dont worry  i have an inferior room for the SAME price  You booked a   bedroom  well  this one has one bedroom  and it costs      for   nights on AirBnB   however   its going to cost you good folks      for   nights  the cost of   bedrooms  just because i know you are in a hospital having cancer surgery and its probably incredibly inconvenient to find other more suitable accomodations with so little time now  Sigh  Marty  you little enterpriser you  Double charging for inferior accomodations is bad business  But having people cancel and then taking advantage of them is just grotesque  You should be ashamed of yourself for double charging me for an inferior room  If you were a good person you would have charged me the proper amount  especially after you made a mistake by not taking care of my reservation like we discussed  Im dying so i no longer mince words  Karma is real  The next time you get taken advantage of  i hope you think of me  May you get everything you deserve in       Marty      That we would be able to change our dates with ease  After being double charged for an inferior room  nothing was easy   Host told us he could accomodate switching our dates  but he instead had us cancel our reservation  then waited until it was booked by someone else before offering us an inferior room with one bedroom for the same price he booked us two bedrooms  When we looked up the room it was half of what he charged us  We were double charged for an inferior room   As i was having cancer surgery at the University of Chicago nearby  we had to stay near the hospital a week after   My    year old mother slept on a couch  I dont understand how Zen City is allowed to operate with such shady business tactics  If the host had not swindled us by pretending he could accomodate a date change  that he let someone else book after asking us to cancel our reservation  then offering us a one bedroom       for   nights room  but charging us      like we were still getting our   bedrooms  DOUBLE CHARGING US FOR AN INFERIOR ROOM  How is this allowed to occur  We would not have cancelled our reservation or asked to change the dates had we known Marty at Zen City would do that  If i hadnt been attached to    cords in the hospital i would have found other accomodations  but after having my torso opened up  i had no strength to fight the power  Nothing zen about zen city  I feel taken advantage of in my time of need frankly  Marty should be ashamed  there are things you dont do to the dying  Ripping them off surely has to be one of the unspoken rules 
401432321,Amazing location  fast response  the host was helpful and netflix was complimentary  There was a couple issues that I discussed with the host and they were as helpful as they could be  Still a great host I will use you guys again
590069736,Interior was nice and spacious  However  this apartment is directly above a bar thats open and playing music until   am on weeknights and   am weekends  If you like to go to bed in the quite or early this place is not for you   Right above a bar with loud music  Great area in town  not great above the bar
618789274,Great spot near the hospital and park  as well as being walkable to many many spots nearby  The Roku remote was basically non functional and the wifi information was not correct  the wifi info on the chalkboard on the kitchen    Otherwise the stay was painless and the location and space was top tier 
707609270,Great place to stay and very clean 
571849973,My experience was not amazing  but I am sure that yours could be  My problems with this particular listing were with security  the smartlock did not have batteries in it when I arrived and therefore was useless   There were no batteries in the apartment  otherwise I would have just resolved the issue myself  So I messaged through the app  due to it being Thanksgiving night I figured that they wouldnt be able to come out that night to fix the lock  which I understood   there was a deadbolt and I was able to safely spend the night  I took my stuff with me to work the following day since I couldnt secure it in the apartment until after they fixed my lock that day  a minor inconvenience  not something that would ruin a trip  They came on Black Friday  put batteries in and I came back to a lock that was not responsive  I attempted several times to put in the code and it would not accept it  It even set off an alarm  causing it to lock me out for five minutes from the panel and then reset and accepted the passcode that I had put in the same way every time  I messaged them and let them know about the issue  I was able to get in and secure the lock  slept  woke up  went to work and was able to lock the door behind me with the keypad  Came back from work and it was a repeat of the night before  I checked out the next morning as planned and only then did they offer to talk to me about the problem with the keypad    Additionally  they were very upfront about the fact that the building itself was still under construction but assured me that the apartment was ready to go  This was kinda true  The lock was clearly not ready to go and additionally there was a wall mount for a television  but no television  and a lamp that sat on the kitchen counter but was meant to go somewhere else because it was not near an outlet and uplugged  just chilling  There was also a water bottle filled with used paint water from when they painted  Furthermore  there was a trashcan in the closet the night I checked in  but after they came to put batteries in the lock  the trashcan mysteriously disappeared  All of these things would have been minor inconveniences and not earned a poor review from me  I am a reasonable person  But as a cumulative experience it was not great  I am sure that once they are finished with the building  it will be a nice place to stay  The bed was comfortable  there were plenty of dishes and flatware to use and space to lounge  But it was not a finished product and should not have been listed as a place to stay until it was checked for completion  I truly hope that you read and understand the comments that I submitted  I can tell that the furnishings are nice and that once the building is done this will be something that I am sure a lot of people will enjoy  I understood when I agreed to stay that the  common areas  were under construction but perhaps a quality check run should have been made to the apartment to ensure that the issues I mentioned were resolved  Particularly the lock  Best of luck in your future endeavors   While they were upfront about the building being brand new and   common areas   under construction they said that the room itself was   ready to go    A reasonable traveler would assume that the amenities listed and certainly the lock would be ready to go for someone to stay safely in their location  This was not the case  The smart lock did not even have batteries in it when I checked in   I messaged them to let them know that I was able to just walk in to the apartment and they were not able to come out  it was late on a holiday   I understood   but this should not even have been an issue to begin with  Additionally there was a lamp on the kitchen counter that was clearly meant to be placed somewhere but instead was placed on the counter not plugged in  Furthermore  the television was not in the apartment   there was the mount for it   but the television itself was not there  I understood the building itself was under construction when I agreed to stay   I did not realize however that the apartment was not truly ready   The directions to where this unit G  was located were not very clear and I spent a good ten minutes walking back and forth across the downstairs to attempt to find the location of the apartment  When I got there I was pretty positive I had to be in the wrong location because the door was already opened and not locked at all  The lock would not work and upon further inspection did not even have batteries in it  There were no batteries for me to put in the lock   otherwise I would have just fixed this issue myself  I messaged to let them know that this was an issue  There was a deadbolt that I was able to use to securely lock myself in for the night  However  when I went to work the next day I had to pack everything back up because there was no way to lock the apartment when I left   even though I was staying for a longer visit  They came the next day and put batteries in the lock   when I got back from work the lock would not accept the very long code that they had set  I tried multiple times until a little alarm went off  Then after five  minutes of waiting it let me back in  I had messaged to say there was a problem but by the time they got back to me I was able to get the lockpad to finally accept the code that I had been punching in since the beginning  The next night I had the same issue when I was coming back from work with the keypad not accepting the code   blaring the alarm   then accepting the code  even though I had put in the exact same code each time  They didnt contact me until AFTER I was gone to talk to them about the experience that I had with the lock  Even though it was a multi day issue  When I arrived to the apartment there was a water bottle full of paint water in the sink  While I understand that the entire building is under construction this was disappointing  Furthermore  when someone came to inspect the lock and why it was not working  there were no batteries   they took away the trash can that had been in the apartment   so I had to place all trash in the tiny bathroom trash can  I understand that my trip was over the holiday weekend  but as a nurse I cannot help that I have to work on the holidays or the day after and require a place to stay  A security issue like the lock not working should have elicited a little bit more of a response  Like I said previously I understand someone not coming out at   PM on Thanksgiving night  But the future issues with the lock not working could have been looked into in a more timely fashion  Due to all of the issues with the listing   the lock not working  the unfinished nature of the apartment  the lack of timely communication about a security issue like the lock  I would say that it was not a great experience  This place had some very nice finishes where it was complete and it is obvious that this will be a nice place to stay once it is completely finished  But if the room wasnt ready  which it clearly was not as evidenced by the water bottle full of paint water in the sink  the random lamp on the counter  and the lack of a television and the lock not even having batteries in it  it should not have been advertised for a visit  Furthermore  when they came to install batteries in the lock   I was surprised to discover that they took the trashcan from the closet where it was stored  It was there the evening before and then randomly disappeared  I was happy I had taken my personal belongings with me in the morning  I am not a particularly picky person but all of this together was just a bit much  While it may be a nice place to stay in the future  it would take quite a bit to convince me to stay again when there are many other options in the area that have had seamless and pleasant experiences 
584865355,This place is a great value to be near the city centre  We had four of us   two couples  when we took an uber it was about    dollars to millennium park   We loved everything about the Airbnb  Great value Only thing was when we wanted to spend the night in   the couch space is not comfortable after a long day of walking around  the beds were VERY comfortable 
582207221,Our stay was very underwhelming  First I would like to say the customer service was great  the photos were pretty accurate  and the cost was reasonable  which is why I added a star  The frustration came on the first night when we realized we couldnt cool the apartment  The apartment has radiator heat  no central air  and the ac unit had been taken out   placed in the closet  The bedroom window was broken so we had to find a book to keep it open  still not enough air circulated  We ultimately moved the mattress into the living room and opened all of the windows  Although it helped a little  it still was not enjoyable  We were HOT every single night  Secondly  the shower had extremely low pressure once turned to  hot and we never had a hot shower  only warm water  The toilet also made loud disturbing noises through the night  Possibly a plumbing issue  Thirdly  the couch is absolutely horrible  The only television is in the living room  however dont expect to enjoy a comfortable watch in there on that couch  Lastly  if you want to actually land a decent park  you better be back around  p  maybe   Any time after that you can expect to walk a decent distance unless you want to pay for parking  After inquiring about it  I was under the impression that street parking would be less of the hassle it was  All in all the stay wasnt the worst  but it couldve been so much better  Just take notes of this review before you make a decision  Please be more honest about amenities and parking availability   No air conditioning as listed   Air conditioning  good water pressure hot water  and realistic parking expectations
580901909,This place is quiet and conveniently located in a nice neighborhood with lots of restaurants  It is relatively convenient to get to the Loop from the blue line  and a slightly longer walk to the Fulton Market neighborhood  The amenities are minimal inside the apartment  but it is safe and secure  We made due with the space  but it was pretty filthy when we got there  Most disturbing was the hair all over the bedding and towels  I am not sure whether it was an issue of where laundry is done or if the maid is not keeping an eye on her own hair while cleans  but it was very upsetting  The smell of the shower curtains was also incredibly unappealing and it was difficult to feel clean at any point during our stay  You were very responsive in your communication and we appreciated the convenience at check in  Thank you   The photos are generous as far as the cleanliness and size of the space  The space is VERY small   There werent dust bunnies all over the floor in the living and bedrooms  the closets were dusty  there was hair all over the bedding and towels  and the rug in the loving room was filthy  The shower curtain smelled bad  We ended up vacuuming  bought new shower curtains  Swiffer sweepers  and Clorox wipes  and cleaned ourselves  It was a little bit further than  steps  from shops and the metro  but still very conveniently located  It was affordable  but still a bit over priced for the lack of space and cleanliness  The water pressure in the shower was terrible  we had no control over the radiator  and the bed was very uncomfortable 
580393993,For the price you cant beat it Please fix the radiator in the bedrooms they hissed ALLLLLLLLL Night making it impossible to sleep other than that dishwasher was broke but we didnt need it  Size was a tad bit smaller than expected  Was something on the bathroom floor
616042470,I I never received a key fob  Crumbs on counter  Had to wash dry the towels to get a wash cloth which there was only   of  Received checkout instructions after I was already gone  I came for a funeral there was so much going on i wanted to not have to think about the place im staying  I was embarrassed that i told my family to stay there   for my moms first airbnb experience to be like that  Never had a key fob for parking  I wanted my mom to get her own messages but they never added her to booking Crumbs all over counter i had to wash to get a clean face cloth Only uses automated  Never responded to any issues Price was   times as high as my first time  Twice as high as my booking the week before with no explanation nothing going on in the city
579032473,This was all about location for me  Perfect  It had everything I needed  The stairwell seemed a little sketchy and I didnt love climbing up   flights  but it was as described  Clean and inviting  The neighbors were very loud one night around    pm and the curtains could be wider and have some sort of shade to keep it darker  The lights from the back of the building at night were bright This was all about location for me  Perfect  It had everything I needed  The stairwell seemed a little sketchy and I didnt love climbing up   flights  but it was as described  Clean and inviting  The neighbors were very loud one night around    pm and the curtains could be wider and have some sort of shade to keep it darker  The lights from the back of the building at night were bright The listing states  starts at       I feel like this is just an attention grabber  The price was actually     and with taxes and cleaning fees it came to about      per night  Really FAR from    
618602674,Great place  bad neighbors  terrible host  Did not approve my change to reduce number of people staying which would have resulted in a refund  Zencity now refuses to honor this because the reservation has ended  During our stay  the permanent neighbors were very loud and the upstairs neighbors flooded their toilet which resulted in poo water literally raining from the ceiling  Zencity did not send someone to clean this up after we called to report the incident  In fact  they did not follow up at all after we reported it  The place was otherwise great  just under poor management  Overall happy with the space but very unhappy with the lack of communication on the part of your company  I am owed       for having only   people in the apartment and I will be reaching out to Airbnb about this and how the maintenance issue was handled  Kitchen pots and pans were not clean  One pan in particular had been left in the oven and was covered in grime  I requested the number of people on my reservation be changed as we had people back out  The change was never approved even though I messaged the host several times  before the stay and before the stay was over  I also messaged about safety and maintenance issues we dealt with during our stay and the host never responded 
594447134,Beautiful natural light makes the space feel big and bright  A few small issues but overall a solid value stay  At the time we stayed the couch was not an option for sleeping so consider this a   guest space  The location is great and the old renovated building charming  Host was responsive  We loved the location  We loved the building  The sheets were clean and soft  Natural light was beautiful  Attend to the issues that I mentioned and you will have happy guests  Hi related again to the couch  the listing says it sleeps    We only had   but needed the couch for the  th  I messaged the host before booking and was told an average sized adult could comfortably sleep on the couch but this is completely inaccurate  Not long enough for an adult and the bottom couch cushion doesn u    t even extend end to end     I think you should get a longer couch or a sofa bed or change your listing to   people   Hi there the space we stayed in had a few small issues  One was the couch looked like it had never been vacuumed under or behind any cushions  One of the guests was told he could sleep on the couch but it was very dirty  We tried vacuuming but the vacuum is old and weak  I recommend a new better vacuum for the space and maybe a couch upgrade  The price would have been great if not for the issues we had   Two more issues  the kitchen soap dispenser doesnt work and the light over the sink doesnt work
591609228,This apartment is a decent value in nice proximity to Lincoln Square and the El  but I cant say Id recommend it  Not particularly clean and a lot of little issues with the amenities that make clear its not very well tended to  Overall its fine for a night or two  but if youre planning an extended stay in Chicago you should look elsewhere   The listing made this place seem much tidier and well put together than it was  Lots of weird issues that made it clear the apartment isn u    t very well maintained  including loose knobs in the doors  a missing piece of the sink handle  and a bit of molding for the floor that was totally loose   Biggest issue was the sink in the bathroom  which really didnt seem like it had been cleaned at all  The seats in the common area were also stained  which was a little off putting  Communication was mostly fine  Only issue was that it took them a couple weeks to respond to my request to add an extra day to my reservation  The place is affordable  but Im still pretty confidant I could find a much better taken care of spot in the neighborhood for the same price 
590470777,The laundry is not free at all  anywhere  as the listing said that there is FREE or unfree laundry   The apartment was spotless  the only problem was that there was hair on the bed from someone before us  Unsure if it was not washed or if it did not come off from the washer  We had to wash the blanket ourselves  To be able to do laundry  you have to go to another building to do it  The card is     on top of a    fee to do the laundry in the main building  The dryers there also suck at drying  Besides that  it was clean  no concerns otherwise   Hyde Park is a somewhat decent neighborhood  Looks a bit unsafe but its decent  Its in walking distance of Whole Foods  restaurants  and gas stations   You can hear traffic next to the window at night  so if that is a concern for you  then I would not stay   The host was very nice and answered my question  Had to call twice though   ALSO parking is terrible  Absolutely terrible  If you dont show up by    youre going to be driving around the lot for a long while  There is no parking pass included for this stay  Hopefully that is something that comes about sooner or later  Parking is the most stressful thing to deal with at this place  so if you dont have patience for it  then stay somewhere that has accessible parking because even when you find a spot  its going to be a long walk in the cold   The TV has several watching options  as well as Netflix  so thats a plus   The mattress is firm  You will literally sweat ALL night with the thick blanket they provide  as well as the firm mattress which is not ideal  so bring your own comforter if you dont want to be hot and maybe lay something underneath you   Overall  it was a comfortable stay and Id recommend it if you dont mind all of the comments above   A BIT smaller than expected  Was unclear about it being a studio apartment   The bed had some hair on it as well as the pillows  There was also a yellow stain that was on the bed spread  We had to wash the blanket with our own money  We also had to travel to another building just to buy a    card to do the laundry  On top of that        to wash the actual blanket in our own building  Called once  no answer  Called twice  answered 
586273846,There were a couple of issues with this listing that were purely cosmetic  a broken smoke detector that was never fixed though we reported it  blood stains and dirt on the comforter  and a severely clogged tub    But the dealbreaker was noise  Every morning other than Sunday and a Wednesday that fell on New Years Day during a week long stay  we were awakened by trash collection noises  dumpsters rolling over pavement  revving and beeping trucks  that began between      and      am and lasted between    minutes and an hour  This is because both sets of bedroom windows overlook the alley where trash collection  takes place  a fact not mentioned in the listing  In addition  the apartment is located directly above the buildings trash room  which dumpsters were rolled in and out of repeatedly  Though we reported this issue to the host and provided photo documentation of trash collection happening immediately below our bedroom window  they denied that trash collection was occurring     and suggested the problem was our  sensitivity to noise   Had there been mention of the alley and the trash noises in the listing  we would never have booked this Airbnb    In short  noisy  dark  and not super clean  Hosts denied the noise was a problem despite ample documentation and refused to give a partial refund for the disruption to our stay  Though the building and location are lovely  I would steer clear of this unit and perhaps ZenCity altogether  Your business model seems to be to fail to disclose crucial details about your listing  noise  and then deny there is a problem when guests complain  The reason I didnt respond to requests for further clarification about the other stuff  smoke detector  gross menstrual blood stains on a comforter  is that it was relatively nbd  but together with being awakened by truck beeping and dumpster rolling     days of our vacation  it made for a pretty shitty experience  Rest assured I will be escalating this to Airbnb and letting my many local friends  Im a native Hyde Parker  know never to rent from ZenCity   Every morning other than Sunday and a Wednesday that fell on New Year u    s day during a nearly week long stay  we were awakened by trash collection noises  dumpsters rolling over pavement  revving and beeping trucks  that began between      and      am and lasted between    minutes and an hour  This is because both sets of bedroom windows overlook the alley where trash collection  takes place u     a fact not mentioned in the listing  In addition  the apartment is located directly over the building trash space  which dumpsters were rolled in and out of repeatedly  Though we reported this to the host and provided photo documentation of trash collection happening immediately below our bedroom window  they denied that trash collection was occurring     and suggested the problem was our  u   csensitivity to noise  u   d Had there been mention of the alley and the trash noises in the listing  I would never have booked this Airbnb   Tub was clogged  Comforters had bloodstains and dirt on them  In addition to the gross conditions in the bedroom and bathroom   which we might have ignored if not for the horrible morning noise   we reported a chirping smoke detector upon our arrival and were told a work order to fix it was submitted  However  the smoke detector remained dismantled and nonfunctional throughout our week long stay  Noisy  dark  and not super clean  Hosts denied the noise was a problem despite ample documentation and refused to give a partial refund for the disruption to our stay  Though the building and location are lovely  I would steer clear of this unit and perhaps ZenCity altogether 
582741447,Zen City is D O P E     Love the hospitality and amazing location  Definitely recommend  The place is nice clean and great neighborhood  Ask about parking rules  Thanks again Zen City     Thank you Zen city      Our stay was great  We appreciate the hospitality  Looking forward to booking here again soon  Please let guest know in the description not to park on the street due to no parking permit or I would suggest an parking permit offer for maybe a small fee  Please let me know once the jacuzzi is fixed my family was bummed we couldnt use  Great stay    Love the water   ice maker     Again thank you   The Hot tub not working    leak and no parking permit notification  
577531086,Ive never had a problem with Airbnb before and Im sure this was a miscommunication that can be easily fixed  We were unable to get into the place  The instructions were clear and we followed them   they just didnt work  The key from the lockbox did not open the door of the house with the correct address  Not sure why  We tried multiple times and tried to get in touch with the host but it was late and cold so we never got to use the place  The pictures look great and Im sue it wouldve been a great stay if we were able to get in  Hey there  Im not sure what happened  Ive been using Airbnb since      and have never had an issue  Im sure this was a miscommunication but we were not able to get into the airbnb  We tried several times  We were able to retrieve the key from the lockbox but it was not opening  It was the right building as well  It was freezing so after    minutes of trying we gave up and went to my apartment  It was a bummer  Wish I couldve gotten in touch with you because the place looked great from the photos  Hope it can get fixed for the next person   We were unable to open and get into the accommodation   We were not able to get into the location 
571983578,Location is great  Five individual bedrooms and Q beds are very clean and comfy  Kitchen is understocked for more than four  but we ate out so that wasnt a big deal  Great neighborhood  The location is great and five bedrooms with Q beds are terrific   allows a large group like ours to stay together  The beds are comfortable and rooms are pleasant  Thank you  That was all great  However  as I mentioned in the review  the kitchen really needs work   there are only four coffee cups and we were nine people  We had to take turns drinking coffee  and one day my husband drank his out of a bowl just so he could join us  There was no kitchen sink dish scrubber and no dish drying rack or pad  so we had to dry dishes in the dishwasher  also no soap in the shower so we bought that  Also  under the kitchen sink is pretty dirty  so you dont really want to use supplies from there  It feels like guests would really not want to spend time eating at the apartment  Also  the outside front door lock seems like it is breaking or something    it is very difficult to work  only a couple of us could get the key to work in it   The kitchen is not supplied adequately for eating in   which was mostly ok for us because we wanted to eat out  Morning coffee was an issue  as there are only four coffee cups and we had nine people   While the apartment itself was very clean  there were no supplies with which to wash and dry dishes 
563978116,WARNING  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL   Misleading description of this accommodation  This accommodation is above a pub and unbearable loud music is played till      am  We tried to sleep as we had long business days ahead of us  but the music was so loud that the floor was vibrating from the speakers and was impossible to relax or sleep   It was clear for us  we cannot stay in this apartment and be fully functional for our next business day s  Half an hour after we tried to go in the bed  around   pm  we booked another hotel  and left the apartment with our entire luggage  The other reasons we decided to leave this place was the cleanliness of the apartment   so unacceptable   the mid frame of the split window next to the oven was with a greasy black layer and full of black sponge pieces  looks like dead flies laying on it  I tried to sit on the coach before to go to the bed and watch TV  but it is an old piece of furniture  looks like collected from the street with unpleasant smell and broken springs  I could not sit more than   min before I felt the hurting pain on my bones from the broken springs  The ventilation fan on the ceiling  greasy and dirty as well  additionally was generating loud noises like tractor  which I stopped with the hope that it will reduce the noise in the apartment  The  nd bedroom door was with penetrated hole  THE BREATHING AIR IN THE APARTMENT WAS HEAVY AND STALE  I lost        CAD thanks to the hosts misleading information and in spite of proving them wrong  the host refuse to reimburse me at all  Here is the misleading description at the time of our booking that the hose word it like that     The home is just a short walk from the park and the lake and stones throw from number of bars  restaurants and entertainment venues    This   stones throw  is not the same as above the bar in one wooden ceiling distance  A child can even throw a stone at least    yards  Ironically at the time of our booking  the House rules    says   Quiet time after   pm  Please read it twice before you get burned as we did with this booking and Zencitys management company   Misleading description  nIt says       stone u    s throw from number of bars        BUT does not say that is above a bar and loud music run till     am  nIronically a rule of house    is    Quiet time after   pm   when the floor is vibrating from the pubs music underneath   Old and scratchy place   Greasy black layer on the middle window frame next to the oven   With the first look  looks like dead flys all over on that frame  but happen to be old black pieces from falling apart sponge   Greasy ventilation outlets  some of them broken   Unpleasant smell coming from old and broken coach   Heavy and stale air  unhealthy and damaging my lungs  Second bedroom is with a penetrated hole  look from inside of the room  unpainted  scratches etc  The host nether responded to our request for additional person  The host did not admit the misleading and slippery description of the apartment  hide the information of loud music every night till      am and refused to reimburse me with         CAD for refusing to stay in their accommodation  Unlisted from AirBnB and save other people money and the frustration we had to go through 
562328973,Great location  close to many attractions  PLease add coffee maker  thank you   They gave inaccurate information about the number of beds and baths  The photos were not of the apartment  The messages came from different people and they did not all include accurate information  The responses were slow at times  Very slow  And there were not all the amenities in the kitchen  For example  no way to make coffee   Slow to respond  gave inaccurate information  It is owned by a company that does not put one person in charge of the listing  It was a last minute rental that must have just come open and they did not fully vet the place 
561429598,Not a good stay  We have used Air BnB frequently in the past   months  and had a really disappointing experience here  The space had glowing reviews for being clean  which we did not find to be the case  The building was shabby and had a very unpleasant smell  The heat was locked at     so we couldnt get the room to cool down making it impossible to sleep through the night  We also could not get the hot water to work  We left for a hotel after one evening   We didn u    t feel the photos accurately represented the space   Some stray hairs in the bathroom  a pretty unpleasant smell in the building and the room  building was shabby and felt unsafe  The area surrounding was great but the building was not cracked up to what the description painted it to be  We paid far too much for such an unpleasant experience  We only stayed one night and ended up moving to a hotel because we were so uncomfortable in the space  Lost about      for a one night stay that was supposed to be a fun  relaxing getaway weekend 
555353754,Great location on a cute street and easy check in process  I was disappointed that the bathroom liner was moldy and that the unit had what was to me an overwhelming undesirable smell and feel of cleaning products   Unlike the picture  no shower curtain  Also coffee maker was broken   The bathroom shower curtain liner was caked with pink mold along the bottom  There was no actual shower curtain  just the liner   The bedroom was dusty under the bed  heater  and in the corners  including a layer of dust on the fan  There was no tea kettle  so I tried to heat water in the coffee maker  only to discover the bottom of the pot was cracked and unusable  Would have been a much better value if the overwhelming smell had not been present  the bedroom had been dusted  the bathroom had a fresh liner and curtain  and the coffee maker had worked  At the price youre asking  you also might consider adding a nice touch like those snacks you mentioned in the listing  or simply something else to make the place more friendly 
554599567,Nice little apartment with many great restaurants nearby  close to the blue line to downtown   OHare  Great base for a Chicago trip   However  the heating is quite noisy and the bedrooms cant be properly dimmed  We had some problems with the heating  It didnt work in the morning late evening  but only during the day  when we were typically not in the apt    The bedrooms could use a paint job   a proper cupboard   Place was a bit run down  Hair on pillows   floor
554079618,This place is in an incredible location  but lacks basic comforts and wasnt very clean  The weird chemical smell reported in other reviews is definitely true and not just in the hallway  but actually inside the place  Also  someone entered the apartment on our last morning before the check out time which was a bit weird  If you are simply looking for a crash pad while exploring Chicago  its just fine  but there is nothing special about it besides the location  FYI if you do end up staying here  you can park for free about a half block away on Wood St   this house was bare bones had no supplies for cooking or general comforts  the record player was inoperable and furniture was cheap and uncomfortable  carpet was so dirty left dust on clothing when sitting on the floor  both beds had stains and hair on linens  the shower hasnt been cleaned in months at least and had several used bars of soap inside which is nasty adding some more home y touches would help a lot
552505172,Chris with Zencity communicated very well and offered clear constructions  He was very helpful  We had an issue with the shower door  or lack of water retention  Each time someone showered the bathroom floor would be flooded and it was an inconvenience to keep dry and clean    Also  the restaurant bar below could be heard morning and night  That might be mentioned in the description for that location 
550908175,My stay with Zencity was reasonable  Excellent location if you want something close to food   groceries and close to Barnes Jewish hospital  The building is renovated but still a bit rundown   the unit itself is certainly acceptable but not as nice as the photos suggests  The hosts were not very responsive or accommodating with respect to options for early check in  The hosts followed up to request a   star review from me after my stay  which is unethical in my opinion 
548402981,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    uce    uacc  ub e  uc  c ub  c ub cc  ub    uc b  uc    ub e  ub    uac    ubaa  ub    uace   uc    uc  d ud    ub    ub     uc d   uc  c ub ac ub    ub     uc    uae    ud    ub e  uc c  uc b  ub c  ub e                                                                     
547063843,This is on the fourth floor of a building with no elevator  Luckily my family is able bodied but this was not made clear in the description  The apartment had been cleaned thoroughly however the chemical cleaner smell was so incredibly strong upon arrival  we were forced to leave windows open in    degree weather for seven hours before the smell dissipated  The apartment was uncomfortably cold  I do not make it a habit to complain  and never have before re  an Airbnb experience  but especially since this is run by a company and not a homeowner  I wouldve expected such a better response  Did not even receive an apology  let alone the offer to reimburse us even for a fraction of the price  It was very expensive for an Airbnb but given the high traveled weekend and great location  I was willing to pay the price  I wish I wouldve stayed at a hotel in the area instead for a slightly higher cost instead  I will not book with Zencity again  I appreciated your quick responses  However  I was disappointed that I did not receive even an apology when I reported the strong chemical floor cleaner smell  It was over four hours before the smell was gone and windows had to be left open that entire time  It was    degrees  Luckily we had plans to where we did not need to be in the Airbnb but the point is  we paid for the entire time  If that had happened in a hotel  we wouldve been offered a new room or money taken off of the total of our stay there  The smell was so strong it was nauseating  I got there at   pm and opened windows  and when my family arrived later at   pm it was still too strong  By    pm when we returned again  we could finally shut the windows but the apartment was uncomfortably cold  For over        the price for which we couldve stayed in a hotel  I would expect better customer service  I would also like to note that I have stayed in several Airbnbs  that either friends or family or I have booked  and I have never complained   I think it should be noted that this is on the fourth floor of a tall building with no elevator  Unapologetic for inconvenience and strong cleaner smell in the apt  took over four hours to air out This was priced very high  I believe it was likely inflated for marathon weekend but I wouldnt have paid the price otherwise  Mightve rated higher had we received a better response when I reported the smell in the apartment
547275562,We had an amazing stay  The check in was very easy and the location could not have been better  The airbnb was clean and we had plenty of towels  blankets etc  We had some troubles with the dishwasher which we brought to the attention of the owner but wanted to make future travellers aware that it did leak all over the floor  Luckily we were at the airbnb when we noticed  however  if we turned it on before leaving it would have caused major damage  We would stay here again if we travel to Chicago in the future 
546579271,Amazing views and great location   The amenities floor with the library and gym was wonderful  Was basically clean  but could use a deeper clean   walls and vents scrubbing etc  and a more thorough mop sweep job   If you arent planning on doing much in the kitchen its perfect  Because obviously  the location cant be beat  But if you were planning on cooking  which I was  it was just too bare bones  No oven mitt  the pots and pans were sparse and not very good sized and in truly beat up condition   Enjoyed my time here  but the price range it was in made me expect a little bit more  Location is amazing  view is too  but some of the details need work  Used to work in quality control for vacation condos in Hawaii   details is what I do   Most bare bones kitchen Ive been in in an Airbnb  Really not usuable for anything beyond coffee  cereal etc   Needs a good deep cleaning  Walls need scrubbing and so does the vent  Also seemed like the cleaners didnt bother to get underneath the bed  which is super visible since the bed frame is high off the floor A kitchen with enough amenities to cook in  There was no oven mitt  no mixing bowl  the pots and pans were all scraped up which means with non stick they are toxic  and the two pots were very small  I gave up on cooking 
544234880,Positive things  very easy check in  quiet nights  good fridge  comfy beds  And the neighborhood is nice    min walk to Damen CTA station  Sadly  the place is more run down than the pictures imply  Also  we felt that after       reviews  this host  who rents several apartments as a business  has become somewhat complacent  The bedsheets were crumpled and contained hair  theres plenty of dust under the bed  and the living room carpet and sofa are in desperate need of a deep cleansing  On a minor note  expect to be innundated with  obviously automated  messages  This is not a   star airbnb experience  but if you cant find a better deal  this will do fine   The has been run down since the pictures were taken  Its not as fresh as it looks   Dust under the bed  crumpled bedsheets with hair on them  living room carpet and sofa are seriously dirty  Unneccessary automated messages 
543833174,Very convenient location for utilizing the CTA system and being in the heart of Boystown     The suite was very clean and modern  Thanks   Would definitely stay at the Bel again but we prefer s suite that faces the street rather than subway station   Did not mention the suite was looking over a major subway train station   A bit loud at times and runs late into the night   Still loved the location overall   Also   the fact that there is no elevator may be a problem for others     not sure if that was mentioned in the description somewhere   Just didnt mention it was right beside the Belmont station   Was great for convenience of using public transportation system but a bit loud at times 
669171326,Nice place to stay with a lot of space It was hair left on the shower wall
569155597,Firstly except to park a half mile to a mile away  We found a parking garage about a mile away that cost us around     day  Check in was easy and quick  When we walked into the apartment the first thing we noticed was the very dirty and stained carpet  The apartment has plenty of space for     people  The bed was very hard and the traffic noise kept us up  mainly ambulance sirens heading to the hospital  Luckily I brought my fan so it helped drown the noise out  The kitchen had everything you needed for cooking  The TV had Netflix and Sling which was nice  The couch was pretty comfy  which is where I slept most of the second night  There is a Whole Foods close and lots of bars and restaurants near by  probably a       min walk  And of course the hospital is right down the road  Thank you for hosting us  Some suggestions would be to clean the carpet  when we walked in that was the first thing we noticed  It kinda made us feel like the whole place was not clean  The bed was very hard and we did not get a good nights sleep  Those were the only reasons why we gave your place a   star  Thanks again  Carpet was very dirty
536412666,Zencity is picky about policies  so tread carefully and read the fine print  I wasnt able to stay at all bc of unforeseen circumstances that came up  so I had to cancel  I got a cleaning fee refund only  That is all the info I have to share and my experience with Zencity  and this location  Because of unfortunate circumstances  I would expect Zencity to be more accommodating and reasonable with resolving issues such as the one I had the day of check in  But  since I wasnt able to stay at all and had to leave bc of a member having a health emergency  I cant agree that Zencity is best at being understanding  A refund for a cleaning fee isnt enough  I expected a full refund since it wasnt my fault that this happened  But  since I got something in return  I cant say its all bad and deserves   stars   I can u    t say because I did not see the property   I cant say because I wasnt there  No parking is a big inconvenience Seems a bit expensive  the only value besides it being a nice place is the location 
536360294,If youre looking for a place thats cheap and not have high expectations then sure this is the place for it  wasnt happy with the place considering the water was shut off in the middle of my stay   Uncleaned bathroom and Im not even sure if the sheets were even switched from previous occupancy   did contact the manager about the situation and supposedly will get some credit which we will see    Should have known that something was not right with the bathroom when they had the shower covered  Bathroom floor was dirty  shower was not cleaned and the bed sheets had foot prints and hair on them    Well Im the middle of my stay the water was turned off and couldnt take a shower    This place needs some updating to be done   especially the bathroom   At one point I had no water in the shower  
656766909,I was not able to access the apartment from the front door because the key did not fit properly and the lock was loose  I then proceeded to speak to Zen City customer service representative  Marty  who was very cold  callus  condescending  and rude on the line    I explained the situation about not being able to get into the apartment  then he replied that we must not have been turning the key properly which is quite a jerk move to assume that adults are not able to place the key in the hole properly  and  it is very a ableist assumption    He then suggested that we go back downstairs   which the listing does not say that you must go up three flights of stairs to access the apartment  also  not ADA compliant  to look for the back up key  alas  there was no back up key when we went back to the lockboxes   As we  my friend and I  explained to Marty that there wasnt any back up key in any of the lockbox that he suggested  he accusatorially asked if we were sure that there were no key in the lockbox  He was extremely frustrating to work with     He finally suggest that we go to the back of the building to access the apartment  We couldnt figure out to get to the back of the apartment  So  while on the phone with Marty  we asked how to access the back of the apartment  in a very annoyed voice  he condescendingly told us that hes trying to help us and we need to listen to him    He explained that we needed to go through the common area of the building through the alley to access the back of the building  this is an alarming safety issue  walk up six     flight of stairs and didnt specify which back door to access  we tried the key for all of the four back doors and we were finally able to get in    Once  inside  I had asked Marty if we could get accommodated for another Airbnb that would be on another floor or another apartment  he stated  No   Then  I inquired why and he explicated thats they were fully booked  which was not true because we did not see anyone else in the building that we were in except for apartment  A  he was able to accommodate us  but refused    He then asked us for video evidence of us not getting into the apartment  we felt that he was being callus because we explicitly explained that we could not get into the front door due to the lock being not sturdy  He made us feel as if we were liars and that we were exaggerating on getting into the front door of apartment  A   Once  we were inside from the back door  we could NOT exit from the front door  a major SAFETY ISSUE just in case of a fire or other issues that could be unforeseeable   We highlighted to Marty that we could not exit the front door either  He then asked us again to send video proof of us not being able to exit the apartment  we took the video as well because we felt like he was accusing us of lying about not exiting the front door as well    It was extremely disheartening because we paid for the apartment in full and expected to have a great experience as well as good customer service without micro aggression  condescending behavior  and callus communication from the customer service representative  Marty    Moreover  the toilet was broken  but due to our very hostile conversation with Marty  the representative of Zen City  we decided that we would tell onsite maintenance staff   who were a supreme JOY  about the toilet not being functional    We were not compensated with a partial credit  we were not offered another place to accommodate us  nor did our initial concerns were rectified by Zen City    Zen City was very satisfied with taking our money and not doing anything to fix our safety concerns    Also  the apartment is extremely hot in the bedrooms  I had to purchase my own fan to not be sleeping in sweat for the days that we were there    Overall  I would suggest another apartment that is not  A with Zen City or go completely somewhere else that would have better customer service    The bright side  the maintenance crew  They were GREAT  I was not able to access the apartment from the front door because the key did not fit properly and the lock was loose  I then proceeded to

567898108,Great stylish place  has everything you need and if you needed more zen city was quick to respond  We had a great time at the place when we needed something zen city was quick to help  The only issues I had were the room description and pictures being completed different than the room we booked  I was expecting a tub etc  Also we had about   k worth of stuff and cash stolen from our vehicle parked in the lot of the building 
534525784,The location is AMAZING and the space is great but our group of   found ourselves with no running water after a full day of working out and hours of walking around the city  We reached out to the host via call   times and messaged for help  We couldnt shower  drink water  or use the bathroom  We learned from neighbors that this is common for the building but had been especially bad the past month  We understand building issues are out of the hosts hands but there was never a response to the messages left  I followed up again on the Monday after the weekend trip explaining further and asking for a partial refund discount and still no response  You have a great location but communication was significantly lacking when it was needed most  I wanted to leave a good review but still didnt receive responses to my messages   Recommendations on parking  A heads up that it was on the  rd floor with no elevator would have been helpful  We were unsure of level of checkout expectations  We weren u    t sure how much to clean up and where we could toss the trash  We cleaned up what we could with the supplies we could find   When arriving i messaged for recommendations on where to park with no response  On our second day the group went to work out  walk around for   hours on a tour  and went back to shower before heading out for the evening  Only to return and find there was no running water  We couldnt shower  use the bathroom  or drink water  We called the host   times and messaged for a request for a call back  We received no response  I messaged the next day asking for a partial refund and still no response  I learned from a neighbor that this was a common issue with the building and it was usually resolved within   min to a hour but had been especially bad this last month  It is understandable that the host doesnt own the building but communication on typical timeline of resolution  apology for inconvenience  partial refund  or at minimum an acknowledgment of communication is expected  Running water and communication from the host 
530419563,Check in was standard  The rooms themselves are nice  But the bathtub was absolutely disgusting  It was full of water  the drain was clogged  and there was dirt sediment on the floor of the tub  The WiFi didnt work  At all  Multiple devices couldnt detect it  All in all  not worth the price they charged  Clean your bathtub  thats unacceptable   The WiFi did not work at all  The bathtub had water in it and dirt in it  The tub drain was clogged  It was disgusting  Having a clean bathtub and working WiFi would have been nice  It made the stay very inhospitable 
530349588,Overall we had a very good stay  Keep in mind they dont offer parking  which is stated in their listing   The location was good and walkable to morning coffee and restaurants in the evening  The park across the street is great for an outdoor stroll or run  The unit itself was very clean and had nice features  bluetooth speaker  iPhone charger cords  etc   The only issue we had was having to pay      for replacement sheets  Apparently spray tan lotion could not be cleaned out of the sheets  I just question how much effort was put into cleaning the sheets and why dry cleaning was not an option  Overall though a very good stay   We ended up getting a different unit last minute  
528237906,This unit is a great spot in Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago   Close to the Blue line train and lots of good food and drink  The location of this apartment is great   The unit itself is great   My stay was complicated by the WiFi not working and the issues with the controlling the AC   Lots of back and forth fixing issues with my stay   To many back on forth messages attempting to resolve issues with the wifi and AC
526344495,Hi  this is my first time giving a negative review on Airbnb     the listing said it has   queen beds and a sofa bed  after my complaint they change it   The sofa bed was NOT a sofa bed it was a regular sofa were if you are more than      or    feet you do not fit  which was our case   I asked about the possibility of getting an air mattress but did not have any answers about that so  you can imagine that having payed nearly    usd for a weekend we at least expected to be able to sleep    but I was offered an apology for the  confusion     seriously         The entrance to the building is full of spider webs and dirt  the stairs were really dirty and if you are allergic to cats you should be aware that they let some cat play on the stairs so there is also a  complicated  smell  There were also smaller spiderwebs inside the apartment    I would not recommend it at all  Definitely not worth    usd for a weekend  Definitely not what we expected   The amount of beds     
524799413,This is a very clean apartment on a beautiful street that is in walking distance of public transportation  Very responsive to communication  No dishwasher  dresser space or kitchen table  there is a tray and chair and a full size refrigerator   Nice living room space with large wall TV  Thank you for a clean  nice space on that pretty block and also for clear communication  Please  please provide a mat or bar in the shower so its not so slippery  that was the only safety issue we encountered  Thank you also for providing feather free bedding and for responding to that request so quickly  Much appreciated   Would have liked to know the info I wrote about before making decision u     info was not inaccurate but needed more info  Excellent communication  nice building  lovely block   If there was a dishwasher or at least a drainage tray under the dish  drying rack so we werent washing dirty dishes in the same place as clean ones were drying   needed dish towels  no kitchen table and just one chair and one tray  no drawers slippery tub  However we did appreciate the cleanliness and the living room area was really nice and it is such a pretty block 
523025555,First time ever I wasnt thrilled with the airbnb I booked  Location is great but we had issues finding it due to a discrepancy with the address  There was no welcome packet as the host had mentioned  Not perfectly clean  Just OK  Didnt like the feel of the place  We couldnt find the place because the address you sent was inaccurate  It is not located at    N Kingshighway Blvd  North side of town is   minutes away by car   Uber driver couldnt find the apartment because the message I received with address from host was inaccurate  The apartment is located on    Kingshighway Blvd   NOT    N Kingshighway Blvd   Baseboards were dusty  Human hair found on floor and walls of bathroom upon arrival 
522761898,Excellent location nearby tons of bars and restaurants  easy check in process  and spacious place  The beds were comfortable  which is a huge plus for me   A couple things to note  which I hope they will address for future guests     provide knives  additional cutlery  and cutting boards in the kitchen  I could only find one small steak knife    forks in total  and had to use a plate as a cutting board  This was not a huge deal because we mostly went out to eat  but might pose a problem for those that want to cook more     the patio sofa had some mold due to all the moisture  We could only sit on the two wicker chairs among the four of us  Given that the patio area was a big selling point for us  it would have been ideal to have the additional seating     wifi was spotty and we had to reset it a couple of times   Overall  Id recommend staying here given the value and location  Provide knives  additional silverware  and cutting boards in the kitchen  Provide detergent for the laundry room  Change the outdoor furniture to lower maintenance ones without fabric cushions   The kitchen area had a poorly patched up hole in the ceiling  nWifi was spotty   had to reset a couple of times   Patio area in the back had furniture cushions that had mold due to rain 
519940606,Overall this apartment is beautiful in its simplicity  the view is absolutely gorgeous  and the amenities floor of the building is impressive  If you stay during nice weather  definitely plan an afternoon just to hang out on the two level sun terrace and swim in the pool  The pool is actually enclosed and I assume is open year round  but it has a retractable wall that opens it completely to the outside  From the front of the sun terrace you can partially see the John Hancock Center off to the left  and the Sears Tower to the right  The apartment itself is intentionally sparse  but still has everything you need  Not a huge deal  but its listed as having a coffee maker  it was really just an electric kettle and a French press  All in all this was a delightful place to stay   you really feel like youre in the middle of this glittering jewel being amidst all the skyscrapers along Chicagos riverfront  Other reviews mentioned noise from the nearby train  but we did not find this bothersome or notice it most of the time  Unfortunately  the only negative aspect of our stay was the check in process  It was not smooth  For what its worth  Zencity apologized over the messaging app when we told them what happened  and they were communicative throughout the rest of our stay  The problem seems to be centered around a disconnect between Zencity and the building staff  Wish Zencity had given us an emergency contact number  I would most likely still choose to stay here again though  just because I was so in love with the views and sun terrace and pool  Check in problems aside  the apartment and the view are gorgeous  The pictures in the listing dont do it justice   Not a huge deal  but the description said it had a coffee maker  It was really an electric kettle and a French press   I would give the check in process zero stars if I could  Instructions were   Please remember to simply state  to the door staff  you are staying in a corporate rental with Zencity in unit        do not mention Airbnb   We did that and the door staff had no idea what we were talking about   didnt have keys to give us   nothing  They acted like we were in the wrong place and we would just need to move along  Finally they suggested that if we were  sure  we were in the right place  we could take a seat on the sofa and call the rental company we had used  However  Zencity never gave us an emergency contact number   communication was with a few different people over the Airbnb apps messaging system  Fortunately all was resolved within about    minutes  but    minutes still feels like an extremely long time when youre panicking and worried that a  you might have been ripped off  and b  you might have to scramble to find somewhere else to stay  Apparently the issue was just that the cleaner hadnt yet brought down the keys that were left in the apartment by the previous guest that checked out that morning  And without those keys being brought to the desk  the door staff has no indication that someone new is coming to stay in the unit  Note  The stated check in time was  pm and this occurred after  pm  Additionally  we were not told by Zencity or by the door staff that you need to use the key fob to operate the elevator  We figured it out pretty quickly  but when arriving in a strange place it would just be nice if instructions were more thorough  We had plans for something that started at     p  and we were late as a result of the check in problems 
519433484,Enjoyed stay nice location It was okay not bad   just needs minor improvements  And please dispose of the condiments in fridge  
518507788,Unit and stay was nice  Check in and out process was fairly easy  Only issue was finding street parking close by  More towel hooks in the bathroom would be nice  Also a coffee maker too  Parking was a little more challenging to find than advertised  Probably due to being on a weekend  Have to park several blocks away on arrival 
517781973,This is a stylish  modern studio in a vibrant area of town   The views from the rooftop are incredible  the views from the apartment arent  The immediate views from this apartment aren u    t good   The listing should note that the apartment is on the second floor and looks out onto a parking lot 
567126225,This apartment is eclectic  but still pretty good   It is a GREAT value for the price  so absolutely no complaints there   The loft is large and sparkling clean   A few odd details  one of the bedrooms doesnt have a door  but its not a big deal   The large shower in the bigger bathroom doesnt have a curtain  which means the heat escapes when showering  making it sorta cold    The other bathroom is great however   Finally  if traveling with a group  we were only provided with one set of keys and fob which are kept in the mail room on the ground floor   The fob is required to access the elevator  and the key is necessary to open the door to the loft   So  if someone goes in the loft and goes to sleep  the other guests are not able to enter the loft   If ZenCity provides us an extra set of keys fob  we wouldnt have had any issues at all   Still  great apartment at a great price  The way the loft gets entered needs to be changed to accommodate guests that are on different schedules  or that simply need to enter the loft at different times   For example  if one guest is in the loft  they must have taken the fob and key with them to get in because they needed them to open the elevator and door  respectively   If that guest goes to sleep  another guest arriving later is not able to enter the loft because they cannot open the elevator or door without the one set of key and fob   The guest that enters the loft also cant return the key and fob to the lockbox because they need it to get back in the elevator and loft   I think the problem would be solved if there was more than one set of key fob provided in the lockbox  or maybe one available in the loft or something   That way the guests wouldnt have to be tethered to each other   Overall it was nice though  great place and great value  Mike  Im not sure if it was mentioned that one of the bedrooms doesnt have a door  but overall its a great place   We didnt have the check in information   Maybe it was us   and if it was we will revise our review    Also  the check in and building entering procedures are not equipped for groups that will not be together all the time   These really need to be changed  by maybe making multiple keys available  that way people can enter the loft while someone is asleep or something

505615834,This location is within walking distance to the museum of Science and Industry  For many of the other attractions you would need to take Lyft or Uber  Not close to the train and although the bus is a few blocks away  its not safe to take at night   The apartment is simple  bedrooms nice size and we liked having our own bathrooms  Beds were comfortable   Some of the dish were put away dirty  and the utensils were minimal in the kitchen  however they did have a French Press   The white sofa in the living room did not look clean  and looked pretty worn   I was disappointed because we had   hosts and they were not quick to respond  Also  while we were gone  they had to shut off the water in the building and they did not tell us  We came home late at night wanting to take a shower and clean up  surprise  No water in bathrooms  and a little bit of cold water in the kitchen  The next day brown water came out of the pipes  but we eventually got it hot  and clear after we let it run a bit  Pretty disgusting  Plus it really gave us a late start the next day   This was my first Airbnb and I spent days searching and reading reviews and comparing prices  I was really looking forward to visiting Chicago and having a special trip with my daughter  Not what we were expecting  Although there were some nice things about your place  there were a few big issues we found disappointing  We liked having a washer and dryer  the beds were comfortable  bedrooms nice size and kitchen was okay  We also liked having our own bathrooms   Im glad there were only   of us  There were only   barstools  and a very small table to eat at   The kitchen had dirty dishes in the cabinet I had to wash before using  No forks  and the hands free soap dispenser in kitchen never did work  even with new batteries  What bothered me the most is the fact that the water had been turned off while we were gone one day  We came home about       pm  wanting to take showers and get cleaned up before going to bed  No water in our bathrooms  and only cold water in the kitchen   I had to email the host about it  I just gave up and went to bed  She sent me a response after I went to sleep  which woke me up  telling me there had been a leak somewhere and they had shut off the water  She told me to notify her in the morning if it wasnt back on   I had to turn the water on for awhile in AM  but it finally sputtered and eventually was hot  It was brown and disgusting coming out of the faucets  We had to run a complete washing cycle without clothes before we could run a load of laundry    This may not seem like much  but we really got a late start the next day because of all this   It was not close to any train station  The bus was not too far  but not safe to take at night  We had several locals tell us this  We spent a lot of   on Lyft And Uber   nThe reviews were not accurate about this   I was under the impression I would get a contact number of our host at check in  This did not happen  and we had to wait on email responses to questions and concerns  Very inconvenient when we didnt even have a fork to eat with in the kitchen  The sofa was dirty  Looked worn  He throw blanket draped over the sofa corner was very musty smelling   Dead flies and other insects in window well in kitchen  We had   people hosting I guess  I asked for a phone number and never got one  Although they did explain about the French press instead of a coffee maker  we had to wait quite awhile for someone to bring us forks for the kitchen  Also had to bring batteries for the soap dispenser which never did work  It said it was close and safe to use public transportation  Not close to any train  Bus unsafe at night  We spent a lot of   on Ubers  and Lyft getting around town   I specifically explained in a message before booking that we would not have a car  This was miscommunicated   It did have a nice view of Lake Michigan  Lower the price a bit since it is not close to public transportation 
504357811,Overall great space   nice crash pad and better than a hotel  The AC HVAC in the bedroom was very loud and rattled inconsistently  Also recommend upgrading sheets and pillows to make it feel a little more luxe  Overall good 
503780622,The location was accurate  The host was not quick to respond  and there were not enough keys to get onto the building  I had to find an alternate way in  And the apartment was quite dirty in the kitchen and bathroom  I didnt feel totally comfortable in either of those rooms  Thankfully the floor  bed sheets  and towels were clean   There were supposed to be three keys but there were really only two  and so I had to figure out on my own how to get into the building  Had to go through back door   Only two of tree keys were available in the lockbox  There was no way for me to get in to the place based on instructions  I messaged the host and they did not message me back until after I found an alternate way to get in myself  There was all sorts of hair and dust on the top half of the bathroom door  It was disgusting  There was hair in the bathroom sink  There was an old  used band aid stuck to the bathroom shelf  The bathtub did not drain  The kitchen stove was splattered with food  The glasses in the cupboard were wet and dirty  The ceiling fan did not work  The kitchen and the bathroom walls were filthy and desperately needed to be cleaned or painted  The paint was peeling off the ceilings  Etc  Cleanliness  Clear instructions to enter  Working ceiling fan 
503271277,Cute and comfy with good location 
502521292,Id stay away from Zencity until their support processes get established   The instructions for getting the the rental were incorrect   The unit we rented was fine  though the AC had been turned off and it was hot as hell   but it took us an hour to find our apartment and the off hours support woman had no idea who we were and couldnt help us   Luckily we figured it out by exploring the building and found the unit we had rented  but it was a scary experience  Please do better on your instructions   Once I finally got a call from one of your employees  late Thursday night  he was also unsure of what to do   Luckily in the time we waited for support I was able to search the building and find the suite we rented   When I described the issue with the Zencity employee he told me that he saw what they had done wrong and he would make corrections   No apologies  he didnt seem very concerned about the problems we were having   AND MAKE SURE YOUR OFF HOURS SUPPORT STAFF HAS CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS AND INFORMATION ON PEOPLE WHO ARE STAYING AT YOUR PROPERTIES     The instructions that they provided were incorrect and we were not able to locate our suite   The instructions that Zencity provided were incorrect  and we were not able to find our suite   The Zencity support line was clueless and could not help us  The host was not available   They have an after hours  anything after     pm  service  but the woman we talked to was not familiar with how to help us and had no idea who to call   At one point she even told me that the address we had rented was not even listed as one of their locations  it was   For the price they are charging they need to have much better support 
501495939,An ideal location with simple and basic providings 
501407524,Great building in great location  and a nicely laid out unit  During our stay  we experienced a bit of a fruit fly problem  though  and the air conditioner was not very effective    so Id think twice about staying here during a hot Chicago summer  But the building staff was very accommodating and the facilities  gym  lobby  were comfortable   I will say  I have misgivings about Zencitys blanket policy of discouraging families with children to stay in their units  Every posting indicates under house rules that their homes are  not suitable for children and infants   This was not our experience  we managed to bring our one year old after some frustrating back and forth with the company   Id encourage Zencity to rethink this    its a blatant example of discrimination based on family status and I find it very troubling   Advertised as   bathroom with dishwasher    neither was true   Inaccurate listing
500676603,Good location  ac can only cool the main room   Bedroom is hot and could use a second ac unit  The bathroom is small and tight  Not the best for a       lbs guy
497470868,Location is in a very nice part of town that is vibrant and up and coming  The  L  is about two blocks away and was very convenient  The amenities are modern and very accomodating  Unfortunately  during our stay the A C would not go below    F which was a big damper on our stay since it was summertime  As soon as I asked for a partial refund  the management company stopped all responses to my messages and I had to involve Airbnb to resolve the issues  Other issues is that one of the cabinets was not cleaned before our arrival and had a lot of a leftover trash from the previous guests  Theres also this running water noise at night that is quite loud if you are not a sound sleeper  Neither of these issues really bothered us  All in all  It was my first time staying at a place managed by a company and probably my last  to be honest   A  C is not effective in summer time  Room could not be cooled below    u  b F   Leftover trash was not completely cleared out from the previous guest  One of the cabinets was filled with alcoholic beverage containers  Everything else in the house was extremely clean  The location is run by a management company it seems so I spoke to multiple during my stay  Most of the messages had a reasonable response time  However  my last message to the host where i asked for a partial refund was completely ignored  I had to file a dispute after our stay and based on airbnb policy  the host gets    hours to respond which they never did so i had to involve airbnb to resolve the issue 
572682151,Pros   Great location    Its located in Hyde Park with a ton of options close  Its also right next to a bus stop that can take you downtown   Home away from home   this has everything you need for a mini stay in an actual apartment  Great view from living room and bedroom plus the bed is comfy    Cons   Cleanliness   several reviewers said this place was sparkling clean but that was not the case for my stay  There was random hair around the common areas and food crud on the carpet  The microwave had food splatter in it and the fridge had leaked liquids in the bottom  There was even a used washcloth hanging on the shower pole when we arrived   All in all   this place is great to stay in  but Id definitely recommend some sort of cleaning crew in between guests to air the place out and make sure its actually clean for future stays  The location was great  The cleanliness was below sub par  I would recommend a cleaning crew between guests to make sure no used stuff is lying around from previous guests    On a smaller note   the record player was one of the reasons we chose this place  would have loved a response when I reported it broken or anytime other than an hour prior to check out  The place had not been cleaned in between guests  There was a used wash cloth hanging in the bathroom with someone elses soap  food smashed into the carpet in the living room and the kitchen appliances  microwave with food splatter everywhere and leaked food in the bottom of the fridge  were disgusting  The smell required us to keep the windows open the entire time we were there  We alerted the host of broken electronics that were pictured and received no response  We never reached out again  Cleanliness  I had to buy Clorox wipes for the bathrooms  tables and appliances and wear shoes in the apt due to dirty carpet 
494575697,Decent but not great  Pictures are nicer than the actual place   Living room sofa dirty  Small lingering smell throughout    Great neighborhood though   Pictures make it look much nicer than it is  Decent but not up to par with photos   Sofa in living room is pretty dirty  Didnt even want to sit on it    Also lingering odor  possibly because its an old building 
490442458,Great location for what we needed  that was going to the university and also pretty close to downtown if you take and Uber   However I do not recommend the apartment for   people just for     It is a good apartment for   but not for   as the couch is in very bad conditions not good for sleeping there   The bathroom needs mantainance and they need a new couch is super uncomfortable even for sitting there and even more for sleeping there  Besides it smells bad
488825132,Overall this apartment is in a pretty neutral convenient location  It is well advertised and the apartment looks exactly like the pictures  However the parking off premises is a HUGE inconvenience and can be a HUGE expense if you are leaving on and off the premises like we did  You literally have to ride around and hope to find nearby parking or you could end up blocks away   I will never stay at this location again because this was a nightmare and PURE nuisance with parking  Ive already addressed my issues with my experience at this location so I will not write them again  but the parking was insane       This description of the inconvenient parking is not clarified in full detail  I had to park insanely far distances every time I came back to the apartment complex or pay for parking in a garage down the street and walk   Bathroom sink had not been properly cleaned  There were brown spots under the items on sink  This was a clear indication that thorough cleaning hadnt been done inside the bathroom  However there was PLENTY cleaning supplies and I was able to clean myself  I actually left the dirty rag I used so you could see how many crevices had been overlooked  For the hassle and expense of parking  I think this place is NOT worth the cost
488041270,The apartment was as shown  clean and cute  Communication was very quick and check in was easy  AC is a window unit in the living room so it doesnt really cool down the bedroom in July  even with the ceiling fan  Electric kettle didnt work  and stove didnt seem to work although it looks new  gas range  burners clicked but didnt light   All plates bowls glasses silverware pans for cooking eating are there  Plenty of towels and bedding  Close to Target  a couple restaurants  Overall it was good and I would use Zencity in the future  Ill just want to clarify about the AC situation next time if travelling in the summer  See comment on kettle  stove  We couldnt find trash bags in the place so we had to leave a pizza box in a smaller plastic bag we got from the restaurant  next to the trash can  but otherwise we left the place as we found it  Very cute little place and if the rest of your places are like this  I will definitely look for Zencity places in the future when travelling  Thanks for everything   I expected to be able to cook and make coffee  but I discovered the electric kettle didnt work and the stove didnt seem to want to work either   you can see the starter flicking but the burners wont catch  Something to look into for the next guest  Wifi was spotty so Netflix didnt work  and you should specify in your listing that the AC is a window unit in the living room  doesnt really cool down the bedroom  even with the ceiling fan   Otherwise good  
484378238,I stayed in this unit for a week  Pluses  Its in a great location  south facing with lovely views of the neighborhood  and Zencity management was terrific  check in was straightforward and my request for an additional fan was quickly met  Minuses  The apartment itself is very basic  If you picture youth hostel type furnishings  your expectations will be met  Water pressure in the kitchen is low  and hot water was in short supply when I stayed so I got used to cold showers  water is more of an issue with the age of the building than with Zencity per se   On the whole  a solid three stars out of five  Thanks for being super responsive to my requests  Check in and mgmt responses were the best Ive seen in any Airbnb host     Vintage   is a fair description  in the sense that this is an old building  I liked the building a lot and have no problem with things not being super updated  but the one issue that was consistently problematic was the water  The water pressure was low in the kitchen and bathroom  and the temperature was tepid at best  Zencity management was responsive and sympathetic  but they really couldnt do anything to fix it   Food in the microwave from previous guests  which wasnt a big deal but also suggested that it hadnt been cleaned out between stays  Nicer furnishings with a couch that is comfortable to sit on and a second box unit AC in the bedroom would go a long way to making this a nicer place and one that is more in keeping with the price 
485342114,Very clean space with hosts that do their best to make sure everything goes smooth
480878800,Photos are of a different apartment  so just know that what you see is not the same as the apartment itself  Furniture is similar though  Much fewer windows in the actual unit    Water pressure and water temperature were truly the worst part of this apartment  Either scorching hot or freezing cold  And the pressure was just ridiculous   I could spit water at a higher pressure    Only   stove burner works  no kitchen knives   Pictures are of an entirely different apartment  Similar furniture  but different   Sheets needed cleaning  Found a few hairs that werent mine in the bed 
479339807,Honestly I was immensely disappointed by this experience  I love Airbnb and have stayed at dozens of places across the US   both for work and fun  Ive never been so shocked by how horrible a place was compared to what it was advertised as and how much I paid for it  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE  There was a giant hole in the ceiling in the kitchen  Every single drawer in the entire place was peeling grossly   to the point where we wouldnt put anything in them  There were bugs in the whole apartment  Couch was different than in photos  nothing on the deck worked at all  Basically an empty shell of an apartment  Honestly the location is THE ONLY positive about this entire place  However  theyre totally wrong about free street parking   its all permit on that street from  pm  am   Couch was different than in photos  nothing on the deck worked at all  Basically an empty shell of an apartment   There was a giant hole in the ceiling in the kitchen  Every single drawer in the entire place was peeling grossly   to the point where we wouldnt put anything in them  There were bugs in the whole apartment  Communicated fine  Honestly the location is THE ONLY positive about this entire place  However  theyre totally wrong about free street parking   its all permit on that street from  pm  am  Honestly I was immensely disappointed by this experience  I love Airbnb and have stayed at dozens of places across the US   both for work and fun  Ive never been so shocked by how horrible a place was compared to what it was advertised as and how much I paid for it  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE 
478167098,The place is really well located and the apartment is really nice  They seem to coordinate with the landlord  so its nice that the door man is helpful and there an automatic check in  The bad part is that they are very slow to respond to text messages on the app and not particularly helpful on the phone  I tried checking in  but their machine didnt work because the cleaner was still in there  This was knowable and they could have warned me  Instead  no one responded to my texts and I waited in the dark for    minutes  pretty pissed off  Them the internet was broken  The cleaning lady told me this and apparently told them  They didnt care to check until I asked about it  Then they made me wait a day before even trying to fix it  It never worked during my stay  The place was nice and decoration great  But really you need to respond to text messages  Also when I called  the woman I talked to was pretty unfriendly  I would have expected am  Im sorry  Ill fix it  and instead I got an  Ill get back to you   which considering Id been texting with no response was not credible   The WiFi never worked the whole time I was there  The cleaning lady told me it was broken and told them but they didnt say a thing until I checked in  Then they told me to wait a day while rebooting the router again and again  They called the ISP on day    by which point the appointment want going to happen until the day after I left  This might have been out of their control  but given the show responses in other matters and the fact they never made this work  I am pretty disappointed   They made me wait in the lobby with no communication for    minutes  Especially given that these are professionals  they were pretty bad  I arrived early and asked if I could check in  They didnt respond for an hour and a half  which was annoying given that it was the middle of the day  but probably not the worst thing  So then I went at    as they said  and the key check it machine gave a nonsensical error  I texted several times and no response for    minutes  I called and the women in the phone wasnt particular nice  apologetic or helpful  The cleaning lady was still working and hasnt returned the key  which if someone had just told me would have been fine but instead I was in the dark  unable to get in and with no one responding  Really unprofessional  See above  Really poor at communicating  particularly when things werent bad 
477119331,Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this  Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this   Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this   Zen City told me in writing that there will be an extra bed and two people can comfortably stay in that studio apartment  However  there was only one bed and I have to manage somehow sleeping in the same bed with my faculty colleague  When I requested for an extra bed they said they can not arrange and studio design was changed and it was under renovation  They did not even gave me an air bed  they said I can buy from the store  I was traveling from India  however can I buy a bed and take it back  This was totally unexpected  Zen City should offer me some compensation for this 
475069739,The location is great   youre right off Forest Park and in the heart of the Central West End  Check in was easy and the doorman was kind enough to store our bags until the  pm check in time  My only criticisms are    that youre right by the hospital  so be prepared for frequent  loud sirens as the older building does have great sound insulation and    I hadnt realized the air conditioning would be a window unit thats noisy and can keep the bedroom area very chilly but expect the restroom to stay warm  Its worth the value vs the nearby Chase Park Plaza   I didn u    t realize it was a window AC unit vs central air  That wasn u    t shown in the photos  
423633241,The apartment was very dirty and I had to do much of the cleaning myself  Overall the neighborhood was nice and the price was cheap  I feel that due to the condition of the house and the lack of cleanliness of the apartment  we should have the cleaning fee returned  as we did much of the cleaning ourselves  There were dirty washcloths in the bathtubs  stains and hair on the sheets and towels in the bedroom  the overall smell of the apartment was unsavory  the amount of crumbs and human nails that were found was appalling  and it seemed that the apartment hadnt been cleaned in quite a while  We were not informed of the construction that did not let us enter through the front doors and we could not find the side door access  The sheets in the bedroom were stained and appeared unclean  There were used wash clothes in the bathroom  There were stains inside the cupboards and there was expired meat in the freezer  The living room was filthy with crumbs and dirt everywhere  Inside of the fouton there were crumbs and fingernails within the cracks as if it hadnt been cleaned for quite a while  My friend and I bought many cleaning supplies and had to clean in order to feel comfortable staying in the place  When we saw the construction we contacted the host to get further instruction to enter the building but we had to wait in our car for a long time because the host did not answer and we did not know how to access the building 
627067457,Place had a cool view but the room itself had a weird smell the whole weekend  I messaged through the app about getting into the place and didnt get a response back  Had to call which is fine  Hot water doesnt last long  WiFi didnt work  And there is no rooftop like it said in the description at the time of writing this review  Place had a weird smell  WiFi didnt work  there was no rooftop  Didnt respond to me on the app 
470048099,The apartment was a good size  with lots of natural light  The location was great   we could easily walk to and from some of the great craft beer places and restaurants around Wicker Park  It was also close to a supermarket   The decor was simple  but provided a nice  minimalist feel  Having a dishwasher in the kitchen  and a washer and dryer on the premises really came in handy   Unfortunately  it was not really clean  It looked like it had been given a surface clean only  My partner had to scrub the toilet and shower  there were crumbs all over the sofa  and we had to wash most of the plates and cutlery  Zencity responded quickly and offered to send assistance as soon as we reported it  but we needed a shower after a long flight and couldnt wait until the next day  Fortunately there were cleaning supplies on site   The air conditioning was only in the living areas with ceiling fans in the bedrooms   Apart from the issues mentioned  it was a good place to stay  It was really quiet  which was key for us  and it came with Netflix  Thank you for being quick to respond  and for offering to take care of the cleaning issue   It should be clear that the air conditioning is only in the living area  and not the bedrooms  It looked like everything was cleaned on the surface  but we had to give the shower and toilet a good scrub  There were crumbs on the sofa  and we had to wash all the plates and cutlery 
465348226,Be honest  the room was spacious and beautiful  I love the room  but theres no elevator at all  I have to carry all my big luggages to the  rd floor  many stairs that huts and the building from outside looks very old even give me a hard time to find the entrance  But location was very good  Close to Lincoln park and many great restaurants and Walgreens and target and public buses to the center of downtown area  If you dont mind the stairs  it is still a very good place to stay  Dear Zencity  Thank You for making a beautiful clean room  but please do let people know that theres no elevators and be more helpful if give us a pic of the building with the entrance    Thanks  No elevator and I have to carry all my big luggages to the  rd floor   lot of stairs  That hurts  Very difficult to find the door to entry  I was stuck there over    minutes
464023993,I could write a novel here about my personal opinions about renting from Zencity and how this is      a business and not someones personal property that they take care of or have any pride of ownership in  But Ill try not to  This is simply a turn and burn facility that is looking to make money  Period  As a fellow host  I just expected much more care and cleanliness for the price    I would caution anyone deciding to stay here or any Zencity property and Ill just stick to the facts as to why          Found a dead cockroach in bedroom     Found little black hairs all over bathtub  which was eroding  and black hair in freezer     Floors wore filthy  do not walk barefoot in there     The fridge was disgusting with leftover food and what looked like fresh spilled kool aid stains everywhere    We complained  they came into the apartment while we were away WITHOUT OUR COSENT to  re clean   We returned to the same mess and kool aid stains  The only difference was now the place had a horrible smell of chemical cleaners  we couldnt breathe and had to open all windows and leave for quite a while     The water was BROWN coming out of the pipes when we initially turned on the bath water   awesome     The neighborhood is great  Whole Foods is walking distance and so is the lake    Best part about our stay was checking out   just not what we expected at all  Facts     Found a dead cockroach in bedroom     Found little black hairs all over bathtub  which was eroding  and black hair in freezer     Floors wore filthy  do not walk barefoot in there     The fridge was disgusting with leftover food and what looked like fresh spilled kool aid stains everywhere    We complained  they came into the apartment while we were away WITHOUT OUR COSENT to  re clean   We returned to the same exact cockroach and kool aid stains  The only difference was now the place had a horrible smell of chemical cleaners  we couldnt breathe and had to open all windows and leave for quite a while     The water was BROWN coming out of the pipes when we initially turned on the bath water   awesome  attention to detail  cleanliness and care
620786591,The nest had a lock on it  I had to ask twice for the heater to be turned off before they finally unlocked it remotely  Someone unlocked and went into the apartment during the day  Im assuming cleaning people  and when I addressed this with Zencity  I got no reply  I left a day early due to personal reasons and once again reached out to Zencity stating that the apartment needed extra clean due to my line of work as a nurse  I was leaving the apartment    hrs before check out  cleaned surfaces I touched often with hospital grade disinfectant  and still got not a single response  My plan had always been to stay with Zencity for the duration of my time in St  Louis but the lack of communication is a huge issue along with SOMEONE HAVING ACCESS TO MY APARTMENT WHILE IM IN IT  Im very upset with how this company has treated me these last few stays  I will no longer be staying with you  Someone WALKED INTO MY APARTMENT when I addressed it with them no one responded 
463105552,During my time in this space  it worked well with my busy schedule for a weekend trip here in Chicago  Upon my arrival  I took it upon myself to look at the details of the space  Next thing I know  I see hair everywhere  On the floor  in the bed  in the shower  on the couch  Then I ran the shower and next thing you know it turns into a bath due to a hair clogged drained  The kitchenware was dirty  every single one  I had to clean anything I wanted to use  I changed the sheets that were first on the bed  just to find out the new sheets had hair in them too  The toilet had body fluids on the outside of the bowl and I knew the space hadnt been cleaned properly  There were stains on the linens and couch as well  My Overall satisfaction would increase if the space was thoroughly cleaned upon my arrival  The company tried to accommodate me by having someone to come and clean  but my stay was so short and due to my busy schedule I didnt feel comfortable leaving my belongings unattended for someone to come and clean  I was very disappointed with the cleanliness of this space during my stay because I actually unpacked hair on all of my clothes in my suitcase   During my time in this space  it worked well with my busy schedule  but my overall satisfaction would increase if the space was thoroughly cleaned upon my arrival  I was very disappointed with the cleanliness of this space   Not as clean as pictured  Stained linens and couch cushions   Hair everywhere  Dishes in cabinets were dirty  Shower was dirty and clogged with hair and it turned into bath  Hair in the bed as if the sheets werent clean  I immediately contacted the company after my upsetting observations and they offered to have someone come and clean  but I refused due to my short stay and not being comfortable with my belongings unattended because I was gone for the day  Very dissatisfied for the amount I paid for a dirty space and would like to be waved the cleaning fee because I came into a space that wasnt clean at all  Hair was on my clothes and in luggage when I returned home from travels  Thoroughly cleaned space  Simple Snacks and or bottled water for guest s  especially on weekends when the price increases  Guide of some sort for out of state guests to get an idea of what and where things are in the city 
592673312,So beautiful and the price cant be beat  Never stayed somewhere so nice for the amount we paid  we could only stay a day  but it was lovely   The full kitchen is so lovely to use for cooking if you need to save money and it is literally down the street from the new aquarium at union station  Definitely recommend it  A few suggestions we have  we could not keep the place warm  the thermostat kept reverting to colder temperatures despite trying to turn the heat up  We never were able to find the elevator either  im not sure if the instructions were clear enough  but the stairs worked for us just fine  Lastly  there were no coffee mugs to be found  despite having coffee grounds and cream  The glasses we used got too hot for us to touch so that may be a good addition to your amenities  Other than that  we had a wonderful time 
460562388,Excellent communication throughout this stay and a very clean and well stocked apartment  It would be nice to know how much of the building we are allowed to access  such as the pool and gym  It would have also been nice if the A C actually worked and didnt just blow hot air  For that reason  we didnt sleep well in    degrees and that being the main point of an Airbnb  that is the reason for such a less than satisfactory review   If they fix this  which may be a recurring problem in this very old building  but interior renovated  the stay would have been great  Thank you for excellent communication throughout this stay  It would be nice to know how much of the building we are allowed to access  such as the pool and gym  It would have also been nice if the A C actually worked and didnt just blow hot air  For that reason  we didnt sleep well and that being the main point of an Airbnb  that is the reason for such a less than satisfactory review   A  C did not work  Less fees
460238714,The location was really nice and I loved hearing all the birds sing and seeing the leaves through the windows  There was lots of light in the apartment and many restaurants  shops  a Whole Foods and train station  nearby  A new sofa and rug is definitely in order  The bed linens were really nice and fresh and so were the towels  The extra blanket was stained unfortunately  The coffee maker and stove were dirty  Zencity was excellent in responding so politely and quickly to all messages  This feels like a place harkening back to college days  Only if you are okay with a little uncleanliness and get the very cheap rate would I recommend  The location was really nice and I loved hearing all the birds sing and seeing the leaves through the windows  There was lots of light and many amenities nearby  A new sofa and rug is definitely in order  The bed linens were really nice and fresh and so were the towels  The extra blanket was stained unfortunately  Thank you for responding so politely and quickly to all messages   Photos made the place look cleaner   Rug stained and had food and fingernail clippings  sofa completely worn out  dirty coffee maker and stove top  hair in bathroom  extra linens stained A much cheaper rate  We paid the higher weekend rate 
457203751,Good communication  Check in easy enough  Small place  smaller than looks in the pictures   Wifi spotty  temp and water at all in the bathroom didnt work most of the time  Have an alternate place to shower if hygiene is important to you  Didnt think it was a good value for airbnb and suffocating for two or more people  said it all in my description  wasnt the best experience  sure a lot is not your fault but still disappointed overall   was definitely smaller than i expected  smallest bathroom i have ever seen in my life    X     feet  kitchen crazy small too  overall  just a lot smaller than i expected   borderline suffocating  nice photography but misleading to me about what the apartment was actually like   n nthe bathroom shower was lukewarm and the water either trickled or didnt work at all in the bathroom two of the days  i know this is a building problem  but was horrendous  couldnt shower two of the mornings i was there   the parking situation was awful  the website would not come up that was listed and parking cost about     a day and we had to walk a bit to get there  takes away any value of the stay  also  wasnt overly happy with the location  cost more than about any other airbnb ive stayed at and the worst overall experience  it was okay  but definitely wont stay here the next time im in st  louis 
456888586,Clean place with a great view and furnishings as advertised  Recommend advertising the amenities that are under construction  like the pool   Also  heat was still on  and A C was not  and temperatures are getting warmer   Some amenities were under construction  
452117610,The apartment was clean and the communication from the folks at zencity was quick  However  be prepared to pay     night to park in a hospital garage in walking distance  Bring your own coffee maker  there is a French press but no electric kettle   hdmi cord  to hook up a device if you want to watch anything else thats not on Netflix    and maybe some ear plugs for the AC unit  its very loud   The noise from the ambulances arriving at the hospitals is very loud as well and woke us up a few times   It would have been nice to have some extra homey touches that most air bnb ers expect  At the end of the day  the price per night  plus parking  does not reflect the true value of the stay  The communication from zencity staff was great but we were not impressed with what was provided for the value   The parking situation was not explicitly explained and we ended up spending more money than we had planned for this trip      extra   The place would have been a four star value if there were some extra amenities available  For example  a coffee maker  we had to bring ours from Memphis   an hdmi cord  we couldnt access amazon to watch or purchase what we wanted to watch and couldnt hook up our computer to the tv   and included parking  I have to imagine the tenants at the apartment complex dont pay for      night for parking  there must be a solution to this for Zencity guests  Especially at      night 
566246496,Unfortunately  I cant comment on the space  since I was not able to access the loft   I arrived and followed self check in instructions  but found no key in the lock box   I tried for over an hour to reach the host  via phone  supposed    hour urgent response line  and airbnb message  but after receiving no response  I ultimately had to make other plans  it was getting late  I had to be ready for early meetings    Hopefully  this was just a mistake on their part  but the communication went from great before my arrival to very slow and incomplete after things went wrong   I had to scramble to find alternative accommodations and am still working on getting a refund   I can say that the location seems to be convenient  near the convention center and restaurants    Please process refund grievance   No idea  aside from the lack of key where there should have been one   I can really only rate the check in here  since I wasnt able to access the apartment and  due to the late hour and a full schedule for the rest of my stay  moved to other accommodations after waiting more than an hour for a response to multiple messages by phone and over airbnb   Prior to this  the communication had been good  so I was surprised when I arrived to find no key in the lock box and no immediate response to my calls texts  No idea   The lobby was fine  The communication was great before my trip   However  this broke down when things started to go wrong with check in   I called the host phone number  and got to an automated messaging system   The system was strange  because it went back to the main menu once no matter which number option you pressed   Once I figured out that you have to go through the full system twice  I left two messages on the  urgent     hour message response system  and one on the regular help line hoping for a response   At the same time  I wrote to them via the airbnb messaging system   I arrived at   pm  and waited in the lobby until     before starting to look for a safe walking distance alternative place to stay   I stayed in the lobby for an additional     minutes doing this  while hoping to hear back from zencity   After moving on to a hotel so that I could use the facilities and get some sleep before early meetings  someone did finally reach out with an alternative code  via airbnb   they never called me back   but I had already gone to bed   So far    days after check in  I have only received one follow up message  telling me to cancel   Other requests for compensation have not be answered  nor has my grievance received a response  Would have been great  So far       for a very stressful  not at all zen  arrival for my first visit to St  Louis is not a good value   If the place is as advertised  would be great 
366898165,Comfort  Overall  I enjoy the Zencity experience  I think that this listing was poorly prepared for  but with some more attention in the cleaning department  this could have been a great experience   The internet settings listed on the wall did not match the internet settings located on the back of the television in the unit  causing minor confusion   The dishwasher was still loaded with dirty dishes  which gave the impression that there were not enough dishes in the unit   There was broken glassware in the cabinets  and dried spills in the bathroom that tracked throughout the apartment  I had questions for the host that went unanswered for days before being responded to  I attempted calling twice  and left messages  but was never responded to  Attention to detail from the cleaning staff  and the carpet extremely fuzzy and caught onto clothing  
365757420,This studio is in an apartment building with what appears to be young tenants  students    It was fairly quiet and convenient to stores  eateries  Zencity was responsive and instructions for self entry were accurate easy to follow  Good value and comfortable  Description on internet said very clean but the unvacuumed  unmopped floors and stained duvet cover were very disappointing and uncomfortable for me  I saw there was oatmeal and coffee for breakfast but no filters  etc to make coffee with   I appreciate your quick response and help w  getting parking  Some detail about how easy difficult street parking is and parking lots that are covered or not covered would have been helpful  I thought     for cleaning was higher than usual  usu        esp since the floors needed cleaning and I mopped up some myself
422968996,solid place  maybe it was an anomaly  but from the moment I arrived I found hair      everywhere  on the table  in both bathrooms  in both showers  and unfortunately in my food that I cooked   Great kitchen imo   I wish I could have given   stars   my feedback for airbnb is that the way the review system works  I was hesitant to say anything during my stay because I was afraid they would try to nitpick me and say something negative   I left the place cleaner than when I arrived   which is not unusual for me   As for the location   I am happy with the Hyde Park area and the street its on is very safe   Parking can be tricky so I found a spot and did not leave for the    days I was there  sorry to say but there was just way too much hair every where on the table  in both showers on the ground in the bathroom in my food bummer because its a solid place also i would have described the keys differently small silver  large silver  gold   keys  small silver  large silver  gold keys the numbers on the keys were wearing off
555578085,Host not very responsive  WiFi wasnt working during the whole stay and there were no attempts to fix it from the host side  Clean  nice looking place  but if youre coming for business where you need internet consistently  probably best to pick somewhere else   WiFi did not work and host did not want to work to resolve the issues with it   If I didnt have to go to other places for wifi 
538186256,Nice  clean property in convenient downtown location  Would stay again  Thanks for the stay  We will look for Zencity properties for future travel  Biggest suggestion would be putting an electrical outlet in the bathroom off the bedroom as there was none   No air mattress available as described   No response to inquiry Friday night after arrival but it may have been too late when sent 
361081917,Nice space and looked as photographed  Well located by restaurants  bakeries  and coffee shops  Doesnt have basic things like sugar so bring that if needed  Easy entry and good instructions to find the place  Ask about overnight parking as we had a lot of issues  Need more instructions details about parking  Saying free street parking available is not accurate and perhaps would have impacted our booking as overnight parking was very limited and not easily available   Also would prefer more information about check out because that is standard for AirBnB  If nothing is required thats fine but its a concern that were not doing everything if theres no info   Parking was not easily available and very few instructions about the area and also how to check out  
459641049,A great location for a visit to the University of Chicago  easy walking distance short drive to campus or just a lovely place to stay in Chicagos Hyde Park  The full kitchen and nearby grocery makes it pleasant for dining in for a meal if need be  The self check in was easy  Also  if youre worried about the street parking   it was extremely plentiful and I never had an issue finding a spot any time of day  Thank you for your quick responses and for the easy stay  Made the quick trip a lot easier overall 
435510221,Very nice 
347130369,Dont expect reliable cleanliness or good customer service  Ive never had this situation in any other air bnb  but it makes me doubt the reliability   references to cleanliness  check in was fine Hair all over the bathroom floor  in the tub  Had not been cleaned recently   Hair of all kinds in bed and bugs on the floor  My host was not helpful and instead was defensive when I said I was having a problem with the cleanliness of the rental   He offered no solution 
345235419,The kitchen is well equipped and Netflix is a nice touch  However  the missing bathroom door and less than desirable condition of the hallway was disappointing  The place itself is not bad if the bathroom door was installed  hole in bathroom floor fixed  and hallways maintained  The kitchen is well equipped and Netflix is a nice touch   Missing bathroom door   The keys were not labeled correctly  they were not as the instructions said  The pictures are deceiving  the missing bathroom door  the hole in the bathroom floor and dirty hallways made the visit less than ideal  The pictures look amazing and once you enter the building and get to the tiny little elevator and dirty hallway I was tempted to go back to a hotel  I understand the hallway and elevator are common areas but guests should be notified about their condition 
342456015,The apartment is well located in a pre war building   The location is close to many restaurants and conveniences and very close to UChicago     I would not recommend it for three people  The third sleeping space is a broken couch  which is too small for an adult  I would not describe this as a three person apartment  The couch is broken and not comfortable for sleeping  Its too small for an adult   The couch was described as a sleeping area  In fact it u    s a narrow couch  appropriate for a child and not an adult  It u    s broken and slanted  you feel like you u    re falling off all night  My son took the pillows off and slept on the floor   Paid about      per night for a broken couch 
664075486,would recommend  very clean   tidy and easy check in We enjoyed our stay   will be back thanks again Zencity  
338098771,Theres nothing wrong with the place  per se  Though the check in is confusing and should be updated  and though parking is problematic  it was an OK experience overall  Nothing to outright complain about  However  heres the deal  When I book through AirBnB Im looking for some combination of superior experience  lower price  or the personal touch compared just getting an inexpensive hotel room down the road  This had none of these and was essentially a flop house with a  nice enough but nothing special  room  It certainly doesnt live up to the adjectives  vintage    boutique   or  renovated   The building itself is simply old and the room is on par with a contemporary dorm room at a small moderately funded liberal arts college  For         I would take the Hyatt and a free breakfast if I had to do it again  But     if you find yourself up the creek without a paddle in Hyde Park on a Wednesday night with a flight to catch in the morning  you will eventually get in the building  the room is clean  the bed was comfortable  and the ammenities were as advertized  I just recommend a less glitzy description   I would say there is little vintage of boutique about the arrangements  Those words conjure up quite a different sort of place   We couldnt access the photos and it took forever to find the key to get in  The instructions were OK up to  follow the side of the building until you come to a lockbox   It Would be better if you said   On the far end of the building  past the back entry is an alcove with a lockbox  or some such thing  The note regarding paper thin walls and floors was quite a bit off putting  again  unless it was advertized   Not for what you get in the room 
335990209,They manage many units so expect confusion and auto responses  And apparently key sets work for multiple units because arriving tenants were able to unlock our unit waking us up at  am  Not safe    Having multiple keys that access any unit is a safety hazard  We were mortified to have arriving tenants able to open our unit waking us up at  am  Thats really unacceptable   We were given pre arrival instructions to access a unit that was already occupied   The instructions lead to a key lockbox that already had the code dialed in and had no keys in it  We called and were given a new code for a different lockbox with keys for a different unit but found out that new unit was double boomed when the other tenants unlocked our door waking us up at  am leading us to understand that all of the keys work for any of the units which is most certainly a safety hazard  Light fixtures are really dusty  And there are few outlets so tangled of extension cords wrap around the old steam radiator which gets very hot thus creating a potential safety hazard as those cords make contact with the hot radiator  Responses seem mostly auto generated 
335576056,Wouldnt recommend this place  building is in good location  but the entrance and hallways are extremely old  dirty and uncomfortable  I chose this listing because of their location and amenities for my bussiness trip  there was no working internet connection  there for no working TV and the AC was broken  my first two days when the weather was warm  were unbearable inside the apartment   Slow response from the host  and when i called twice to complain  the person that was supposed to come over to fix the AC never showed up  I would never stay there again   There was no working internet connection   since this was a business trip  that was a major inconvenience  therefore there was no TV  and the AC wasnt working  and the firat   days  since the weather was warm  it was unbearable inside the apartment  The building hall is filthy and uncomfortable   The location was good  The building is extremely old and dirty  The unit itself is really old too  the furniture is nice  but in my experience the lack of advertised amenities made my stay really uncomfortable  Would not recommend   by far the worst experienceso far on Air BnB
332195580,the price is not matching the appartment  i paid too much  the photos made a good impression but the appartment is old and dusty  besides that its noisy  we left after only    min and i camcelled the booking  i also never got any response from Zenciry  definitly not recommandable   the appartment isnt luxurious or similar at all  the photos look much better then in real  its a tiny  noisy n dusty place  definitly no villa  as written at the entrance door  the price is way too much for what you get   checkin was easy and ok there was a lot of dust almost in the whole building  he never respondee nice neighbourhod but the building is very old and therefor noisy and dirty  too expensive  i paid over     dollar for   nights and expected a higher quality n comfort for that amount  the place is never worth that money 
573996281,great location  fast   clear communication  thanks again 
331759351,Is really close to museums and planetariums Wasnt able to connect to the wifi  Didnt matter to us as we didnt need it  but it could be a problem for other people  Didnt really answer our questions  Had his own autoresponse for our enquires

330406480,Quaint  comfortable  for the most part  small studio in Hyde Park   just a quick lyft uber away from downtown  Historical building with unique charm not found in most hotels but not without its quirks  The appliances are a little older  if you decide to cook  The building is not young  so the plumbing can be tricky with a lack of hot water in the shower and a finicky toilet that you need to hold the handle longer to flush  We didnt utilize but found  french press with coffee and instant creamer  a straightener  and body wash and shampoo in the shower  Towels were clean  there was wifi and streaming on the TV  There was also an iphone charging station bedside  The check in and out was easy and convenient  It would probably be a great place for a student or someone seeking quiet and the building seemed very quiet  Thank you for letting us experience Hyde Park  Overall  for the price  basically fees and taxes  we feel we could have gotten more from a hotel downtown  The shower curtain needs to be shortened in and out of the shower  that was a real hazard and we obviously werent the first to experience this  as one loop had been previously torn  The window ledge needs to be trimmed by      as well  There was nearly no hot water  ever  and the toilet needed finessing just to flush a few squares of tp  Im not sure how someone is supposed to safely hang towels above that radiator when it is in use  There was no hair dryer that I saw yet there was a flat iron  I brought my own regardless  because I didnt see it listed  The cleanliness was the ultimate for us as we were charged for the cleaning fee and Im sure the person before us was as well  yet the kitchen wasnt clean  It looked very pretty in pictures but to more accurately represent the place and avoid disappointment  Id suggest a message regarding the finicky ways of an old building and for the love of Pete  grease the hinges on the main doors  Creaky floors are one thing  but those doors made so much noise  The work throughout the studio was a little sloppy when you see it in person  and seems to have been done hastily to make it rent able  Id also close off the   storage closet to make it less janitorial and more comfortable throughout the joining spaces   The space seemed bright and cheery and updated and clean and modern  It was a historical building with layers upon layers of paint over what were once unique characteristics  The space was very small and not nearly as glamorous as the photos represented   There was a leak or some sticky substance by the trash can which was still wet and food left in the fridge  Too much communication generated every day from Zencity  I received something every day up to the trip  three days before  Wed never stayed in or visited Hyde Park  Its an older community but not much to do there besides walking several blocks to restaurants  We could have had more for about the same or less   in a hotel in the city 
317743171,Perfectly located unit in the loop  Amazing views of the river  Outstanding amenities with a rooftop gym and sky deck  with an indoor outdoor pool   Centrally located for business or for a quick tourist visit to the city  Thanks so much for a great time in Chicago  The place was spotless and in a great location   in your description you should definitely talk more about the amenities  gym  rooftop  view  etc  they were amazing   The description said that it could sleep    One queen bed with a sofa bed  Unfortunately there was no sofa bed in sight  I dont see how the unit could sleep   people  
316631996,Beware of this listing  The shower did not work and the host did not come by or send anyone to check the problem  The host has continued to maintain falsehoods and misrepresentations about this event in email communications   The shower did not function  It produced either ice cold water from the city or boiling water from the buildings boiler  There was no mixing and no way to take a shower   The worst part of this experience was that the host did not respond to my complaint and that I had no way of contacting him except through once a day AIRBNB emails  The host did not come by or send anyone to check out my complaint  AIRBNB has also been unresponsive and resistant to my request for a     discount for my payment  A lodging with a non working shower and an irresponsible  elusive host is not a good value 
309110351,Positives  good location  size and space  natural lighting  bed linen and towels  Netflix   Negatives   dirty place with hair in bathrooms  dirty dishes in dishwasher  water filter in fridge overdue for replacement by    days  dead insects on floor  stains on stairs  broken slats of beds   You need to have a thorough audit of the property to do the needed repairs and maintenance  And also improve cleanliness  Also I suggest when there are problems you should call back rather than continuing to communicate via email   You need to have a thorough audit of the property to do the needed repairs  And also improve cleanliness  Also I suggest when there are problems you should call back rather than continuing to communicate via email    Host said cleaning was done when clearly there wasn u    t or at least no inspection or it was really poor quality   Dirty dishes in the dishwasher   The stairs are full of stains and there were dead insects in the stairs and living room  Since we had issues with the house I would have expected them to return call but instead communication was always through inbox  On the two occasions I called it was an answering service who had to ask for a lot of personal info which they should already know through the Airbnb site  I expected better cleanliness and quality for a super host 
307095951,This apartment is located on a relatively quiet residential street  and occupies the second and third floor of a three story row house  With a simple clean deck off the first floor connected by stairs to his second deck with seating  the heat lamp  and weber barbecue above the garage    The unit is quite spacious with good light and air but minimal furniture as is common in many remote operated air B Bs especially in Wicker Park   We did not miss not having a dresser because there is very generous shelving in the master walk in closet  The master bath is spacious and beautiful with a fantastic shower That throws torrents of rain like being under a waterfall  and with an adjacent Jacuzzi tub   There is a second queen bedded smaller bedroom also on the third floor with a separate hall bathroom   The quiet central air conditioning was a lifesaver in August  The kitchen was mostly well equipped and spacious  but meals were had from the living room sofa and side chair as there is no kitchen or dinner table  only two comfy bar chairs around a small island   We only missed having wine glasses  This apartment was very ample for our needs  generally well equipped  maintained and efficient   The master bathroom had a bath soap and shampoo dispenser  but those were empty    A simple small bar or two of soap wouldve been nice    The kitchen was generally well provisioned  and we appreciated that a few basic items were there  like a stick of butter  some tea  a couple of spices  salt and pepper  etc  All very appreciated   There were a couple of items that we would have liked that we could not find  some basic inexpensive wine glasses  a carrot potato peeler  and a small handheld CanOpener   There was nothing there to open a can   We use the Weber grill one night but unfortunately there was no charcoal  We left the other half of the bag I purchased in one of the kitchen cabinets for the next guest  It seems odd to have a gas heat lamp on the deck  but not a gas grill  Almost all the Airbnbs weve stayed at throughout the country have a small gas grill if there is outside space    Shopping for charcoal is not the first thing on the list when you are on holiday   Otherwise  we had a great time and appreciate all the things that were there to enjoy  especially the incredible shower in the master bathroom  One of the best ever  The air conditioning was a lifesaver   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  Additional comments   u   cCalling the unit a  u   cpenthouse  u   d is a bit of a stretch  It is the top two floors of a two unit rowhouse or brownstone  u   d

305088132,This spot is fairly far from downtown and any L stops  But it is a cute spot in a lovely neighborhood  The space is NOT adequate for summer months due to issue with the electrical circuitry that the window AC unit is plugged into  But  it would likely be ok for cooler months  We had to move to another AirBNB due to this issue and had a lot of difficulty addressing this issue with the host    Photos of the space made it look better than it is  Space was fine  but shoddily put together and clearly needed better investment  Space has poor electrical circuitry than causes the kitchen light to be on when the AC window unit is on and you cannot turn off that light without turning off the AC    Kitchen and bathroom both were a bit dirty   Hosts were difficult to communicate with and fairly unresponsive to our issue   Difficult to reach quick public transportation to downtown   This is a fine enough place for cooler months  but inadequate for the summer  
303600997,Slightly disappointed in this place which I really wanted to love  I have to agree with the other review that said that the communication is impersonal  as it seems you are dealing with an agency rather then an owner   There is absolutely no flexibility with early check in  we wanted to arrive at      and check in was    they were not able to do that  or late check out  even if there is no one coming in the next day  There is no help in storing luggage past check out time  On arrival there was a strong smell in the back room which seemed strange  As we stayed longer I also found bottle caps on the kitchen floor and a hair brush under the bed  It seems as though cleaning was done in a rush and no one thought to check  There was only one roll of toilet paper in the bathroom  and we bought more  A few days later I found some in a mechanical cleaning closet  but Im not sure as to why this wouldnt be stocked in the bathroom cabinet  There were four adults staying here and only one head sized mirror in the bathroom  makes it hard for more than one person to get ready at a time  We ended up buying a cheap full sized mirror to help us get ready for     Im not sure why this hasnt been done already  Again  the wifi only works in the back area of the house and is very hard to get connection in the lounge room and front bedroom  The location is a plus  very safe and lots of great cafes and bars around  The apartment itself is nice and laid out well  I wish that the communication with the host agency had of been better  it felt like you were just another number like at a hotel  I would be hesitant to rent with an agency based air bnb again following this experience    The living area looks a lot bigger than what it is   u   cqueen beds u   d one is very small I would think it is more likely a double bed  WiFi only works in certain parts of the house 
303515336,As a host  Zencity was extremely responsive in general  an excellent communicator who even asked how our stay was going unprompted  which I appreciated   Also he  she  they  I am not sure which  was very solution oriented when an issue occurred during check in and solved the issue in a reasonable amount of time     The space itself is a one bedroom apartment with nice amenities and some thoughtful touches  a good working kitchen  within an active building in Hyde Park  a decent enough area for my taste   The apartment itself was immaculate  the building a little less so   The area of Hyde Park seemed decent although I wouldnt necessarily stroll at my leisure all hours of the night  but its proximity to a university engendered an element of cultural diversity and security   A cool factoid I discovered is that Barack Obamas house is literally a few blocks away      Hi Zencity thanks again for your hospitality   Despite the chick in issue and the lack of washing machine during our stay  we enjoyed the space and appreciate your responsiveness throughout    Washing machine was unavailable to us because a special payment card was required and not accessible at the time   Apparently the host was not successful in obtain the card from building management   A little hiccup with check in  the magnetic door opener for the building was not provided with our key   So we actually couldnt get into the building   Eventually a building resident let us in  
303140611,zencitys place was nice and clean and the host was very great with communication    AC only in front room 
295976164,Overall the place is very comfortable and spacious  The balcony is really cool and perfect for a summer night to watch the passerbys of the neighborhood  The location is wonderful  Very close to many restaurants in Hyde Park and to the buses and Metra  The amenities are plentiful  and there was no need to buy anything extra  We were a little disappointed with the washer and dryer not working as this was one of the reasons for choosing this place  We were coming from another destination  and we had the need to wash our clothes to last us the entire trip  Hopefully  this gets fixed  In any case  I would recommend to stay here for any future travelers   Hi Chris  Thanks again for letting us stay in your apartment  Overall  it was a good place to come back to after pair long days walking and seeing the great city of Chicago  A couple things wed recommend to spruce up the place for future occupants would be to fix the shower as the pipes were backing up from the first shower we took to the last even after using Drain O  A mesh would help this in the future to catch all the hair and crud  We would also recommend adding a more comfortable couch  The low back makes it difficult to lay back and relax  We ended up using our pillows to create a higher back  Besides that  the place was comfortable  and the amenities were great  The small office area was perfect for me to get the little work in I needed to get to on my laptop while watching tv    Further  we were a bit disappointed the washer and dryer were not functional  Part of our decision to book this place was to have that amenity  since we were coming from another destination and in need of washing out clothes  We had to take other measures to make sure we had enough clean clothes  We would have chosen another place if we would have known this was not available    Lastly  we did enjoy the kitchen  the tv  the closet  and the overall spaciousness of the apartment  We never felt cramped  which made us feel at home  We also really liked the balcony set up  although we werent able to use it due to the weather   The neighborhood is wonderful and the location of the apartment was perfect for food and public transportation options  Overall  we appreciate the time we spent in Chicago  Cheers   Listing did mention washing machine and dryer in unit or building  Literally  it u    s true  However  both machines are nonoperational    The bathtub was backing up from the day we got there  The final day was terrible as I had to use the plunger to drain the tub  When plunging  a bit of dirt was coming up  I used the Drain O I found under the kitchen sink  but it was not effective  May need to use a snake to clean out the pipes  Recommendation is to put a mesh to catch all the hair and crud that could plug up the tub in the future  
292262127,This place is very clean and functional but it IS NOT what it looks like in the pictures  Theres no washer and dryer  no marble counter tops  no tv in the bedroom  no luxury amenities as shown in the listing   Check in was very long  We didnt receive keys until   hours after checking in  This was my first airbnb so this wasnt a great experience   The record player  fresh sheets  towels  and comforters were a huge plus but I wouldnt book here again   This listing is NOT as described  The unit looks nothing like the pictures    The concierge did not have keys to give us upon arrival  It took   hours for us to receive keys  Host evaded the fact that the pictures that were shown did not match the actual unit  
289131535,I highly recommend this place  It is great to have the entire apartment  The location is around   th street in a residential area  It is close to busses and is only a block away from Whole Foods  You her the trains passing early in the mornings  but you get used to it quickly and it is not disturbing  This place has a great TV system connected to wifi  Not all international visitors might be used to the system  So I think an explanation  passwords   network name and such details should be provided clearly to guests   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  wifi  noise  Additional comments   u   cThe wifi did not work as I arrived  Chris was able to take care of it a day after  My suggestion would be to check everything before the guests arrive  He was also very generous to refund me a one day cost of the apartment for this inaccuracy  I am thankf u   d  
287777418,Chris is very responsive and nice  The check in and check out experience were smooth and easy  The apartment is nicely decorated and cozy  There is free street parking  which is great  and the area is safe too    Even though Hyde Park is a little too far south from downtown and other attractions or sites  there is a Metra station three blocks from the apartment  As long as you catch the train on time  getting around is not so hard  Lyft   Uber is always only minutes away   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  Additional comments   u   cAir conditioning  Theres only one small unit in the apartment and the summer heat is just too much for the unit  Heating is great u    we located one in each room  so staying here between the fall and the spring would be great   u   d    From where all the main attractions and destinations  which are downtown  Hyde park is a bit too far down  But the area itself is really nice  There are cool shops  breakfast cafes  and stores nearby    I subtract one star on the value just because there was only one small AC unit for the entire apartment which is located in the living room  The bedroom did not get any cool air  so we had to move the mattress to the living room  Sorry  Chris  Promise thi 
286202203,Overall the place was clean and neat and quiet for most of the time  The couch and bed were both hard as a rock and not very comfortable so we thought putting down the extra comforter on the bed would help with softness  The comforter in the closet was dirty and had stains on it  Be prepared to pay for parking in a garage daily a couple blocks away because there is no parking what so ever on the street  He did provide things if you forgot to bring them which was nice     Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs  towels and linens  Additional comments   The extra blanket in the closet was dirty and had stains on it   
422696350,The location is great  It is right off of the   rd Street corridor  so you are very close to restaurants and shopping  You are also only   blocks from a bus stop              I was able to walk to the center of the UChicago campus in a little less than    minutes   The price is good  Nearby hotels will cost much more   One thing to note is that the title listing includes the word  vintage  for a reason  This is an old building  The radiator heat made it very hot when I visited in early March  the bedroom window was already cracked open when I arrived  and I left it open the whole time   The refrigerator was also quite loud  The only time I spent in the apartment was to sleep  so I fixed this by simply shutting the bedroom door  If youre planning on spending any significant amount of time in the apartment  this may bother you more  Thanks again  For the location and price  it was a great deal  The instructions swapped the keys which were needed to open each door 
282580228,Z Id suggest changing your capacity on the listing  Your main room has a bed for two and the couch isnt a sleeping option for a third  My friend and I who traveled in to take a break from work a large production music festival gig had hoped to have seperate sleeping arrangements  Cramming two dudes into a bed luckily we are buddies  isnt ideal     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  Additional comments   u   cDefinitely not designed for more than    More so if you aren u    t a couple  One bed and a couch that is too small to sleep on   u   d  
276369295,Ill start off with the good  Apartment is in a good neighborhood  easy to locate and we found free street parking  For the most part  the size and cleanliness of the apartment were a      but when we went to use the glasses in the kitchen they were dirty   Apartment is small  but works for   people  The bad  the furniture  and there isnt much  was outrageously uncomfortable  The futon  had to have been an IKEA family special and in my opinion  needs to be replaced with an actual sofa as you feel every spring  This apartment does not have AC  but one window unit in the living room  When we arrive  on a    degree day  the unit has not been turned on  so the apartment was very warm  It finally cooled down as we left the following morning  All in all  apartment was ok  but would be great with a few changes  That futon has to go    It is so uncomfortable  In addition  the AC wasnt on when we arrive and it was very warm  Took hours to cool down   Lastly  glassware was put in cabinets dirty     Other than those few things  great location and good place    u   cWhile the photos represent the apartment  they can u    t possible represent the uncomfortably of the furniture   u   d   Apartment was clean  but when we went to use the glassware they all had figure print and lip marks     Cute neighborhood     Apartment is pretty barebones  No coffee for coffee pot  window AC unit in living room only  small  extremely uncomfortable  IKEA futon  Thank goodness we only stayed one night   
269680133,Chriss place was very good for the price  Its small  but great for     people max  We were a little confused with the directions to get to the apartment as they do not go in numerical order like youd expect  Make sure you walk all the way to the very end of the hallway  here you will find the correct apartment number  This past weekend was extremely hot  in the high   s  The unit luckily had a window air conditioner that worked okay  It never got lower than    ish degrees in the apartment  so it was still a little warm  The shower   shower head were also a bit on the older side and the water pressure was not great  The rest of the apartment was very nice  small kitchen with essentials  and having Netflix was also a plus  As far as location goes and traveling to the city  Its about a    minute walk to the Metra station and another       minutes downtown via the train  The Metra only comes about every    minutes  so plan out your schedule ahead of time unless you want to wait  Another useful tip is that the ticket station is only on the North side of the station  So if you need to purchase a Metra ticket  enter on the North end  or youll have to walk around to the south end which takes a little bit of time   You can buy them on your phone too   You can of course Uber or Lyft  but it is quite pricey  so the train is a much cheaper alternative  Free parking around the apartment is also quite full on the weekends  so you may have to park a few blocks away   Hi Chris  A couple of suggestions      It would be helpful to guests to tell them the apartment unit is all the way at the end of the building  The units do not go in numerical order and that was a bit confusing     The shower needs a little love  I think a new shower curtain without stains and a good scrubbing of the tile  There were some mold spots as well  Also  the shower pressure wasnt good  I dont know if it is the shower head or just an older apartment building  but it wasnt great     The air conditioner didnt get very cold  Not sure if its old or what     I couldnt find a scissors in the apartment  That would be a good gadget to have in the kitchen  I used a knife  which worked  but a scissors would have been better     Some other places weve stayed had a listing of sights or places to go see  maybe a book or something would be helpful  Also  directions for the Metra or map or something like that  We used our phones  but something physical might be helpful   Just some suggestions  overall it was  nice place to stay  thanks    The apartment unit was tricky to find  The units did not go in numerical order and was at the very end of the other side of the building   Bathroom shower needed a new shower curtain and had some mold spots on the walls ceiling that could of been cleaned better  A little far out of the city  but still very good for the price 
637508815,Had a great time with my wife and would recommend this place to others  There were a couple of minor issues that were quickly resolved by their very responsive and professional team  I would stay here again 
263265851,Pros     excellent location   close to the Pink line  Clinton   grocery store  Jewel Osco   there is a clear view of the Metra train tracks but I find the Metra noise much less annoying than the squeakiness of the El     Chris is extremely responsive  when the fridge stopped working  mightve been our fault   Chris replied to our queries within minutes and the fridge was replaced within hours  Excellent communication    Cons     kitchen more basic than I wouldve liked  e g  only   bowls  only   sharp knife      only   key was available despite   guests     apartment is more of a studio than   BR   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  listing description  Additional comments   u   c   kitchen more basic than expected  e g  only   bowls  only   sharp knife     home more of a studio than a   BR appt    only   key available despite   guests u   d

162887089,For central access to the downtown business district  you cant beat this location   It is located on a street with multiple CTA bus routes  giving a commute to the downtown of less than    minutes  Chris  your apartment is in a great location   However  you really must warn folks that the stairwell access is not suitable for anyone with climbing issues   It is narrow and the treads are not standard dimensions   We encountered public drug users in the area every day on our exit or entrance to the back gateway   The dumpster aroma is a bit strong  too   I realize that you cant do much about either of those things  but a warning to customers would prevent surprises   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  Additional comments   u   cIts not that the listing description is inaccurate   Its just incomplete   The stairwell for apartment access is not suitable for anyone with ambulatory difficulties  u   d    The price is similar to hotels in the area without all of the amenities of a hotel  
159769196,If we could rate this half a star  we would due to multiple issues we had with our stay at Chriss residence  as well as the service with Chris as a host  The only positive is the neighborhood     The residence was not up to the cleanliness standards to be expected for the price        per night   The building is not properly advertised for the neighborhood that its in  however we understand that this may not necessarily have a direct affect on the residence itself  Although  in this case  it did  The elevator was not functional  causing us to hike luggage up five flights of stairs  We have multiple pictures of stains on the walls  dirt and grime in the refrigerator and freezer  as well as faulty hardware in the bathroom  We also noticed that the dishware was not properly cleaned and had yellow caked on residue from previous usage    Chris was extremely unprofessional  and needed to visit the residence multiple times during our stay which really made us feel uncomfortable  and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays  let alone hotel stays for comparable price points  There was a showing of the space scheduled during our stay  which was completely unacceptable  Chris also needed to retrieve a garment for a  supposedly  previous guest while we were staying  which also made no sense to us  Why couldnt these things be handled after our stay was finished     Furthermore  we had booked a stay at one of Chriss other listings which we had to unfortunately cancel due to a change of schedule in our business trip  The fact he was unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at the other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didnt settle well with us  Especially since we had booked a longer stay at his other listing    All in all  we are completely unsatisfied with Chris as a host  and even though the Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area  we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing    Unfortunately  we wont be able to provide you with a five star review due to multiple issues we had with our stay in your residence  as well as the service

made us feel uncomfortable  and this is something we have never experienced in previous AirBnB stays  let alone hotel stays for comparable price points  The need for you to schedule a showing of the space during our stay is completely unacceptable  And the need to retrieve a garment for a  supposedly  previous guest while we were staying there makes no sense to us  Why couldnt these things be handled after our stay was finished     Furthermore  the fact that you were unwilling to refund the booking fee for the reservation at your other property that we unfortunately had to cancel really didnt settle well with us  Frankly  it pissed us off  and we would have much rather have canceled the second reservation if we knew we wouldnt incur this ridiculous fee again  Especially since we had booked a longer stay at your other listing  You have every opportunity to refund this charge  AirBnB doesnt hold you to this  Weve already sent a refund request  yet we see that you are much more interested in taking advantage of funds from potential guests     All in all  we are completely unsatisfied with you as a host  and even though your Gold Coast property is available in a desireable area  we would much rather stay elsewhere than waste money on such a low quality listing     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos

an overall higher quality environment

150256451,Chris is great getting back to you and coordinating keys pick up  The area is one of the best of Chicago  The apartment was not very clean  sticky stain on kitchen floor and general dust   The feel of the apartment is like a motel  That is  you can tell that no one lives there permanently as the furniture is bit odd  the layout of the apartment is odd as well   Bottom line  it comes down to pricing  if you are getting a significant discount over hotel rates  then it is worth staying here for what you get     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  bathroom   Chris is great getting back to you and coordinating keys pick up  The area is one of the best of Chicago  The apartment was not very clean  sticky stain on kitchen floor and general dust   The feel of the apartment is like a motel  That is  you can tell t 
147064886,I would only recommend the bed as a sleeping arrangement  but apart from that the apartment is surprisingly big and its location is very central  Great value  Overall we had a great time at your place  A few things I would still like to point out    the stairs in the house itself are very dirty   there was also a very annoying constant loud noise coming from the bathroom    the sofa is barely comfortable for an adult to sleep on and we didnt find a plus bedclothing for it  Apart from these the location is awesome and the apartment is very big and clean  I would happily consider visiting your place again  Thank you   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  
143583069,The standout for this listing is definitely the location  You can be anywhere in downtown Chicago in    minutes or less  I loved the proximity to whole foods  great restaurants  and different business  Additionally  Chris is a great communicator and the check in checkout process  as well as pretty much how to do anything else in the apartment was super clear  The apartment is showing some signs of wear and tear and overall  its in an old building  but for the price you cant ask for more  Its a great value  My other piece of feedback would be to note that the apartment is on a  th floor and there is no elevator   Hi Chris  your place was great  My only piece of feedback would be to update the toilet seat  Its all scratched and shows black spots  For        this would make the bathroom much nicer    Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  Additional comments   u   cIts worth highlighting that the apartment is on a  th floor with no elevator u   d

705953693,Awesome location  Thank you so much for your hospitality  we had a lovely stay 
590797203,Very cool location with modern  furnishings  Host was very accommodating  There was an issue with the internet and keeping Netflix going  Other than that the place was a delight to stay  There was hair in the tub around the fixtures  Just had an issue with getting in and out of the laundry room  Location was great  Wasnt to hard finding parking 
96588694,The Bad   Not clean  We had to clean up other peoples hair in the bathroom before we could use it  we were grossed out  There was hair and pee stains on the sheets  The walls  cabinets  and doors throughout are grimy with dirt and little spills here and there  I dont know how we can be charged a cleaning fee if it wasnt even cleaned for us  The Wifi doesnt work and it looks like other guests report the same  The location is right above a bar that plays music until  am  we didnt sleep much  We couldnt enjoy the views because there was construction going on which woke us up very early       The Good   Great location  There is a parking garage right across the street which was very convenient for our rental car  which you dont need  at all  parking is expensive  too   Divvy bikes were very accessible  right next to michigan avenue and all the restaurants and shops  Check in and out was fairly easy   The unit was larger than we expected    Would be nice to know theres construction going on so all the windows are blocked  Also  to know this is above a bar that plays music until  am ans that the walls are paper thin    Once you sent the written instructions  everything was good  I dont think there should ever be a youtube video  written instructions are the most accessible  especially if you dont have cell phone service   I sent you a list of these issues  Hair in the bathroom  hair on the bed sheets  pee stains on the bedsheets  dirty walls and doors   Good communication during check in but would have liked a response back to the message we sent after checking out   This is the most expensive weve ever paid for an airbnb and it was the dirtiest unit weve had  With the added cleaning fee  wed expect it to be clean for us  
94139776,Chris was very responsive and try to accommodate to my request the best he could  The building is in a prime location in Chicago   Note it is an old building and currently there is construction so the view from the windows are blocked with wood protection barriers   There is a faulty smell in the common areas of the building   The apartment is as described except for the bathroom  It could be cleaner and have better amenities   The building is old and right now the facade is under construction  There is a very bad smell in the common areas of the building   The bathroom is not as clean as it should be  The bathtub in particular is in bad need of Comet and elbow work   The shower curtain is stained with mold  There were only two towels  albeit clean  but not to the standards I would expect for an Airbnb   The rooms carpet is old and needs better care   The kitchen and living room space are ok   This is a great location in downtown Chicago   However  there are a lot of homeless people around and people smoking outside the building   When I arrive  almost at midnight  there were four people outside the building door which made me uncomfortable   It is a busy street  with restaurants and bars around   I do not feel very safe particularly at night  This is an expensive place  I believe due to the prime location in Chicago   However  I would expect a better living space   I recognize the building is old and Chris seems to be working on improving the apartment  but for the price  I would say it is less than I expected 
91424776,My trip to Chicago with my girlfriend was amazing  no thanks to Chriss apartment  All the great reviews  made picking Chriss apartment an easy decision  However  my girlfriend and I experienced nothing but issues  We had difficulty checking in  There was confusion over which unit we were in and both units were dirty  We were never provided clean sheets or towels in the three nights we stayed at Chriss apartment  The sheets were covered in little hairs and smelled bad  The towels were damp and smelled worse than the sheets  The floors were dirty and half the light bulbs did not work  Chris stated he would provide a gift card to a local restaurant for the check in ordeal  but a gift card was never provided  After check out Chris stated he would issue a     refund for the awful hospitality  but the refund was never issued  Airbnb did take it upon themselves to issue a one night refund due to the check in issues we faced  Chris did not even call to express his apologies   To future renters    bring your own towels and sheets     The kitchen and bathroom did not match the pictures in the listing  Please let me know if pictures are needed to confirm   Instructions provided for check in were inaccurate  Lock box combination provided did not open the lock box  When correct combination was provided  keys were not in the lock box  After calling several times and waiting over    minutes after our check in time  the keys were placed in the lock box by the people previously renting the apartment  Once we go to the room  the place was not cleaned  After speaking with Paul  Chriss assistance   he indicated we were given instructions to the wrong apartment  Instructions stated  th floor  but we were supposed to be on the  nd  Regardless  both units were uncleaned upon arrival   Apartment was dirty  Cleaning team did not come until hours after our  pm check in  Even after the cleaning team came  the sheets and towels were dirty  Bathroom and floors did not seem clean either  Paul was extremely helpful and understanding of our ordeal  however  it seemed like Chris did not care  He indicated he would provide a local restaurant gift card to compensate for the issues we faced at check in  Gift card was not provided  After check out  Chris stated he would issue a     refund  refund was not provided   The location was great  Close to everything we wanted to do  I had a terrible experience staying at Chriss apartment  Based on all the great reviews  I thought staying here was a no brainer  I was wrong  I had issues with checking in  Both units I was directed to were dirty  I was never provided clean towels or sheets  Several of the light bulbs were out  the refrigerator seemed to be dipping coolant  my white socks turned black within minutes of walking on the carpet  and the pictures of the kitchen and bathroom provided on the site did not match the unit I stayed in   Chris assured me he would provide a gift card to a local restaurant for the issues faced at check in  Gift card was never provided  Chris then stated he would provide a     refund for the issues with my stay  another promise broken  To future renters of Chriss apartment  please bring your own towels and sheets to be safe  If you forget  there are plenty of nearby stores to buy some 
80979974,Host was extremely accommodating all throughout our stay  We were allowed to check in early  and they even let us keep our bags in the apartment during the day of our departure  We had a late flight out of the city  so we still wanted to enjoy our stay and explore  The space was as described and in a great location  We were central to all Chicago has to offer  The apartment was not the cleanest one I have been in  but it was suitable for a space to stay     Before our stay  the host provided us with some great suggestions for things to do during our stay  We never had any issues reaching the host before or during our time  I recommend Chris and Collin to anyone traveling to Chicago   Photos and description were very accurate  The space looked the same as in the photos  Key to apartment was not where host told us it would be  Had to wait for host to arrive in order to get into the building and apartment  One positive is that the host dropped everything and arrived as quickly as he could  Host was very friendly and accommodating  There was long black hair all over the floors and in the shower  Neither my wife or I have black hair  so I am assuming the space was not cleaned before we arrived  Floor in kitchen near sink was sticky   
708054739,Place was as described  I would recommend checking out their website as well to take a look at their listings  Thanks 
618137059,Poor service  poor communication  dirty towels  horrible customer service  I think our experience warrants a discount and refund of partial funds for our stay  It was terrible  Late  Not told the place was ready until we arrived to pick up keys  Then lied to and told the cleaner was in route the clean   After waiting    minutes the cleaner had still not arrived  Dirty towels and refrigerator  Following thru on the promises you make customers 
710264371,Parking was difficult at this particular location  But definitely safe an close to restaurants an the hospital  Bathroom still had trash from last guest an shower had dust an hair in it an toilet still had poo an paper in it  Wouldnt blame zencity as a whole  But they need new housekeeping for sure 
405693242,Great properties in great areas  always a great host
616489170,You can expect quick responses from the owner of this property  Check in was super easy with the lockbox and code to get in  And everything was clean and and prepared for us  There were little shampoo and conditioners and body wash provided  And the pillows and bed are super comfortable  I loved everything  It was a perfect fit for us to stay over  The drain in the shower was slow to drain though  The blinds in the bedroom looked a little dirty towards the top but honestly overall we really loved the place 
615844503,The place was clean  comfortable  and conveniently located  Check in was easy  The only downside was that I was confused about how to access the gym and never got clarification from the host  This appears to be a big airbnb business  so might be a little less responsive to your needs than something run in a more personal way   I was never told how to access the onsite gym  I didnt know where it was or how to access it   The host was slow to respond about some issues and never responded about how to access the gym  In addition  the written information provided in the unit was general  describing how to use the heating ac system in any unit  The unit was very hot and It took me a while to find the heating control because it was in my mother in laws room 
645339856,Was great  Just hot Was great  We definitely would stay again only thing was the rooms were very hot during the night so it was hard to sleep  We also had to go up   flights of stairs which wasnt a problem for us but maybe for a more elder booker  Other than that we definitely enjoyed it 
700423059,Bad  Tiny reminders everywhere that the place was not quite obsessively clean as advertised  including unchanged bedsheets  but about as clean as you could expect any hotel or air BNB  Also  parking was challenging  especially during the weekend because people park there to shop and eat   Good  Beautiful and spacious  and stylish decor  Lots of windows and natural light  Easy check in  Great amenities  Pots and pans and dishes  dishwasher  washer and dryer  Location close to just about everything you need  Building requires code to enter  and individual apartments   building doors auto lock when you walk out  which made it feel safe to enter and exit  Pricing was definitely reasonable    Would be open to staying here again  Was disappointed that the bed sheets were not clean  especially in COVID era  and especially after the apartment is advertised as obsessively clean  I took pictures of the stains as well  Also  parking was a challenge   Generally  beautiful and spacious  and stylish decor  Easy check in    u   cObsessively clean u   d wasn u    t exactly my experience  but about as clean as you would expect any hotel or air BNB   Dirty sheets on the bed  Flat sheet had crumbs of food  Top comforter had different sauces crusted on it  Faint cigarette smell on the sheets and pillows 
618661518,The place was very nice as well as the host  We were able to make ourselves at home right away  Although we were kind of turned off from the blinds  Every blind on every window had a small tore off shade I believe on the sides so I recommend they fix those  but other than that  excellent place honestly   Great host  great spot   Fix blinds  Excellent place  
604544848,Great stay
403751562,Nice place little tight in space wise when in came to bathroom and bedroom space
709905981,Great place to stay if youre visiting old NOLA  Not super glamorous  but lots of amenities and great location  Check out Emeril Lagasses training kitchen around the corner 
646366064,Spotless place in a great location  Theres free street parking and quick access to the highway  grocery stores and more  The place is a little smaller than the pictures make it feel  The couch only seats two and isnt the most comfortable  Theres also minimum kitchen amenities so if you plan on cooking be sure to bring almost everything youll plan on using  Overall  a nice place in a great location thats worth checking out   The photos made the furniture and common area seem a touch larger than they were in reality   There were almost zero amenities in the kitchen and the main room furniture was very uncomfortable 
709612317,This place didnt look like the photos on the listing so just beware of that  Overall the place is in a good location in Central West End and check in out we seamless  Wifi is fast as well   This place wasnt what was listed in the photos so just beware of that  
668706993,There were multiple problems with the place and the host was either unresponsive or slow to respond  Outdoor furniture
626692727,Super cute   just not as clean as I expected  Super cute place  Id stay again just please clean better The log in at the front door didnt work  I followed someone in  I will compliment the host helped quickly afterwards  There were stains on the bed sheets and carpet  and there was clearly stuff on the floors and couch pillows that hadnt been cleaned 
627576287,There were a few issues that came up but they were able to have them resolved  Overall I am happy with my stay and was a good value   the photos for the listing were of an entirely different unit than the one I stayed in  there was a lot of dust especially around the windows and blinds
624425202,Check in was difficult  the key access code given to us didnt work so after calling customer service we were given a backup key that didnt actually work  We were only able to get into our room because the door was just unlocked and because the key didnt work we could lock the door when we left  After a few phone calls with zencity  I was told someone should be at our room by   to deal with the issue but nobody came by until the next day  The place was clean and it looked just like the pictures though  Customer service was always very polite but it should be made sure that someone is able to get their keys when they arrive  There was no key available for us so we were given a replacement which didnt work and we were unable to lock the room when we left because of that 
669413008,So cute and cozy and a great location   Very clean   I will definitely visit the next time I come to town  The place is awesome  I would recommend to my friends   I would provide salt and pepper packets   I understand you have to be safe   I would also have maintenance come before the last day of visit  or dont bother    Major irritation both in Monday and Tuesday  Thank you again  Sink kept backing up and did not get fixed until an hour before i was leaving  I just would have like a live person to reach out to me 
569188125,For the most part really I enjoyed staying at this Airbnb  Its centrally located to a lot of local shops and restaurants  Check in was simple and easy and communication was prompt  However the cleanliness for parts of the apartment was sub par  I was rather disgusted by the various stray hairs in the shower wall and base of the tub  Some were straight  some were curly  There was a noticeable amount  There was some construction debris upon entering the apartment  it appears the washer and dryer were installed and no one gave the floors a good sweep or vacuum  I felt like I couldnt walk around with bare feet due to the dirt and dust  Besides those points I did enjoy my stay  Hi there   I enjoyed staying at your Airbnb  Its centrally located to a lot of local shops and restaurants  Check in was simple and easy and your communication was prompt  However the cleanliness for parts of the apartment was sub par  I was rather disgusted by the various stray hairs in the shower wall and base of the tub  Some were straight  some were curly  There was a noticeable amount  There was some construction debris upon entering the apartment  it appears the washer and dryer were installed and no one gave the floors a good sweep or vacuum  I felt like I couldnt walk around with bare feet due to the dirt and dust  Besides those points I did enjoy my stay  I hope you forward this feedback to your cleaning crew so that future visitors wont have the same experience   Kind regards  Gordon There were quite a few various stray hairs in the wall of the shower and base of the tub  There was construction debris in the entrance hallway  I believe the washer and dryer were installed they failed to clean up the dust left behind  The initial price was      night  with taxes and cleaning fees and exchange to Canadian dollars it ended up being over      night which was a lot more than expected 
635750321,Great location and the place was very clean  There were a few bugs in the room and the building had a stench  Also  I left a pair of shoes in the room and the host lacked responsiveness  They responded once and it was late  I even sent a picture of what the shoes looked like and I have not heard anything back  Other than that  I enjoyed my stay  It may be hard to find parking but luckily I didnt struggle with that  Thank you for letting me stay in your home  I am disappointed by the lack of responsiveness I received considering I expressed that I left a pair of shoes in the place 
613359193,Floor looks not cleaned for long long time  liquid spill markings in number of places over the laminated floor areas  white chalk like powder by the basebords  totally dirty all over the appartment  carpet in bedrooms not vaccumed  old spilled liquid residues in the fridge  glass or coffee cup rings on the countertop  old toothpaste markings on the bathroom sink area  dirty kitchen sink area  dirty utensils  Not sure if I want to stay in any units by Zencity  bc of the ignorance  Floor looks not cleaned for long long time  liquid spill markings in number of places over the laminated floor areas  white chalk like powder by the basebords  totally dirty all over the appartment  carpet in bedrooms not vaccumed  old spilled liquid residues in the fridge  glass or coffee cup rings on the countertop  old toothpaste markings on the bathroom sink area  dirty kitchen sink area  dirty utensils  I wrote a message to the host describing in details all cleaning issues troughout the appartment  received response that are sorry that the  cleaning crew missed few spots   The  few spots  is      sq ft area     I was asked to send pictures  which I did  but never received response  Clean place  Owner had a chance to send a cleaning crew and offer to clean it  Never offered to do so 
671601091,Clean space  if a bit small  Heart of downtown amd walking distance to lots of different areas and down the street from the Union train car  Thank you for the stay  we were very appreciative   Initial check in was a bit wonky and required aide for the building staff  The initial login went to a voicemail rather than allowing entry to the building and elevator  Service member from the building allowed us to our floor and was fine there after 
709757002, 
705140181,The high ceilings and brick floor are lovely  Chic  bedroom getaway  Lovely place but the check in process isnt the best  Felt like a treasure hunt to retrieve keys  Then getting to the apartment was the next adventure  Area is in development  But I wouldnt walk at night 
647413507,The toilet seats are old and filthy need to be replaced  Also  the unit was way too cold for the duration of our stay  Messages asking for the code to adjust the thermostat were completely ignored by the host  Never received a response to my message asking for the thermostat code  It was way too cold in the unit and you never had the decency to even respond to my message  Hopefully enough negative reviews put you in your place   Still haven u    t received a response asking for the thermostat code to adjust the AC  Entire stay was way too cold   Toilet seat is filthy and needs to be replaced  Never responded to my message 
647380312,Great location for easy walk ability or public transportation if you need it   Would specify this is a unit in a coach house in the listing vs  just saying coach house since in Chicago often coach houses are one single unit  Took     days to confirm reservation change request At the discounted rate this was a fine value  but at normal price it isnt worth it 
566770263,Highly recommend  We had a great trip  You guys made that possible
628282353,Air Conditioner did not cool at all  inside temp was in high   s and very uncomfortable     Cleanliness details needed a lot of work    Elevator was out partially so had to take stairs numerous times   floors    Heavy smell of smoke from other units    Seating accommodations uncomfortable if staying with more than   people    Internet spotty    Management company was responsive and had AC fixed at very end    Asked for partial discount for AC discomfort  request was not approved    Good location  needs improvements with updating investment and deep cleaning   Very limited on kitchen equipment  Attention to detail  Comfortable seating  kitchen equipment
627998246,Great location and balcony is nice The walls need a cleaning  there was gunk in the bathroom and the carpet needs a cleaning around the floor boards  The balcony was extremely sticky  As well as in the kitchen there was food in the freezer and the trash can had gunk around the lid  Lastly  there were stains on the comforters  Not to say the stay was awful due to this  I just wanted to bring it to your attention  because although it didnt totally bother me  it could someone else  And I assume it is someone else taking care of cleaning the stay other than the hosts  I asked to stay one more night and I never heard back  Not a big deal though 
633348077,Great space  Amenities are a big plus and the privacy of the location is ideal  Thank you for being responsive and allowing me the space for the weekend  Great value  Very comfortable  The only issue was the WiFi access I was given wasn u    t working the first night of my rental   Refrigerator was not clean 
647381113,The interior design of this place was so cute  There was a safety concern with a window that couldnt lock at all which lead to me feeling unsafe  Other than that it was a good as expected    Some towels didnt smell clean   smelt like cigarettes  Host seemed unconcerned about my safety concerns
621749970,Okay stay
624310809,Good luck we paid for a   night stay and were given wrong code to smartlock so couldnt even get in and had to find another place to stay at the last minute  When someone pays to stay in your units and they never even get in the door because the smartlock code doesnt work is beyond unacceptable especially when it costs even more money to find a different place to stay last minute since your host never resolved issue to get us into the rental   Not to mention still havent received response to getting refund  or even an apology   The code for smartlock was incorrect   Never even got access to the rental since the code for smartlock didnt work and never got help to rectify the situation from host  Paid for a   night stay we were never able to use  Being able to actually use and access the rented unit 
592695957,Be cautious when deciding on a place  The pictures can be very deceiving  This place has a lot of potential but needs to be cleaned from top to bottom  We have small children and I was ashamed to have my children have to be in such conditions  They werent allowed to even play on the floor until I personally went out and purchased my own cleaning supplies and sweep and mopped the place  I washed all the linen and towel myself before using them  Nothing seem clean to me  There was hair everywhere  Food on the floors  in different area of the home    cereal  pizza crusts  crackers   Streaks in the toilet  urine and toilet paper in the other unclean bath   Comforters were filthy   Spider webs hanging in very visible places  The was old food and drinks left in the refrigerator  Floors hadnt been swept or mopped    Brian was very responsive in the beginning  once I expressed my concerns  I never heard back from him   I spent much in my vacation time cleaning the place up  purchased new comforters for my family to sleep on   Brian never responded to me after the first day of my   night stay I appreciate you hosting our stay but Im very disappointed that with your communication on addressing my concerns   Looks nicer on photos  There was hair everywhere  Food on the floors  in different area of the home    cereal  pizza crusts  crackers   Streaks in the toilet  urine and toilet paper in the other unclean bath   Comforters were filthy   Spider webs hanging in very visible places  The was old food and drinks left in the refrigerator  Floors hadnt been swept or mopped  Brian was very responsive in the beginning  once I expressed my concerns  I never heard back from him   I spent much in my vacation time cleaning the place up  purchased new comforters for my family to sleep on   Brian never responded to me after the first day of my   night stay If it were cleaned  more TVs  assigned parking

456851576,Great easy place  Overall pretty clean  About    minutes from downtown Chicago  This was my first time using Airbnb and overall it was pretty great  Hard to find parking 
479270482,This place is awesome for a large group  It was super clean  and the layout is awesome for a group that needs a big place to stay  All rooms have big beds and the large kitchens with the pool table and ping pong table give this place a fun atmosphere for people to enjoy one another  The location is great  close to bars and on a quieter area on the north side    I would recommend this place to anyone  Brian  Your place was wonderful  clean  big  and perfect for our family during the week of our wedding  It was definitely a  hip  place that everyone was impressed by  I gave mostly   starts  but the confusion with the cleaning crew telling us to come back in   more hours was super stressful since we need to get to our rehearsal dinner in the next few hours  I do appreciate your quick response after the voicemail was left  I would just suggest being on the same page as the cleaning crew and making it clear when we could be there  I was under the impression that if we did not hear back by   everything was good to go  Other than that  like I stated  it was an amazing stay and I will make sure to give your place a glowing review  Thank you  Due to bad previous guests they were running late on the cleaning and it was not clear that they would not be done at    when we were to check in  The cleaning crew was there at   and told us to leave and give them   more hours  This was  worked out within a shorter time  but stressful at the time due to an event all the guests were trying to get to and had to get ready  Just confusion about check in and when cleaning would be done 
572007068,Well kept great space  Very accommodating and spacious  The amenities are top notch  Slawik  I suggest adding curtains before your next guess  Bare windows work well in suburban areas but not on a busy street like Truman road  I felt a lack of privacy and warmth  However the place is great and your response to my need is very much appreciated   Was not aware that it would be no window treatments in common areas   Beautiful tub in the masters suite  however the window over the tub could use cleaning   paint and an upgrade 
648350287,Great place in the Hyde Park Area  Easily accessible surrounded by a Whole Foods in walking distance  Not far from a beautiful park with an amazing view of the lake and city  The place was very clean  but faintly smelled like cigarettes
710074007,Great place  kind people Help with mail would be appreciated
628322834,Very clean  amazing stay  Private  and right across forest park  There were a few holes in the wall next to the right side of the bed  otherwise an amazing stay
644018008,Communicative and kind  Thanks 
643362525,This is a good spot for being close to the beach     min walk to promontory point
628262784,im sure all problems will be taken care of i chose not to write a public review  thank you     the rooms are very nice and clean that was wonderful   other people staying there was very loud and obnoxious in behavior that is unacceptable in my book  need to inform what floor and the price says    and up it cost almost     for two nights  hallways dirty someone had gotten sick all over the hallway floor
628325212,Solid place  style and space  in cool location  Thank you for providing the place  It was a stylish spot  just bothered by the insects  Really the only major issue were the flies and gnats  Unfortunately there were several throughout kitchen and bedroom 
623266665,I did not actually go to the property but they took my money for the whole stay  Very dishonest company  who choose to not respond to emails on their site  I would be very careful when booking with them  I have a lot of Airbnb travel experience and this was the most dishonest one I have ever experienced  This has been the worst and most dishonest experience on Airbnb ever  I booked nd they repsonded  will let you know within    hours   Since I needed the place that same night I cancelled  They charged my card for the whole   day stay which included cleaning  I did contact airbnb to resolve but Zencity said they had a very strict refund policy  I got nothing for my       They simply took all of my money for the whole   day stay  Cleaning fees and airbnb fees  Taxs etc   A reputable company would never behave like this  BE VERY CAREFUL when handing over your credit card to this dishonest company   They charged me for a booking I cancelled  Very dishonest company  I emailed them on their website to cancel and they never responded They charged me for a cleaning fee and I never used the place They never responded to my communication  They took my money for the whole stay  Beware of this company  I did not go to the home at all  This is my VERY WORST Airbnb experience ever  They took all of my money after I tried to cancel  Be very careful when giving this company your money 
708207512,Make sure your music is not to loud they will change the door code while your things are still inside
620048275,Great location and stylish loft  Host was the disappointment  I had several issues no key fob to enter building after a certain time  a leak in the bedroom  etc and the host stopped responding to me  Your location was beautiful and well styled  I was very disappointed in the communication with whomever was hosting they just didnt care about my needs  There was no key fob which prevented me from leaving my air bnb after    I came to visit family and this severely impacted my time to connect  Also  there was a leak in my room over the bed since it was raining  I reached out to the host and they stop responding to me  
640605471,The issues began when we arrived and the checkin information was not only incorrect  but the key to our apartment was missing  As per our previous correspondence there were several issues with cleanliness when we arrived  The TV and internet also did not work  Hello  I am writing to request a     refund for my stay with you from Saturday the   th to Monday the   th  The issues began when we arrived and the checkin information was not only incorrect  but the key to our apartment was missing  As per our previous correspondence there were several issues with cleanliness when we arrived  The TV and internet also did not work which I assume was because there was no Eero in our apartment  I would be happy to further discuss these issues and provide more photos if necessary 
648358224,central location for getting to all areas of KC  cleanliness promises  shower curtain smelled musty  needs replacing  Need vacuuming under the couch   strewn with various pieces of garbage  kid toys  etc  Building in general has a slightly unpleasant odor to it
618603052,Zencitys booking process and communication were great  however  the cleanliness of this unit and building left a lot to be desired  kitchen sink had dried food particles fingernail clipping on floor general unclean floor lint on furniture hair in bathroom on floor  toilet  sink  and shower common areas of the hotel were very dirty   in need of vacuuming  painting  cleaning Should be clean   no excuses Needs trashcan in the bathroom Lighting is very dim  hard for a female to get ready Not enough towels for   people for   days
355308984,Apartment was nice  Poor parking
627669491,The apartment is clean  and the view from the living room is immaculate at night  its close to the lake and a park and for the price its not bad   the couch is broke and the wi fi cuts in and out sometimes   And if your not from Chicago a couple blocks away your in the hood   You guys know the couch is broke and you try to just fix it   thats unacceptable  You should go and fix that ASAP considering thats really the only place you can actually be comfortable and watch TV since its only   in the whole apartment   Dont treat me like just money actually care about peoples experience Should of mentioned that this was near unsafe areas A couch that wasnt broken  real mattress on bed in one of the rooms 
619154004,Price  location and size of unit are great   Noisy tenants above unit though late at night  The price  location and size of unit were great   I would add a couple of comfortable chairs in living room and speak to neighbors above   Quiet time after    pm  Needed to call after not receiving an email and waited a couple of days  There really wasnt a bunch of furniture in the living room to hang for a bit   Also the upstairs neighbors were very loud with music and noise after   pm until wee hours 
636931536,Looked better online than in person  Before we even entered the building we had issues with parking  The directions from the company left out important details  The garage they instructed us to use was only open certain hours and when we arrived it was closed  There was an alternative entrance to the garage that we had found out about later  after we talked to someone who lived in the building  First thing we noticed when we walked in to the apartment was the smell of trash that did not go away our whole stay  The smell lingered throughout the whole apartment  Even after spraying a room refresher the smell did not go away    Second when we put our things down we saw what looked like pizza sauce on the table and we found a parking ticket from the previous month  Which iwas the first indication of the place not being cleaned prior to our arrival  Next while checking the beds for bedbugs we notice there were crumbs and hair on the sheets which means the sheets were not washed  Then we noticed the floors and rugs throughout the apartment also looked like they havent been vacuumed in awhile  There were other minor indicators of the place not being cleaned but these were the main ones  They pride themselves on keeping the property upto hotel standards but it was far from that    To top it off  after all of that  we couldnt even watch TV because it said too many people were using the account  They dont have regular TV they have Roku TV and I assume they use the same account for other rentals    Personal notes   We found the beds were way too stiff for our liking  We preferred sleeping on the couch    The curtains kept no light out so dont expect to sleep in    We noticed a monitoring device under the island  To us it was not that big of a deal but it would have been nice to know about   We were really looking forward to this place and saw all the great reviews  but I unfortunately we were extremely disappointed and would not recommend  The review well be leaving  Looked better online than in person  Before we even entered the building we had issues with parking  The directions from the company left out important details  The garage they instructed us to use was only open certain hours and when we arrived it was closed  There was an alternative entrance to the garage that we had found out about later  after we talked to someone who lived in the building  First thing we noticed when we walked in to the apartment was the smell of trash that did not go away our whole stay  The smell lingered throughout the whole apartment  Even after spraying a room refresher the smell did not go away    Second when we put our things down we saw what looked like pizza sauce on the table and we found a parking ticket from the previous month  Which iwas the first indication of the place not being cleaned prior to our arrival  Next while checking the beds for bedbugs we notice there were crumbs and hair on the sheets which means the sheets were not washed  Then we noticed the floors and rugs throughout the apartment also looked like they havent been vacuumed in awhile  There were other minor indicators of the place not being cleaned but these were the main ones  They pride themselves on keeping the property upto hotel standards but it was far from that    To top it off  after all of that  we couldnt even watch TV because it said too many people were using the account  They dont have regular TV they have Roku TV and I assume they use the same account for other rentals    Personal notes   We found the beds were way too stiff for our liking  We preferred sleeping on the couch    The curtains kept no light out so dont expect to sleep in    We noticed a monitoring device under the island  To us it was not that big of a deal but it would have been nice to know about   We were really looking forward to this place and saw all the great reviews  but I unfortunately we were extremely disappointed and would not recommend   Parking 
628298768,One of my favorite spots  I had to kill a lot of bugs on arrival before my other guest arrived  And thermostat stopped working halfway through the stay got extremely hot the last half   But love the spot besides those things and it was a spill that was left there previously too  Just make sure the cleaners pay more attention   
353368767,Terrific location   value  I would absolutely stay there again 
628678894,Overall  we had a great visit to KC and enjoyed the space   Pros  walkable to Power and Light  great views from top floor  secure apartment   Cons  check in instructions were incorrect   had to call Zencity for access to unit  kitchen drawers utensils were dirty  limited kitchen supplies   toiletries provided Lock box information was incorrect  Directions were vague and hard to understand  Dirty utensils  hair in the drawers
649026513,Nice open apartment that put you in the heart of wicker park
649101011,The unit requires some maintenance and the sofa at the living room needs to be changed  no comfortable at all    
649028024,We were booked to stay in the full apartment  however  due to unexpected maintenance we were moved to a studio apartment  It was still pleasant and clean  our host refunded a small amount of our cost due to the move in location which was much appreciated  There was a little bit of mold in both the shower window  and when I opened the dishwasher I saw a large amount of mold growing on the dishwasher door 
648337939,comfortable place and super close to the medical campus and forest park 
621679066,Stylish and cosy place   Very basic kitchenware though  no toaster  no vegetable peeler  just some utensils and pots and pans  Clean space though 
621451434,Overall  had a great time here   The common spaces were clean  but we felt that the floors couldve used extra sweeping to make the experience immaculate   The area is quiet for the most part  but keep note that there was some construction happening next door at the time of my stay that is something to be aware of   Overall  the apartment fulfilled its purpose of allowing me to get the work done that I needed  and I would gladly stay here again if the occasion were to come again 
646998296,The room was very clean and the building was extremely secure  It was in a good location and I was able to find parking on the street without issue  However  the room advertised in the photos was not the room I stayed in  The one I stayed in was still nice and had the same amenities but I was a bit disappointed because I was looking forward to the room I thought I would receive   Different room than advertised  
456009963,Fantastic location and very nice apartment     Converted me   no more hotels ever again  Really good visit but we didnt have hot water in the shower and the drain was slow    We told the desk agent on Sunday but I dont think anything was done   So other than cold showers it was a great stay and location Little slow to get door code but in the end the technology was corrected
595715136,Very comfy beds  We enjoyed the workout room  Location near the park would be nice during a warm season  Very near the hospital  so ambulance sirens were loud and frequent  Very nice place  We enjoyed the workout room  Easy check in  Mirrors in the bedrooms would have been helpful for getting ready  Everything was as described  yes it was accurate
649579499,Zen city charged me twice for my stay and did not refund me my money  The communication was horrible  I was never able to talk to a manager  Horrible experience but never again will I patronize this company  They are criminals   Zen city charged me twice for my stay and did not refund me my money  The communication was horrible  I was never able to talk to a manager  Horrible experience but never again will I patronize this company  They are criminals  
640089587,Had a great stay overall  we inquired about an early check in because our flight landed at  am which got approved by Marty via the Airbnb app but when we arrived we tried to receive the keys and could not  I reached out to Marty and he stated that he did not remember approving an early check in  I then had to read the messages verbatim that he said to me that indeed approve the early check in  other than that the stay went pretty smoothly  I inquired about extra towels and got no response  and there is also a loud obnoxious smoke detector that often beeps and is annoying  Other than that  nice location and good AC  Host  forgot  about early check in we were supposed to do  but quickly cleared up the confusion
649556619,Nice place with good location just small space for   or   people only
673440870,Great location  Updated look needs to be  deep cleaned though  Thanks the location was great  Place needs a deep cleaning on comforters and drapery and tile  The WiFi never worked or us  Couldnt log into the zen city account  Staining on the bed comforters  Not sure the sheets were changed in one room  They smelled like mens aftershave  Wise range of pricing on this unit from one weekend to the next 
618796397,Very clean and nice  Easy check in process and quick responses  We didnt have the key fob due to previous guests leaving with it  Was able to communicate with Zencity in timely manner regarding this but was unable to get key fob during our stay so we were unable to access some of the extra amenities such as the parking and gym  There was free street parking easily available  however  Overall  a great place to stay 
627116132,Location   Location   Location   This area was nice   the the apartment was was nice   I enjoyed walking thre square and jogging through the park   I dont recommend this place  You may want to use a paint with some sheen ink it  if you ever repaint  That would keep the walls from staining   Which in my eyes was the only real drawback besides the mouse  Needing head what appears to be a makeup stain on it  Which made me more uncomfortable than not being clean 
627670802,Nice location very clean and right on point about the apartment the pictures say it all      Everything was ok  besides having to deal with the ceiling leaking in the bathroom are whole stay The ceiling around the vent area leaked the whole entire time
592168202,The fob for the gated parking was not in the apt and no one brought it to me until the next day around    pm  There was also some leakage through the window when it was raining and we didnt have any extra towels to clean it up  Other then that it was great and the location was perfect for the union station and arch  I would stay again  The fob for the gated parking was not in the apt and no one brought it to me until the next day around    pm  There was also some leakage through the window when it was raining and we didnt have any extra towels to clean it up  Other then that it was great and the location was perfect 
628917527,Great stay  Would stay here again 
455492311,Good location  Felt secure   With window air conditioning had to choose between it being hot or bright from the windows while sleeping  Need to provide more than two towels  Also  we had to choose between it being hot and stuffy with the curtains drawn covering the a c or bright light while sleeping as soon as the sun came up  We slept terribly all three nights  Was given two towels for three nights  Asked for more towels and was told we would get some  Never did 
704901243,The place is better as a base for visiting Chicago and Hyde Park in particular  rather than a place to spend a lot of time in  as it is rather minimalist in furnishing and decor  The bottom fitted sheet needs to be a bigger size  as it pops off at the corners all the time  There were dust bunnies in the corner and long black curly hairs in the bed and on the floor  An even a small work desk    there is plenty of room for it  would have been helpful  The coach really needs to be replaced 
710596076,Could have been cleaner n price to high for quality and too much traffic
615980698,Overall  the apartment was how we expected  Clean enough  with a few exceptions  French press that was in the cabinet was dirty  bathroom floor could have used a  sweeping   The supplies in the apartment are very bare  if youre expecting to make coffee in the morning  bring your own grounds  Theres no coffee maker also  it is a French press  The beds arent very comfortable and the water pressure is minimal  These are pretty minor issues that did not affect our stay drastically    The one problem we did have was checking in  While we were able to get into the building via the call box outside  once we found the apartment door   flights up  we could not find where to put in the code to open the door  I had messaged Zencity about this issue  and did not have a rely until the next morning  After maybe    minutes we finally realized the door handle had a touch screen  it is black   does not light up unless you touch it  and we were finally able to get in  If we had not figured this out  Im not sure what we would have done  as there was no way to contact the host immediately  that I know of  or saw in the instructions     The best place about this apartment was the location  We will probably stay someplace else in the future to see what other Airbnbs the neighborhood has to offer 
616005143,This was a gorgeous apartment in a wonderful location  The bathroom cleanliness left something to be desired  but I hope that it was an unusual occurrence  The building amenities were amazing and better than expected  Normally I would not leave a note here but the bathroom cleanliness left quite a bit to be desired   I hope your cleaner was just having an off day and that this was not the norm  The floor looked as though it had not been swept  I swept it with the provided broom not long after arriving and there was quite a bit of dirt hair TP bits etc    the shower walls tub had clearly not been wiped down  I wiped it down with provided cleaner and rag   and the toilet rim had very obviously not been wiped down  dust  urine drips  etc  were clearly present   The rest of the apartment appeared to be clean  but if you are charging guests a cleaning fee  it seems like you would make the restroom a priority as every single guest uses the restroom and that is where the most germs are present   Also   you may want to be more detailed in the individual building amenities  I had no idea that the building had a hot tub or coffee machines  and wasnt positive that they were available to me as a temporary guest  Knowing both of those things wouldve been an even bigger selling point in addition to the stylish space    Overall it was an excellent stay and I will definitely be back  Bathroom cleanliness left quite a bit to be desired  The floor looked as though it had not been swept  I swept it with the provided broom not long after arriving and there was quite a bit of dirt hair TP bits etc    the shower walls tub had clearly not been wiped down  I wiped it down with provided cleaner and rag   and the toilet rim had very obviously not been wiped down  dust  urine drips  etc  were clearly present   The rest of the apartment appeared to be very clean 
640860374,Beautiful apartment with plenty of room and a wonderful view  Great spot in walking distance of tons of restaurants and shopping    I would give   stars but the electronic keypad was out of battery upon arrival and was not fixed till late the following day  I dont watch TV often  but there was an issue with the connection with the internet so the TV didnt work   Also  anytime messaging the host  it was usually an automated messaging system that rarely answered my questions    Other than that  I had a wonderful stay and would recommend even with these inconveniences   In the description  it said flexible check in but ended up not being able to get in till    minutes after normal check in  I messaged the host about parking before booking and they never got back to me   Also TV channels didnt work   I wanted to check in early if possible  but I couldnt even get in at the normal time of  pm because they were still cleaning and needed an extra    minutes  Then the keypad wasnt working because the battery was low  When I messaged  the responses were somewhat quick but they were automated and rarely ever answered the actual questions I was messaging about 
640107683,The description is spot on excellent location to bars  restaurants  cafe and Oz Park  While keeping in mind you are staying above a bar if you are a light sleeper I would suggest using the back room as there is less street noise  Unfortunately we had an issue with the sliding glass door  it automatically locks behind you  The locks are being changed but a friendly reminder to stay alert and do not lock yourself out    The beds were very comfortable and they had fresh  clean towels a plenty and ready for use but the common rooms such as kitchen and living room could have used some extra attention some spots seemed to have missed the last couple of cleanings  The water in the bathroom sink and the shower have poor pressure  I would also suggest letting it run for a couple of minutes prior as the water came out dirty brown and smelled of metal rust  Overall we had a great experience and would highly recommend  Wonderful place overall loved the things I would maybe suggest are adding a note that the sliding glass door automatically locks to help avoid the situation my mother and grandmother went through and maybe a glance over after cleaning just to make sure all surfaces and underneath furniture was not forgotten about  Thank you so much for the stay and wonderful communication  There looked to be some sort of peanut and other debris under the couch and overall debris in the living room and kitchen they seem to have not been cleaned it quite a while
616998993,Location was fairly convenient  Overall decent budget wise  but there were a few hang ups to consider  Check in was a little tricky   and there were some things that about the place  i e  couch in the hallway  tricky parking  that were less than ideal  Just to keep that in mind  Our instructions came after we asked  and had already arrived  Getting in was really challenging  There was a couch left right outside the door    looked a little run down  Not what I expected 
591561684,Very stylish and great location but the building was under renovation  The unit was not as clean as I expect from Airbnbs  though the gated parking was appreciated  Host was unresponsive to a safety concern during stay which was unacceptable so I will not plan to stay again  You need to include in your listing that the building is under remodel  there was a lot of construction stuff in the hallways    The unit was unlocked when I arrived  which was more than concerning  I msgd to confirm this was intentional and received no response  Unacceptable    I also noticed the place was quite dirty  There were clean towels and  appeared  clean bedsheets and trash had been taken out  but the floors didnt look like theyd been cleaned in a month  There was also a musty smell  which I think was coming from the washer dryer closet  There were work boot prints on the floor  as well as visible dirt and hair  The bathroom rug had long black hair on it which stuck to my feet after my shower  certainly not from me as I have long red hair 
664440253,This place is average to bad stay  I expected more based on the pictures  First  it looked like it was half way cleaned  Floors dirty  big stain on rug  soap in shower  and sheets stunk BAD and were obviously NOT changed from the previous person that stayed  They let us pick our check in time and it was suppose to be   am so we planned on trip on this time  We got into town and was told we couldnt check in until  pm  Made us late to our event   The bed was suppose to be a queen and it wasnt  There was suppose to be a table to eat and there wasnt  No parking near building so made everything very difficult to get to  When we got there the code did not work and we got no response for help  Had to ask the building owner for help  Luckily  we only had to stay one night and it was sufficient enough for that but will not go back   Bed was not a queen size bed  way smaller   Passcode to get in didnt work  Didnt have a fast response  We were locked out for sometime  We were also told we could check in at   a so we left town to get there at that time got into town and found out we couldnt check in til  pm  Bad experience  Floors were not mopped  Big stain on rug  Soap on shower wall  Sheets STINKED  I know those sheets and comforter were not changed  Location near everything but no parking close made everything a challenge Better parking  Cleaner 
646366652,This property is in a good location with access to I     I also like the fact that laundry and a gym were in the building  I love Zencity  They have great property with all of the amenities I love  This property was in a great location  right across the street from a really great Caribbean restaurant  Moesob   Check was easy  However the apartment it self could have been cleaner 
620051762,Great location neighborhood  good amenities  secure building  overall a great place to stay  I would definitely stay here again    Great location neighborhood   I would definitely stay here again    never did get our parking fob  no further updates during our stay besides the one time I called them  had to park on street   out of   nights we stayed  instead of inside gated area
638181938,I got a full refund so there was resolution  However my husband and I were left scrambling to find a new place to stay when we were over     miles away from home  The place had not been cleaned and had traces of someone who had clearly just stayed there   dirty dishes in the dishwasher  unmade bed  towels on bathroom and bedroom floor  black curly hairs in the bathroom floor  crumbs on kitchen counter and stove top  blanket bunched up on the couch from where someone had been relaxing and left water stains on the glass top coffee table  Just a completely far cry from what we expected and a complete disappointment  Our money was refunded for the room  after a two hour hold on the phone  but truly ruined the other plans we had for the evening that we cannot get back  I will stick with what I know with commercial hotels  I got a full refund so there was resolution  However my husband and I were left scrambling to find a new place to stay when we were over     miles away from home  The place had not been cleaned and had traces of someone who had clearly just stayed there   dirty dishes in the dishwasher  unmade bed  towels on bathroom and bedroom floor  black curly hairs in the bathroom floor  crumbs on kitchen counter and stove top  blanket bunched up on the couch from where someone had been relaxing and left water stains on the glass top coffee table  Just a completely far cry from what we expected and a complete disappointment  Our money was refunded but truly ruined the other plans we had for the evening that we cannot get back 
626539112,Loved this place  nicely decorated and very clean  Also  perfect situated to walk to several places  Our room was very hot  however that is our only complaint  It was very hot in the room and we could not figure out how to adjust it or receive a response  Otherwise it was amazing  Beautiful  clean and wonderfully located   There was no AC 
623939793,There are a lot of stairs but gives a good workout   the shower handle is broken and after many reviews not fixed  The couch is broken and after many reviews not fixed  It is so dirty and nasty this couch  With all kinds of stains very gross  I was told the couch would be replaced after my stay but I get the feeling they tell all guests that because its still there after many reviews  The bathroom smelled like a sewer  I imagine because of the broken shower handle and the water keeps running continuously it creates a smell  My first night I went back home as the room wasnt as clean as they stated  I let them know late in the night and the next day they got back to me and offered to send over a cleaning lady  So they cleaned the room the second day  First day I wasted my money because I didnt stay because it was gross  I am happy that the host sent someone to clean it did make a big difference    Because of the nasty couch I went back home for my own sheets and comforter  There was hair on the white sheets of the made beds   it just all grossed me out  The space was a nice one  The train is very close by  It is LOUD all through the night and day  If you have a hard time sleeping with noise this isnt the place for you  With the couch replaced and the place cleaned   shower handle replaced not such a bad unit  If you can deal with the train  The shower handle needs to be replaced it has been noted in many reviews the dirty couch as well  Thank you for sending someone to clean the second day that did make a big difference for me  Over all wasnt a bad stay  I feel the only way to have the adjustments made is through the review as you guys didnt fix the issues reported so many times before  Thank you for hosting   I booked specifically because the listing spoke about how clean the unit was   because of the gross feeling I went home I brought my own sheets and comforter   The home was not freshly cleaned upon arrival  It felt eeeky   The bathroom smelled like a sewer  The carpet was dirty  The place felt dusty  The couch was awful  Full of stains  I didnt stay my first night  So I lost my money  I told zencity about these things  They did not refund my first night  However they did send someone to clean the unit the second day and it was much better after that  Except the couch just needs to be replaced  Cleanliness I would have paid twice as much for super clean  Thats why I booked the room  Everything else was ok
619894774,Not as clean as expected to be 
616467131,Dont do it  Unclean   uncaring Management owner by the name of Marty  plus my wallet magically disappeared when I was the only   in my unit besides the house maid or whatever she calls herself  I am extremely disappointed  Maybe you should try hiring a new house maid or having someone inspect the properties personally bcuz both my units were not clean  I had  dust the hangers off along with cleaning out the microwaves  the refrigerators  the tubs and sweep the floors  Not   mention the bed sheets and pillow cases were filled with different types of hair so I didnt even sleep on the beds at either   of the units  The doorman even had to take the trash out bcuz it was left in the room  I also purposely placed seeds underthe chair in one unit and behind the table in the other and it wasnt cleaned  Its probably still there if you wana go and see for yourself bcuz I doubt she cleaned the rooms properly  Theres so much more than an unclean room that I endured   I will just say that I will not be renting anymore Zencity properties   also  I do not appreciate the way the man by the name of Marty didnt handle the situation I was in but I am sure you let everybody know   The cleanliness  The actual check in process was fiNe  it was walking into a used room and having   clean up after a late check in that was the problem  The doorman even gave me Clorox wipes   clean with  I have photos   video footage of how the place was when I checked in  I had   clean up myself   I still didnt sleep in the bed  The doorman that checked me in even had   take the trash out when I checked in bcuz It was full  I even purposely poured sunflower seeds on the floor under the chair that was there and I went back in the unit the night after I checked out due   my wallet missing and after the cleaning lady left   guess what was still there   Sunflower seeds  under the chair    Besides these units being unclean bcuz I had   different units    I will NEVER rent from them again  my wallet seemed to magically disappear when I was the only   in the unit besides the cleaning lady   Thats not even the half of it     Way   much   write but I will say I spoke to  of the owners of Zencity by the name of Marty and he didnt help the situation at all  He didnt even care  Told me hell call me back and a week later I still hadnt gotta call back so I called him and he didnt even care  remember who I was    And the Way he was talking  me really pissed me off  I have also told my family   friends to stay away from Zencity properties as well  No response even after   days worth of voice mails  Location was cool if it was actually clean and the management owners werent so fraudulent
645256351,The unit was not as clean as we would have liked given the pandemic  We found hair of past residents all over the bathroom  in the drawers and the shower   as well as a used towel still hanging on the curtain rod  which was extremely off putting  Also  the units WiFi was very spotty   we ended up hotspotting our phones for most of the trip  Lastly  although we were worried at first at the proximity to the train stop  the noise did not bother us which was a pleasant surprise  We appreciate the effort you all made  but the units lack of cleaning was extremely off putting  especially given coronavirus   The unit was not as clean as the photos led us to believe  Also  the WiFi was not reliable   The bathroom contained the biggest issues  The drawers were full of hair  the shower still had hair both in it and on the wall  and there was a used towel hanging on the shower curtain rod  The comforter on the bed had hair on it as well  Upon mentioning our concern to the host  the host offered to send someone to clean  However  no one ever came  The host was responsive  however as mentioned above  no one came to clean after our complaint 
709393872,Dont trust the photos  The title and photos indicate there are laundry facilities in the apartment but there were none  Upon entering the space  I immediately knew it was not the space in the listing photos and I was very upset  Additionally  the power to the microwave would go out after about    seconds and the water temperature in the sink and shower would change dramatically in a short period of time  Additionally  because I had to buy things  coffee and laundry services  that I had thought would be included  change my meals because the microwave wasnt working  and because there is no on site parking  while it is in a good area the value is less than other similar options in the area  please ensure the listing photos actually match the apartment you are renting out  mine did not match and I am upset about this   The title and photos indicate there are laundry facilities in the apartment but there were none  Upon entering the space  I immediately knew it was not the space in the listing photos and I was very upset  Additionally  the power to the microwave would go out after about    seconds and the water temperature in the sink and shower would change dramatically in a short period of time  because I had to buy things  coffee and laundry services  that I had thought would be included  change my meals because the microwave wasnt working  and because there is no on site parking  the value is less than other similar options in the area
559075904,It is a great location that is close to everything  Host was helpful about luggage storage and check in out was so smooth 
627572181,Great location  Good Amenities including enclosed patio and spacious unit   AC unit was not installed during my visit and only a ceiling fan in the living room was available to provide a breeze during a few warm days during my stay   Unfortunately the diversion for the shower did not work   so I was forced to use the tub to wash up  I trust this will be addressed for successive stays   All in all a nice property   AC not installed during stay   Only ceiling fan in living room  Shower head did not work during stay  
627817276,It was okay I would stay again 
624170159,Make sure your blanket  pillows and sheets are clean  Check under the bed and other places for old trash  and make sure they have a key fob for you  Because if you try to use the code after a certain time youll be locked out  Make sure house keeping checks all pillows  blankets and sheets after each checkout  as I have found most of what i listed to have stains from the previous visit  Also make sure the house is clean as i found another persons toiletries under a radiator and under the bed  Lastly get a replacement key fob as i was locked out the building after   and the kiosk was not working  and communication was very thin and took a while to get a response  And parking in the neighborhood is horrible  maybe you should invest in a parking space and include it in each persons stay 
649872077,This is a great location  and the building is charming and fresh  Thank you for your hospitality  but there was no fob  and the room was not as clean as one would expect  I was stuck in the lobby due to the instructions not mentioning the    seconds to use the elevator  There was no fob in the room  and no fob was ever brought 
669905030,Great place great location great price Thank you again for a wonderful stay  Still had a great time and would love to come back 
629670037,Nice and clean 
627862021,Expect a wonderful space with an amazing  secure location near Lafayette square   Even in a pandemic and the backdrop of demonstrations  I felt safe and always had a place to walk to  catch a takeout or find something to love about St  Louis  Id take a look at the cleaning company and general maintenance   They could have been much better  especially related to the dirty bathroom and chirping fire alarms   I do appreciate the communication and the accommodation of a different room when the fire alarm sounded in the space   There does seem to be a couple of roof leaks that created the problem with the fire alarm in the living room   I love the apartment space  view and location   Top notch  Some towels left in the hamper  trash was not taken out and there was a slow drain in the sink

617085860,This will be a pretty comprehensive review  If you are going on vacation with multiple people  this is an alright option  Very spacious  not quite as clean as the pictures make it out to be  but still very livable  The location is incredible  Its not too far away from the city while also being secluded enough away from the hustle and bustle of the late night city  That being said  if you are coming on a business trip  this is not the place for you  This apartment is literally right above a bar that plays music late into the night  I didnt mind it and was okay with it  because I usually stay up until      anyways  But let me just say you can make out just about every song they play  I found it to be pretty good for the price  but only because I got it on discount  If it were not that way  Im not sure if I could have justified the price  All in all  good spacious living  very very close to the city  If you can get past it being located right above a bar  this might be perfect for you  Not being right above a bar 
294919326,The place was very nice   clean  Check in was easy  The pool area was very nice  The only negative thing I have to say is that parking was an absolute nightmare   we drove around stressed out for about    mins trying to find a spot   Parking was a nightmare 
619857115,Modern apartment with high security  Professional renters  quiet neighbors  and a fun location in the heart of the business side of Kansas city  Crisp and clean  but not as minimal as imaged  Overall a wonderful stay  Thanks for getting me such a modern and inexpensive stay  The atmosphere is wonderfully private  but this definitely felt more like a robotic business transaction  Im completely fine with this  but I think others would be offended lol  Many blessings to you   The photos got the layout correctly  but everything from the flooring to the colors was completely different   Curly hairs on the bathroom floor  sheets had an old stain on them  Other than that  everything was sparkling clean 
708536342,Great space  Nice for a little vacation  Nice place but the communication with your guests needs to be better 
708182640,Peaceful building  beautiful neighborhood
703845535,Good location for CWE district and Barnes Jewish Hospital   Clothes washer in unit leaked and was an issue for me because it was an important amenity for choosing this place to stay as I was needing a place for extended stay close to Barnes   Clothes washer leaked  Broken light at bed head wall  sharp broken trim at bathroom step  electrical box pulled out of wall   Several days with nothing happening with solution to washer problem  then eventually still not fixed  Amenities not in working order  parking is an issue 
703760845,This studio would be ideal for short stays  The value is not the best for longer stays  with lack of long term parking unless you are able to reload the meter every   hours  The meter maids are literally so quick to write a parking ticket  It was hard for me as a night shift nurse  parking on the street during the day  It seems the host sometimes overlooks messages  so if you havent received a response within a reasonable length of time  shoot them another message  The response to my message hinting to have things fixed in the apartment didnt have the response I had hoped it would   the blinds were fixed after about a month and the shower head was still hanging out of the wall when I left  The rooftop access mentioned on the headline is actually at another building down the road  not at the actual building the unit is in  The rooftop access was a huge selling point for me to book  and it came as a disappointment when I found out it wasnt at the apartment building point  The bed was the best part of the stay   it was actually very comfortable  All in all  do your research and make sure this is the best option value wise  I felt like I overpaid   Photos  blinds missing slats  host fixed this issue about a month into stay   shower head dismantled from shower wall  never fixed  nAmenities  no rooftop access at unit building  was at another building down the street  bugs noticed to crawl behind crevices behind bathroom walls and kitchen counters  bathroom and closet wafted of marijuana at specific times of the day  and unfortunately my Louis Vuitton Keepall brought this aroma home with it Attempted to cut stay short due to issues mentioned above  but host never responded to my message asking to change reservation check out date until another message was sent regarding receiving mail    new netflix user named  Worst Airbnb Ever  however was added to the users on the netflix account that was signed in on the smart tv in unit  This was addressed with the host  who said that it was no one from the team that created this new user  However  it was not me either  The astonished faces of my coworkers were comical  when I told them I was paying       for a studio downtown  People at work told me they were paying roughly      less for a  br  ba mortgage just outside downtown 
455417537,Great location and very clean  We had problems with the WiFi not working but other than that the apartment was great  Great location and really nice apartment  Just would have expected that someone could have fixed the WiFi problem for us as we really needed it  WiFi went out and while we got responses on trying new passwords the WiFi was not fixed and someone could have easily come by and fixed it for us  We were there for   days and the WiFi went out on the  nd day  I appreciate that they responded with some help but it was very frustrating that it was never fixed 
514116931,A perfectly located studio  Perfect for exploring the city   Very walkable neighborhood and easy access to public transit  Hosts were very communicative and made checking in and out very simple  Overall a positive experience  Your location is fantastic  Your recommendations and speedy communication were greatly appreciated  Check in and check out were a breeze  The only downside was the cleaning issue  But overall we enjoyed our stay  There were several very long hairs throughout the bathroom  in the shower  sink  and around the toilet  My partner and I both have short hair so it must have been left by someone else  Also  I found broken glass next to the bed 
625142563,Im sorry  but I wont be back and Im not picky by any means  Inconvenience all around  Everything should be given up front  WiFi  password  change of location  parking spot numbers  etc  if you do decide to change locations and someone gets there on time and has to wait til you find another place  something should be compensated   Made up  time for time missed  another day  etc   I dont feel like I got my moneys worth   I spent half my time writing the host  Upon arriving I was asked to change location because the room I booked was having problems  I feel like they do this all the time  Upon arriving I had to change location  my check in was at     I didnt get to get settle in until      pm Clear upfront instructions  WiFi password wasnt given Until asked for   parking spot number wasnt given until asked for  so someone could have towed my car    not to mention I was in someone elses spot 
651547826,Great communication and location  The U of C neighborhood is relaxed Thanks for being a great hist to me
651574025,The bnb wasnt as clean as i expected  dishes were questionable and the fridge looked horrendous  Parking was not easy at all  and the host described a paid parking situation  i understood there was free parking  it was an okay place to stay  im grateful i had a bed  but while i was there i just felt it was unclean  besides the room The bnb wasnt as clean as i expected  dishes were questionable and the fridge looked horrendous  Parking was not easy at all 
650177993,Really convenient location Super easy check in check out Clean studio apartment with no frills  The air conditioner is not strong enough for the size of the studio apartment   The water tasted off 
621537820,Calming design  very spacious and light filled apartment  Great location and fast responses from host   Unfortunately  no in unit laundry as listed and very  very loud roof construction that I wasnt informed of  It was disruptive for my WFH calls  and caused debris to get over the floor  creating a mess for me to clean up at the end of each day  A ZenCity staff member named Mallory was seemingly dismissive about my inquiries on both points  however Ava and Marty were much more helpful  Marty was able to have the construction pause by my  th day there  until I left a week later   Would have loved to give a glowing review otherwise  Thanks for the quick responses  especially to Marty and Ava for helping when I felt uncomfortable with the construction and electronic lock     reasons for this score  First    Laundry in building or in unit   was listed as a feature  but after I couldnt find it and asked Zen City  I was told by Mallory that it wasnt in unit but instead there was a laundromat   blocks away  This was upsetting because I had booked this place in part because I wanted to clean my clothes safely during shelter in place  but instead  had to go out to get my clothes clean   n nSecond  I was not informed that there would be construction on the roof throughout my stay  It was really loud and disruptive from   to    not great for WFH calls  and minorly destructive to the unit inside  the walls and ceiling cracked  leaving paint chips and small debris on the floor near all the outer walls   When I inquired about how long the construction would last  Mallory said it would be a quick fix  When it continued on for   more days  I reached out again  and this time  Marty was much more helpful  He was able to have the construction stop until the end of my stay   The place was clean upon arrival  however  due to roof construction for the first   days  small debris and dust regularly fell from the walls and ceiling onto the floor  becoming a daily chore that I had to clean up 
348035318,A great location  beautiful views  nice pool and hot tub  A better clean up and a few cozy or thoughtful touches prior to arrival regular coffee pot   the key was difficult to operate The apartment had not been cleaned thoroughly  Laundry behind the drapes  a panful of food in fridge and old bread in cabinet  Great location and view  nice pool and hot tub   The apartment was extremely uncluttered  but almost to the point of being not comfy 
626826592,We were very disappointed to discover when we checked in that our apartment smelled strongly of cigarette and or marijuana smoke   We found the packaging for an air filter and  smoke trapping ashtray  in a kitchen cabinet   Putting   and   together  it was clear that a smoker had stayed there and Zencity had not bothered to clean apartment to get rid of the smell    We emailed the photos to Zencity but this website wont let me upload them to this review    We contacted Zencity by email and their first response was we should look under the kitchen sink for cleaning supplies   We replied that it was not our responsibility to clean the entire apartment  the carpeting and furniture to get rid of smoke odors   We eventually sent Zencity an email asking them to consider a     refund of our fees and their response has been   silence   We left the windows open day and night and that did reduce but not eliminate the odor   It also created other issues because the weather was rainy and variable and the apartment was often either too hot or too cold   And on   nights there were heavy drinkers and loud partying on the rooftop above us  so with open windows it was very loud   By the way  both doors to the rooftop have big signs that it was closed   The apartment itself was OK  but the customer service by Zencity was completely unsatisfactory   There was a prominent sign in the apartment that smoking is prohibited and a smoker may be charged an extra      cleaning fee   Obviously that was not enforced   I read that Zencity manages extended stay apartments in Chicago  Kansas City and St  Louis   Based on this experience  I would be very cautious renting a property managed by them  Your company needs to be more responsive to customers when there is a problem   Your customer service was very disappointing   You can read the chain of emails between me and your representatives   The apartment was not cleaned as described   See above   The entire apartment smelled like cigarette and or marijuana smoke when we checked in   We notified the manager   Zencity   who basically shrugged their shoulders and did nothing   Their first response was to look for cleaning supplies under the kitchen sink  and there were not any there that might have helped    We found the packaging for an air filter and  smoke trapping ashtray  in a kitchen cabinet  so putting   and   together a smoker had been staying there   Zencity appartently did nothing to get rid of the smell before we arrived  in spite of the prominent notice in the apartment that no smoking is allowed and there is a      extra cleaning fee for smoking   We left the windows open day and night and it did reduce the odor but did not get rid of it   That led to other problems because the weather was rainy and variable and it was hard to keep the apartment at a livable temperature   And for   nights there were people partying on the building roof above us very late  so we could not keep the windows open because of the loud noise   By the way  there are big signs on both rooftop entrances saying that area is closed  but that apparently did not stop groups of heavy drinkers on   nights   We sent an email to  Zencity asking them to consider refunding     of our total charges  and the their answer has been   silence  See above 
669413907,Booked this place because a friend came in from out of town  We saw how their listing stated they did ultra cleaning so it made us want to book it especially because this is during covid  This place was the opposite it was SO dirty  There was a hair ball in the toilet and hairs on the seat  When we checked the bed there were hairs too and the table had dirty marks on it  I contacted the host immediately with pictures too and did not receive a response until the next day  We wanted to use the dishes that night and when we grabbed a dish it was dripping with water  The stove had dirty marks too  I was surprised that the host did not respond to at least accommodate  After check out I requested a refund and they said they can assure me the place was clean and that it was discounted too much already so they couldnt  I contacted air bnb support after and told them my experience and they refunded me the cleaning fee thankfully  I wish I would have gotten refunded for the whole thing as the host did nothing to accommodate  This place is unsafe  Dont stay here trust the reviews  This was the worst experience especially having a friend come in from out of town I was embarrassed  Hair in toilet and on the toilet seat  Hairs in bed  dirty marks on tables and spots on couch  The stove also had big dirt spots and dishes in the cabinet that were supposed to be clean were wet and dripping with water 
619445238,Nice area for downtown  The cleaning was not up to my liking or my significant others liking  We had to clean it ourselves to be      satisfied  The bathtub did not look dirty but once we cleaned it  It was dirty which was unfortunate because we love taking baths  The shower was amazing though  Everybody in the building was also extremely sweet  The elevator went down and the handle to get into the room did not work  I contacted the owner at      pm   I did not get a response until  am the next day  It says Zencity is     
652426221,Great place overall Thanks a lot Too much noise outside  A lot of sirens
630079416,Thank you for your hospitality  Thank you for your hospitality  Please check your dishwasher  I think it needs repair   You know we had an issue with the Wi Fi    and we were not able to watch TV   Also  It could be better in this pandemic time to provide some paper towels and sanitizer  Thank you for your quick responses  The refrigerator has some residue of dried liquid 
627404246,FRAUDULENT LISTING    The address is on Pearson Street  around the corner from the Hermitage address  It is questionably connected to a different apartment building on Hermitage  but NOT the one on the listing  The questionable address that it is supposedly connected to has a porta potty in the front  with caution tape on the fence  and is in terrible shape     The photos do say that it is not exactly like the actual apartment because it is a new listing  Fine  But all the photos of windows show it is at an upper level  Which is true if it were in the correct address  Instead  it is direct from the sideway into the doorway  These are the apartments that get broken into in this neighborhood because theyre easy in and out    To add to the lack of safety  the door knob does not shut all the way  It was handmade drywall that didnt line up properly when they were trying to rehab the apartment  So the deadbolt works  but the door opens about an inch because the knob does not connect properly    It is connected to the remainder of the unfinished rehab apartments  which had THREE smoke detectors chirping  Unless the central air fan is on full blast it is every minute of that loud  low battery  chirp   I went in and tried to turn one off  but it still would not stop    Zencitys communication was terrible  I have transcripts to show for that  too    I HAVE PHOTOS DOCUMENTING EVERYTHING  I cannot speak for other listings  but either Zencity does not check their properties before they list them  or they are a fraudulent organization  Zencity  check your properties before you post them  If you are an honest company  and you sincerely did not check beforehand that it was a different building and address  then that is something you should look into in the future  If you do not care  I wonder if all of your listings are fraudulent  If you need proof that your company is representing a fraudulent listing  take a look at      W Pearson      N Hermitage  and     N Hermitage   The address is WRONG  They say it is     N Hermitage  It is      W Pearson  It is in NO WAY connected to     N Hermitage  It is connected to     N Hermitage      N Hermitage has a porta potty in front of the building  caution tape on the fence  and is in terrible shape   n nIt is not a second floor as the photos suggest  I know it says that it isnt exactly the pics because its a new place  but the multiple photos of windows suggest it is a second or third floor unit  First floor buildings are unsafe in that neighborhood   n nThe messages from host  when they actually responded  said it is connected to     which is FALSE  Either this company does not check their properties before posting them  or they are trying to get away with showing     as a nicer building than the one it actually is in   n nI have photos to prove this   I asked multiple times why it was a different address  no response  They did not respond until I went to the building to see it was  in fact  a different address and wrote them to tell them the door does not close all the way  It locks from the deadbolt  but the hand made drywall door frame is unacceptable  The doorknob itself does not close all the way  Even when locked with deadbolt  the door opens approximately   inch because the doorknob isnt lined up properly   When they finally did respond  the representative said they would send a  handyman  over and that never happened    Very disconcerting  Hours went by without hearing back from the host  When they did reply  it was false information  Listing address is a completely different building and street 
627349137,Thanks for hosting  Have blinds for the sake of peoples privacy  security needs to be updated anybody can just get in  have real cleaning personal that cares and takes there job seriously clean your units communicate with those that you are hosting   There werent any blinds in the kitchen and someone got into the building and knocked at my units door I called the police on May   rd to assist me  Mice are in the buildings walls  bathroom was disgusting with thick dirt on toilet  and shower mate was cloth and smelled of mildew  dishes where dirty Having curtain or blinds in kitchen
708203918,Slow internet  had difficulties accessing building with intercom down  Parking was inconvenient  Had to leave my car in a paid lot all week  Be prepared to spend       per day on parking  High speed wireless wasnt accurate  I hD  mbps download speed all week  Very difficult running reports for work with such slow speeds   Intercom to check in to building wasnt working  Contacted zencity for help accessing building  they said they were working on the issue   and then never responded  I had to ask a random resident to let me into the building and swipe their fob to let me onto my floor  Zencity never responded to my issue not being able to get into the building

420785666,The shower had very low pressure  Water only came out of half of the shower head  So showering felt more like a bird bath  I was informed    mins before check in that I would be staying in a unit different from what I reserved because of maintenance issues  It wasnt a huge deal but I would have prefered someone asking if I was okay with the changes first  Considering the cleaning fee and price I would have liked the bedding to look more presentable  I personally feel more comfortable sleeping in beds that appeal to sight  touch  and feel senses    But overall not bad   The location was very convenient  The shower had very low pressure  Water only came out of half of the shower head  So showering felt more like a bird bath  I was informed    mins before check in that I would be staying in a unit different from what I reserved because of maintenance issues  It wasnt a huge deal but I would have prefered someone asking if I was okay with the changes first  Considering the cleaning fee and price I would have liked the bedding to look more presentable  I personally feel more comfortable sleeping in beds that appeal to sight  touch  and feel senses    But overall not bad   The location was very convenient 
626809238,Great location and great unit for a good value  From my experience and that of other reviewers  the cleanliness can be hit or miss  Overall my stay was great with the exception of things being a bit dirty and no rooftop access  Great finishings in the unit  great neighborhood  good value   The rooftop deck was advertised in the listing but I was unable to access it with my key fob   Roach at check in  live mouse day    dead mouse on floor end of day    water leak from wall  fridge had stains on surfaces  bar stools covered with crumbs  floor sticky in spots  Host had decent communication  however they offered to come by during the day to have a look at the leak and do a spot clean  and I dont think anyone ever came by  if they did I didnt hear anything about it and couldnt tell 
615825744,The apartment was nice  but different from the photos  The host was responsive during my stay except for the day of checkout  I had forgotten a travel bag on the bed and realized a few hours after checkout  The host did not check themselves for the bag  nor did they allow me back in the unit to grab the item myself  Instead they only told me the cleaning service didnt see my bag and that was it  Completely cut off  I was extremely disappointed  I enjoyed my stay even though the photos advertised a completely different apartment  What tanked the pleasantness was the fact that you would not allow me to check the room for my belongings that I forgot  Either the host or the cleaning service stole my belongings  I am highly disappointed by this and how the host became unresponsive after checkout day about my belongings  Did not respond when attempting to retrieve left behind items  Not helpful at all 
513509421,Very good place to stay and great location  love the design and vintage post mid century visuals and contemporary building decorum  I recommend staying at this place for its location in East Hyde Park Kenwood  Indian Village area   adjacent to So  Lake Shore Drive  Metra Trains  plus CTA buses at the corner   Prime location within a few blocks of Whole Foods  Marshalls  if you forgot your swimwear  and the iconic Original Pancake House  Zipcars are located with in a block or two  Very spacious  incredible south and east views of the shoreline and Lake Michigan  Comfortable and clean apartment of a higher floor  all communication was easy and clear instructions  easy in and out   Parking appears to be quite challenging due to the density of high rise buildings in are area  Overall  we are very pleased  Pros We felt safe in and out the building  including at night   Very quiet  friendly neighbors  courteous front desk staff   Terrace cafe was a nice plus   Nice pool and exercise room   Cons A couple of scary episodes with Elevator     not stopping level with the floor  door getting stuck on closing and jerking motion when moving between floors   Some neighbors warned us about using Elevator      Leaking kitchen facet   Disinfectant smell is too strong  irritating for people with sensitivities   Suggestions Full length mirror  on bathroom or bedroom door or wall  wifes request  Coffee maker is a french press manual type  not an automatic coffee maker  full disclosure   Overall  very please with the accommodation  although nothing to compare it to since this was our first AirBnB experience    I would consider staying  with Zencity and East End Luxury Suite No   again 
624934962,The downtown location of this apartment cant be beat  especially for the price  While there were some cleanliness and communication issues  overall our stay at the apartment was very pleasant and we would come back again  Also note that the roof deck that is advertised in the listing is still under construction and not yet open for use  While there were some cleanliness and communication issues  overall our stay at the apartment was very pleasant and we would come back again   The listing featured a rooftop deck which was still under construction and not yet accessible  Some of the other listed amenities were closed due to the COVID situation  but this is not the fault of Zencity   When we arrived  it was obvious that countertops had not been wiped down thoroughly as there were multiple watermark rings evident  Some glasses and plates were stuck to cabinet shelves  or hadnt been cleaned fully in the dishwasher  so they had to be ran in the dishwasher again  There were hairs in one of the bathroom sinks  and the trash had not been emptied in the other bathroom  There was also a large sticky spot right at the apartment entry kitchen area that we had to mop down    Given the obvious lack of attention given to cleaning and the current pandemic situation  we had to wipe the whole place down with disinfecting wipes when we arrived  as we werent sure which other areas  light switches  door handles  etc  could have possibly been missed  The host responded to my messages quickly  but several pieces of important information were not conveyed in a timely manner  For example  we were notified of a planned fire alarm test after the alarm had already been going off for    minutes and we had egressed down    flights of stairs  causing a serious and panicked disturbance to our work day  This could have been entirely avoided with more advance notice  The host also requested to drop by to do some scheduled maintenance to the flat less than an hour before they showed up to do so    I also got a feeling that some of the check in out messages were produced by a bot  as I mentioned something about a lost and found item in the apartment and received a totally unrelated response about late check out 
669420299,The pictures showed a larger place with a kitchen table and chairs  a full size couch and larger bed area  We got a tiny place with barley enough room to set up a pack n play for our   month old  No kitchen table  no chairs and the  couch  fits   person comfortably  I dont know how people get away with renting places with pictures to obviously another unit they are renting  Id update your pictures to the actual place you are renting  The pictures showed a larger place with a kitchen table and chairs  a full size couch and larger bed area  We got a tiny place with barley enough room to set up a pack n play for our   month old  I don u    t know how people get away with renting places with pictures to obviously another place   It would have been great if it was the place of the pictures that we booked
628512997,Could have been better but overall decent experience There was trash underneath the couch and there is only one fork in the whole unit  Glasses in the cabinet were filthy
625264935,Location is great  The building itself had some issues during our stay  there were no lights in the stairways and we needed to use our phones to see   The unit itself was just okay  It left much to be desired as overall cleanliness was an issue for us   Amenities were there  but they were essentially not usable as they weren u    t clean  I couldn u    t clean anything because the sponge that was left was already used   The rug needed to be vacuumed as there was hair everywhere  The dishes in the cabinets were not clean  Overall cleanliness would have made this a much better experience 
652851634,N A Thank you for being great host but some people may want front wall painted over if their really picky  stayers   Really nice home and I appreciations the  hr extension  Had to change reservation last minute and walls were severely scratched need a new paint job  Just minor details of mopping and dishes
621747452,Good place beautiful area
512786003,Loved the space  Very stylish and a short Uber ride to downtown          bathroom was an unexpected touch that was very cool  Perfect kitchen if you want to cook  My only grievance is the wall near the door was quite thin  I continuously thought people were coming in my apartment but I just was hearing them going and coming from theirs  Nevertheless  I absolutely would stay here again and I encourage others to do so as well  Loved the apartment and location  but lock for back door was broken and walls were a bit thin  But otherwise  did love stay 
512754967,Meh  Beware  by the time all the service fees  taxes  etc were added up it was almost like going to a hotel where they change your sheets  The cancellation policy is pretty severe and they collected half in front and half   weeks prior to occupancy  Check they AC unit too   after waking up at   am several nights  we discovered that the AC was programmed to go to heat at    in the middle of the night  Grrrr     The location was pretty sweet  minutes from the tunnel to take you to the Promontory Walk and minutes to the Metra stop  Beds and bed sheets were comfortable  Sofa was the worse for wear   pretty dingy  The floors had a bit of sticky film  The views were nice but you had to peep out of the window  If you sat down  all you could see was sky  Windows   screens could have used a cleaning      What was frustrating was that I asked for extra towels and there were none  We asked for two fobs and keys instead of the one  so that we could go on our separate ways   if one wanted to go for a walk and the other for coffee but they said they only had one  so we always had to make our plans coordinate      The kitchenware was the utmost bare minimum  We were always washing dishes because there were only   cups    plates    spoons    forks    steak knives  no cutting knife  no paper towels  a tiny disposable towel  no cooking oil  For coffee they only provided a French Press  no coffee maker  Thats what they call luxury accommodations   Hallway floors were sticky  I tried to vacuum but the vacuum that was there just spouted more stuff out than in  Responses were a day and more late  Never helpful either except for the time I reported one wine glass had a crack in the base  Even then  it took several days for them to replace  I had asked for extra towels before hand  a tip from another user  but none was provided  It was a bit of a hassle to have been given one key and one fob  I asked for a second so that is one of us went walking  we didnt have to coordinate when to gain entry  It was also a bit of a hassle to have only   large spoons    small forks    small spoons  NO cutting knife  NO paper towel  one small disposable towel      plates and   cups  You had to keep washing what you used  The cooking utensils were pitiful as well  If you say youre a luxury condo  why the measly kitchenware  The sofa looked pretty dingy and worse for wear 
628805160,I never had a problem with this company  I just know it was so hot and the air didnt work  The place is super nice just wish the air worked  I just expected them to have air that work are at least rush to get it fixed
341715111,Great location  nice apartment  Great place except for the shower curtain  Also  it would be great to have a little coffee for the in the morning  since theres a coffee press in the apartment  The place could use a new shower curtain  but otherwise all the rest was clean
622021138,Stylish place  Thanks 
453381436,Great stay  great communication  perfect location  easy check in   helpful provided utilities    Great stay  the temperature in the bed room fluctuated a lot though and might have made for a better sleep if not
651002990,The hosting company Zencity has terrible customer service  I was not able to enter the rental on time and they did not give the rental a thorough cleaning between visits  The key was not even in the lock box upon my arrival  Considering COVID     they should have spent more than    minutes cleaning and sanitizing the space  Unprofessional 
652247956,It is sparsely furnished unit in a building that is located in a desolate part of downtown  If fit my budget but not ideal location to walk out and feel like you were in a downtown urban location   The photos are not of this unit   Different furniture  layout   Not only was it unclear for me   two other guests staying in other zencity units had the same issue with access upon arrival  Calling a hotline that requires you to leave a message and then wait for an email response is not responsive  Isolated area  Nothing around the building  Building is vacant and felt very desolate 
672710113,This place should have been perfect   great location  just enough room  good price  unfortunately  it wasnt    The place was just not clean and the water was shut off on the first night  this was not communicated to us  and then the water was brown the next morning making a shower impossible  We did purchase bottled water to drink because we didnt feel comfortable after seeing what was coming out of the pipes    I hope they are able to correct these issues because otherwise it would have been a good experience  If you are going to count on the doorperson to check in guests you need to have a way for the guest to contact the doorperson so they dont have to stand outside the building    You need to hire another cleaning company because this one is not doing a good job   I was very disappointed in the cleanliness   I can forgive a lot at places I am staying but not cleanliness    You should let your guests know before booking or at least at booking if the water to the unit is going to be shut off   At the very least a discount should be given for the time the water is shut off      It is really too bad because the location is perfect   The building is right next door to my daughters building and if my experience had been better I would be rebooking every couple of months   It wasnt clean and check in was not effortless   The doorperson at the building wouldnt acknowledge that I was waiting outside the building so I had to stand there until someone else walked into the building and went in with them  after explaining why I was doing it  not that I was trying to breach security    Then the doorperson was nasty to me and not at all helpful  The whole place felt a bit grimy  all the dishes has a grease film on them and had to be washed before using  the table was dirty and it was not well dusted    You could tell it wasnt cleaned well   Most Airbnbs are clean because the owners take pride in them   This felt more like a budget motel in terms of cleanliness  Slow responding to one of my messages but eventually got back to me    They also did not communicate the fact the water was going to be turned off  If it had been cleaner   If I had access to laundry    If the water had not been turned off on my first night   If the water had not been brown the next morning and I could have taken a shower   If I didnt have to purchase bottled water to drink because I did not feel safe drinking the water after all the brown water 
621134080,Pretty big disappointment and a few inconveniences  Host wasnt as professional as I thought he would have been    always a different person replying as zencity so communication was somewhat confusing as well
621599641,Okay place  Have place cleaned correctly
621844240,Great place with a good view Had a problem with the door code given to us  called and got a new one
621054093,Great stay and a cute place  Thanks for the hospitality   Thank you for the hospitality  It was a nice place  The only thing I really have a complaint about is that walking in  you can tell the tenants were smokers  You can still smell the cigarettes  Other than that  it was a great stay  Also  someone wrote on the chalkboard a number for a blow job  Which I thought was odd  Dishes werent washed properly  Some were still dirty and placed in the cabinets
420774671,Overall  it was a good place  The only complaints I have were regarding the slow and sometimes not relevant responses and the sickening smell coming from the bathroom  But in their defense  it was a building issue and the maintenance person said it would take a few days to fix  after my stay   Unfortunately  I had to endure it but maybe by the time you book  all will be fine   The slow response was really inconvenient once when I had to extend my stay but before they responded  a photo crew had already come in and we had move everything outside to wait    I am a home person so I loved that I never really had to leave for anything except food and what I came for  THIS IS THE BEST PART  The owner really put thought into stocking the place with household items like laundry and dishwasher pods  pots and pans  phone chargers  air fresheners  etc  Things you dont think you will need on a trip  they had the foresight to put it there     All in all  I think my issues were just luck and I would recommend booking here  Everything was good except for the smell and slow responses  It seems a lot of thought went into making the apartment feel like home  very convenient courtesies   Perhaps add a micro USB charger  Samsung  other non Apple devices   There was an odd smell emanating from the bathroom  but to be fair  it may have been and issue in multiple floors of the building not owned by Zencity 
419783909,Small kitchen cute though   great bed   Loved the set up of the building  Stylish space   The couch was small and uncomfortable which left me in the room most of the time w my phone on my Netflix app but those things arent a big deal  Over all I enjoyed my experience here although I would say you had a great tub wish there was a way to plug it for a nice bath  I would recommend booking here for sure  Very cute place  You have to jiggle the key to get in it wouldnt budge at first I almost thought I couldnt get in 
621565725,Great place and location to stay at this value  I reserved a room twice in the same week here instead of a local hotel and will definitely repeat in the future if this place is available 
622145037,It is a great place to stay with great amenities but it gets little loud and noisy sometimes as walls are very thin    Finding the apartment in side the building  Problem with access code and the door was jamming It is bit noisy   you can hear your neighbors and people walking on street
621072318,This was an experience that started out fine and ended horribly     Price gouging   We booked the space for six nights  Though the keypad was giving us issues every time we tried to enter the apartment  we once waited       minutes for Zencity to change the code since the keypad wasnt working   we wanted to extend our stay   They refused to give us the new daily rate  which was about     cheaper for those same new dates that we wanted to extend into   They said that if we extended it wed have to keep our same rate because they couldnt change it for us   Annoyed and frustrated  we said fine because we didnt want to have to move and the place was nice enough   After going back and forth  they finally sent a modification that actually added an additional day on top of what we requested   We were flexible  so we didnt say anything because we were already pretty annoyed and wanted to not have a sour relationship with Zencity   RODENT  I E  MOUSE  and poor response   A little past the midway point of our stay  I saw a mouse in the kitchen go from under the oven to under the dishwasher  and later to the bathroom   Now   my partner is TERRIFIED of mice  Terrified   I immediately messaged Zencity  asked them during one call to send someone  they said they would   then asked them on a second call  three hours later  to send someone  they said they would    About four hours after that  around      hours in total  they sent someone who said he just got word an hour before his arrival   In the meantime  like any reasonable person  I had to find another Airbnb last minute  which ended up costing more than this location   Despite the fact that we found large holes throughout the apartment  laundry room and bathroom  and the door doesnt have a door guard  so anything can slide right in        all of which we documented  we were only refunded half of the money we paid for the remaining days of our stay after Zencity ignored our messages and started only communicating with Airbnb     It really started out as a promising trip  but my partner is still reeling from the experience  Im out of a few hundred bucks unexpectedly and I dont even know if Ill have a job in a month  I will NEVER rent a place managed by Zencity again  The space was nice until I found a mouse   I think you all should consider plugging up the holes around the space  laundry room area  bathroom  and put a door guard under the doors  The keypad didnt work for the first few tries  There was a mouse in the kitchen  and we didnt leave food out  When we couldnt get into the apartment and when we found a mouse in the apartment  we experienced pretty slow responses  When I booked the place  you were charging     a day   When I tried to extend it  you all were booking it for     a day at the time and refused to give me that rate   I extended anyway because of COVID    to be nice   Then you extended for one day more than I wanted originally  But I said fine   Then I find a mouse    you wait over    hours to send someone  who told me when he got there that he had only gotten notice an hour before   and then you only give me half my money back for the remaining three days  which shouldve been an additional two days had you not extended my time    I had to find another place last minute  which resulted in me spending even more money that I intended  and I dont even know if Ill have a job in a month    
511719147,I reached out to the company  host  as our power was out for a majority of the stay  Was told that someone would come and never did  We ended up leaving the property before time  Because of this situation  the good looks and location were over shined  I reached out to the company  host  as our power was out for a majority of the stay  Was told that someone would come and never did  We ended up leaving the property before time  Because of this situation  the good looks and location were over shined

619854562,Zencity   great units and extrememly poor customer support    Rented two places from them starting on           The rooms are really new and nice   Near the Country Club Plaza in KC   Underground parking  new units  nice building so a big thumbs up for that    Kitchen amenities are quite sparse though  so cooking isnt that easy   Maybe they expect you to eat out a lot since you are travelling   Rooms were spacious and beds nice    Customer support is atrocious  worst of any Airbnb I have stayed in by far   Had an issue in the first place  no shower curtain  and it was never addressed   We were told a shower curtain would be delivered and that did not happen   The second stay never happened due to the covid    issues   Trying toe communicate with zencity and get a reasonable refund has been an ordeal  with way too much time of mine utilized for this effort  Extremely poor customer service for an agency that runs multiple Airbnb units   Never stayed there   Just clicking to get through review  Due to the covid    outbreak my wife  who was going to stay in the unit from         decided to fly home   Her activities later that week were cancelled and she was afraid that flights home would be cancelled    She called the zencity contact number at noon and no response   I subsequently contacted zencity through the account and let them know we would not be using the reservation   Zencity offered a refund of          of unused nights  which was Tuesday   Wednesday    I attempted multiple times to contact zencity and could not get through and or left messages and they were not returned   I was asking for     of unused plus the cleaning fee         We never even checked into the room  so no cleaning would be necessary   Zencity then offered     which I accepted  as I want to end this ordeal    Very disappointed in the customer service of zencity and will not rent one of their spaces again 
624853784,I stayed for   days  I had some issues with Zen and the apartment  But I think it would be great for you  Perfect location and etc  I would have to say the community wasnt as nice to me  And I felt a lil unwelcome  The host were great communicators  They were in constant contact with me  Thank you Marty for your help  I would like to thank you for Airbnb  I really didnt like my experience  I think thats less on you and more me  But the space I was in was great  The only issues I had was check  in  the readiness of the apartment  and being called on for smoking on the balcony   The dryer isnt working properly   Check in to a whole  I was given the wrong instructions  Didnt like I had to go all the way outside to smoke  when I had a whole balcony   NOT YOUR FAULT 
531888622,Nice  clean apartment with good view overlooking rooftop terrace  It would be helpful if you would provide information upfront about the WiFi password  how to work the tv and how to access the building amenities 
622723783,Great space  Great space  Thank You 
622864247,After check out host asked me to pay     for a Pillow that had been drawn on  Which was not from me  Hi I agreed to pay it just to not have an issue then they came back asking for another     for the same reason which Im not about to pay  After I left host asked me to pay for a Pillow that was drawn on which was not for me for a payment of     which I accepted and paid  which I should not have  after that then they requested another    for the same issue 
622139805,Would not typically AirBnB in Wicker Park mostly because I live in Chicago but I needed to a quiet place to finish a research paper  Since Chicago is essentially shut down due to a pandemic this seemed to be my only option to get out of an overcrowded house    Positive  Clean  wide open space with a sky light and   bedrooms with comfy beds and clean linens with clean towels folded on each bed  Sat at the kitchen island under the skylight and was very productive on my laptop  Good WiFi connection and very quiet inside the apartment as long as the windows were closed    Negative  Was given the wrong code for the lock box on the front door  luckily a neighbor let me in  Dont rent this place if you cannot easily walk up to the  th floor  very steep long staircases  Hallways are very dingy and dark and have stained carpets all the way through with neighbors shoes everywhere  so not a good smell to walk into   Handle to the shower came off in my hand and NO water pressure at all  Coffee supplies provided typical to a coffee bar at an AirBnB but a broken coffee grinder which made everything else on the counter useless  Last thing  weird Chicago weather     degrees on a Tues and    degrees on a Wednesday  was annoying because I had to message Zen City every time I needed the temp changed outside of the   degree pre setting on the nest thermostat   Messaged me the wrong code to get in the front door and a neighbor had to let me in and I emailed the host and didt get a response until I figured out I had to message through the app to get a response with the correct code   Host did not respond to my email  only responded through app the next morning
630392509,Very nice loft  Expect to climb lots of stairs and pay fairly steep prices for parking  Its in a great location everything you need is within walking distance  Key was not initially in the lockbox  Had to bother neighbors to buzz us in Parking included in price and an elevator 
670562219,Hard to find key and unit  Host not willing to work with me on refunding money for the reservation even though I didnt stay
623031249,This was a cute little place  But you definitely get what you pay for here    the parking sucks because you have to pay for it  The hallway to the room smells SO BAD  Like a dog kennel    but thats not the hosts fault  Its just a warning lol  The apartment is nice but make sure you know how to make french press coffee because there isnt a normal coffee maker here  Also  bring toilet paper  paper towels ect  because there was none when I stayed here  Everything else is great though if your looking for relaxing stay on a budget 
622957893,Great place to stay Get place to stay
650210320,Great place  Lots of spiders on balcony n a few in living room Big spiders too  Cleaning the balcony of the webs n spiders would be great so I could enjoy the balcony next time  There was a spider on the frount room corner wall and lastly bathroom shower curtain was dirty
622723684,Nice clean space  will stay again 
652913972,Location was awesome   Just wasnt quite what we expected  The apartment wasnt as nice and homey as we expected   more like an motel room  But is was clean which was a big plus  
622515831,Few things need to b fixed in the loft but the space is great Loft is nice however kitchen faucet hot water drips out and the shower hot water last every bit annoy   minutes  Hot water ran for literally   minutes in the shower then turned cold and kitchen faucet hot water basically doesn u    t work  Condom wrapper behind night stand
623025147,Great location and value Just work on cleanliness before arriving other than that it was very good As you know the bed wasnt changed and floors were not clean  sink was dirty and no laundry soap
621933981,I booked a one bedroom with elevator access  When I arrived at the building  elevator did not work   was stuck on  th floor    I tried to call zen city through the app but no one picked up  Finally someone responded to my message on the app and told me I can use the back door to access stairs to the  th floor  I declined this because I had a lot of luggage  They finally re booked a small studio with elevator access but when I asked for   back  ZenCity refused   so far   I have used ZenCity before but this experience was far below their standards   I booked a one bedroom with elevator access  When I arrived at the building  elevator did not work   was stuck on  th floor    I tried to call zen city through the app but no one picked up  Finally someone responded to my message on the app and told me I can use the back door to access stairs to the  th floor  I declined this because I had a lot of luggage  They finally re booked a small studio with elevator access but when I asked for   back  ZenCity refused   so far   I have used ZenCity before and this was very unprofessional in how I was treated   I booked a one bedroom with elevator access  When I arrived at the building  elevator did not work   was stuck on  th floor    I tried to call zen city through the app but no one picked up  Finally someone responded to my message on the app and told me I can use the back door to access stairs to the  th floor  I declined this because I had a lot of luggage  They finally re booked a small studio with elevator access but when I asked for   back  ZenCity refused   so far   
708727173,This place offers a great location in the middle of downtown St  Louis  Place is very comfy and ideal for a visit   Place was grest except for a couple moldy spots here and there   Living room carpet couldve been cleaner 
622638889,Great location 
622531555,Beautiful apartment inside an even more beautiful building   There are   different addresses given for this listing  Were familiar with the area so we were able to figure out which address was correct  U need a key fob to get in the front doors   to use the elevator  which we didnt have until we got into the apartment  Luckily a resident in the building assisted us to our floor where we were then able to use the door code to get into the unit  Once we got the key fob it was smooth sailing to get around in the building   access all the great amenities  The photos do make the unit appear bigger than it is  but its still very good size for a studio  Full size appliances in the kitchen  except for the dishwasher  its tiny  but hey its a dishwasher   The very large closet is almost the size of the bedroom  so that helps avoid any clutter from luggage   things  Plus the  rather large bathroom also nicely makes up for any space u may feel is missing initially  The description boasts about the large windows   natural light  This particular unit is actually quite dark  The view is just of buildings that are taller so most of the natural light is blocked out  There is only   lamp in the living room for light  and all of the bulbs had very low lumens  This made the apartment feel obnoxiously dark  especially during the daytime when it was cloudy  The only complaint we made was that there was an issue with the garbage disposal not working in the kitchen  which smelled horrible   even worse when the water was run  Messaged the host   got a response right away  A maintenance request was initiated by the host and the problem was supposed to addressed by the building maintenance the next day  We stayed for   days and unfortunately one ever came to fix the problem  After running the dishwasher a few times  had to run it empty in case there was any back flow from the disposal which contained rotten food that had obviously been sitting in it for a while   most of the smell went away  Then we  just used the kitchen sink minimally  However  that issue was not the fault of the host  The host was quick to respond each time we reached out and thankfully was gracious enough to allow us to check in last minute  Wed definitely stay here again and absolutely recommend Zencity as host  Properties are professionally cleaned and always well kept  No one ever came to fix the garbage disposal  The photos make the place look bigger than it is  Good  size for a studio tho with large closet    bathroom   There were   different addresses given for this listing  Were familiar with the area so we were able to figure out which address was correct  U need a key fob to get in the front doors   to go up in the elevator  which we didnt have until we got into the apartment  Luckily a resident in the building assisted us to our floor where we were then able to use the door code to get into the unit  Once we got the key fob it was smooth sailing   Better discount for stays of     days or more 
706575540,Great location  I really enjoyed the stay here  I would just like to suggest a more thorough cleaning  it wasnt super dirty  but could use more attention to detail  and to add a wine bottle opener  We noticed the decanter  aerator and wine stoppers and assumed there would be a bottle opener  but after returning from the store with our bottle of wine we realized there was no way to open it  Not a big deal  but was not swept   dust dirt on floors and a lot under bed  and stove top not wiped off from last guest  Bar accessories were dusty and had to be washed before use 
623179965,Awesome getaway  Super homey 
705466021,Nice area to stay  Large   bedroom apartment  Comfortable and has a lot of character  but has  a few cosmetic issues  Easy to access with many parking options nearby  You might have issues with the stairs to the third floor if elderly or out of shape  Would stay again  This rental was pretty much what was expected knowing that it is in an older building  Besides the items weve already listed there are a few other safety things to list  There is exposed electrical connections in the under sink area in the kitchen  wires with wire nuts possibly being exposed to water   Some of the ceiling fan lights remained  on or flickering  when either turning off or on  or shutting just the lights off on the fans in both the living room and front bedroom  Thermostat is loose in the wall  Most smoke detectors missing   just the brackets remain   only one working detector noticed   rd floor apt   Hollow core door is used as the main door into the apartment  easy to be broken down through    Even with the mentioned issues  this is a very appealing apartment  It has alot of character and with a little TLC and elbow grease as far as refreshing wood work  paint  nail holes in walls  bathroom vanities  it would be a shining star    Also  not knowing who owns the building the main entrance into the building needs cleaned  Trash  wood planks  bucket  etc is behind the door when it is opened to go inside and the area including the carpeted stairs is very dirty and dusty  Keybox had different labeling than describes in directions  Also keybox that was supposed to have our key in it had already been opened and keys missing  cleaning service    Had to contact the main office for further instructions to get in  Dusty in many places   heat and return air vents need cleaning  Dirty greasy broiler pan in oven  Dirty sticky eating utensils in silverware drawer  Gnats in the bathroom  Plastic over the windows for heat cold air control needs re adhered to the frames   Dirty blades on ceiling fans 
452675186,All in all  this was a great place to stay  It was   of us all together  and it was more than enough space for us  Checking in and out was an absolute breeze  but keep in mind that there is only street parking available and an absolute headache to find an empty spot  More than once  we had to park our car up to three streets over  And even then  its only a   hour maximum until you have to either move it  or leave and go somewhere for a bit  Other than that  it was nice and clean  Great touch is the washer and dryer inside the unit  Please make sure things are vacuumed before hand  it was just a little off putting to find quite large food crumbs on the area rug  Also  two pillows had very questionable stains on them sans pillow cases The rug in the living room had food crumbs and debris and that wasnt very savory to find when put our bare feet on the rug Parking is a complete NIGHTMARE
622643588,This place was beautiful with all needed amenities including gated parking  Felt like the cleaning was rushed though  as kitchen was a bit dirty  Host also didnt answer a few of our questions  However  the area is great as its only a    min drive to the arch  Thank you for hosting
621937629,This place is cute st first glance however upon waking up at night to use the restroom  I discovered this place had roaches and these bugs were huge  One was in the bathroom and touched my toothbrush and i showed another in the bedroom  As you can imagine i was disgusted  I informed the host and sent photos but they did nothing  Also though it sys there is no parking on oremus  understand it really means that   There is NO place to park if staffing here   Honestly i feel like i deserve a refund  i wouldnt recommend staying here  I appreciate you letting me rent your space however im incredibly disappointed with how the ROACH  situation was handled  No one ever came to address the issue  I did Mohr sleep the next two nights after seeing bugs in the bathroom and bedroom  Very upset  The carpet head crumbs on it  There was a lime of dirt and crumbs and atop off these air conditioner  The walls of the shower were not clean  There were bugs iight took   hrs after me notifying the host before i recieved a response  They were shooting outside the window  The entrance to the building isas nooottt rally accessible also street parking was almost nonexistent  Cute setup but not worth the bugs and headache 
652876085,We had difficulties with the checking in and out and the knobs but overall it was an ok stay  nice apartment  just need better instructions on how to get in and fix the knob  nice people 
623262122,Zencitys a really nice place and affordable  I really enjoyed it
619905216,Very gross and dirty  There were hairs all over the bathroom floor and the bathtub as well as the entire bed  sheets  comforter and pillows  You can tell they dont even clean it and only get away with it because the place is up to date so it looks clean and nice at first   This was during the corona virus outbreak too  very gross   Our fire alarm also went off every single time we used the oven  and continued to beep every minute for   whole days  Asked the front desk to look at it or try and fix it and they kept saying they would but never did  Other than the neglect and uncleanliness  the place was very accessible and had decent parking space nearby  Location was great too 
622907426,Zen city  Patch up mouse holes communicate with people at your property provided more sheets and towels and blankets  Never messaged or answered responded    hours later  Mouse holes in walls and broken knobs Never responded had dangerous situation Being better hosts
715615432,Nice and conveniently located apartment  equipped with everything you could need regardless of the length of your stay  Easy check in process and great communication prior to stay regarding arrival information  Thank you for having us  The info you sent out beforehand made our arrival and check in process stress free  Found food on the floor by the bed when we arrived and a dustball in the kitchen 
629064232,Good luck in your search and always price check  Prices are not that great   A message was sent to me saying I overpaid     dollars for a airbnb in the Skyline building  when I tried to book the same place that week  it was not available and nothing was said or done about the money i paid    weeks later it was available  I really liked Zencity until the last   trips  A refund would be nice as I always followed the rules and kept the places clean  Thank you  When I asked about the overpaid refund  Same as above A refund or a free weeks stay 
622023222,Cool space with a cool story  Unfortunately  my first night was spent cleaning the entire apartment  Hair and stains were everywhere  The bathroom laundry room floors also need to be mopped  On the upside  the apartment was in a good location  spacious  had all the amenities I could have possibly needed  and affordable for my week long stay  Thank you for the stay   The room was not  u   csparkling clean u   d as advertised   Although I could tell the the apartment was picked up by someone  when I arrived  there was hair everywhere   on the carpet  in the shower  all over the floors  on the couch and chairs  and even in the bed when I pulled back the cover  There were stains all over the bathroom and the laundry room had a foul smell  I would just like to recommend hiring a cleaning service that can notice these details  and also provide a mop or swiffer so the bathroom and laundry room floor can be mopped  There should also be a vacuum suitable for carpets  as the one provided had a hard time picking up things on the carpet  When cleaning   a hair net would be great so random hairs arent seen everywhere  Stars for the kitchen  however  which was very clean compared to the rest of the apartment 
622809734,Overall good place to stay great location  Great new age nostalgic feel The roku remote was missing   Missing roku remote  Main bathroom toilet was clogged up after never was able to flush 
623243824,One of the best places to stay at in Missouri Thanks for being a great host  Everything looks just like the picture 
621973953,Great location and nice space  Please make sure to respond to messages during the stay  and if not available through the airbnb portal  provide a way of quickly communicating any concerns or questions  Carpet was dirty and the vacuum provided did not do a good job of cleaning it  No response when asked for new vacuum  Sent a message through the airbnb portal  and called once  No communication occurred from Zencitys side besides the check in and check out messages 
648348727,This space is well curated and in a great location  The bed is comfy and the check in process is super easy  But besides that  pretty much everything else was a problem  Our  enhanced clean  unit had dusty surfaces  broken seals on the travel sized toiletries  part of a roll of toilet paper left from the previous tenant  among other minor cleanliness things that normally wouldnt be an issue but made us feel very unsafe about the cleanliness of the space in the midst of a pandemic  Along with this  there were several maintenance issues including missing bath drain plug  broken soap dispenser  missing light bulb  and even the entire right bedside table being ripped out of the wall with unsightly holes left in the wall and no temporary replacement table  We also received no response  within    hours  after sharing our concerns via direct message after we checked out  which is why this review is so bluntly honest  Again  the space was well curated and beautifully designed  but it seemed poorly kept up and not at all  enhanced clean   We were very thankful for our sleep space  but didnt feel safe or sanitary in the space until we cleaned it ourselves  We were so excited to stay here since its a great location and beautifully curated space  but it just seemed like the maintenance and or cleaning staff didnt put much thought or effort into maintaining the space or cleaning the space  At almost      per night with a certified  enhanced clean  we expected far better   There is a bathtub but no drain stop  so we couldn u    t take a bath  The soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken  There were two side tables and two side lamps in the bedroom in the photos  but when we arrived there was no light bulb in the right lamp and the bedside table was ripped out of the wall with unsightly holes in the wall and no temporary replacement   Was not spotless as we would expect with  enhanced clean  in the middle of a pandemic  The provided travel sized toiletries had their seals broken  dusty surfaces  loose change along the floorboards  and     of a roll of toilet paper left from the previous tenant  The loose change  minor dust  and toilet paper would normally not be an issue  but in the midst of a pandemic with  enhanced clean  it made us feel the space wasnt properly cleaned or sanitary  Did not respond to concerns communicated after we checked out  we were there from  am     am so we just problem solved when we ran into issues  
296846914,The place is perfect for two  thank you for the stay it was greatly appreciated
623456667,Great place for price
643368492,Great location  Needed a much  much better cleaning before my colleague and I arrived for our business trip  Zencity were very friendly  and wanted to help however they could  but responsivity was spotty  and we ended up leaving halfway through our trip  If this unit receives a deep cleaning  a couple repairs  and is maintained with more thorough cleanings between guests  then it will be a great place to stay  This unit has great potential  but needs serious attention first  Fix the hardwood floorings loose slats  Get more comfortable  less firm  mattresses  Fix the couch leg  Clean the AC units deeply  Clean everything deeply  Replace old kitchenware  Add more silverware  Repair the bathroom where fixtures used to be  Clean better between guests  Replace the shower curtain  Leave enough keys for each guest  or at least for each bedroom   The unit was as photographed  and the location was excellent  Its construction quality  furniture condition  and cleanliness were very disappointing  Ex  the flooring was so loose throughout most of the unit that it clattered noisily as hardwood slats slid under my feet  even when tiptoeing   We were only given   key  despite the unit being a   bedroom booked for business travel  It took several days to get a second key  which was rather inconvenient as my colleague and I had different schedules     Red mold on the shower curtain     Hairpin and soap bits left in the shower tray from previous guest s     Old fixture removed from bathroom wall not repaired closed     Bedroom a c unit very dirty  old filter  mold inside  both bedroom units      Accumulated dirt grime mess on bedroom curtains as a result of dirty a c unit     Broken couch leg  so that end slants     Some kitchen equipment is unusable  what is usable is few  need more silverware       Most dishes were visibly dirty upon arrival  and had to be run thru the dishwasher before use Communications were relatively helpful and very friendly  but variable on promptness  For the price  the cleanliness should have been significantly better 
624151641,Terrible  Do not stay at this place or any Zencity location  The person renting out this place did not have the rights to the apartment as their lease had ended  As a result  we were kicked out a couple hours into the stay by the landlord and were not even issued a refund   The host did not have the right to rent out this unit and we were therefore forced to leave a couple hours into our stay  
563003543,Upon arrival to the Airbnb we noticed an extremely pungent smell  it had clearly been masked with some Febreeze or air freshener spray  we contacted the host and they sent someone in the next morning  However  after several messages back and forth we noticed we were communicating with three different people which made voicing our concerns difficult and it seemed dismissive because each person would just say  hope youre enjoying your stay  when we really werent  After sending someone to look at the place  they basically said nothing was wrong and left it at that  Im not sure if the smell was from the old furnace or just because the building itself was old  but their way of dealing with the issue wasnt great  The place itself was nice but the smell was pretty unbearable for most of the stay    The host then contacted me again and said they hoped I had a good stay and proceeded to ask that if I had any complaints to send it to his private feedback  I thought Id post it all here so everyone is aware  Multiple different people communicating with me which made it extremely frustrating to voice concerns 
664902188,Dont go with zencity  they failed to have the apartment cleaned when I arrived  The bed was slept in  dishes in the sink  trash in all the garbages and used toothpaste in the bathroom sink  Then on my last day of the stay a maintenance man unlocked the door and came in while I was sleeping at     am  They would not make it right  Its big corporate and you get the run around  Having the matinace man come in while I was asleep is horrible  If I had been a girl I would sue you for sexual harassment  Having a locked door open at      am out of your sleep in your underwear is not a good experience  All that after non cleaning   It u    s much much smaller than the pictures make it look   The key pad does work  The bed was unmade  dirty dishes in the sink  the trash was not taken out  they literally did not clean it after the last person had been there  they apologized but only gave me    dollars off for the whole ordeal I had to get a different place  which they did pay for   but was very unprofessional and I had to fight for my    instead of them making the wrong right  Also the iron does not work  and there customer service is horrible  The matinace man walked in on me while I was sleeping  Clearly he thought the place was vacant so they have communication issues as well   Its also in a rental place were its probably illegal to have air bnbs  It would be fine if they had better customer service 
597087323,Excellent space
623931401,The place was absolutely beautiful and in a fantastic location  I gave it   stars for two big reasons  you can hear the upstairs neighbors   and they were loud  sounded like they were moving furniture at all hours of the day  and then proceeded to complain about us playing our music  and the responsiveness of the hosts  The apartment itself was perfect though  we especially enjoyed the back deck and there are a bunch of bike rental ports near the apartment that we used about once a week They would take days to respond  even when we sent a message on a weekday at a reasonable time   am  p 
711000269,It is a nice apartment and I enjoyed the stay 
625236828,The location is great with a nice view  It is in a posh building in Hyde Park with a nice restaurant which will deliver to your room  The room is sparse with no desk or kitchen table to eat at or work at   The unfortunate part is that the place was dirty  The fridge and light switches  which I personally wiped down   There were no paper towels  so I had to use my own wipes   But the worst was that the sheets were blood stained  Some of the stains had even soaked through to the mattress cover  It was evident that the staff had not changed the sheets  I had to change everything myself  because Zen city had no staff in the area to come over and take care of the problems    I was thoroughly grossed out and just wanted to get out of there  Then they overcharged me      for a one nights stay at a     place   Bad experience  Please clean your facilities   The washer  dryer is not in the unit  but on the same floor  down the hall   All went well  Responses okay cleanliness
671099284,Quiet Thanks for being a great host  Very thin walls  Had to buy toilet paper  faucet ran weird  no bathroom trash can Was accused of smoking in room but made to feel that I was not allowed to step outside as often as I wanted to   She literally came in   no badge  asking to see if there is any smoking or damage because my tv was up too loud  at    volume   because she owns this and lives next door  Then she said She was going to kick me out early if she hears sees or smells me the rest of the time  This was Friday night   No smoking happened In the room and when I Call her she was wrong about that she said she had evidence somehow    
624418903,Would recommend Great customer service
450958020,Nice apartment with a full kitchen  balcony  one half and one full bathroom  Near McCormack Convention Center  perfect for conference attendees  Secure entrance  clean and quiet building  Weve enjoyed our stay  Hi  Chris  I just wanted to let you know a couple of things we noticed when we got to the apartment  None of them are deal breakers by any means  but perhaps something youd want to follow up with your cleaning staff    Kitchen floors and counters  as well as the coffee table  havent been cleaned well or at all between guests  The carpeted areas were not vacuumed  Bathroom counters and floors also had not been cleaned well between guests  there were smears  stains on the counter and floors  The full bath sink on the right was partially clogged  not allowing the water to drain well  Kitchen sink was equipped with hand soap  and the soap dispenser in the half bath was actually dish soap    One other thing that would improve the comfort and give one more of a luxury feel    especially important since luxury is contained within the apartment title    is if the mattress and pillows were newer of better quality  Also  the couch    though very stylish    was quite uncomfortable     Not sure if its possible  but Id suggest having two fobs for   guest stays  This alleviates some of the scheduling issues around who leaves comes back first to the apartment    Overall  we did enjoy our stay  but I thought Id share some things that could make the place even more inviting  Thanks much  Sanja
628654423,Aesthetically pleasing  great location  cleaning tools on hand including the traditional flatware etc  Great communication from ZenCity team very rapid responses    Cons  should clean lobby daily  Correct wifi issue  not available during stay  I look forward to staying in the future if your interested I love to partner with you guys in the future for some marketing and sponsored content  Not the safest as the patio door handle was broken upon arrival and created concern for outsiders entering location easily  Dust and debris from settled furniture blinds table tops etc  towels with dust also Just by making simple changes I think the space could really be nicer and would take in more revenue I wished it had waters or coffee menus to food nearby door dash codes etc  complimentary things    I review these places avidly as I travel for my website and audience  it couldve been stronger but was aesthetically pleasing to the eye 
623805944,Looks exactly like the pictures
622919875,Overall solid place  Just note that you cannot rely on their WiFi network at all  So if you have important work meetings you wont be able to use the network they provide because it simply doesnt work   The WiFi network is extremely unreliable  I had asked about how strong the WiFi was prior to my stay and this inquiry was ignored prior to check in  If you u    re booking this place with the intention of using WiFi  you u    re going to need your own personal hotspot   Everything in the place was extremely clean  but the bedroom had a bit of a weird stench  I asked for suggestions regarding what to do about the terrible WiFi situation that were ignored  Reliable WiFi and parking
624419813,Nice place with a nice view  but you could tell they didnt clean it to their best ability and the windows were glued shut so it was minimal ventilation 
625432550,This is my third ZenCity stay   I like their style so I keep coming back   This space was easy to find   Given the wrong code for the key but after calls and emails  got that sorted out thank goodness   I love their minimalist style   It was clean   Internet was speedy   Appliances all worked fine     Be aware that this apartment does not have free parking and parking is scarce   We almost always had to park a block or more away   We did not have enough towels  two bath towels for three people  and other than the bedspread  no throws or blankets for guest three   Finally  while we adjusted  it was VERY loud  Street noise was constant  people hanging out in the alley or behind the building were loud and easily heard  after    PM    Some of the blinds were missing wands so we couldnt close them all the way and there is also a great deal of light after dark in this area   Overall  still a ZenCity fan  Might add to the listing the lack of parking availability  it was rough  even with COVID and downtown not being that busy   AND it was very very very loud   Also  had three people and two towels  no dishwashing soap  and no extra blankets for the third person  Code provided via email was incorrect   Called and emailed   Took awhile to get a response  Serious lack of parking  Parking 
623829416,Nice and private stay  Any issues experienced were quickly resolved 
623466627,I stay with zencity alot  never have a bad thing to say  Great company with amazing apartments in great locations  I would recommend staying there if you are in the area  Thanks again for allowing us to stay at your place   we will be back    
651582618,Although the building staff was great  parking isnt great  the apartment was okay but very dirty  Comfy couch   bed though  Already spoke to Stuart about my issues 
622027820,Its a small studio for a quick stay  Everything was clean and nice inside however the area seemed a bit unsafe not terrible but since it was downtown thats why  Host on the other hand was very nice and answered all our questions 
624738362,Needed to be a little cleaner overall
628766673,I am always satisfied with Zencity   this last visit not so much   The amenities stated air conditioner  The unit didnt have an air conditioning unit or a thermostat with air   I was told I MAY be able to get an air unit the next day but no guarantee  I told them either get me an air unit  give me a new AirBNB or I needed a full refund  I was offered a new unit  that also didnt have air   After I cussed  sorry i had to  I was advised the maintenance man would be there the next day between   a  p  He came around   am the next morning  Luckily it was around  pm when I got there and its by the water so I was able to open the window and enjoy a really nice breeze that night
624222219,Cool place to stay 
624760808,It was pretty alright  Everything you need is right in the unit   Not really a loft  BUT it was still nice   There where a couple of stains on the sheets 
620936017,Overall  I ended up canceling  I was not a fan of the hosts communication and need there response to close out my stay  They only send auto messages  All else I cant really speak to  I didnt want to leave a review since I ended up cancelling but your response time on the cleaning fee refund and during my pre stay was terrible  Automated messages are not enough  Left   star for all else since I could not rank it properly  Once we resolve through the other process I can tell airbnb to unpublish if you want but I need COMMUNICATION  Very slow responses and trying to get cleaning fee refund since I didnt stay there
624542722,The apartment was beautifully decorated in a great location if youre looking to explore the city  Private parking lot was very convenient  However  there was a noticeable cigarette smell in the unit  Dead mouse in hallway 
154415965,Great location to the sites of Chicago and to the metro   
623307502,Read carefully All my food for that stay spoiled since I was in a hotel without a kitchen   No mention that there was a flight of stairs outside making it handicapped inaccessible   No handsoap  no disinfectants anywhere  floor was sticky upon entry  Told them I was NOT staying there apparently that wasnt enough to convince them 
667821001,Pros  location is awesome for the price  would be a great spot for anyone visiting DePaul  TONS of coffee shops restaurants within walking distance  cute neighborhood to stroll through and the nearby park is nice  The bar downstairs is decent  although on the young side  and they shut down at like       on the dot during weekdays  so you dont have to worry about being kept up all night  Check in was super easy  TV is big and there was a fire stick with Netflix etc  Decor was cute  felt like staying at a friends place in college  Both the beds and pillows were SUPER comfortable  the one in the front room is firm and the one in the back room is much softer  so you can Goldilocks it until you find one you like   Its managed by a company and they were super responsive to all my questions    Cons  felt like staying at a friends place in college  Place is pretty bare bones and could have been a teeny bit cleaner  but nothing that I wouldnt have expected for the affordability of it  With a few minor kinks worked out  Id stay there again  Hey guys  I really appreciate your great communication and the fact that someone came to get me off the balcony  although  someone probably should have double checked to make sure that the door didnt lock before they put a chair out there   Once you get the kinks worked out  itll be great  I really like all the furniture  Also  you should know that someone in the building  not the bar  was bumping bass music literally all night  it was on when I went to bed at midnight and then still when I woke up at  am and  am  It was the loudest in the back bedroom  so maybe ask whoever lives on the other side of that wall   Water pressure was so low that the shower was unusable and the internet went out multiple times  Would also really benefit from a coffee maker   The place had a stale smoke smell  despite the little air fresheners all over the place  it seemed the worse from the back room  I assume some previous tenant had been smoking  the windows were open in the front bedroom when I checked in    Id recommend all the linens textiles be washed bc those little air things arent cutting it  Plus  there was some dirt on the floor around the toilet and in the track for the sliding door  Its a good location for the price but it needs a working shower and to be aired out from whatever that smell is 
626811782,This was my second stay in this apartment in a few weeks  A few things I noticed between this stay and the last  weekdays are louder for construction   traffic during the day but quieter in the building  Weekends are louder in the building as more than one person was having a party   apparently the walls are thin   so bring white noise   earplugs    The apartment was great  again  and everything was comfortable  Note  ensure you lock the door behind you  Even though it uses a fab  it doesnt auto lock like a hotel door  This unit could use a better spatula for cooking  The cheap plastic one is hard to use with those great pans   Also  I dont know if I missed it in the instructions but you should add signage that you have to lock the door behind you when you leave  I didnt realize that until my  th day in the unit 
471515432,A group of us  multiple families totaling five adults and five children  were in town for a quick weekend trip  and Brians place worked out very well for us  Its a nice space thats well suited for large groups  located in a very walkable neighborhood  note that parking is tight  however   My one complaint is that the space could be cleaner  Nonetheless  Brians space is a good value  and Id recommend it to any large group  Thanks for the use of your place  Brian  Overall we enjoyed our stay  but as my private feedback indicates  I think the place needs a bit more attention  Nothing we experienced was worth the trouble of contacting you during our short trip  but I figured youd want to know  Thanks again  and best of luck in the future   Its a very nice space in a great neighborhood  but its just not well maintained  Some of the issues we encountered  No cold water in the master shower  the guard rail over the stairs is wobbly  clothes dryer door is broken  only eight towels for    guests  almost no silverware   The email I received from AirBnB said wed get a door code three days before arrival  so the fact that I didnt hear anything until arrival day made me quite nervous  It worked out in the end  but this was avoidable  Also  Im sure future guests would appreciate a few more details upon arrival  like where to put the trash and recycling   Maybe a laminated printout of house rules  wifi password  trash location  etc  Bathtub had visible grime and dirt  dust and dirt in many corners  I think a more thorough cleaning would really do wonders for the place  See check in comments 
647013691,location communication and free parking was awesome  Only thing  I was just very bothered by how dirty it was  There was a ton of dust on the fan  old cookies above the fridge in the cabinet  and the bedding was stained  It has blood stains and hair on it along with other random stains  Also by the windows was a used q tip  Super dirty  location communication and free parking was awesome  Only thing  I was just very bothered by how dirty it was  There was a ton of dust on the fan  old cookies above the fridge in the cabinet  and the bedding was stained  It has blood stains and hair on it along with other random stains  Also by the windows was a used q tip  Super dirty 
621924870,Great  clean space  Easy check and communication  Thank you 
667517472,The location for this space is great  Also  it is a great spot to stay  Even though there are a lot of tenants around  I hardly knew it  quiet and reasonable rate for the space  I greatly appreciated the quick response in communication about the the wifi and television not  working properly  I was glad to get the tv working with the information that was sent but was sorely disappointed that the wifi never did work  This was frustrating  given that it was noted that wifi would be available   the wifi did not work the whole time I was there  I had to use my hotspot and used up all my data  and have to wait until October    to get the data back at my normal speed  
531069605,The room we booked was really nicely decorated and the bed was super comfortable  There is a record player  and a blutooth speaker as well as multiple phone chargers and some nice touches like an iron  ironing board  and blow dryer  The location is awesome  there is a really rad street corner bar right down the street  whole foods is a block away and basically any shopping or eating you could want to do in St  Louis is within a five minute walk or a       minute drive  Zencity staff  who book the room  were quick to communicate and check in was pretty seamless  The room we booked   R  does look over a parking lot and doesnt have a lot of privacy  especially at night when you want to have the curtains open  But you really cant beat this location or accommodation for the price  Thank you very much for your hospitality and for a great stay  The location was amazing and the room very cozy  Check in was seamless and the front desk staff was very nice and helpful  The reason I gave Zenicity   stars was because of the following     The bath tub was really gross  it had thick dark hair throughout the tub and a big hair ball in the drain catch  There was noticeable grime along the grout joints of the tub  it was clear it had not been cleaned     Zencity directly requested a   star review without asking how the stay was  To the best of your knowledge it could have not been good but youre still requesting a five star review  Best to just remind your guests to review you and not directly ask for   stars     Zencity requested     from me through the app because you suspected there were some stains on a wash cloth that would not come out  It seems as though that request was made before an attempt to actually wash the rag was made because it came only a few hours after check out  It was a wash rag my wife used to wash her makeup off  which she does at home with white rags so we know it would come out     it should really be noted that this is a  nd story room that over looks a parking lot and garage  the privacy is not so great because anyone standing in the parking lot or on the second story of the garage can look right in your windows  Otherwise it was a really great location and the accommodations were nice  we loved the decor and the fact you had things like blow dryer  iron  and lots of power outlets  Thank you  The bath tub was dirty enough to where we did not want to take a bath in it  It still had lots of hair in the drain catch and along the sides and base of the tub 
530451311,Apartment was great  Roomy  comfortable  and clean  Thanks for being a great host 
661873370,Overall  we had a restful  relaxing stay in this luxury apartment   It sits on the   th floor  and commands a great view to the South  looking down Main Street   You will love it   We opted to pay the daily     entrance fee to the connected parking garage  and this made parking very convenient   And the white walls create a feeling of luxury and expansiveness   we loved this     In the spirit of total transparency  here are two significant actions items worth noting for the maintenance staff  and they are    the deadbolt did not function  and    there was no hot water in the far bathroom or kitchen    When staying at hotels  I have come to appreciate the blind deadbolt in all hotel doors  as this allows me to sleep a little better at night   The deadbolt does not function correctly in the front door  so I did not sleep  a little better       The strike plate is positioned      too low  and the bolt does not enter into the door jam   The door does lock  yes  but the deadbolt does not function     I debated fixing the plate myself with a Dremel tool  but my significant other advised me against it  P   The  nd item is the hot water   Yes there IS hot water in the bathroom closest to the front door  but no hot water in the far bathroom or kitchen    Notwithstanding the deadbolt and the hot water  we had a wonderful relaxing stay in this apartment    My advice to the next traveler is to check that these two items have been remedied  The apartment was beautiful   My only recommendation is to fix the hot water issue in the far bathroom and kitchen  and hire someone to fix the deadbolt  the strike plate needs to be enlarged at the top to receive the deadbolt    Other than those two items  our stay was very relaxing and we loved the apartment   Thank you     There was no hot water in the Southern bathroom  and the deadbolt was not functional   For guests who desire a working deadbolt on the main door  as most hotel have  this apartment did not provide that   See accuracy comment above 
653560671,Close to many restaurants and a very secure building   There werent as many kitchen items as expected to cook some meals  Key fob for garage stopped working on last night   Was told someone would try and come fix it  no one came and we heard nothing more   Wasnt the worst thing  but we did have to park on the street the last night 
624832859,Clean Space  Looks like the pictures  Good Location  Quite Clean space  as advertised  Quit location 
624556683,Nice clean environment  The only problem I had was that they tried to charge me for a stain on a cover which I think is unreasonable 
527770471,Place is clean  basic  has sparse furniture and little charm  About what you would expect from a corporation short term rental  so it misses the coziness of Airbnbs where people actually rent their places out  If you are cool with that  then you will like it  Had to really try to use intercom to use automated system to get in  Had to contact host  did reply promptly  OK location  new building This is one of those Airbnb companies that set up apartments in drab  basic but clean style   cheap furniture  bed cracked when I sat on it   etc  This is fine  but honestly  I love Airbnb to see the beauty in what people put into their homes and guest spots  Again  it isnt an inaccurate description  but it should be out there that this property is strictly a basic rental only setup

625991220,Good local nice place
589689207,Very cool space  modern and comfortable  Cleanliness left some to be desired   The shower had not been cleaned   Still need to tweak some amenities  lots of pans  but no pot holders to get them out of the oven    nothing to really use as a pot holder  no rags  no kitchen towels  nothing    Little things that Im sure they will address   People in the hall were consistently noisy   Otherwise  we loved the stay   Everything was functional and nice to look at   Parking is super safe and the neighborhood is safe and close to the highway as well   Great restaurants close by  Need pot holders or kitchen towels Cleaning crew needs a stern talking to  sheets were changed but I cant say anything else was actually cleaned Jet dry for the dishwasher to help dry the dishes The bathroom  specifically the shower  had all sorts of hair in it  pubes or leg hairs or both  plus head hair    The floors had foot prints all over them  which I was able to wipe up in the bathroom    The bathroom counter wasnt clean   Dishes were put up in the cabinet wet   There was pink glittery tinsel all over the place  mostly in the bedroom  Carpet clearly not vacuumed   Earrings on the floor right by the bed  vacuum should have caught them and all the glittery tinsel stuff  
641794828,Upon arrival at      we realized its coded to open at three  Then the cleaning crew arrived and said we would need to wait another       minutes  After already paying for parking we sat in the hall and waited  The construction from     everyday was also rather inconvenient and we were not notified about the noise prior to check in  It was chilly so we tried opening the windows and they came out of the frames  In totality it was worse than we expected  Upon arrival at      we realized its coded to open at three  Then the cleaning crew arrived and said we would need to wait another       minutes  After already paying for parking we sat in the hall and waited  The construction from     everyday was also rather inconvenient and we were not notified about the noise prior to check in  It was chilly so we tried opening the windows and they came out of the frames  In totality it was worse than we expected 
656417236,I loved the Hyde Park Neighborhood  I felt safe and there were plenty of shops and restaurants all in walking distance  However  the unit was not as cleaned as expected from the look of the pictures  The bedding didnt feel clean and the shower grout was not clean  Needs to be re caulked or cleaned throughly   The shower appeared to be clean  however the shower grout wasn u    t clean   The microwave wasnt clean  The bedding didnt feel clean and the shower tiles need to be re caulked or cleaned throughly  The unit was not a clean as expected for the neighborhood its in 
625526159,Be prepared to pay for parking daily in the parking garage  Had to pay      day for parking  Should list Parc Frontenac apartments with the address
625632830,Easy Check in  Host responded to every email  Great building  Great location  Super affordable  I tried to be as diplomatic and as honest as I could be  Since this is private  I will reiterate that I was actually pretty frustrated with the experience   I appreciate that you responded to my e mails and trust that maintenance was  indeed   contacted  That said  if I were the host and my unit needed to be repaired  I would make sure it got repaired  I would do whatever was necessary to make the situation right  for the my guest  As I see it  that is the responsibility that I would have taken on  when I became a host   I am certainly not criticizing you   Just sharing my opinion and disappointment with this experience  I do appreciate that you rented to me  at all  I know you didnt have to  I am appreciative that I had a roof over my head and recognize that roof was provided by Zencity  So  thank you for that    I hope that you have a great day     Jamie  There were some maintenance issues that left the apartment without air conditioning and without a working kitchen sink for my entire stay   Nothing Major Had the air and the sink been working  I would have given this   stars   I am sure that this rental  when fully operational is just the perfect space for a weary traveler   I believe that my experience was probably just a fluke and was not the norm  I am grateful that the space was offered to me  at all 
707637285,Nice view
587896716,Overall stay was okay  Apartment was beautiful and just as described pictured  We had some issues regarding building security but hopefully they are addressed and not an issue for people who stay in the future  Overall stay was okay  Apartment was beautiful and just as described pictured  Still had some construction dust in the unit  When we arrived we accidentally transposed numbers of apartments and went to the wrong one  Entered code and were granted access to someone elses apartment  Both they and we were freaked out when we walked in on them  Definitely a concern that our code worked for both units  Construction workers woke us up at      AM wanting to install lights under cabinets  Arent we supposed to be made aware of people entering our apartment  There is no peep hole to see into the hallway and as two women staying alone in a new city  this is a major security issue  The superintendent of the building was extremely rude and said it needed to be done before the New Year even though we were not comfortable with two strange men entering our apartment  Fire alarm went off at      one morning and didnt turn off for    minutes  I understand the building is in the final stages of renovation  but the security issues are very disconcerting  Clean for the most part  Some construction mess still in the unit 
625980313,Our experience could have been a lot better  Unfortunately  the WiFi doesnt really work  We could not use the TV because the fire stick couldnt connect to the WiFi  The ceiling leaked when it rained and we didnt know until my girlfriend slipped on the water  Also  during our stay two men came in the apartment without any prior notice from Zencity to us  It was extremely scary because they walked in on one of us getting out the shower and one sleeping and we did not have clothes on  The second man came with two children to install something and again  walked right in with the access code  He also stated that The owner knew that he was coming to do the install  However  Zencity did not mention it to us  We were out of the place a lot because when we were there we slept with a chair under the door and took turns watching it be just to be safe  we didnt know who else has the code and might come in  We also received a noise complaint while we were sleeping  It was extremely crazy because my fianc e had just flown in  It was extremely difficult to find somewhere else to stay because a chunk of our money was tied up in this place and it was extremely short notice  Most places were booked  The experience wasnt horrible however  it definitely could have been better  There definitely should be communication with the guests about other people being able to just walk in when they feel like it  TV did not work  internet connection was very inconsistent which is why the TV did not work   There were food shavings as well as hair in the refrigerator  hairs in the bathroom  the toilet paper holder was broken  the tiles were chipping in the shower area  walking up the stairs to get to the apartment there were pieces of plaster all over the steps which I have pictures of  as well as when it would rain the ceiling would leak in the kitchen  I feel as though the communication stopped when I checked in because we were not aware of the two men being able to just walk in on us
652413906,Great place  location was perfect
650523880,Look elsewhere for decent accommodations  The place REEKED of cigarettes  even thought there is a non smoking policy  Our hair and clothes smelled like cigarettes after the first night  Going out and about smelling of cigarettes was awful   Sleeping in that was unpleasant  to say the least  We absolutely could not spend a second night at the apartment and found new accommodations the next day and checked out  We washed our cigarette smelling clothes ASAP  It was really gross   Sam and I are not ones to complain usually  but this had to be addressed  There were a variety of smaller issues  which are easily overlooked  considering the basic requirements of cleanliness are held up  However  this was not the case as the place was an ashtray  The apartment and its furniture were falling apart  The fridge leaked  The toilet did not flush  the shower took a solid    minutes to warm up  and the water pressure was very weak  Some other minor things  like the blinds were all convoluted and not attended to properly   All in all  The biggest issue was the reek of cigarette smoke that made our stay unbearable  besides the variety of falsely advertised amenities  Also  Zencitys reluctance to properly address the situation was disappointing    I contacted and explained our issues with the apartment to Zencity  First they offered alternative accommodation  but for another date  Which of course  visiting Chicago  we needed a place to sleep then and there  They initially charged us for the second night we did not stay  When I declined their offer and further explained the cause of our cancellation  Zencity went quiet and has not responded to my request for a refund  Ive tried to contact them for multiple days now   Spare yourself the headache  money  and unpleasant consequences of booking with Zencity and go with another Airbnb host  I wish I could leave a good review and not have had dealt with all this  The new place I booked is cheaper  in a great location  and is truly CLEAN and properly maintained  Hi Zencity   can somebody please get back to me regarding my stay and refund for checking out  Thanks   The place reeked of cigarettes  even thought there is a no smoking policy  The apartment and its furniture were falling apart  The bathroom had issues with the toilet  water heater and pressure   Reeked of cigarettes  Made our clothes and hair smell like cigarettes  The fridge leaked water  The bathroom plumbing was awful  Responsive at first  and then not at all  when confronted with a complaint and the request to resolve a refund  Accurate description of expected environment 
650244876,There was no air conditioning in listing despite it being in the details  and when we messaged the host we never heard back  Its been    days since we sent a message and still no follow up  Overall it was a sort of decent stay but without air conditioning it was very unbearable  Decent location in the city but very hard to find parking  we had to find a garage like almost a    minute walk away  No air conditioning  Dusty and there were spiders and silverfish everywhere Host never responded to messages Including air conditioning like listed
625326607,Better cleaning service would be a plus Had to get security to let me in the apt After the  rd day of waiting for a response I finally had to call host  I expected to enter a freshly cleaned apt  Instead I found trash in the corners of the livingroom and beneath the couch  Also I found hair upside the wall in the shower 
625115121,Youll love the location and view of the city   Such a cute and stylish space with a lot of natural light  Thank you   Cute and stylish space  Love the big windows     No coffee pot   The code     did not work to get into the building  On either entrance   finally had the security guard on the building help us out but she couldnt get us either so she took us up finally and let us in  A little frustrating because we got in late and werent familiar with the area  We noticed things here and there that were not cleaned  a major one was the rug needing vacuumed 
624859937,Felt like a hotel  Wish the tv had been in the bedroom and that there was an opportunityto recycle  Also the check in code should work for the entire stay so the fob isnt required Trash hadnt been emptied
623031077,I enjoyed my stay here  The building is very nice and secure  The big window is beautiful and the space is nicely decorated  On top of that I received fast replies  which I appreciated because I had an issue checking in  Thank you for the great space  I believe the dishwasher is broken  or maybe I wasnt working it correctly  Other than that I would say maybe just check in with the company that cleans the apartment as the dishwasher had a few dirty dishes in it and there were towels sheets left in the washer when I arrived  Other than that  I genuinely enjoyed my stay  The view was AMAZING and the loft was the perfect quiet place I needed for finals week  And you guys respond so quickly I appreciated that 
668825644,First time visiting Chicago   couldnt of asked for a better location  Definitely a college feel in the apartment   as long as you have a city camping mindset youll have a blast  If youre looking for finer things   like a nice shower   look further  The balcony was a great touch   just dont close the door behind you   you might get locked out  Overall the location really makes up for the flaws   Bathroom could of been advertised more clearly to understand how dated  Nothing too major     No airflow in the back bedroom  Bathroom sink drain fills rather quickly   not too pleasant while brushing your teeth
669622015,Charming stylish place  comfortable bedding  Some minor issues with bugs  laundry is coin and hard to find coins in the area  Find a way to not have coin laundry because coins are now very hard to find Didnt respond for a while and we waited for more than an hour because instructions were wrong Hoard of mosquitoes on patio  some big problems throughout Good coffee shop but not much else around the area
521290341,Clean  and nice beds Need better window covering in the bedrooms  way too much light imo
652351810,Air conditioning doesnt work and they didnt fix it the entire time we stayed there  It was very hot and we contacted host multiple times about this  They said they will send maintenance team but no one arrived to fix this  The place is not at all worth of the money  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE   They didnt let us know about the air conditioning issue  Fixing the addressed problems and being nice to the customers  
665157609,Super outdated building with weird strong smell  Elevator comes to an abrupt stop and feels like its going to break while youre inside of it  use the stairs instead  Tiny bathroom  can barely move in it  Not very clean  surfaces had fingerprints and were kind of greasy  Bathroom corners were piled with dirt and grime  Found bugs in kitchen while making food  Bed is extremely firm and uncomfortable  but the pillows were nice and soft  The comforter was nice as well  DISGUSTING piss mold smell when you turn on the heater  Sketchy place to stay in general  Photos were taken to make it look nicer than it really looks  beware  The building itself was very run down and had a weird smell that was so strong it gave me a migraine  The apartment building overall felt haunted and old with the creaky floors  dim lighting  elevator that jolted at every floor  etc  The bathroom was extremely tiny and we could hardly move in it  Bathroom corners and floorboards were piled with dirt and grime  We found bugs in the kitchen area while we were trying to prepare food  The bed is extremely firm and uncomfortable  DISGUSTING piss mold smell when you turn on the heater   The room we got wasn u    t exactly the one in the photos  Weren u    t aware that they were renting several units out and they u    d all be different  Misleading   Dirt and grime on floorboards and corners of bathroom  Feeling of uncleanliness throughout entire bathroom  Parking was absolutely atrocious and horrible  A little overpriced for what we got  Ive stayed in airbnbs that were cheaper and were nicer 
624530655,If you are looking for a location that is convenient to Forest Park  Central West end  and Barnes Hospital this would be a really good choice  The apartment was nicely decorated  and the bed was comfortable  Didnt really have any issues   concerns with the check in process  Unfortunately due to covid    the restaurants in the Central West end area were only able to offer carryout  If you like to walk  Forest Park right across the street is an ideal location  However  if you are a light sleeper or prefer to have a quiet setting  this may not be ideal for you  It sits right on Kingshighway  so the noise from traffic  including multiple emergency vehicles traveling to or from Barnes Hospital is quite loud  There are a few minor maintenance items the apartment could use  overall the apartment was clean and comfortable   As far as description  this location is very convenient to the Central West end  and close to Barnes Hospital  which is why I was there in the first place  I would include that this location in particular is right on Kingshighway and there is a lot of noise from traffic including emergency vehicles traveling to or from Barnes Hospital   I needed to extend my stay  and unfortunately initially the access code had changed on the door to the apartment  That was rectified fairly quickly  There was hair in the sink in the bathroom  It took a while for the hot water to kick in the shower  the shower itself needs a new head and faucet  You might also consider putting in a better quality shower curtain  Initially  when I was trying to reserve The apartment I did not get a response  My son actually was able to handle it for me oh  that I should have been able to taking care of that myself  There are no concerns about the address  I think the price was fair  however the cleaning service fees taxes really raised the overall cost of my stay 
632022242,Very clean and super friendly customer service  Great location  We took great walks along the lake  Besides these minor issues Zencity was a great company to work with  Washer and dryer are only for residents and I was given inaccurate information even after I contacted Zencity and my messages were initially ignored until I called  Also  there should be mention of work out facility closure   I understand why with COVID     but still would have liked to know in advance   Continued toilet issues
624223765,This is a great location to stay in   The bed was very close to the floor  being that I a very tall it was sometimes a little ruff standing from such a low position   Bed was comfy once in tho   Rep from Zencity was very helpful with allowing me to check in early   Communications on property about how to get clean towels werent so clear   The concierge were extremely helpful but I had to ask questions to be get information about the building   I didnt find the laundry area until my last day at check out 
625742780,Bang for your buck  great place to stay  can get a tad noisy  overall would highly recommend It was good  up until someone set the building behind our apartment on fire  No sleep that night  as emergency vehicle lights and fire shined into our bedroom
706730116,This location was great  And the lighting from the pool area makes the balcony pop  Really wish their check in process went smoother though  Really love your locations but the lack of response was disappointing  Especiallywith how to get in  I had to cal and wait on hold to get the instructions on how to enter the place  There were bags of trash on the balcony  Never responded in app  Had to call them  The lack of response was disappointing  But it was a great rate 
632304466,This stay was disappointing   Wifi didn u    t work and host was unresponsive   The host forgot to approval my reservation after check in time 
625110805,Nice inside The area
650581504,Beware  its not whats described and the host does not exist  Please contact me  You over promised and under delivered  No key fob for two days  no washer  dryer for me to use as described  no pool no gym access 
521168271,The place is honestly just not clean  found used qtip  and very expensive  Opt for something else if at all possible  Just clean the place  The entire place was not perfectly cleaned but a few issues stood out  I found food from previous guests in the cupboards  and fridge  A used qtip in the sofa pillows  The toilet would regurgitate  lots of  water at night  The cleanliness and attention to details is simply not up to par  You can get a similar room in a private home at half the price 
520500726,The apartment is amazing  well decorated  very clean  with all the comforts  Communication with Zencity was very easy  Unfortunately they were working on the block  which made noise from machines for several days  The location is great if you dont want to be on downtown  I recommend it and would definitely stay here again 
630264148,Except a cozy stay  just be ready to ask a bunch of questions in regards to checking in 
700937828,No comment 
673523882,This apartment owned by Zencity is in a good location  and it is spatious   just as advertised  Check in is very simple  So is checkout  Once the apartment is cleaned  it is very nice  The view is pretty  Everything is provided for    The reason why my rating for this stay is lower than normal  however  is beacuse I had a very unpleasant and unfortunate experience while staying here  Specifically  when I checked in late at night  the apartment was very dirty  No one had cleaned  The bed sheets were unfolded and dirty  The bathroom was not cleaned  A wet towel was in the kitchen  Cleanliness is something that every user generally cares about when staying at a rental  Cleanliness is of paramount importance nowadays during a global pandemic  where we wish everything was desinfected due to fears of spread of the virus   After giving notice that the apartment was dirty  I was then moved to a different apartment owned by Zencity  and told to stay there until   pm the next day by phone  Unfortunately  there must have been some mistake communicating  as a man then came into my new apartment the next fay while I  a female  slept   This was extremely unnerving  and unsettling    Although I was later told vy Airbnbs support team that he was there for cleaning purposes  I was left very shaken  and frankly feeling unsafe during the rest of my stay  Perhaps this was a one time thing   but its something to consider in the future   Please note that Zencity did refund my cleaning fee  which I appreciated   They did not however offer to compensate for the additional expenses having to move to a different location  nor did they offer compensation for having someone come into my apartment while I slept   Having said this  I do commend the customer service at Zencity for quickly replying  and moving me to a different location for the night  They do answer quickly  and do try to help you out   On whether Id recommend this place for further stays I guess it really does depend  the place is nice  but Id certainly be afraid of this happening again  Perhaps  however  it was a one time thing  Hi   I wanted to let you know that I will leave an honest review of my stay  I have put up front the positive of the apartment  but had to be frank and candid about the situation that unfolded  I did however give credit to your communications team  and kept ir as neutral as possible  Happy to give further feedback as needed 
628802053,Our stay at this apartment was overall fine  The street lights shine right into the bedroom even with the big thick curtains  The specific room we stayed in was right next to an exit and it was loud when people would leave  There were no garbage bags throughout the apartment  mold starting to show in the bathtub  and several little bugs flying around  At some point during our stay I believe the breaker flipped which turned the lights off in the apartment  This wasnt noticed until morning so it wasnt a big deal  The place doesnt have a specific parking spot but plenty of parking around the complex  With all this in mind  it was a very smooth check in and checkout and we had a great time in KC  There were several small bugs flying around  Tub needs to be re calked due to mold starting to appear  No trash bags in trash cans 
711932454,I would not recommend this Airbnb for the following reasons     whole apartment smells of cigarettes    Shower curtain reeks of pee    Toilet was clogged when we arrived    Bedroom fan completely covered in dust    Wrong apartment  different from photos on Airbnb    Popsicle stick found on top ledge of shower    Wifi information was hard to find  It was not labeled  Apartment was a different one than shown in the pictures   Shower curtain smelled like pee  popsicle stick in shower and bedroom ceiling fan covered in dust  Overall the experience was uncomfortable due to the uncleanliness  it not being the same apartment as listed  and the fact that the toilet was clogged when we arrived  I would not recommend staying at this Airbnb 
518984795,Nice apartment located in a lovely area  Close to metro station and amazing Chinese restaurant  The host is very responsive and kind  The air condition worked well and the kitchen was clean  Also  there were towels and soap etc which was nice  The things that I didnt like  water pressure is bad and it is hard to get warm water  Also  there were black hair in my sheets and all over the bathroom  Im blonde  and there was some dirt in the floor  Despite this  I enjoyed my stay 
518397270,Great location  steps from train and in a neat neighborhood  Sink did not drain well 
626326531,Very clean spaces  and genuine  I enjoyed   out of   of my stays Falsely advertising isnt good I booked   stays with this company but my last stay they juts werent as responsive as the others
517657602,Quaint space on the park  Parking is not included but can be paid for on the street  A great spot  but with a moldy ac unit  I got in late on the first night and was hoping to have essentials to shower  since I was unable to bring my own  and it said they would be provided  There was no soap  only conditioner and hand lotion  So in the future  itd be nice to know what is actually provided in toiletries  Door was unlocked at my arrival  which was a little unnerving  The black mold growing in the ac unit put off a horrible smell throughout 
655594754,Great view no matter the time of day   location is also great as well  Everything that youd like to visit or do is walking distance from the condo  Thank you for allowing us to stay  The only thing we didnt like  There was hand finger prints all over the kitchen appliances  The couch had a few stains and the mirrors in the suit were very dirty  Other than that we had a great stay 
508379459,Central West End is a great place to stay when visiting St  Louis  This apartment is right across the street from Forest Park and a couple of blocks away from Euclid Ave  fun street with lots of great restaurants   The apartment is simple but does the job  Parking can be a hassle  We had to wake up one morning before   am to move the car  We arrived    minutes prior  contacted Zencity to see if they could open the door  We had to wait in an unairconditioned hallway because they could let us in early  They blamed it on cleaning which was clearly not the case  hair in the bathtub email communication was fine  just not available by phone  parking  more character in the apartment 
626558061,Cool place for the dollar  WiFi password wouldnt work but if you dont need it oh well   WiFi password wouldn u    t work   Only   body towels
536440365,decent location  parking wasnt hard to find around property  stair entry smelled pretty bad
624742843,Apartment was nice and comfortable  Very spacious  Only one tv in apartment  Parking in area is bad 
621153530,I will not personally ever recommend this place  Horrible experience  Very strict building to be in  No personal space  Room photos look smaller in person  If you want fresh air theres no windows that can be open in this room  Horrible security  Horrible property manager  Just save your time and headache away from this place 
626550644,Nice Stay Nice stay
625254886,Stay was what I expected  Location is great in terms of being close to Wash U  if you want to be there   Living space is quite small and walls are paper thin  I was able to hear conversations of next door neighbors  Check in was pretty smooth   Listing stated that it had a gym but the gym was closed and listing wasn u    t updated to reflect the closure   Floor had crumbs all over  which was a little annoying when walking around without shoes  There was also a large stain under the fridge door once you opened the door        per month for a studio is steep 
279798564,This is a great location  It is a five minute walk to the blue line  allowing you to get downtown in about    minutes  We had   people and we all could sleep with plenty of enjoyment  There isnt too much seating other than a couch  a chair  and   barstools  The TV is really nice and very easy to run  The bathrooms were nice and soap  shampoo  and conditioner were supplied  There is plenty of space to maneuver around and chill in  For the price  I would stay here again  Thanks for letting us stay there  It was a great stay and it was so nice being close to the Blue Line  I would recommend getting paper towels for the condominium though  Some more food recommendations wouldve been nice  Hair on the ground I called the morning of checkout and there was no response 
623647085,Great location and very clean
652894783,Good location It was not difficult to contact host   There u    s a fireplace in the photo of the living room but in our place the living room looked completely different no fireplace  no bay window in LR  No big deal but it was picturing a different apartment  Mini blinds very dusty  Hardwood floors in bedrooms not swept  With the supposed strict cleaning protocols with COVID     I was concerned about just how well the apartment really had been cleaned  Also  the air conditioning wasnt functioning properly when we arrived  There was a sign on the front door left by repairman that the unit was frozen and to not change the settings on the thermostat from the fan only mode  The wifi login and password listed did not work  Host did provide another when contacted  Being properly cleaned  especially during COVID     and better maintained  air conditioning   A coffee maker would be nice to have as well  This was my first experience with Airbnb so I wasnt sure what to expect  Not sure Ill do it again 
562272286,The location is about a    minute walk to the train station which made it easy to go either downtown or to the airport   The place is spacious and had the amenities youd expect and need  hair dryer  iron   ironing board  toiletries  basic kitchen supplies   I appreciated the Roku TV and Netflix account for entertainment   The shower in the bathroom is quite moldy and caused the apartment to smell of mildew  I dont think this was the hosts fault but I searched for something in West Loop and booked thinking I had reserved something in that neighborhood  which it wasnt  Cleaner bathroom Coffee
651610312,The rounds of clips  rapid gunfire  drive by shootings  screaming  sirens and murders went on all weekend long   The rounds of clips  rapid gunfire  drive by shootings  screaming  sirens and murders went on all weekend long  
561541264,The place is perfect and I was going to rate it   but in the end my experience soured as I forgot my laptop charger in there while leaving and in spite of multiple requests within an hour of leaving the place to locate it there was no response from the host  I understand its my fault to leave it and the host isnt liable but I would have appreciated any help to find it or a response on whether it was found 
624442734,Overall  a very well decorated place  Cozy and feels like home  Ive stayed in a Zencity air bnb before and it was an amazing experience  However  this time around not so much  This air bnb wasnt properly cleaned at all  Which is very disappointing considering were in a pandemic    No paper towels in the unit  Which was also frustrating because you have to dry your hands somehow after washing them    The padlock to our air bnb was also unresponsive the first night  Meaning  whenever we left we had to leave the door unlocked that night  Thankfully  we werent traveling with any valuables  The was an issue with my air bnbs padlock the first day  Ive stayed in a zen city air bnb before and this was nothing like my previous experience  The apartment wasnt clean at all  The floor was sticky  The walls had so many smears  prints and scuffs on them as if it were adult kids putting their hands on the wall  There was no hand soap in the bathroom nor paper towels in the entire unit  If the air bnb was clean and up to par  especially in a pandemic  and if the door was secured upon arrival 
633347480,i enjoy Zencity but this place i didnt like More clean towels and a new mattress it was uncomfortable and sunk in in the middle
625155762,Great spot   no complaints  Love the spot   will come back    Your front door doesnt look though  please fix 
653510831,Pretty nice place  although parking isnt included  so expect to pay        a night for parking  except weekends   Smelled of smoke despite the signs that say no smoking allowed 
671085659,Great apartment  It had everything we needed for our short stay in St Louis   The apartment is in a great location downtown with plenty of restaurant options  We were never more than    mins from any attraction we went to   Again just minor issues probably from regular wear and tear of use   Overall the apartment was not as clean as the post lead us to believe   I found a loaf of bread in the kitchen cabinet and my wife found some on the floor in the bathroom 
700435530,This might get long winded so bear with me  The first thing youll encounter is that the check in instructions to get in arent accurate  Youll have to wait for someone to eventually leave for them to open the door to the hallway you need to get in to access the elevator  Once you overcome that hurdle  youll be let down when you walk into your room  The unit has a prominent smell of cigarette smoke  This is strictly a non smoking until so if you have health reasons or just want a smoke free room for comfort this place is probably not for you  If you are a smoker  you wont be the first to smoke here and will probably get away with it by the look at the response that I got when bringing up this issue  The rug had bread crumbs trash on it  The floors felt like there was a layer of grime on them  The comforter had a yellow stain on it  Speaking of stains  the bedroom and bathroom walls have stains that appear to be from bodily fluids  The shower floor was stained where one would typically stand while showering  Had to get one my hands and knees to scrub the shower floor so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out  Horrible water pressure in the shower by the way  The thermostat was locked so I couldnt make it colder than    degrees  After I contacted the host about this issue it took them two days to lower it to    degrees  By then I had figure out a way to make it cooler  just gotta be a little creative  Another annoying thing was that the light switch for the kitchen also controlled the outlet where the tv was connected to  So you could only watch tv with a huge glare on it  Another workout was found for this issue  Got one of the two extension cords behind the couch and connected it the outlet in the room and ran it under the door  Unplug the tv from the outlet and take the cord out of the plastic cable hider to have enough slack to connect it to the extension cord  Another inconvenience was that the key fob they provided at first didnt allow access to the parking lot or the roof  After the second day they did provide a secondary key that worked for everything but they didnt request permission when dropping it off and just helped themselves in  Even though we werent in the room at the time  its common courtesy to ask when entering the until like other hosts and handy men have  It felt like a violation of our privacy and made us feel uneasy  Other than that the location was good and the aesthetics of the renovations were nice  Please get rid of that awful smoke smell and do a deep cleaning  Update the check in instructions as well as the first key fob that was given since it doesnt give access to the parking lot or the rooftop  Change the stained comforter and clean repaint the stains on the walls  Give better access to the thermostat     degrees is horrible to sleep in   The description states that this is a non smoking unit but the place reeked of cigarette smoke   The instructions to get into the building were accurate but to get into the actual unit  were not  No way to get into the hallway without a key fob following the instructions provided by the host  Took    minutes for someone to be coming out for us the get in  Then the key fob did not open the gate to the parking lot nor to the rooftop  A second key fob was provided after the second day  which raised another concern  Someone when into the unit without authorization  In the past  when the host or a handyman had to get inside the unit permission was requested and only until I granted that permission would they come in  Common courtesy to ask for permission to go into the unit since for all intents and purposes I am in charge and responsible while I pay to stay here  This gave us a sense of having our privacy violated and honestly rubbed us the wrong way  The worst out of a few things on this list was the horrible cigarette smoke smell  Despite being a non smoking unit the smoke smell was obnoxious and undeniably coming from the room  The building and halls didnt smell like this until you went into the apartment unit  Had to go to the store and buy odor eliminator and air freshener  The rug in the living room had physical crumbs trash on it  The couch was just simply dirty when we had to remove the cushion due to the remote falling in the crevice  The whole floors felt like there was a layer of grime on them  The shower floor was brown in the area where one would stand to shower  I had to get on my hands and knees and try to scrub out as much as I could so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out  The white comforter had a yellow stain on it  The walls in the bedroom and bathroom had stains that appeared to be bodily fluids when using a black light  The laminated card on the little chalk board that says  cleaned by  didnt have a personnel name or a date  For all I know the place wasnt cleaned before my stay  Communication wasnt as fast or as helpful as most Airbnbs  When mentioning about the key fob not working to open the gate to the parking lot  a response wasnt received until someone went into the unit without authorization to drop off the second key fob  Noticed that while we were staying at this Airbnb the price to stay there decreased a bit  After having the complains and inconvenience we mentioned  a partial refund discount would have been appreciated 
626784282,Location was fine but keep in mind if you have a car  it will be a literal nightmare to find a parking spot  Space was average  you get what you pay for 
717225048,The bed wasnt comfortable  the wifi didnt work  and we had a hard time finding the lockbox with the key fob in it because the instructions were unclear The instructions to receive our key fob in lockbox C were unclear  The email said wed have pictures to reference but we never got a picture
531947087,Excellent place   Great location in Hyde Park area Too many SMS
700627799,Great stay  but the lack of privacy was a bit scary  All windows should have blinds  Great stay  but the lack of privacy was a bit scary  All windows should have blinds 
653220039,Not the best stay 
625970140,I highly recommend   Its safe and private  But it doesnt have parking  Only free on the weekends  Thank you for letting me stay  I hope you let Me stay again  Parking availability sucked  I was close to where I need to be  But if it wasnt for the free parking on the weekend  I wouldnt have a place for me car overnight 
654329242,While the location and minimalist style were exactly what we were looking for we were surprised to find that there was a heavy smoke odor in the unit upon our arrival  We found that it was not as strong if we kept the AC off and the windows open  With temps in the   s during the day  we found ourselves feeling pretty uncomfortable from the heat  especially at night since it didnt cool off much  We reached out to Zencity right away with our concern but with a     hour response wait time we felt we lost our window of time to relocate before settling in  They did offer us a small discount on our stay to make up for some of the inconvenience which we appreciated  The shower drain was clogged and the toilet handle was broken which we reported to them as well  Other than these things the apartment was comfortable and we were glad to have a washer dryer in unit  Thank you for the stay  We struggled to feel comfortable  unfortunately  due to the smoke smell which became worse when we turned the air conditioning on  With the higher temps this week  we were left with some restless nights  While we would have liked to have canceled  we were short on time with our work schedule and were not able to find another option close by within our budget  We feel that if the description of the unit included that there was a smoke odor we would have not booked  We hope that it will be addressed for future renters  We also feel that the delay in responding on Monday affected our ability to make a decision to cancel and rebook somewhere else for the week as that was the day that we would have had the most time to do so  We appreciate the offer of a     discount  Please let us know how to proceed with that   Smoke odor 
624681496,It was not what I expected but still had a good time  Nice quiet neighborhood
625776964,Great place  Great location with lots to do close by  The place was nice and clean  Minor things such as a broken soap dispenser and no paper towels  We didnt have much trouble finding parking  Heads up  There is no coffee machine and NO IRON  Otherwise  Id definitely stay again when in town  Great place  especially for the price 
624668351,Great little spot  nice quiet area close to everything  A little loud as its located by the front door and under the stairs in the basement  but still very enjoyable  Host was super awesome  I would definitely stay here again when im in this city  Enjoyed my stay  only critique I have would be to put a sign on the window behind the couch for people not to bang   knock on your window disturbing guest when they cant get in the front door or the box code is malfunctioning  Thanks again  The electronic keybox  check in was experiencing technical difficulties  but it was doing that for everyone trying to enter not just us  Because of this mishap I had random people knocking on the window all day   night hoping to get my attention  so they could gain entry  I finally made a little paper sign that said stop knocking call your HOST   it stopped lol   Missing Keyfob  so i couldnt access the parking lot   pretty much stayed inside the next day because I didnt want to fight with the electronic keybox  The host offered to bring another by  but it wasnt that big of a deal to me I was teleworking anyway  Overall really cool place  nice area  other than a few minor issues that are easily corrected  I would definitely stay there again  with earphones   The bed had been made  but not washed   I had to pull the top sheet wash it then sleep on top of it  The fitted sheets had shoe prints on them when I pulled the comforter back  Comforter had hairs   light stains as well  Black leather chairs in kitchen were dirty with food particles  Im easy going I hardly care about stuff like this  but im mentioning it so that the owner can make sure his staff is truly cleaning things in the era of Covid      Walls were a bit dirty with what looked like liquid stains   lots damage to the paint in some areas  I called   Zencity took note for the record  Right under the stairs   by the front door  so it can get very loud at times  Everything else was good to go 
626528633,I thought this place was really nice besides the fact that it did not look like the pictures  basically just a different version of the pictures it was still very nice and felt smelled clean  My only problem was if you are wanting to stay long you might want to bring more to cook with  there wasnt any mixing bowls and   fork  so we had to keep washing  Overall my stay was good and I recommend this place  Thank you for the stay  Roads are very narrow but of course that is not the hosts fault  just a heads up for someone who does not like crowded areas 
712296376,Nice location  really near to lake with good window views  Thank you for letting us stay  Didnot find it clean as expected  Air filters and rooms were a bit dirty   Filter needs to be changed 
623542453,The apartment itself was in an amazing location and the furniture was very well appointed   The other tenants are VERY helpful and nice   The area is definitely safe  You can walk to anywhere you want on the plaza   I stayed there during the shutdown due to COVID    so the Plaza was closed down   There is an amazing park by the apartment as well   Food Delivery was very easy to do   There were animal hairs on all of the towels  wash clothes  washer  bed sheets and pillows   There was hair in the shower  There was urine on the toilet seat   I let Zincity know this immediately and sent them pictures of the hairs   They did drop off new towels the next day and let me know that there were other sheets and pillows in the closet  However  they did not provide me with a new comforter  I had to re wash the comforter  sheets and towels as I did not have anything the day of check in   I was unable to figure out how to put in the code to unlock the doors   One of the other tenants let me in and gave me a quick crash course in how to enter and exit the building  After that getting into and out of the building was a breeze   Parking spot    was unable to be used because there was someone already parked there  Zencity did a great job with finding me another spot to park in during my stay   Many times there were several hours between some responses to my inquiries  You may want to ensure that all towels  linens and bathrooms are truly clean prior to a new guest arriving especially with COVID    going around  I was unable to figure out how to put in the code to unlock the doors   One of the other tenants let me in and gave me a quick crash course in how to enter and exit the building  After that getting into and out of the building was a breeze   Parking spot    was unable to be used because there was someone already parked there  Zencity did a great job with finding me another spot to park in during my stay  There were animal hairs on all of the towels  wash clothes  washer  bed sheets and pillows   There was hair in the shower  There was urine on the toilet seat   I let Zincity know this immediately and sent them pictures of the hairs   They did drop off new towels the next day and let me know that there were other sheets and pillows in the closet  However  they did not provide me with a new comforter  I had to re wash the comforter  sheets and towels as I did not have anything the day of check in  Many times there were several hours between some responses to my inquiries 
627317436,The unit is basic  Its spacious  There is no air  it is very hot  The temperature outside was in upper   s and lower   s and it was still hot  For this reason  I would not stay there again 
625414631,Very slow to respond to emails and app messages  took   days to get a reply  and no access to a contact telephone number to reach anyone  Even the door man couldnt reach the host     Bad plumbing but otherwise a great stay if you just want to have peace and no interruptions from the host or neighbors  Very slow to respond to emails and app messages  took   days to get a reply  and no access to a contact telephone number to reach anyone  Even the door man couldnt reach the host     Bad plumbing but otherwise a great stay if you just want to have peace and no interruptions from the host or neighbors  Very slow to respond to emails and app messages  took   days to get a reply  and no access to a contact telephone number to reach anyone  Even the door man couldnt reach the host     Bad plumbing but otherwise a great stay if you just want to have peace and no interruptions from the host or neighbors 
142515203,The apartment is in a great location and very spacious  It looks exactly like the pictures  We had some difficulty entering the apartment at first because there was some miscommunication and the apartment was not ready at check in time  but Chris acted quickly as soon as he learned of the problem  Overall  we had a great stay   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  late host  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements  host unreachable 
627090495,Overall place is very nice and cute my only issue was the pics had a balcony and there wasnt on and the refrigerator was kind of dirty other than that I loved it They need more up to date pics because I booked that Airbnb looking forward to having a balcony to sit out on and enjoy the nice weather  One the pics on the app there was a balcony but the studio didn u    t have one  The refrigerator was dirty like it hadnt been wiped down in a while it had crumbs
615231317,Great 
646749862,Pros  Great location  Cons  There was a listening  recording device hidden under the desk  No where in the listing does it mention it nor in the apartment  Floors look as if they have not been vacuumed in months  Head board had hand prints  Washer smelt of mildew  Could not park in the gated parking lot because the fob would not work  They brought me a new one and it still didnt work    Before you book on Airbnb check out the Zencity website  Rates are much cheaper and you shouldnt have to pay anything for a dirty and privacy invading space  My suggestion would be to remove the Alexa  any listen  recording devices from the home   hirer a true house keeper   Under the desk was an Alexa  Some sort of device that can easily listen in on conversations or whatever you may do in the air bnb  The concerning part was that it was hidden and NOT mentioned anywhere on the listing or in the apartment  I managed hotels for years privacy is a number one priority for guests  Shame on you   Floors had visible debris  Bedding had hair all over it  Head board had hand prints  Washer smelt of mildew    Couch had hair  It was upsetting to see the cheaper rate on the  Zincity  website  Ultimately the privacy   cleanliness of the apartment made me feel that I shouldnt have had to pay the higher rate 
711694253,Was it worth the price  Id say so  Will it make everyone happy  No    Bring your own water  The tap water here is not good and there is no filtered water  They put in the post that paid street parking is available but there is a sign that says street parking is by permit only after      so we got a ticket  The doors slam surprisingly loud unless you turn the handle and scotch it closed gingerly  Different neighbors scream bloody murder or let their dog bark loudly every so often  There is a group of homeless people that hang out right outside of the building so just make sure you dont go down alone if youre uncomfortable with that  There is a big lack of toiletries  they left one single use  maybe double use   tiny  tiny bottle of shampoo  conditioner  and body wash for the   of us adults for the week we were here so not much attention to detail  I might have been able to just ask for more and get them delivered but I didnt ask because we brought our own anyway  The chair in the living room was obviously broken  There was something wrong with the heating units because no matter how low we set the temperature  the room got overly hot and dry quickly so we kept them off most of the time  The view was so nice  we had a corner apartment that had a park on both sides and the arch and city could be seen from one window    but the windows were really dirty so I would say it almost ruined the enjoyment we could have gotten from the good view we had  There was a severe lack of supplies in the kitchen  no coffee  no filters  no spices other than s p  a couple cooking tools  The comforter was unwashed because it had crusty red stuff on it  Im hoping that was just Cheetos  One pillow definitely had a dot of blood stain  There was a big lack of outlets in the bedrooms and the one outlet that was in a good place was broken  The building doesnt feel safe but the room made us happy overall  Good location and not any traffic nearby  could be due to less travel     Pretty much everything mentioned our group could look past and we overall liked the place and had a good time  I just wanted to warn anyone else of the possible vacation ruiners before they booked  There was no extra comforter in the closet but its no big deal  accidents happen  Was it worth the price  Id say so  Will it make everyone happy  No    Bring your own water  The tap water here is not good and there is no filtered water  They put in the post that paid street parking is available but there is a sign that says street parking is by permit only after      so we got a ticket  The doors slam surprisingly loud unless you turn the handle and scotch it closed gingerly  Different neighbors scream bloody murder or let their dog bark loudly every so often  There is a group of homeless people that hang out right outside of the building so just make sure you dont go down alone if youre uncomfortable with that  There is a big lack of toiletries  they left one single use  maybe double use   tiny  tiny bottle of shampoo  conditioner  and body wash for the   of us adults for the week we were here so not much attention to detail  I might have been able to just ask for more and get them delivered but I didnt ask because we brought our own anyway  The chair in the living room was obviously broken  There was something wrong with the heating units because no matter how low we set the temperature  the room got overly hot and dry quickly so we kept them off most of the time  The view was so nice  we had a corner apartment that had a park on both sides and the arch and city could be seen from one window    but the windows were really dirty so I would say it mostly ruined the enjoyment we could have gotten from the good view we had  There was a severe lack of supplies in the kitchen  no coffee  no filters  no spices other than s p  a couple cooking tools  The comforter was unwashed because it had crusty red stuff on it  Im hoping that was just Cheetos  One pillow definitely had a dot of blood stain  There was a big lack of outlets in the bedrooms and the one outlet that was in a good place was broken  The building doesnt feel safe but the room made us happy overall  Good location and not any traffic nearby  could be due to less travel     Pretty much everything mentioned our group could look past and we overall liked the place and had a good time  I just wanted to warn anyone else of the possible vacation ruiners before they booked 
624544419,Well I paid for my place little did I know they gave me wrong codes answered my text or my emails with automated responses and then at the very end they offered me     of my money back which I thought was a joke if I gave them     of their apartment back after renting it they would not have been very happy about that but since Im a great guest and I always leave my places in excellent condition  why would they think I would be happy with that offer
627041991,Great location and nice apt  The air never worked and it never was less than    in the apt at any time  They were hard to get timely replies  Will not stay here again due to the air issue  The apt was great but the air never worked  Was trying to get someone out there to check it out and it was nearly impossible to get timely replies  The temperature never dropped below    
627318602,Good place with a low price  Unfortunately during my stay the host was very slow to respond  and it seems as if they werent prepared for people to stay  Good location  but parking was pretty hard to find since its only street parking by the building 
625103791,Nice loft and great price  Issues trying to get in caused a bit of stress  luckily a tenant helped us get in  Everything was clean minus the bathroom  short curly hair all over the shower and floor  Location is great for downtown exploring   Needed a key fob to use the elevator and therefore couldnt get up to the room until we caught someone going up who lived there  Also  key pad to get in building didnt work  again had to wait on someone to come in so we could get in   See note above Hair all over the shower and bathroom floow 
625762163,Super cute place with a great location  Emphasis on style over functionality     Would stay again for the great location and comfortable bed  Thanks for letting us stay in your space  Great location   There were several small pieces lying around   plastic piece on the balcony  plastic near the bedroom window  random piece under TV  Not a big deal but maybe they belong with something  Some hairs in bathroom but otherwise clean 
633372971,Nice location  But a pain to check in and communication was not great 
627690827,Great location  Difficult Check in instructions  very hard bed and furniture  Clean and well equipped room  Loved then wine opener and creamer and coffee  Ultimately I couldnt get comfortable  There are screws on the bed that poke out on the right side  I really scraped my knee and the bed and sofa are very hard and firm   I was under the impression there was a person of contact  You have to figure out everything yourself  check yourself in using codes   Once you figure out the code to open the initial door the elevator doesnt let you up  Covers and throws Comfortable furniture
657919462,This apartment was a cute place with thoughtful touches to it  The cleanliness aspect could be improved as I had to vacuum and mop all the floors down the first night due to dust and stickiness  There were also some nicks and bumps in the apartment that looked like wear and tear issues  The location was good and we had quick access to downtown  Lock box difficult to access 
419283058,This place is in prime area  There is a nice park  the Great Lake  coffee shop and a few restaurants within walking distance  The building is very stylish  has a gym  It also has table for study in lobby area  There are a number of students in the buildings  My room doesnt have view of the lake or the city  but I know that other rooms do  and can give great view    Parking is hard  but not quite impossible  Meter parking is free after   pm and before  am  on the street across the building    When I checked in  there was no cookware  utensils  anything but an empty kitchen  I was very sad about that  They worked hard to bring new kitchenware to the unit on the second day  but missing other basic cook stuffs such as salt and pepper  But I just prepare a quick premade meal so it was ok  I appreciate that they fill up the missing items    If they fill up the kitchen in all units  and offer the competitive price  Zencity is such a GOOD CHOICE for visitors  contractors  I just hope they fill up the kitchen well  including condiments  cookware for it is the main purpose of renting the whole unit  I think cooking basic including salt  pepper  oil is needed
657493453,Great location for University of Chicago  quiet space  good responsiveness by telephone   Furniture different than pictured  Missing key in lock box  Had to call for alternate instructions 
702124377,Great place and perfect location 
576177558,We chose this because of the very ideal location and price  Walking distance to several places and nice area at a nice price  a win win  right  Overall it was a good stay  but had a few issues   The first one was the description showcased a dedicated parking spot behind the building as we are a band on tour this was a big selling point to secure our van and music equipment  We arrived to a car already parked there and upon messaging were informed to park somewhere else in a paid lot  This was fine  but not what was expected  The next issue was the doors touchscreen keypad which we didnt realize was the keypad and tried the wrong door initially  made for a bit of a laugh even though it was      AM   Then we tried the correct door and the code didnt work even after multiple attempts  After messaging the host the code magically worked    Upon entering  the space looked like the photos albeit not quite as clean  Just seemed slightly dusty and not as pristine  but not a huge deal  Just a slight disappointment  but we got over it because it was overall nice and beds were all clean and we were tired  In the morning shower time saw us struggling with a showerhead that lacked pressure and only partially worked  Then when trying to do some work the wifi password didnt work   regardless of the device  I sent a message and the response was to use the WiFi we had been trying with the same password  I followed back with that it didnt work  no further help  Aside from those issues  everything else was great  The location was perfect for us walking around and a short walk to the CTA and etc  I would definitely not mind staying there again for the price and if I was not on tour concerned about parking  Overall good stay  but theres an issue with the WiFi  the door code not working right away  the seemingly included parking spot that isnt actually included  and the not fully functional shower head made for a not as ideal stay  Location and price are perfect though   WiFi is included but the password didnt work no matter what device and the only help was an auto reply stating the same password that didnt work  The listing also alludes to a dedicated parking space but upon arrival it was occupied and after messaging we were informed to find a pay to park lot instead  The cherry on top was the shower head lacking pressure and not working very well    Initially we tried the wrong door  completely our fault   but it wasnt clear the door had a touch screen keypad that went dark so wasnt very apparent to use  Upon entering the code very carefully several times it didnt work  We messaged the host and then mid messaging back and forth about the issue the door magically worked  It seems the code hadnt been activated or something along those lines  Overall it was clean  but it seemed like a lack of recent sweeping or mopping wasnt present  Not the worst but just didnt live up to the photos Communication was quick even at      am but some of the responses were auto reply type responses  Not a huge issue though and we had our issues resolved except for the WiFi  If all the amenities were included worked it would be flawless 
258647394,The place was very good and clean  Very accessible to nearby landmarks  They had all the necessary kitchen items and towels   Only two concerns      the new safety lock pin and gate pin could have been provided in a single email or within airbnb messages rather than sent separately   I understand the safety but when you provide the pin it could all be together  So we had this issue and had to reach him through message  however there was no response for atleast a few hours  Finally I figured out the other email which had the instructions to enter       the AC thermostat was making a loud noise all through the night every time it kickstarted   Otherwise it was a good stay and everyone in the family enjoyed  Beautiful home  Please take a look at the Ac  heaters thermostat noise which was very annoying all through the night   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  Additional comments   u   cAC   Hester thermostat u   d   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements  Additional comments   I wish all the pin details come in one email or in the airbnb messages itself   
652867185,Beautiful place  great location to downtown Chicago  The apartment was wonderful  although we seemed to run into a hiccup with some neighbors regarding noise   The complaints they lobbed were during periods of time when we were not even present in the Air B B   Other than that mishap  the location and experience were fine  Our check in was late   The place became available to us at   pm  we did not arrive until      and there was still cleaning staff preparing the apt   It was fine  but just wanted to note 
587193827,We enjoyed our stay  Zen city was accommodating  Our stay here was the first time we shared a place with family  It was more than comfortable for my parents  my husband and myself  I could not be more happy with the value of the stay  Comfortable beds  ample space  great neighborhood  Thanks for the comfortable stay  It was a great value  I would suggest checking behind the door in the bathroom  It appeared the cleaning was done with the door open and some build up occurred behind the door   We were also a bit disappointed by the responsiveness to our request regarding the kitchen sink  we do recognize it was a holiday  so I am guessing thats not normal practice  We had a problem with the kitchen sink backing up the first morning of our stay  not caused by us  as we only put water in the sink   We did not hear back until after checking out the second day   however  it was January   when we reached out and we expect the delay was related to the holiday 
614947200,Zencity provides a very clean and comfortable space to stay  They were also very quick to respond to any questions I had  The apartment  is within an easy walking distance to grocery and more restaurants than you need  With its close vicinity to the train I was concerned with that noise but actually was surprised by how quiet it was  The only time it wasnt was when garbage removal occurred in the mornings  Id definitely look for a Zencity run Airbnb for my next stay  Your place was fantastic  Nothing to complain about on the apartment itself  The floors were squeaky  but in time  we figured out where to walk to make it less so  My only complaint was the banging in the back which I assume was the garbage removal  Seemed to happen between    am every morning  So its nothing on Zencity  Not your fault  But did wake us almost everyday 
586227703,This was a great apartment  bigger than we expected  Everything we needed was there  There are two separate rooms  but they are open to the ceiling so there is a lot of noise carrying  The building is old  but not unsafe or unsavory while we were there the elevator broke down  The stairs were available  but not easy to find if youre outside and dont know where to go  If I had been alone  I would have felt very unsafe in the stairwell   Also  the sofa had a leg break   However it seemed to be broken before we arrived  I sat on the sofa for the first time while someone was sitting on the other side  and it just fell back on the broken leg  That will need to be fixed  Needs new shower heads  too  However  having two bathrooms was fantastic    The place is convenient to things downtown with        or    minute walks  We headed to the Arch and also Ballpark Village for New Years Eve  Once we parked  in the garage across the street      day  we never had to drive   We stayed for NYE so things were a little loud in the hallways and the streets  but generally there wasnt noise from neighbors    Overall everything was great and I would recommend this place for a small family or two or more adults needing separate rooms  Thank you 
710609375,It wasnt as clean as I expected  Other then that it was ok  It definitely was not what I expected as far as cleanliness  During COVID time there shouldnt have been anything on the floors  It led me to believe they didnt clean from last guest  The house was not how it looked on AirBNB  There was lint  hair and lint balls on the floor and rugs  The sheets didnt look clean either
668120375,Bed was comfortable   Price was fair  The building was nicely decorated   th floor with   elevator and laundry on  nd floor was a challenge  Parking is nearly impossible  Got a ticket my  rd night for parking out front of the building   So plan ahead on that  Overall Id recommend still had a great stay   Address was a bit tricky  Lock issues but they were resolved fairly quickly once someone answered All the dishes in the cabinets were dirty  Every single one Parking sucked   You will get a ticket for parking if u r on the street Price was decent
624944548,This was my first time getting an Airbnb and I have to say for it to be the first time it did not go as well as it should especially since it was my birthday  The host was very dramatic and very paranoid about the amount of cars that were outside he acted as if there were cars covering the entire block and I had a huge gathering or party or something overall he was very strict  and it didnt help that he lived only   houses down  I have to say if I am going to do this again it will have to be a way more private and secluded area  My gmail account couldnt reply back  Was having issues communicating with the host 
473945780,This is a bare bones apt in a great area    Brian is very helpful     there is lots of room and a good value for the money    Worked very well for a two night stay for   couples there for  College graduation     Thanks for answering everything so promptly    we had a great time    If you are paying someone         to clean  I think you should see what kind of job they do    Thanks again for everything     Rona  There were   chairs  one broken at the table   no way   people could eat there    nNever got the tv to show regular stations   you need to leave written directions and also directions to grocery and breakfast restaurants     This was good    No problems    The whole apartment needs a good cleaning  baseboards in bathroom    grout between tiles   also you need something on the floor of the tub as it is very slippery   also a safety bar would be good    An extra towel or two might also be good as a backup    Thanks for answering all questions promptly All good
712858989,We loved this space  It was an extremely easy going process with absolutely no issues  Their prompt communication was very helpful   we felt so welcomed  Definitely recommend  We loved it 
704849787,Clean place with nice decore  A great value for the price  Great location close to everything I needed 
654330048,Used as a quick stopover  bed and towels felt brand new  City area was a bit loud at night  Thank you for the stay   It seemed too new to have as many reviews as there were listed   One part of the check in process was stuck in the door of the box  Also the check out instructions as provided by the host did not work as intended since the door did not lock without the fab  and they wanted us to leave the fab inside the unit 
702550015,Amazing bed and shower  Great washer and dryer  There is no parking  barely any parking on the street  The front steps are hazardous by design and there isnt a tv in the bedroom  The couch in the living room is just a love seat so this is definitely better for one or s couple that isnt into snuggling  I liked the easy access to check in  the check in and check out hours are limited  should be able to check out later than    I think  Need better parking The bottom sheet had hair on it from previous guests Parking is terrible I mean good luck
614870202,This space is beautiful   airy  light  great views  and as pictured  Know that the host is not an individual  but rather a company  The apartment is beautiful and very conveniently located  I enjoyed my stay there and have the following comments   There is a bit of an ant problem in the bathroom and living room   The bed is wrapped in plastic that makes it very hard for the body to regulate temperature while sleeping  I messaged the hosts about this but received no reply  I ended up sleeping on top of the bed because it was too uncomfortable within the sheets  The bathroom needs a bath plug  there is an ant problem in the apartment  especially the bathroom  otherwise it is very nice 
633810209,Clean
633805740,The location and views from this place are absolutely incredible  The space is very nice and minimally furnished  Our critiques are that the shower floor was dirty when we checked in and one day the elevator in the building was not working and the door to the stairs was locked  We also did not receive check out instructions until    minutes before our check out time  so the communication could have been improved  Overall  we had an amazing stay  We took pictures of the place before we checked out because we loved it so much 
714298308,It is in a wonderful location in downtown Saint Louis  The floor are creaky and the walls are so thin so you able to hear everything from neighbors and including outside
714125531,They cancelled my reservation hours before I was supposedly to get there  They cited  maintenance issues   I asked what kind of maintenance issues they were and why they would take all five of the days that I had reserved  They had no answer  I had to settle for another place  as it was the last minute and I needed a place to stay  Very stressful and disappointing 
612516881,Great value place to stay in Hyde park  The place was impeccably clean  check in was a breeze  if we had any issues they were quick to respond and its in a great location if youre going to the university of Chicago  theres a shuttle stop just a few blocks again   We stayed for two weeks  The main downsides were that the couch in the living room was quite uncomfortable  so we tried to turn it into a futon but it seemed it was actually broken and was being supported by this metal post in the middle  It wouldnt have been a big deal for one or two nights  but for two weeks it was pretty painful  Also the beds are both memory foam  not spring mattress  and I had a hard time sleeping the first few nights   obviously this would only be an issue if you dont like memory foam  Overall a good stay but I would try somewhere else if I was going back for a long stay solely due to the couch and bed 
629714701,Location was good  Walkable to restaurants  starbucks and forest park  There was a constant party upstairs  we could Smell drugs in the hallway every night  We were not disturbed but a little hesitant to go out late   The place needs to be cleaned though  The ceiling fans were a dusty mess  We switched them on only to be showered with dust balls for a whole day  The hall bath shower sprayed water all over the bathroom so we had to clean the floors after every shower   The kitchen is NOT well equipped  The unit sleeps   and has only   dinner plates    coffee mugs and   salad plates  No serveware either  Because of the current situation we were trying not to eat out and had to buy paper products to make up for the lack of kitchen supplies   If a place can sleep     which we indicated on our reservation  there should be   dinner plates  mugs and all kitchen utensils  The kitchen was NOT well equipped    dinner plates and   coffee mugs was VERY inconvenient   nThe bedrooms had no curtains   the morning sun was so strong we could not sleep past   am  The windows in the living room was missing blinds   nThe hall bath shower was explosive     The water would splash all over the bathroom when one person showered so we were constantly cleaning the floor   Check in instructions said to look for a phone on the left of the first door  It on the right  When the fans were switched on there was dust balls flying everywhere  The closets were dusty   I hung my shirt on the rod in the closet and I literally had to wash it it got so dusty  We emailed to ask if they could come with some drapes to put on the windows and NO RESPONSE It needs to be cleaned and drapes installed
609878127,It was great  My only complaint would be that the AC units only blew warm hot air so we had to open the window for cool air  It was great  My only complaint would be that the AC units only blew warm hot air so we had to open the window for cool air 
609264686,Thank you for hosting my friends and I  I loved the decor which was simple and modern  Everything we needed i e  towels  utensils  soap etc was there  It truly felt like a hotel stay  We had a small hiccup with the heater not working upon arrival but Chris was very responsive and sent someone right away to fix the problem  I will definitely come back    We found a lot of hair in the bed sheets and some stains as well  Made it very uneasy to sleep in  Other than that    everything was great 
629631383,Although we had some frustrations with the check in process  dishes that were left dirty  and an AC window unit in a room that barely worked  they were outweighed by the reasonable price  amount of space  and modern atmosphere of the apartment  We were also able to access the roof    stories up  which provided an amazing view of the sunset and the city  We would consider staying here again  Although we had some issues explained on the previous page  we still had an overall great experience  It was nice to have more space to spread out for approximately the same price as a hotel room  and we felt at home after the initial frustrations  Also  having access to the roof was amazing  This should be something advertised on the listing as it was a huge perk of staying there   In the photos  window air conditioning units were pictured  However  the one in the largest bedroom did not work properly  It made noise but put out little to no cool air  which is unacceptable during the summer months  Also  most of the units had the  u   cchange filter u   d light on  which needs to be addressed  Finally  there was a tub  shower combination in he bathroom  However  there was no way to plug the drain in order to take a bath   The automated check in was awful  We typed our code in to get the keys from the box in the lobby  but the staff put them in incorrectly  The string on the keys were sticking out the door  causing the opening mechanism to jam somehow  The number I was given in the check in instructions went to an answering machine with no option to talk to a live body  We didnt want to leave a message as it was   pm and we needed to get into our apartment immediately  Thankfully  AJ  who is with the apartment staff  not even Zencity    had another number for us to try which connected us with a Zencity staff member  He helped us troubleshoot to open the door manually  but it was still a difficult and frustrating process  In the kitchen  there were dirty dishes in the dishwasher  such as a cookie sheet with multiple  caked on burns  There were also dirty dishes elsewhere  such as a spatula in the crock pot that had dried egg caked on it  Based on these findings  we had to assume everything was dirty  so we washed all the dishes in the dishwasher before we were able to use them  Regarding the bathroom  there was a sample body wash left behind in the shower  We know these usually are thrown away when rooms are cleaned  so it made us wonder if the shower had actually been clean  Also  there was a cup on the sink that was filthy  people had used it for there toothbrushes  so there was dried toothpaste on it  and there was mold caked around the edges  as well 
629613866,Do not stay here  Entry box was broken and I couldnt get in  Host owner called me back two hours later and called me a fucken bitch because I was unhappy that I was locked out  I am   months pregnant and drove    hours to attend my sisters funeral only to be cussed out  lose money and not have anywhere to stay  I am devastated  Go out of business  This was listed as luxury  upscale  Instead the box was broken and I couldn u    t get into building   Box was broken  Called the owner host for access  Im  months pregnant and drove    hours for a funeral  Only to be called a fucken bitch when I called the host owner and was threatened by him as well  I ended up not having a place to stay during the trip  Owner called me a fucken bitch and hung up on me when I called because the box was broken and I couldnt access unit Owner was rude  irate and unorganized  Called me back hours later only to blame me for not accessing the unit  Called me a bitch and threatened me  Place is run down and entry box is broken  I took pictures so there is proof  I was never able to stay in the unit and lost money and had nowhere to stay for my sisters funeral 
658619177,A simple clean spot in the heart of Hyde Park with a walk to the lake that will help clear your mind  Very minimal space which I needed with a vintage feel  Perfect for what I needed to do  Thank you
653182904,     be aware it is next to a metro station  it is quiet enough where you cannot hear it  There needs to be an extensive cleaning before anyone is allowed to stay there  Covid isnt a joke  The cleaniness and condition was pathetic and dangerous with an  ongoing pandemic   Many of the photos showed furniture in good condition  When we arrived a chair was broken and hidden in the closet  We were also unaware the apartment was next to the train station   At first glance the apartment appears clean  but as soon as your shoes came off  you could feel the grittiness on the wooden floor  Many areas had not been swept  especially underneath the bed  In the kitchen hair was found INSIDE the refrigerator  Yuck  In the freezer  ice trays had a sticky coating on the edges  Two drawers had a pile of open and unopen candy in them  The horror continued as you reached for plates  silverware  or literally ANYTHING  Many of them had food particles on them   To make matters worse  you could see finger prints on many of surfaces  Moving towards the bedroom area  we found stains on the comforter as well as the mattress  We found hair in every single drawer in the bathroom along with a dirty sponge  There was not a surface  towel  or sheet that was not cleaned within the first    minutes of our stay  We are extremely disappointed considering there were plently of other options that offer extensive cleaning with covid  We should not have spent the first    minutes deep cleaning  An attempt to contact hosts with some issues was met with no response during stay  Although they were responsive prior to check in and with a refund for a night  The quality and condition of furniture left a distaste  There were many knicks in the walls  There was dust on the books and magazines left by the nightstand  Dishes and utensils needed extra cleaning and replacing 
634036427,This place was loud and felt uncomfortable  There was constant noise from other apartments and the hallway  as well as from inside the apartment  creaky floorboards and loud thuds from the air conditioner  Our sleep was so interrupted that it aided us in leaving a few days early   The apartment was not clean or stable  The decor was very cheap  A lamp fell out of the wall randomly one morning   Strangely enough  theres a garbage disposal but no switch to turn it on in plain sight  we checked everywhere  even in cabinets    The washing machine and dryer had missing knobs  rendering it hard to use and understand    Jacuzzi tub was amazing  The highlight of our stay    Property manager randomly stopped by to check our water heater  It put us in a very uncomfortable situation to allow a man we didnt know  and had no knowledge of  come inside of the apartment  This was an issue never addressed by the host  despite me sending multiple messages about it    Overall  very unwelcoming stay  but had the basics  Beds were fine  we washed the sheets and pillowcases after immediately noticing an odd smell to them  Towels and washcloths being provided was a plus  Basic dishes and utensils also provided   Much of the decor was cheap  the lamp fell out of the wall on our third day there  The washer and dryer has knobs pulled off rendering it hard to use   Luckily  the place was equipped with some cleaning tools because we swept and vacuumed the floors of all of the rooms  accumulating dust piles everywhere  Surfaces in living room and kitchen were sticky  Pillowcases had an odd smell  The host was very slow to respond  I often had to send follow up messages for simple requests such as   Where could I put the trash   Two inquires of mine were never addressed 
633661474,Clean  Super cute   Convenient   Coffee was a delightful treat   but creamers were all spoiled  I mentioned it in a message but you may want to let whoever does the cleaning now to not put them out any longer  Was told free street parking wasn u    t available but it is available  So I purchased a spot in the suggested app   was charged     for an unneeded spot   Had to shake out bedding b c of long black hairs and all over bathroom too 
659100650,The stay was pretty good  However  Ive had smoother checkins  Location was great  The keypad wasnt accepting the access code   However   Zencity customer service was very helpful 
578045801,Stylish space  close to downtown  Only negative  bathroom wasnt thoroughly cleaned 
631241293,The place is very stylish
517624177,Fine place   A few issues but were resolved quickly   Liked the location a lot  I appreciate your quick response to the mold issue in the air conditioning unit   I would have followed up after someone came in to clean to acknowledge the issue and assure us it would not happen again   Just so we could have recommended to others without any reservations etc

631541148,The stay itself was great  I love loved the living room decor and the kitchen  The kitchen wear was very suitable  I love to cook so it felt nice not being forced to order fast food  The apartment was close to everything I wanted to get to  I only left in my car once my entire stay  Other than that I didnt move my car   My only qualm about my stay was some cleanliness issues and repairs  That is the only reason I rated my stay so low  I truly wanted to give ZenCity a   star rating    All in all the living room and kitchen were to die for  Thats definitely where I spent most of my time  I also appreciated how quick their communication was  None of my answers went unnoticed  The apartment over all was very well put together  I loved the living room furniture  the kitchen and the pillows on the bed were amazing  however  I could not get over the bathrooms cleanliness and blinds off of the kitchen   The bathroom appeared to be clean  and unfortunately I didnt get a picture because when I walked in I immediately needed to use the restroom  but the toilet had dried urine all over it  There was urine splattered all over the seat as if it had been there for quite a while  no exaggeration  Also with everything going on in the world it made me question the rest of the cleanliness of the apartment   The blinds really need to be replaced  There were many missing and it made it very bright in the apartment and not the best privacy  It made walking past it as workers work across the way a little uneasy   The over all stay was okay  maybe a little better than okay  Im not certain Ill come back unless these issues are prohibited  Again it was a beautiful living area  I loved lovvvved how it was so close to everything I wanted to be close to and your communication was amazing   If youd like to reach out to me about further details from my stay please feel free to contact me   Kind regards  Dalvonda Better cleanliness  
627483199,This location is GORGEOUS  Truly stunning  well staged in a great building   However  getting into the building is a formidable challenge at best  If you arrive late on a weekend be prepared to park on the street if you can find parking as this location is downtown  You must then enter into a garage and then get keys from a box and then trek through an office building to correct elevator banks   The biggest issue was that our unit was DIRTY  I sent pictures and contacted someone and was told it would be cleaned and it never was  I was then told I could not have a refund on the cleaning fee as I had to clean Urine and fecal matter off both the toilets  change the sheets  clean the counter tops and after that I gave up  The showers were dirty  long hair everywhere  It was just dirty  point blank period   The fan in the guest bathroom never turned off and rattled like it was going to project itself out of the ceiling at any point    I received a text about the tv being too loud before the cleaning issue was addressed and thats unacceptable    The staff with Zencity was friendly  and one gentleman helped me with the key situation so I was appreciative of that  Im disappointed that no one came to clean while I was there  Nor is the cleaning fee being refunded as I had to clean myself    The space is stunning and worth the price  if it was clean  It was literally like Fort Knox getting into this building  Super secure but took Atleast    minutes initially due to difficult lockers There was urine and fecal matter on both of the toilets  The counters in the kitchen werent clean  there was hair all over the bathroom floors and shower  The sheets and comforters were dirty  The couch had stains  we were given dirty towels 
650624906,My initial experience was quiet pleasant  The apartment was nice and neat  The location was convenient as well  most restaurants were in the area  Checking in was easy and it was great using the gym in the unit  Unfortunately  the microwave was dirty which caused me to not use it at all and after a couple of days of staying there  Ive encountered another issue related to the cleanliness of the apartment  As a result  I no longer wanted to spend the rest of my stay there    I contacted the host immediately and left a couple of voicemail messages  It took about     hours for the host to return my calls  He was respectful and great as far as listening to my concerns  He assured me that he would have a cleaning crew come in and assess the situation  My guest and I were greatly accommodated with a new apartment for the night  However  I had   more days left to my visit and there was a lack of communication when it came to what the host planned for the rest of my stay as the apartment that I was allowed to stay in for the night was recently booked for the next couple of days    I admit that things happen that may be out of ones control   the host did the best he could given the circumstances  I received a refund for the remainder of my stay  the process was very smooth  The second apartment is similar to the first and it was clean and nice as well  I appreciate how great you were considering the circumstances 
630828152,I cannot recommend using Zencity  I wanted to like the place at      Blackstone  The location is great   But it was also really surprisingly dirty  Too  I called to request an early departure following the contract rules exactly  I was told to expect an email and all I needed to do was click the changes for a partial refund  No email ever came  No one returned my calls   Honestly  I dont think folks on the corporate end of the Zencity brand are paying attention  Thus their poor Google review status   You are taking a risk by booking with them   Airbnb should remove them as an option  If it was easier to communicate with Zencity and if they were more on top of the overall customer experience   which they claim on their website   these properties would be great  This one in particular needs a deep cleaning   Communication with host was challenging  Photos were accurate about the layout but the apt was alot more worn and stained than presented   I was stunned at how dirty the apt was  Food stuck to counter tops  dirt hair in floor corners  shower needed a good cleaning  I had to really scrub the bathroom and kitchen  I really wanted to like this place 
658719303,This was a pretty unit in a busy area  Will be looking this up again next time Im in the area  Thanks for quickly accommodating for us   Looked like the unit would have balcony  but it did not  
672974944,The place was comfortable for one person not two and if your not from here its in a bad area The place was comfortable for one person not two The key was not in the box we had to go through a whole thing just to check in
659090502,There are better places in the area for the cost   It was not kept up like shown in the pictures   Overall OK   I wont book with Zencity again  but will go local  You need to send a worker in to fix things up  replace light bulbs  and do regular maintenance floors were dirty
634034966,great area and spacious loft  It was hair all on the pillows and sheets  The floor had not been swept or vacuumed throughout  the loft the fridge was pretty dirty as well as the balcony with cigarette butts
629902673,While this place had a very cool vibe there were some issues that I feel people should know about  One of the toilets was clogged for   days   The plumber came the first day and said he had to have another plumber come to use a snake   Then I heard from no one for another day   I sent several messages to Zencity with no response for    hours or more   He finally came the third morning I was here and he had a plunger   no snake   He fixed the toilet in   minutes     There was a party on one night next door that was so loud I could not sleep   Loud music and loud bass with over       people   If you are looking for a relaxing  quiet place this is not the place   Zencity said they would call in a noise violation around midnight   The party ended around           am   The ad says black out blinds and drapes but the blinds are clearly not black out   There are black out draperies on some windows but not all of them   The tracks are there for all windows but it appears many have been removed and never replaced  The draperies are black out but the blinds are not   Clearly bright street lights come in these large windows at night and bright sun in the mornings      The place  while having a very cool vibe  has not been kept up very well in my opinion   There are lots of burnt out light bulbs and cracked mirrors on the bedroom closet doors and a broken chair    I did ask for a refund for a part of my   day stay there due to these issues and didnt ever get a response to that    This was only my second time using Airbnb and the experience was just ok   The ad says black out blinds and drapes but the blinds are clearly not black out and the blinds dont match   some being really cheap mini blinds   There are not draperies on every window just some    I was wondering why have them at all if they are not going to be on all windows  The tracks were there on each window so it appeared they had once been there and some had been removed  The drapery are black out but the blinds are not   Clearly bright street lights come in these large windows at night and bright sun in the mornings   The place  while having a very cool vibe  it has not been kept up very well   There are lots of burnt out light bulbs and cracked mirrors in bedroom closet doors and a broken chair   Just needs some attention and it would be fine   Dishwasher also was not attached in place very well and needs a few screws to fasten it to the countertop so it does not tip out when you load it  One Toilet was clogged for   days   the cleaning person told me as I entered the space   The plumber came the first day and said he had to have another plumber come to use a snake   Then I heard from no one for   more day  including sending messages to Zencity with no response for    hours or more   He finally came the third morning I was here and he had a plunger   no snake   He fixed the toilet in   minutes   It didnt take long to fix so not sure why it took so long for him to get there the second time  If you are looking for a quiet place do not book this  There was a party on one night next door that was so loud I could not sleep   Loud music and loud bass with over       people  Zencity did say they would call into the management to report a noise violation once I called them around midnight   The noise finally died down around          am    Again  cool vibe but not sure about the host as they sometime responded but often were very slow in responding   waiting    hours for a response is too long in my opinion   I did ask for a refund of some of my money for all of these issues and never heard back from anyone about that 
629919820,This place was good for the price   Not somewhere I would stay if you are expecting the host to go above and beyond with the details   It was a very minimal place   Something I didnt think about when I booked it was the noise from the outside   During the day it was fine  but at night all the street racers must have come out because there were loud engine noises until about  am    Some of the cars outside had music so loud that it sounded like it was coming from inside the apartment   Overall  it was a good stay  but there were definitely a few extra touches that would have been nice like a coffee maker or some kitchen towels   There arent many dishes provided so it was nice to have the dishwasher   Same with the in unit laundry as there arent many towels or wash cloths provided   It is a fun and happening area if youre looking to take a little stroll and get some good food   No coffee maker   There was only a french press  
647032135,Overall great
634267441,Great spot
656084140,Great location  Everything was less than a    minute drive away  Street parking wasnt hard to find  The Airbnb itself was extremely clean  but the apartment complex its located in could definitely up its cleanliness  The room itself was clean  but the apartment complex was dirty  The features offered were not accessible  pool  rooftop   The common areas of the apartment were dirty 
624619388,Id recommend for the value Over all it was great just irritated about having to stand outside for    mins trying to figure out how to get in  And the smell was weird The speaker was broken so we could not get into the building  Even if it was working you need the key fob that is in the room to make the elevators work  A security fairs had to assist us  Thankfully he was there It smelled like stale cigarette or stale weed smoke in there
713114362,Not bad    Cigarette smoke all throughout the apartment
634015917,Its mostly an OK place  but the WiFi was spotty when we were there and the bathroom door knob fell off from the outside and often trapped one of us in there until the other could fix the door from the other side   The bathroom door needs repairs as the knob falls off from the outside frequently  The person I picked up the key from didnt have my name on their list The bathroom door not being broken  also the WiFi was spotty and the place smelled like cigarettes
634601959,As advertised in the pictures   Great location and it is really close to the     which was a huge plus for us  Thanks   All went smoothly
646715762,I loved this place  It is a very nice place and it is in the perfect location  Didnt get to enjoy the patio as much because of the rain but it still was a nice place to stay for   days  Also  the host was great at responding to any questions I had about the place  The set up is very nice and the space is huge  I would most definitely recommend this location  Thank you for allowing me to rent your space 
634579450,N a
658523246,There were a  multitude of issues that werent addressed  First and foremost  this place is advertised with AC but that is not the case  The unit in the living room is so tiny  it doesnt even cool off the living room and attached kitchen adequately  When I brought this up  I was told by Zencity that they would have maintenance come and install at least   AC unit  if not   in the two bedrooms  The way the place is set up  the bedrooms are down a hallway from the living area   there is no way in hell this tiny unit would be able to cool the bedrooms  The towel rack was broken  They said maintenance would also fix that  MAINTENANCE NEVER CAME  We slept on the floor of the living room because the bedrooms were so hot  Which caused me to have neck and back pain  Its one thing to have an issue  its another to make promises and not deliver  They also said that there was a fan in the closet   there was no fan when we got home on Friday night  We found   blood stains on the rug and a used condom wrapper on the floor of one bedroom  We had issues checking in as there was no key to the building in the lockbox nor instructions on the alternate way of getting into the building  Also  after sleeping on the floor and picking up the comforter to clean up the space  it was filthy underneath  I dont think the floor has been vacuumed in some time which made me even more nervous because of covid  While they were timely in their responses to my concerns  none of them were actually fixed  Their solution was to let us leave on Saturday and get a small refund  not even     saying it didnt  seem like a good match   We were there for a funeral and did not have the time or the mental space to search for another place and move all of our things  This is the first time Ive had a negative experience with Airbnb  I still love Airbnb but definitely not this place  You need to get your stuff together  One problem after another  that you did not address  You made promises that were not kept  Im very disappointed   There is a tiny AC unit in the living room that was so small and weak  it did not even cool the living room and attached kitchen adequately  The way the space is set up  the two bedrooms are down the hall from the living room   there is NO WAY even a high end AC unit would be able to get to them  When I called about it  I was told that maintenance would come and install at least   unit  if not   in each of the bedrooms  Maintenance never came  I was told via messenger that there was a fan in the closet that we could certainly use and when I returned  there was no fan either  Maintenance did not come on Friday when we checked in nor Saturday  I did not sleep well either night as we slept on the floor   and in fact  had neck and back pain   There was no key to the building front door in the lockbox  There were detailed instructions on getting the key to getting in the front door to actually getting inside the unit  But there was no key to the front door  I re read the instructions a few times and finally called ZenCity  I was told the  code  to get into the building after waiting on hold and waiting in the heat outside  If their instructions were so detailed  why werent they updated in the instructions  They later told me that the last tenant  took the key   I dont believe that for a minute  We found a used condom wrapper on the floor of one of the bedrooms  Because the AC didnt work  we slept on the floor in the living room and when I picked up the comforter  it was filthy on the bottom which means it hadnt been vacuumed in some time  This of course  is a concern during the time of covid  We found   blood stains on the carpet in the living room  the towel rack in the bathroom fell off when we put a towel on it  Communication was good and somewhat timely but it was all lies  They promised maintenance would come with   AC units and would fix the towel rack  That never happened  Its one thing to have issues which can happen  its another to make promises and not deliver on said issues  Its completely unprofessional  If you advertise AC  then there should be adequate AC which there wasnt  Every host should be cleaning more than thoroughly with covid in the air  If there is a problem  fix it   they just made a bunch of empty promises  This was the worst Airbnb experience Ive ever had  Truly disappointed  The  solution  they had was attempt to kick us out on Saturday before our departing day of Sunday  saying  it wasnt a good fit   We were there for a funeral   there was no time or energy to look for a new place and move all of our things in between going to the wake and funeral  How about you just deliver on what you promise  I believe we should get a     refund for the problems we had   Airbnb was not helpful either 
717406729,Good stay
631152930,This has the perfect location and view   Parking is a hassle but theres decent parking nearby   Theres water damage in the bathroom ceiling over the shower and ceiling pieces chipping away which was the only real damage in the unit   Overall I was pleased but it wasnt as high quality as I expected for where its located and how the pictures looked  I would have appreciated better communication about how I was charged after the fact   Ill always pay for anything that is my fault but I asked for a call and didnt get one   The space was very nice and simple  however not nearly as high quality as the photos portray   Before my stay the response time was fantastic  after the stay I was charged for dirty towels  which is what I thought the towels are for    and I asked to speak on the phone with someone and never was called   Also  I left my laptop and had to ask three times what time I could pick it up over a    hour time period I believe 
673434796,The good  bad and ugly  Location is great  the apt is run down and not stocked up at all  Listing says quiet time after   pm and yes  there is a bar downstairs bit its more of a club   Loud music banging the apt till  am almost every night  Good luck sleeping  Not bar downstairs  its a club  Goes almost   nights till  am  Good luck sleeping 
672634697,Great place and location  The space was very clean and the unit has a lot of nice appliances as well as a smart TV  Only issues we had during our stay was the construction in the building and a few minor quirks in the unit such as the glass shower door being difficult to open  I would be happy to stay here again 
707656950,The apartment is really well located  have all you need for a short or long term  stay  has a nice view  the bed is really comfortable  the wifi works perfect if you need to work  Thank you so much  The place is really lovely  clean and well located  Just as a suggestion  the instructions about the parking lot are missing and should be included in the first email within the check in instructions  The information about the parking lot are not clear
627690286,Really close to the Belmont station  Enjoyed the place had a washer and dryer and well  The balcony was a nice addition  Enjoyed our stay glad we were there for the cleaning lady  Thanks again
627129594,When arriving to the apartment I noticed the floors were very sticky so I took it upon myself to sweep and mop  The mop water came out brown  There was also hair that was not mine in the bed  This was disappointing since I had messaged the host requesting an early check in but was told no because the place needed to be cleaned but I arrived to a not clean place  Other than that it wasnt too bad 
702379684,A very cute place to stay Great just the problems in the beginning
712309811,It was a great place to stay for thanksgiving 
709639494,This was a great place for our one night stay  Located right in downtown  Apartment was clean and spacious  Great for a couple spending a night or two in town 
645906629,Nice property  Place was exactly what I expected  Had minor check in issues but was resolved quick  Will stay again if visit at Louis again  Pin pad wasnt working  but host fixed the problem quick  Shower curtain was dirty 
633642886,The place was nice and clean but while checking in I had difficulties getting the key out the locke box   st the code didnt work  Then I call them and they provided me a new code then come to find out the key wasnt there and I was told the key will be in the room  the housekeeper had the key the whole time  Basically the whole check in time was really inconvenient and took time out of what I was there for   The number to the key box didnt work  Then the key wasnt in the key box  The whole time the housekeeper had it  The number to key box provided didnt work and key wasnt in there
672631877,Very quiet building and easy access to all of downtown  Nice pub downstairs and nice coffee shop and restaurants within a block  Parking super easy with several street level lots within a block or so  I recommend this space    The description and another unit in the buildings photos showed a nice rooftop terrace  None was to be found   photos are designed to make places look better than they are  so i get that  the space was nice  but it was expected the photos were even nicer  not a complaint 
635017522,Central to plaza and downtown   Parking may be an issue  If more than   adults are staying    key is not enough and certainly there should be   bath towels per person   Spot hero and the other parking app had no parking availability n parking was an issue     adults checked in on Friday only   bath towels and   key for the unit messages host but did not get a response until Monday  Host stated they would bring towels n key but never did   We had to go buy towels  Having bath towels
632270790,Ive stayed at this apartment   times   its a cute space and very comfortable  The bed is perfect  the amenities are nice  The kitchen is very bare bones  so bring anything you need including paper towels  Parking is on the street but is easy to manage  just make sure to clear out your car of any bags  cash  electronics  chargers  etc for urban street parking considerations so nothing gets stolen    Would book again  Hi  This was my third stay at this same apartment in the last month and its been a little worse every time  Less clean  fewer amenities    not sure if your cleaner needs to review practices  but in the covid era cleaning should be the top priority  Under couch was not vacuumed  Lots of food crumbs I requested towels  they never came 
512688252,First the good  this house is in a great neighborhood   Lots of restaurants and things to do   The apartment also has three large bedrooms   However  the unit is not well maintained   First  the unit does not have its own internet router   The internet is taken from a business on the first floor  the unit is on the third floor    The reception was so weak we could not connect our devices   Even worse  the TV is on a sling  so the TV did not work because the internet did not work   Other problems  when we arrived the deadlock was exposed  in other words the steel plate was not installed  which I imagine is a security problem  though Im no expert   The overhead light did not work in the living room and a light was burned out in one of the living room   Maybe the worst is that the host simply did not respond when I pointed out the internet problem  I didnt even bother raising the other issues    Basically  this place had the potential to be great  but mismanagement made it a disappointment for me and my friends   This apartment does not have its own Internet   It uses it from a business located on the first floor  but the apartment was on the third floor  and the reception was terrible   The TV had sling  not cable  so the apartment was without internet and without cable the entire stay   We only got the code when I specifically asked a couple hours prior to check in  The host did not respond when I pointed out that there was no Internet and no cable  actually having the amenities posted 
499536842,This is a great place and location  Especially for the price  Zencity was a great host and they responded quickly when we had questions  The only issue was that the wifi is really slow at night so you cant stream tv shows movies online  Also  the bathroom does have a bad smell coming from the drain  but it goes away when the water is running  Other than that  the place is clean and stocked with nice amenities  Thanks Zencity for being a good host  The only things I want to mention is that the drains in the bathroom give off a really bad smell and it would not go away   Also  the Wifi is very slow at night when multiple users are on the network  I messaged Zencity about the wifi and the people I talked to thought the router was in the room but it wasnt  It seems like there are multiple routers in the building but they all get busy at night so we cant stream anything or load webpages  In the morning  it works alright  I would suggest having more routers in the building 
709740838,Great space and close to hospital
627465640,Nice amenities  clean and neat  Though host was unresponsive regarding emergency situation  No response regarding emergency
668681230,Great location  clean place  will definitely book again when visiting Chicago 
633054399,Thank you   Thank you   sofa
653501835,Great location  Need some updating  Dear Zencity Team  as per my text messages  you should fix the apartment first  paint the walls  fix the oven  change the carpet to finish the strong smell of cigarette  and really deep clean it  The location is great and you guys have a great customer service  The apartment as is now  is damaging your business   The photos were not from the same apartment  There was a picture from a kitchen with white tiles and a kitchen table  The kitchen was brown and no table at all  The oven was not working   I shared pictures with Zencity Team to show that the place was not clean to the standards necessary during the times that we live in  COVID      The worst place was the bathroom  However  the entire apartment needed a deep cleaning  Location was great  When I arrived and was disappointed with the condition of the apartment  the staff from Zencity was very responsive and accommodating Pictures need to reflect the reality  The place needs to be deep cleaned  There is a strong smell of cigarette that the Zencity Team needs to fix it 
498302835,Nice unit in a great area  Was perfect for what we needed for a wedding we were attending in the area  Thanks for having us  We had a great weekend   Only suggestion I have is that the place was extremely hot  maybe a better AC unit  Not your fault though  hottest July on record  A better AC unit or an additional one in the bedroom  A nicer couch 
497667897,Zencity messaged me before check out asking me to write a   star review  I dont think a host should prompt the guest to give a perfect rating  I think this place is  okay  but theres nothing exceptional about it  And given the price  I think it should be exceptional  But if it werent for that message I would probably be giving a   star review out of courtesy  I just dont think it was worth the price  It was quite expensive for a studio apartment 
497590182,The location is amazing  Its so quiet and ducked off  Beautiful area and peaceful  Love love the place but beware of security alarm going off if you dont unlock it correctly or try to check and make sure its locked  More clear instructions on how to work the lock and securing the lock  Every single time we tried to step out or make sure the door was locked  the security alarm went off and would not go off no matter how many times we put in the code  Very annoying for us and probably other guest 
633864777,It is a gorgeous  decked out apartment that comes fully loaded with dishes and appliances  a hot tub  gym  and beautiful view  Thank you for being a great host  Ps  It was really cold during the stay but the thermostat had a   digit pin to it so maybe next time  that pin could be nearby  Other than that absolutely Gorgeous apartment home and decor  Directions did not make since  Where it telling you to enter the door  walk up the stair  then enter the next door  The next door was locked and it was no information on how to gain access to it  However m  after about    mins of walking around  we figured Out another way to go  Leaks in the roof 
624831444,More like a hotel than a lived in apartment  decently clean  secure building  right downtown area  Would stay again  Thank you  Couldnt figure how to get into the building at first  it was late and the host didnt respond back  but the security guard let us in and helped us out 
631841518,The apartment overall was nicely decorated   very minimalist  but all you need for a few day stay  Its in an apartment building so youre among other tenants  just an FYI   Check in was easy  You also have access to the apartment building amenities  which was a nice bonus  although they were a bit dated and dirty  mainly fitness center   Location was nice   right next to Forest Park and close to lots of restaurants and a Whole Foods  Here comes to bad   the place looked like it hadnt been cleaned  particularly vacuumed in weeks   The floors were covered in dust dirt hairs  especially gross in the bathroom   to the point where I had to whip out the vacuum they had stored in the closet and clean it myself the first night just to feel clean enough walking around  The apartment is a bit old  which is fine  but the bathroom could use a bit of a facelift renovation  We were in town briefly for a funeral and were not expecting needing anything too high end  but this even grossed out my husband  who isnt the cleanest of people  I also sent a message to the host before we even arrived asking a question and never heard back  Had it not been for the affordable price  I probably wouldnt have given it   stars   The place overall was nice upon first glance  nicely decorated in a minimalist style  The only thing that caught me off guard  aside from the cleanliness  was the bathroom that definitely needs a good upgrade   The entire apartment looked like it hadnt been vacuumed in weeks  The bathroom was particularly dirty  but the floors throughout were covered in dirt dust hairs and it was pretty gross  I had to bust out the vacuum that was stashed away in the closet the night we got there just to feel OK walking around  One of the blankets provided also smelled so bad we couldnt use it when sitting on the sofa  I sent a message to the host before we ever arrived and I never heard back  If the place has actually been thoroughly cleaned before we arrived 
635512070,Pending    Follow up contact was less than desirable 
500081068,Wonderful stay  Thanks for everything  The bed in    isnt extremely comfy 
672956622,Great location for a studio apartment right next to the the L Train in the heart of Boystown and right near Wrigleyville  Secure  with lots of easy parking and dining options nearby  Overall  this was about perfect for what we needed  Was simply disappointed when I sent pictures of how the cleaning crew completely missed dried vomit underneath the toilet seat and around the toilet and received zero response  We didnt realize it until the  nd day  but the nightstand next to the bed was also covered in a sticky substance  likely spilled clear soda  but who knows   The rest of the place was quite clean  but these two issues should have been caught by the cleaning crew  The cleanliness issues were never responded to  while other issues were responded to immediately 
671230159,Great location  Unfortunately there was a strong scent of smoke in the unit which was extremely hard to mask with candles  It was not pleasant to arrive to  The only thing that kept this from being better thank expected was the smell  When we entered on Thursday there was an intense smell of smoke  It was in every room and could smell it in the sheets  Seemed as though someone had been smoking in the unit prior to our arrival  We bought several candles on Friday to mask the scent for the weekend  The place fit our needs but the stench was unfortunate 
306355579,We had a great time at Brians place for a guys weekend  The place was perfect size for    guys that stayed here  Brian was nice enough to let us check into the front condo and hour early while they finished cleaning the back condo  Brian was also very up front with me about some issues and things that were broken by the group before us  They did a great job not only fixing what the previous group broke but also getting the place clean in a short amount of time  Only have a few complaints  first is that it would have been nice to have more than one pool stick  Out of all of them only one wasnt broken  The second is it would have been nice to have cable in the back condo living room like there was in the front condo  I mentioned this to Brian and he already said hes getting it resolved  Would definitely recommend staying here and enjoying Chicago   Thanks again for having us  I appreciate you letting us check in early  I also appreciate you being up front with us and letting us know about all of the issues that the group before us left  Overall we had a great time  I hope we didnt leave to much of a mess  We all woke up really late and didnt have time to clean as much as we would have liked to    The group before us was not kind to the place and left several things broken  Brian was very up front about all of these issues before we got to the place    Overall very clean place   Brian was very up front with me in regards to the status of the place  The people that had the spot before use left several things broken  Brian did his best to correct these issues on short notice   The place had a great location and fit the group we had perfect  As mentioned there were several things wrong with the place due to the group before us  Kind of reduced the overall value of the place  Again Brian did his best to accommodate us for these issues  
272530466,Brian was a great host as he responded very  very fast and ensured that everything would be set up when we arrived  He informed us on the status of the cleaner and was very timely   The space is large and fits everyone very comfortably  The living room area is a great space to hangout and everyone has a place to sleep  Some of the furniture  particularly the chairs in the dining room were not very sturdy  Brian mentioned that someone damaged them and he fixed them  which was awesome  but some felt very frail and we were scared to sit on them for fear of breaking them  Overall  we never felt cramped   There are very few cooking utensils if you are planning to cook  Having a house full of girls  we were planning on making breakfast to save some money  however there were only   pots and no pans to prep food with  There were some utensils to eat with but we purchased a lot of disposable plates silverware previously  The refrigerator is not yet hooked up with water or ice so you need to get ice beforehand  The nearby gas station was closed so it might be a trek to get ice  There was coffee though  always a plus   The location is pretty far out from downtown  about       minutes from where our group went out  Despite being a bit of a trek  the area felt safe and parking was easy to find   Overall it was a great stay and was very easy to check in and out of  Thank you very much for having us  The only thing I would recommend would be to set up the fridge with water and ice and eventually get a pan or two  but I know the place is still new  I would also suggest getting a few more towels  Thanks again   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  Additional comments   u   cThere are very few cooking utensils if you are planning to cook  Having a house full of girls  we were planning on making breakfast to save some money  however there were only   pots and no pans to prep food with  There was coffee though  The refrigerator u   d    The location is pretty far out from downtown  about       minutes from where our group went out  Despite being a bit of a trek  the area felt safe and parking was easy to find    The space is large and fits everyone very comfortably  The living room area is a great space to hangout and everyone has a place to sleep  Some of the furniture  particularly the chairs in the dining room were not very sturdy  Brian mentioned that someone 
338163878,Great apartment in the best location close to shops  cafes  restaurants   transport what more could you ask for  Thank you for the stay  the only problem was the shower      just a bit hard to turn on  and not that hot
636240461,great stay once again carpet was not too clean
646404430,I really wanted to give this spot a   star rating  The cleanliness was there  the space was nicely lit up with natural lighting and overall was a great stay   My issues lied within check in mainly  There was a passcode given to enter the main building and elevator  this enables you to enter floor of apartment stay   The passcode given did not work and it took us over an hour before a resident of the building saw our struggle and allowed us entry into the elevator  I was never replied back to by anyone from Zencity which really made for a rough start to our stay  Another small issue that arose on our last night was someone parked in our reserved space and Zencitys response to that was to park on the street  It was free but a bit inconvenient with all the construction happening and just loss of security we felt with having our rental in a garage vs street parking  Plus the reserved parking is part of the price paid with this space   Last note is be prepared to bring your own everything in regards to foods drinks snacks  Example is theres a coffee maker with no coffee to make   Overall  this was an awesome stay once we got in and settled  My girlfriend and I enjoyed our time very much  It was super close to all the good things KC has to offer  The bathroom and shower were super nice  Cool little balcony to have morning coffee or late night digs   Really hope this review helps with your future stay  I really enjoyed the space a lot  It was super clean and very nice to be in for the the few days we were there  My issues fell with the entry code to the main building door not working and no one getting back to me caused for an hour of time to pass before someone let us into the building seeing our struggles in the rain 
636578075,This was a nice place to stay  Zencity fails to disappoint  This was a new unit and doesnt have a garbage disposal nor wifi working yet it was still a comfortable stay for a reasonable price  If the pictures were accurate  the wifi worked  and it had a garbage disposal 
635990072,The first night the smoke alarm kept going off every    seconds  They couldnt get maintenance out to fix it that night so it was hard to sleep there the first night  However  it was fixed the next day  Within walking distance of several restaurants  Baileys  Roosters  Imos are a few we walked to  and a grocery store  There are two parking areas to park nearby  The WiFi that was given to us didnt work so we had to get the info off the router  Overall good experience  Spacious and comfy 
608409101,This is definitely a business  not a home  Outstanding price  Great bedrooms  Would be great if you could park in the front of the building  Tricky to enter if you park in the back of the building  Your renter should have a key that unlocks the back door in the case that they are parked behind the building so that they dont have to climb over things to get to the front door  Also  there is some sort of noise coming from the walls at night that makes it difficult to sleep   Also  the shower near the back of the apartment is poorly designed  One has to stand in the shower to turn it on  so it sprays cold water on you  No one was able to use that shower for that reason  I purchased a parking spot in the back of the building  which meant that I had to climb over a fence in order to get to the lock box to retrieve the key  Everyone in my party had to climb over a stoop wall to get to the front door from behind the building   This happened every time that we entered or exited  The solution would have been to have a parking spot in the front of the building 
633015624,I would never suggest booking with this host  They are very dishonest and will not respond to legit concerns  Our place did not have lights in the bathroom for   days  They never came out to fix it  We had to use our phones as flashlights to shower  They told us that it was not an emergency  Who does that   There was only one set of towels for   adults  Our reservation got changed a day before we came into town  I tried reaching out to the host only to be ignored  They are very shady and I will never stay at their properties in the future  They ruined my first time in St  Louis  Also the photos that they post is all smoke and mirrors  The place is sooooo much smaller than the pictures depict  Cheaply made furniture and there was damage to the property as soon as we got there  The bathroom had a dirty tub and dried up poop stuck on the toilet  Renters Beware     You guys suck  You ruined me and my friends first visit to St  Louis  I will never be back  I hope you all are happy with my hard earned money  Businesses like yours will never prosper because all you care about is money and not the actual person  I saved up for months for this trip just to have it ruined  I hope you can sleep well at night knowing how you operate your business   Our booking got switched the day we came into town  This was not our original booking  They moved us from the heart of downtown to the   Hood    They would not respond to any messages about the mix up  We were forced to stay there because they only wanted to refund less than half of our money  I will definitely be contacting the Better Business Bureau about this host and Air B B   There was dried up hard poop in the toilet that must have been there a while  The tub was dirty as well  We actually had to go out and buy tissue paper as well as extra towels  We had no lights in the bathroom for three days  They told us that it was not an emergency and that they wouldnt be able to fix it  We had to shower and get dressed using our phones as flashlights  I was hosting this trip for my friends  can you imagine how embarrassing this whole experience was    The placed us in a bad neighborhood  This was not the original listing that I signed up for  I paid almost      to stay   days in a cramped  dirty  dark apartment  I will never rent with Zencity again  I took so many pictures to back up what took place  I also have every screenshot from the constant contact that I tried to make with the host  Very unprofessional and dismissive 
715607962,It was a great spot for a weekend stay  Parking was a bit crowded but not horrible  The place was in great location to everything and was very professional  Definitely would visit again Thank you for an awesome stay 
663975444,Cozy spot for a little weekend getaway  Clean  neat  and easy to find  Finding something to do is easy in the area  and the host is quick to answer questions The apartment is cozy and awesome  I love how close it is to downtown things to do  Only issues I really had were that there were no garbage bags for the kitchen area  Otherwise  our stay was perfect    Keypad access code system was faulty  Had to call host because we couldnt get In on our arrival Theres no where to park which would have been nice to know ahead of time  As would a list of potential places to park  I spent more on parking over the course of   days than I ever would have considered had I known before hand
636197775,Lovely stay
617631924,This exceeded our expectations  with only one minor complaint  The location was great  Gated parking was a huge plus  The building was well secure and very nice to stay in  The space itself was extremely nice and truthfully the pictures do not do it justice  Everything you need to wash clothes  cook meals  do dishes  or just enjoy yourself in the room   We enjoyed our stay and will for sure book again  The only complaint we had was at times it can be difficult to communicate with the host  For example  there were no instructions for checking out  except where we needed to leave the keys  so we asked what they would like us to do with towels and sheets and the response told us we could not check out late  Not really sure where that came from  About half an hour after our checkout time I received an email with some reminders regarding checkout but still nothing about how to leave the unit before checking out  Other than that  which was minor  we had a great stay and will book again when we are in St  Louis  Highly recommend  The first time we had a question  the answer was quick and useful  However  after that when we had questions  answers did not follow correctly or answer the question asked 
179010214,The apt was great with a contemporary feel  There is minor work required in the area downstairs where one is entering the building  The neighborhood is a quiet residential with easy access to bars or an entertainment area  Access to downtown Chicago was at most    mins by car  Parking was always pretty easy to find wether it was night or day  There was a little issue with the cable but the host was responsive and had it resolved over   days   Overall  I was satisfied both with my stay and interactions with the host  Minor updates required on the building but the apartment itself was great  I would recommend a stay here  Would be good is dishwashing liquid  hand soap and something to clean the floors during ones stay was available  There is also water leaking from upstairs to the main entryway  directly above the entryway is the  nd floor front bathroom   The entry stairs need to be in better order  Overall the premises was great and it seems like a work in progress
673964045,Great stay Nice place  could use a foot rest for couch 
650181532,This garden level apartment is located in a great neighborhood   convenient to public transportation  easy to park with the ParkChicago app   Lots of food options within walking distance  and Humboldt Park where you can hang out in good weather   Check in was SUPER easy  simple   excellent directions through the airbnb app   Communication with staff was quick and easy on week days  less so on week ends   The unit is very clean  photos are exact   The bathroom is well appointed  washer and dryer in easy access space   My only disappointment   I was attracted to the description of the kitchen    We dont like to brag  but the kitchen in this spacious two bedroom is pret ty nice    It is as pictured   good looking with new appliances   Not well furnished  though   dont plan to do any more than basic cooking    We arrived to no coffee maker pot  but it turned out the French press had walked off         The unit was surprisingly quiet at night  in spite of being on Division St    We werent there during the day  cant comment   Great location for food and local color  nice and clean   Very nice bedding   comfortable beds  hotel style sheets and duvets   very comfortable  Maybe change the description of the kitchen   As of       it wasnt well furnished   Also  the towel racks were all ready to pull off the walls    Light bulbs needed for the four bedroom wall fixtures   Photos depicted the space appropriately   I was attracted to this listing by the description of the kitchen   It  is attractive and features new appliances  but it is poorly furnished   dont expect to do anything more than very basic cooking   In both requests for clarification before checking in and then for requests after arrival  it seems that there arent staff available on weekends  On Monday  communication was prompt 
635753423,This is a very stylish place  nice view in a nice area  Lots of good places to eat around  Unfortunately I had to give the place   stars because the only reason I chose this bnb to begin with is because they advertised a pool which I was disappointed to realize was not the truth upon arrival  Also  the screen door leading to the balcony was broken and maintenance came to fix it about halfway through the stay  I was unprepared for a visit and wouldve appreciated some type of notice  I would take  pool  out of the title to be more accurate  There is no pool  Had to wait downstairs for about    min before being let upstairs
712890974,My stay was ok  The kitchen in the apartment could have been cleaner but other than that no complaints   There were gnats in the apartment that were kind of annoying  Other than that the stay was ok   The dishes in the kitchen were dirty  I had to wash most of the dishes before i started cooking because i found food on several dishes  The space could have been cleaner thats pretty much the biggest feedback I would say 
607405331,This place has a lot of potential if they clean it up and get some better furnishings in it   The furniture thats in the picture isnt the same in some rooms   It needs a thorough cleaning  This was my first bad Airbnb experience  You have to do a better job at maintaining cleanliness  The furnishings need to be fixed and updated  This listing doesnt Have the same furnishings as the pictures   The places needs a thorough cleaning 
647032832,Place was nice and pretty much as expected based on the price  Place is great could but could use a fresh coat of paint and a new couch cover  Place overall was showing signs of wear  Bathrooms are great and exceptionally clean  Living room and other common spaces were a bit tired and needed a new coat of paint  Couch also has some staining and screens were full dead spiders  Questions about additional fob were not responded to 
618135094,The room was awesome  Clean and set up nicely   It took some effort to get to the room   Horrible instructions to get into building and to the room   I had to have another tenant of the building let me into the building  Then the elevator doesnt work without the fob   which is waiting in the room so had to take steps to get to room  At checkout    am  I enter the hallway where a woman is waiting and asks if Im checking out   I said yes and she said she has that room now    Note   She is going into room that hasnt been cleaned between guests   This was my first air bnb experience   I dont know if Ill do it again  The place was awesome  I just wish the instructions  were clear as to how to get into the place  Also someone came into the room when I was getting ready to leave at checkout time   Apparently she had rented the room for that day   When I left she was out in the hall and asked   Are you checking out     I said yes   And thought well shes walking into someplace that hasnt been cleaned between guests   I would have left if I were her   This was my first time doing this and it wasnt the best overall experience  You can do better   loved the room though  The instructions said to punch the apt   into keypad inside front doors to get into building   This didnt work   Someone let me in   Then to get to the floor of apt the elevator wouldnt work without the fob so had to take steps to get to room   None of this was explained   One to room I punched in code  got in and the fob is there   It shouldnt be like this  No real issues here other than unclear instructions Location
586216367,This is a very clean  well appointed apartment in a terrific location  However  there is significant renovation work happening in this building at the time of this review  Also  the soundproofing is pretty minimal   while in the bedroom  you can loudly hear anyone going up and down the stairs from one of the buildings entrances  If youre looking for a quiet place to stay  this might not be your best option in STL  On        the fire alarm went off in the building around   AM  A man who identified himself as a janitor said that it was set off by accident  Unfortunately  the fire alarm in the room was blaring loudly for almost    minutes  Between this and the significant renovation activity in the building  our stay wasnt as frictionless as we had hoped  I hope youll give future guests a clear heads up that this building is being actively renovated so they can decide whether its a good fit for their needs  Other than those issues  this is a beautiful apt  Hope this feedback is useful  thanks for hosting us  The building is undergoing renovations so the hallways were full of debris  nails  and construction materials  Its a beautiful apartment  but the soundproofing is an issue  Noises of other residents going up and down the stairs and the neighbors across the hall were really loud  particularly in the bedroom 
585298417,Great spot for a weekend in STL in a walkable  cute neighborhood  The apartment was perfect but the building is still being renovated so there is debris in the hallways  Otherwise the apartment was nicely decorated and we enjoyed our stay  Also  we were woken by the fire alarm at     am and decided to leave for the airport early  as it took almost    minutes for the fire department to arrive  During our last morning  the fire alarm was triggered throughout the entire building at      am  It was going off for    minutes before we just decided to pack the car and leave a few hours earlier than anticipated  In addition  the hallways were littered with construction materials  The shower was also extremely low pressure and I had to pay     to have my hair washed at a local barber shop  Thank you for understanding  We still have yet to hear back from the host 
633121009,Nice location and spacious layout  The place reeked Id smoke  there were bottle caps on the balcony  ash on the bedside table  and a condom wrapper on the floor  I requested money back but have yet to hear back from Zencity  Going to report to Airbnb if I do not hear back soon 
659943257,Nice apartments  Quiet and clean
651571418,I stayed at Zencitys Garment District unit over the course of a week  Echoing some earlier reviews  the apartment itself is great with high ceilings and modern touches  Though I didnt really use them  there are also large common spaces on each floor and an accessible pool  It was priced attractively too  With that said  there are a few disclaimers especially for those who will be working remote and or have a car     the Google Fiber plan that the unit is on is the basic   free  plan and only supports     Mbps speeds  which is too slow for any video conferencing if you happen to have any work meetings that you need to dial into and    parking is somewhat challenging and the closest garage that I could find was at   th and Wyandotte        min walk   which also costs     night  Zencity itself is not very responsive to any questions  mostly automated messages   but outside of this  I had a good stay  Just be aware of some of these tradeoffs   Google Fiber speed was only the basic plan    Mbps      Mbps   which was too slow to support video conferencing while working remotely  The parking situation was also pretty challenging in the neighborhood  you should be upfront about this rather than telling people to just check Spothero  there are no garages via app for nighttime use    No responses to my questions whatsoever   just automated replies  Better internet and improved parking situation  even guidance would have made this a lot easier  
618071503,Given that photos were not provided of this listing  the place was nicer than expected  I stayed in unit      it is a very spacious and large apartment for just one person  Theres a nice in unit laundry room  a large kitchen and living room area  walk in closet  big bedroom  and a nice balcony as well  There was a tv as well with a Netflix account provided by zencity  The location is great since its in the Plaza   all in all  it was a comfortable stay  However  I would caution prospective guests about the following   if you have a large car  parking will be difficult  It is provided free of charge in the building but it is a very tight spot  with a pole on one side and a usually large car on the other   which made parking an everyday nightmare for me  However  there is some street parking available too  I did have difficulty checking in  but by calling the number provided  it was sorted out quickly  The parking spot provided needs to be seriously re evaluated  There is a pole on one side and usually a very large car is packed  often outside of bounds  on the other side  This made the parking experience very difficulty and resulted in scratches on my car  It would also be helpful to have a much smaller code to enter the apartment since it needs to be entered every single time  Providing more dishes  like plates and glasses  would be very useful to people staying for a longer period of time  Decorating the place a bit more would be an additional nice touch  Beyond that  the apartment was nice   plenty of space  nice amenities  and good location  It was difficult to get into the building  The code intended to be used without the fob did not work  I had to wait for someone to let me into the building  The instructions were also not very detailed about using the pin pad to enter the apartment  The pin pad had to be tapped multiple times before it would respond  There was a bit of a smell in the entire apartment  especially in the kitchen area  It would have definitely been useful to add room freshners  There was very minimal communication and none at all once checked in  No checkout instructions were sent beforehand  These were only sent once I notified that I had already checked out 
634334623,Do not book  You will get a roulette of apartments none of which will be cleaned  Do yourself a favor  dont book with Zencity  Wow   This is not the unit I booked on air bnb  This is a false advertisement with no contact with the host what so ever   Pet hair and other hair all over the apartment including the bathroom and bed sheets  Microwave had red sauce splatter all over it 
625750853,Really nice apartment with modern interior and everything you ll need for a comfortable stay  Thank you so much for your hospitality  I really enjoyed my time in Chicago at your apartment  If I may suggest an idea for improvement  the vanilla scent all over the place was quite importunate and I wasn t able to recall the source  Maybe it is something that the cleaning lady is useing and could be replaced by a somewhat fresher scent     The windows could need some cleaning as well as the mixer and the shower shelf  And the Couch is really stained and could be replaced in near future 
640170451,Easy booking and quaint place   The wi fi was a bit slow  but useable  
629969457,Good location Place had no spoons and limited utensils  No trash bags or paper towels  Thats why I gave it a   star  But it was a good deal
639527058,The pictures definitely reflect the quality of the unit  It was nice to see some fun coffee accessories  wine glasses and a decanter  Really nice touches  The view from the balcony was great  especially with morning coffee  When we stayed the dishwasher wasnt working  which was a bummer  but Im sure its temporary and will be repaired soon  The unit was as described  I really liked the added touch of specialty pour over coffee with a grinder   very cool  I was frustrated that the dishwasher didnt work  it just made cleaning up before we left a little more challenging
642920476,great location in hyde park  very close to the lake  very large airbnb  it is a very old building  no central air but have window units  great easy check in  luckily we found decent street parking    only complaint is  there was no paper towel  we had to buy our own and there were ants coming from the window in the first bedroom and some in the kitchen  i found couple ants on the bed  we did not use the first bedroom  we ended up cleaning the kitchen and tried to clear up the ants in the first bedroom  i communicated with the host and no refund for the cleaning and the building manager did not come and talked to us 
637821651,Great location and good space  Easy check in process and good communication  A few areas needed sweeping but overall the place was sanitized and clean 
700446885,The area was very safe and homey  The apartment itself was decorated in a very minimalistic way and it made the space feel very big  Everything was cleaned very well  Starbucks was next door as well as places for sangria and seafood  Apartment and location are both a        I saw the review about the lock being messed up  it does work but the door frame was chipped away so it doesnt allow the door itself to actually lock  Automated messages
653550309,There were several items of trash left behind from previous guests and a few dishes that were left unwashed  usually wouldnt be that big of a deal but I would expect proper sanitation during a global pandemic  The sound throughout the whole apartment is connected as well since the rooms arent completely divided and the echo makes EVERYTHING loud and clear  Wasnt a deal breaker either but it just wasnt what we were expecting and I wish that was more accurately described in the listing   We also chose this place specifically for wifi access and were unable to connect to the internet the entire stay  the hosts were also not super helpful with this and only responded to our concerns once our stay was already almost over  There was also no battery in the smoke detector which could potentially be a major safety concern  The code to access the building also didnt work      of the time which was really annoying  Other than this it was an okay place to stay  the location was great but maybe just get a hotel or look for a place that actually cares about their guests enjoyment and safety   The fact that rooms were not fully separated and sound throughout the entire apartment was connected was not mentioned in the description or accurately depicted in photos  Wifi was one of the main reasons we chose this listing however the internet didnt work our entire stay   There were several items of trash left behind from previous guests and a few dishes that were left unwashed  usually wouldnt be that big of a deal but I would expect proper sanitation during a global pandemic 
636900734,Zencity was very clean and comfortable  Only issue was a maxed out netflix account on one night we planned to stay in  Would stay again though 
634255763,If you want to wait outside the unit for an hour and have soaking wet carpet that smells awful this is the place for you  The only thing that was good about this Airbnb was the kitchen  I suggest making sure everything actually works and smells nice in your units before giving them to visitors  Carpet was soaking wet and left an awful smell  and air conditioning did not work   Lock did not work to get into unit  Had to wait an hour to be switched to a different unit that seemed like they just cleaned while we were waiting  I would reccomend this place be listed at    
639111235,Nice place for the price 
638754665,Wifi didnt was spotty and the hot water in the shower was intermittent  But the place has a wonderful view and the apartment is very nice 
710739044,Everything was so nice the beds were not queen size they were full size bed  Everything was prefect in the house  The only thing was at  pm we had start being quiet The parking is not so great
717900562,Overall a great place to stay 
670210965,Unfortunately  we had a male use the key code we had to come into the house and as two sisters staying there  it was very unsettling  The next morning we also found cockroaches  If these two incidents were taken care of and prevented  then I would recommend this place but cannot until this is dealt with  We had a man break into the house using the same key code that you gave us  He came into the house and closed the door before we got over to the stairs and he let us know he was in the wrong house  While this seemed to be an innocent mistake  there have been people who use this approach to check to see if a house is a good place to come back to and burglarize  My sister and I did not feel safe in this house after that and its very concerning that someone else would have the same key code that we did to this place  I messaged you immediately and never heard a response which is also very disappointing   The next morning we also found cockroaches in the kitchen drawers  the brown banded ones  Im not sure why we would be paying an     cleaning fee  which Im sure each customer is paying and still find cockroaches in a house   Both of these were very disappointing because both of us were very excited to stay and were ready to book again until these two incidents occurred  Had cockroaches in multiple drawers in the kitchen  Check in communication was great  I however did not get any response to my concerns about someone breaking into the house 
636871164,New but sticky floors and dirty hallways  Floors were extremely sticky  lots of dust and dirt
700435558,Great apartment  Location was great  Apartment was nice  neat  and clean  There is no onsite parking so be aware  Will definitely book again if Im ever back in St  Louis  Great location  Apartment was clean and nice  The only downfall is street parking  I would definitely stay again though 
636558959,Great location  Easy check in and easy to navigate  Beautiful decor  Comfy bed  cozy couch and netflix    
636859402,Great location Thanks for hosting 
651044591,The apartment is smelly   elevator is dirty   nasty   common area is just horrendous  Parking is difficult to find   street parking   I paid      for two horrible nights  Read the cleaning fee and parking accommodations before renting   not worth it   
624246284,Zencity got it right     location  decor  and customer service  The property is in the Lakeview neighborhood  It is  literally steps away from a major train stop for three train lines  several buses and within walking distance to Wrigley Field  Lincoln Park Zoo  tons of  resteraunts  and bars    Pre Covid     there was always something to do   But  despite being in the thick of it all  the unit is quite and the residents  appear to be respectful of each other    In terms of decor the unit has a minimalist vibe  but there  is just enough to make you feel comfortable   The color scheme is modern and simple  There are accents of gray  white  and black throughout the unit  And the bed and linens are like fluffy clouds   They are soft but still provide ample back and head support  and are on the higher quality side    I had the pleasure of working with Marty  He helped with making the reservation  and was really responsive to any inquiry I made  during the stay   He responded in a timely manner and was always professional    Overall it was a good stay  I felt safe  the space was clean  it was reasonably priced  and the Zencity team provided solid customer service  Overall it was a good stay  I felt safe  the space was clean  it was reasonably priced  and the Zencity team provided solid customer service 
638718554,The view is so good   The apartment has large windows to enjoy it  very modern style  the kitchen is a great little size and has the basics  The bed was extremely comfy  We were disappointed to find out that of the  rooftop  pool  gym  terrace  mentioned in the listing  there is only actually a gym at this apartment complex  Im not sure why a pool  rooftop or terrace was mentioned in the listing but they dont exist  Aside from that  we enjoyed everything else about our stay and would recommend it We absolutely loved the view  It was incredible and so modern  a fun little getaway  Thanks for having us   The listing stated there was a pool  rooftop  gym  terrace but the only thing out of those we were able to access was the gym   There was no response for a couple days when we asked about access to the pool terrace rooftop
649878592,Great stay and cute place  Only issue was there were ants all along the boarders in the living room  There were ants everywhere and I seen a huge roach  They take a while to respond 
629931011,Nice Place  I will use again
638439132,The place was  decent  looks can be deceiving  Doors was off  Drain was clogged in bathroom  Paint job was not the best in apartment  Need better pool sticks  Chairs did not match height of kitchen table  If the place was a cheaper price it would be worth it  Everything in the home was working properly and looked as good as the pictures 
653224481,Great location  Honestly cant be beat  especially for that price  Walking distance to anything and everything youd need  and quick access to major roads and highways  Some quirks about the apartment  wire covers coming off the wall baseboards  front desk didnt seem to know what we were talking about when checking in and we said we needed physical keys for the place  but nothing intrusive or terribly distracting  Id stay here again  Wire covers had come off the walls in nearly every room  Not a big deal  but a little unsightly  And there appeared to be dry wall on the floor beneath the living room AC unit
619226255,Shakey wife situations
629927564,Great space and beautifully decorated My boyfriend and I loved the apartment just wish it was a bit cleaner  The bathtub was dirty and took a long time for water to drain The bathroom tub was stopped up and dirty and some of the dishes had food on them
635165813,Great location  Wonderful location to many amazing restaurants and we were able to have a real foodie experience   Also the bed and linens are very comfortable and we both slept well  And added highlight was enjoying fireworks for the Fourth of July from the comfort of our couch  We really enjoyed a relaxing time during our staycation in STL 
640084868,The apartment was what I expected  The only thing that threw me off was the filthy dirty shower curtain  Most of the days   I took a shower at my parents house  Also a few different little insects  Other than that it was an okay stay  Thank you so much for offering your home and for the hospitality  The apartment had quite a few different insects  small spiders  moths  and flies  mainly in the bathroom and bedroom  Also maybe a new shower curtain for the bathroom because it had a lot of dirt and mold at the bottom  If the bathroom was clean
640069067,Good place  Great bathroom  great patio  Only downside would be noise monitoring   We had to keep our music super quiet or else wed receive a text  Other than that  good experience 
639557431,A very decent stay  getting yours moneys worth  Great environment and great location 
652340576,It was very clean and in a great location  we initially had an issue with the air conditioning fans not working but we contacted the host and they were amazing and responded so fast to get the issues resolved  Would definitely return because of them  The staff Stuart and Marty really came through for us in getting us another room when the lights and fans stopped working   Thanks again 
714122670,Its a cool little apartment  location is within walking distance to a lot of stuff you can do in downtown KC  Not great in terms of responsiveness of host value we paid at the time      a night   bedroom fan and light remote didnt have a battery the whole vacation so we couldnt use the fan or light  even though we messaged the host on the first day  Also the garbage disposal didnt work at all and sink got backed up with normal use  That was the last afternoon we realized it  so a little more understandable as to why it wasnt fixed before we left  A little strange that none of the windows crack open  and the fire alarm seemed to be detached broken from the wall  Great location  cool building  just seems like the Zencity owners maybe havent really put in the time to make sure the place is consistently functioning  thanks for the weekend  had some hiccups but it ended up working out in the end Just for what we paid at the time      per night  but now its listed as     so not sure what happened there   it didnt end up being an experience quite worth the value of what we were paying for
704664912,This Airbnb was a very interesting concept  Its in a great location and is very charming  However  the instructions on how to get into the building are rather confusing and most of the dishes in the kitchen were dirty or still had food on them  so I had to rewash all of them before I could use them  The bathroom is super cute though and theres a good diner within walking distance from the place  so that was nice  The automated response never sent so I was on the phone with them right before I was supposed get on a plane and immediately go to the Airbnb  and the instructions were different on the photo they sent me than they were in the description they also sent  The guy on the phone was super nice though and very helpful for both times I called  So customer service was very good  Almost all the dishes glasses in the cabinet were dirty or still have food on them and there was hair all on the towels in the bedroom and sheets    but other than that the place was pretty clean 
640223813,nice place but bring your own toilet paper  host is slow at responding or doesnt respond at all  place is hard to find 
640065843,It was ok A microwave and Netflix logged us out for to many users The bathroom could have been more updated and the floors were dirty
650182512,Do not rent from these people They are liars and deceivers  What they advertise is a lie  I have a medical condition which excludes me for the governor of wearing a mask I went into the building and was thrown out of the  building because I couldnt wear a mask  They did not tell me this  Nothing was open as they advertise it was  And they wanted to charge my account without my approval when I never stayed in the room  Beware there are plenty of places do not spend it with these people they will steal your money and will not give you a refund  Beware You are the worst place I have ever engaged  Your lies and your deception will catch up with you  Taking money from peoples accounts and lying to them is unacceptable and it will come back to you   They lied about everything they advertised nothing was open  Terrible just terrible They lied about everything they advertised just terribleTerrible No  These people lied about this place  False advertisement  I never stayed at the place and yet they still wanted to charge me on my credit card and I never authorized it  Dont stay with these people
703927121,The photos no longer accurately portray the current condition of this unit  There is a large patched hole in the wall behind the front door  there is an open golf ball sized hole to the left of the bed  the art hanging above the bed has cracked glass plastic  one of the Breuer chairs in the kitchen scraped a long  deep gash into the wall  The unit smelled so strongly of bleach we had to open both windows  turn on the kitchen and bathroom fans  and leave while it aired out  All   building entry doors did not work so we had to call twice to be let into our unit at the time of check in  The stovetop burners had sauce on them  and the silverware had food on them  If this all doesnt bother you  the location is great  right next to the Belmont stop of the blue line  and getting a Spothero lot will save you on a consistent parking space if you bring a car  Update your listing photos as they are not transparent of the homes current conditions  change your cleaning team so they dont poison anyone with bleach  and replace the broken art above the bed and patch the holes in the walls  The photos were not accurate at all  There was a recently patched hole in the wall behind the front door  the framed photo above the bed was cracked with broken glass or plastic  there was a huge tear  scrape in the wall from one of the Marcel Breuer chairs in the kitchen  and a hole in the wall to the left of the bed   All   gates to the buildings entry wouldnt open and I had to call the help line twice to enter at the time of check in The dishes that were put away were full of water  and the others hardly looked washed  Food stuck to the forks  The stovetop had sauce all over the burners  The apartment smelled so strongly of bleach that we had to open the only two windows  turn on the kitchen fan  and the bathroom fan  and leave for a few hours while it aired out so we didnt feel sick I had to call twice to enter at the time of check in  I was on hold for a long time during the second call
635183487,Nice space in a nice neighborhood close to parks and shops  Great to getaway for work or play  I enjoyed my stay overall with my infant  For the most part it was a peaceful stay  One morning  I was playing music at half volume for most of the morning  When I switched genres  I received a call from the host about a noise complaint  I called the host about the lack of rooftop access and never received a call back   Though I brought my own supplies  the cleaning and sanitizing supplies in the apartment as well as  the french press and coffee table books were an added bonus    Outside of some stray hairs and the neighbors dogs running into the apartment   they apologized repeatedly  during check out  I found this to be a relaxing stay   Fresh air on the roof deck was in the description  but I was not allowed access during my stay   Involves some intuitiveness when operating the keypad  especially if its your first time operating a key pad  There were several long stray hairs on the carpet and couch  Did not receive a callback in relation to denied rooftop access 
632020397,Very nice space in a great location with an incredible view overlooking the park  The A C in the bedroom is extremely loud and leaked water   Also  out of your control  but there was construction each morning starting at  AM that shook the entire apartment  The loudest part of construction  sounded like drilling  would end around   AM 
559721378,Great place  clean  good area for st louis  Plenty of space for   people  and the walls were well soundprooofed  man toilet was broken even the neighbors tried helping toilet was broken when we got there and we werent able to fix all trip no response
661875330,Nice place  Worth the price Nice but please clean the walls  They were filthy when we came in 
702992671,We had a wonderful stay with Zencity  The location of the apartment was perfect  and within walking distance of almost everything  The view of Chicago was amazing  We really got the feel for what the city has to offer  Would love to book with them again  We had a wonderful stay in your apartment  The location was perfect and exactly what we were hoping to find for our trip  The only thing that was an issue was the cleanliness  Some of the dishes in the kitchen were dirty and there were dead bugs all over the shade of the master bedroom  Everything else was wonderful and we enjoyed our stay 
700621735,very nice location and great decor  the space could have been cleaner than it was 
661778051,This place was very spacious and allowed for guests to spread out and have their own room  The location is great as its close to a lot and then train line  I will look to stay here again  Thanks for having us  The place was spacious and great location  Will remember it for my next trip 
651009021,Be very wary when booking your stay  Online description does not fit  Very rude and unhelpful  They will not assist you to make your stay comfortable especially during hard times No comment Was in a wrong listing
718890036,Great spot in the city  but not the best place to stay  It was noisy with a dog upstairs and neighbors being loud  The place wasnt that clean and the internet was barely operable  This led to issues with the Roku TV that had been a selling point for us   The wifi was non existent and that led to the Roku being mostly useless  The pots and pans had grease and grime from the last occupants and the glass stove top was a mess  The reasons above 
718792250,Cozy   Comfortable
703834503,It was amazing  The bed was the best part it is definitely super hard to get out of  The view was amazing and we will be back for sure  it was amazing there was a doorman who was a little rude everytime we would come in but besides that we loved it  the kitchen is a little smaller  it was a great place but the bathroom had some spots you could tell hadnt been cleaned
636574065,Great and spacious place for the price next to the lake and around a lot of restaurants and miscellaneous businesses    The cleaning solution or detergent     from the couch broke me out into allergic hives and the microwave was broken other than that very good and smooth check in  Friendly front desk  Loved it  Recommend to everyone 
634282975,This air bnb is not the nicest or prettiest air bnb  It looks like the pictures but when you get to the space youll realize it is actually much older than it seems in pictures  When we moved in there was no A C  That is a major problem as it was said in the description of the bnb that there was A C  It took days to even get a temporary fix on this problem and communication was very slow  They ended up providing two portable A C units  did not cool the whole house so we had to flip a coin every night for who would get A C   The living room temp unit they provided leaked so they provided a bucket and told us we had to dump it every day  This air bnb isnt the worst day but definitely not the best  If you only plan to be in your air bnb to sleep then go for it    The apartment does look very similar to the pictures but when you arrive you u    ll notice the apartment is much older than it appears in pictures  There was no A  C in the apartment when we moved in  although it said there was A  C on the amenities list when we booked  This was a major flaw that was not fixed during our stay  They provided a couple of temporary A  C units  One they provided leaked and they informed us we would have to dump the bucket of water that it leaked every day  This was the biggest issue in staying here and resulted in a very early termination of our stay   The shower curtain in the bathroom was white but very dirty and brown at the bottom  There were a few times I saw ants crawling in my carpet in the bedroom  No major cleanliness issues but just small things to note  Sometimes responses would be slow which was unfortunate because we had a major A C problem and would have to call many times to receive a response  A C in the summer is definitely considered emergency maintenance but we had to wait days before we received even a temporary fix  They had no communication on when there would be an actual fix to the A C problem  Before you book here I would definitely call to make sure theres A C  You get what you pay for in this listing 
661679391,Beautifully designed
488858799,Great location  great amenities  great view from rooftop  hey guys hope there was no issues  happy to cover the cost of pillow or towel or whatever had stain on it if you could explain the details  I didnt spill anything but mistakes happen so ill give benefit of the doubt  let me knwk  thanks
637457157,This place is very close to a Country club plaza and it served my purpose well  I would definitely stay here for my next visit  Thanks for being a great host and for providing quick responses  It has been a great one week stay 
702996459,The home was nice but I think the photos are a bit deceiving  The home wasnt as clean as I expected and the heating system was broken  It was either extremely hot or extremely cold  Also  without an elevator the three floors is a bit unbearable with luggage   groceries 
636201868,Fantastic location  Efficient and friendly building management  Permanent residents also seemed friendly    I would have liked to stay longer  I have identified a couple of issues but on the whole would not hesitate to return  The location is fantastic and the staff and building residents were very friendly   The wifi in the unit was pretty slow  couldnt stream or do zoom meetings  There is a reason for the wifi lounge on the first floor   It looked like there was black dog hair on the white rug in the living room  Also saw an ant or two in the kitchen  Some responses when I asked specific questions were a little slow  This may be a different issue  but I also had to ask the front desk staff a couple of times for more toilet paper 
636926663,This place is nice
559068945,Great location   Tiny kitchen  but functional  Rooftop deck is awesome  We had trouble with the coffee maker    apparently there were   parts to it  and only   were in the apartment   We really missed having just a standard coffee maker    and had to go to the store each morning for coffee  Other than that    great location and very friendly staff at the desk  We tried to consolidate our questions into fewer messages  but would not always get all answers  Had to resend a couple messages to get responses for all questions 
635100713,Great location  Easily accessible and around a lot of restaurants The kitchen stove was not clean and gnats were flying out of the eye  There are a lot of scuff marks all over the walls which made it feel unclean  Didnt want to lean on the window seal to look out the amazing windows because they were dirty as well 
668824239,Great location right downtown next to Barnes Jewish hospital  A lot of great restaurants within walking distance and we had no trouble finding street parking nearby  While the building is a little bit dated  upgrades to the unit  along with the added door security and awesome concierge employees  our stay was good  Would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in this area needing a nice little spot  While we enjoyed our stay a lot  the bathroom had a pretty strong sewage smell  Im not sure theres anything that could be done about this    maybe an extra air freshener in the bathroom   The mattress could also stand to benefit from a mattress pad or something because it is VERY firm  With a lack of ceiling fans  maybe a stand up fan in the bedroom as well  Overall  it was a very nice place and the PM front desk woman is excellent  
637845385,It was mostly as described  It was a nice stay  the cleanliness was disappointing in the living room area  The carpet looked dirty  Could have used a blanket in the living room too  The sitting room area was not vacuumed  looked dirty  There wasnt a blanket so I had to use a towel when I was watching tv 
604858757,The place is beautiful great area  Unfortunately just dirty all over  Just seems like the cleaning attention only focuses on the kitchen but the rest of the place was just dirty  Its sad because its great place Hair all over the bathrooms  Dirty all over   Ive waited an hour for the cleaning person to finish cleaning the place and after the person left it was still very dirty 
646692410,The pictures provided were inaccurate  but the accommodations were still very nice  The walls are fairly thin  so noisy neighbors can be an occasional annoyance  Be prepared to pay for parking in the area if you have a vehicle   its free during late hours  but the spots fill up quickly and you risk being towed if you stay past the free hours  The apartments layout and furnishings are very stylish   the living room couch is very comfortable  but the bed was a little too stiff for our liking  The bathroom is very small  but the shower has excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water  The kitchen is stocked with necessities  but we had to wash the majority of them to use them because they were visibly dirty  Despite the parking inconveniences and slight issues with overall comfort in the airbnb  we were very happy with the provided amenities and the building security  Thank you for allowing us to stay in your accommodations  More affordable convenient parking and less noisy neighbors
637401054,Our stay was good  The place was very clean  the area of town was in the heart of the city  and once we had the key it was easy to access  The only downside was noisy neighbors because the walls were very thin  was it was a little hard to sleep  Overall good place 
716286205,This place was nice just needs some small upgrades and more thorough cleaning  The neighbors kept banging on the wall saying the TV was too loud at  pm and the TV wasnt loud at all  The walls could use some new paint really bad 
234140928,Loved our stay thank you so much  The only issues we had was the smoke alarm was going off a lot while we were cooking  Other than that we enjoyed the stay  Thank you  Loved our stay thank you so much  The only issues we had was the smoke alarm was going off a lot while we were cooking  Other than that we enjoyed the stay  Thank you 
636931679,Make sure WiFi works before you check in  mine didnt work for a entire   night stay  Also be weary of a heavy smell in the bathroom from something unknown   No WiFi  dirty dishes were unexpected  also who would expect a stinky bathroom  Dirty dishes stain on sheet on arrival  stinky bathroom Working WiFi and not a stench in the bathroom of mold or something dead
635154905,The smell in the hallway was disgusting  They need to figure out something else with the trash shoot  We will not be staying here again  The smell in the hallway was a huge deterrent  We will not be staying here again  The hallway to our room smelled disgusting  
636920851,Kitchen utensils inside the drawer werent clean  The walls of the place is scuffed up  definitely needs a paint job  The bedroom had some dust and needed to be cleaned  It was frustrating because I was having trouble with my room and I was trying to get in contact with zencity  They took a long time to respond to messages and when I called they wouldnt answer  took a couple tries to get them on the phone  The best they could do was offer a     discount on the first two nights which I checked out about   days ago and havent received anything that states that will happen  Would recommend a faster response time and faster acceptance of booking time  I have waited over    hours of a response for a place I was trying to book in the next   hours I would have a check in 
633414782,Good place  great natural lighting in the place  minimal and clear communication  could issue some more cleaning Colored spots were on the bathroom towels  and the bathtub didnt look like it had been cleaned  especially the floor crevices in the shower Nothing was spectacular  parking details could have been much clearer Better parking  and an overall cleaner space  I didnt feel like I was in a just cleaned apartment
641163310,DO NOT BOOK HERE   Host is unhelpful and apartment was not clean  This was the worst experience I have ever encountered on Airbnb   To add to my frustration I saw that multiple other guests had posted similar issues regarding cleanliness   I booked this at an advertised      night and was charged         night  Room was not clean Dirty dishes in dishwasher and in cupboard   Stains on walls  doors  cabinets   Food debris and trash on floor around and under couch   Hairballs on the floor by the bed   Pubic hair on walls of shower  Marty was evasive in his responses and unproductive in solving the problems Clean conditions  responsive host  amenities that demonstrated the host actually wanted their guest to feel comfortable   No detergent for the dishwasher or washing machine
633862646,The instructions are unclear  It took us about       mins to even set foot into the building and another    mins to get into our room  There is no on site parking so we ended up paying quite a bit for parking during our stay  There were only two out of the six elevators that led up to the Airbnb floor  which was not stated in the instructions  The hosts communication was a bit slow  We had to call them multiple times  in which they did not answer and responded late  Furthermore  when we had arrived  the showers had hair in the drains and there was no trash bags in the bathroom trash cans  The kitchen had a broken drawer that we were not made aware of  The host attempted to FINE us      in damages stating it was due to a stain in the carpet  which we did not see because it was located UNDER the coffee table  Given the state of cleanliness of the Airbnb  the cleaners lacked a thorough cleaning and attempted to fine us  There is no parking on premise so we ended up spending quite a bit on parking alone  The instructions were not clear and took us about       mins to set foot into the building  then another    mins because there were only two out of the   elevators that allowed for the guest to reach the Airbnb floors  We had to get help from the security desk  When we arrived there was hair still in the shower drains and no trash bags in the bathroom trash cans  The kitchen had a broken drawer that we were made unaware of  The host tried to request      in damages which they stated was from a stain on the carpet  given the state that the apartment was in  the cleaners did not do a thorough job and attempted to fine us  We contacted the host many times and it was pretty slow  We had to call multiple times which they did not pick up  but they would contact me later in the day  Beautiful view  just no parking 
495867665,Excellent communication  easy check in  convenient location   Bed was wonderful and decor tasteful   Be aware that parking was a bit hard at night   Whole Foods is close  but we had to park several blocks away when we returned from shopping   Cupboards could be a bit cleaner and better stocked with cooking essentials  but overall a very pleasant stay  Hi   We enjoyed our stay  but a couple things would have improved it  oven dishes to cook in the oven   better curtains to block the light and  stronger AC since unit gets a lot of sun     Bed was wonderful and decor was pleasant except the old fridge and kitchen in general   Good location and easy check in   Maybe emphasize the parking challenge a bit more     Thanks  Cupboards under the sink has debris dust as well as fan 
703886083,The apartment was really clean and nice  and the managers responded within minutes to any requests made  It is also ideally located on the soldiers memorial square  allowing us to walk easily to many places    With that said  I do not recommend this apartment for families  There was a strong odor of marijuana smoke at night  and our neighbors were partying loudly until   AM  Probably fine for adults but not for families with young children  Thank you for the opportunity to rent your apartment  We appreciated your quick responses to our lack of hot water  and a coffee maker  We did not like the smell of marijuana smoke at night  nor did we appreciate our neighbors partying and shouting until   AM  Please consider listing this rental as for adults only in the future   I booked an apartment in a building that insisted on quiet after    PM and before   AM  Imagine my surprise when there were loud partying and shouting happening in the building until   AM  Also  the stated curfew made me think that it was a place for professionals and familes  but the smell of marijuana smoke was clear in the halls and seeped into the apartment at night   See above for my description under accuracy  This should be listed as only allowing adults to rent the apartment 
641799800,Our stay was nice  There were a few issues but the host responded very quickly  Was leery about hearing the train but it was super quiet   a nonissue    Our stay was fine except for the smell    there was a strong scent of marijuana as soon as we entered and everyday in the afternoon  And the smoke alarm was chirping constantly  Also  the only drawers are in the bathroom and were dirty  The bedroom carpet was dirty so I tried to vacuum but the vacuum threw more dirt out  Everything else was really nice  Very quiet  Convenient  Safe  Keypad was broken  Had to call host and go through a tedious process to gain entry  Not good after a long drive 
712677977,Great location near downtown Kansas City  very affordable for my one night stay  Some cups were still wet and not looked to be cleaned properly  toilet paper left in the toilet  and hair left on bathroom floor 
636508822,One time renter and first time using Air B B  This property was well represented  It met all expectations with the exception of few items  Such as  hand towels  bar soap and a little more detail to the cleaning crew  It was a five night stay and Im of the opinion that was missed by housekeeping  To be clear  I would rent again and make my expectations clear  This isnt meant to be a critical review but  honest  These are details that would have made this rental more attractive  Thank you I should preface that this is my first ever Air B B experience  Shower surround and curtain had something splashed on it  I was able to wipe it and it was removable  Indicates to me that it wasnt thoroughly cleaned before my arrival  No bar soap or hand soap in the bath area  The kitchen floor had been mopped before my arrival and appeared wet  Although  it could have been that the trash can was washed and never dried because when I came back from the market there was a two foot trail of liquid seeping from below  Which forced me to use the one and only hand towel that was provided  That seemed odd for a five night stay  I brought this to mgt  attention  Two days later there were new bath towels and a dish towel provided  THe host was actually quite good and responsive  Though there seemed to be a break down between mgt  and whoever provided services to the apt  There were some details that I felt fell through the cracks  In general this is a great property  Well represented through the booking process but  shy on the details  I would rent again with requests for items I felt were missed 
641811922,Place needs work   Biggest positive is that its close to hospital  Front door hard to open   Paint chipping off wall   Kitchen only had one kitchen towel  no coffee pot  drawers were dirty Tub dirty  floor dirty Pictures staged the apartment very well   In reality  furniture was old  couch had stains
641113873,The loft was beautiful  very clean and spacious  Parking loot free was incredibly high and meter parking was ridiculous  Weekend meter parking is free but towing is strictly enforced 
655515702,The apartment itself was just fantastic  The space was amazing and simple  The view was incredible  However  the front door of the apartment complex was boarded up  from the time we went into the building to when we closed the bedroom door we could smell marijuana  even in the living room   and the neighborhood did not feel safe  with no on site parking that means walking blocks in an unsafe neighborhood to get to your car   You cant blame Zencity for their neighbors  but this neighborhood needs to be mentioned before making decisions 
710617819,Simple  no frills apartment with great view of the city   Very comfortable bed  Lots of beautiful  natural light Hello   thank you for allowing me to stay in your apartment    I would suggest cleaning the bathroom tile in the shower as it was dirty and had hairs on it from other guests   The plastic shower curtain liner was pretty moldy and dirty too  and should be changed out      leaving some coffee out on the kitchen counter would also be a nice touch   shower tiles and shower curtain dirty
635488208,Incredibly beautiful place beautiful amenities that we were told we could use however the management company had told Our host multiple times that we couldnt use them and they never pass that along to us  so we were incredibly misled as the pool was part of the main reason we booked  The security guard asked us to leave the pool on July   th before the fireworks in front of everyone because we did not have a bracelet  we didnt know we needed  The host said they would give us a   day refund  we have not received that  Has not answered us  Please refund the two days as you stated you would  It was a beautiful place  we cleaned it upon leaving we would just have preferred honesty rather than you misleading us saying we could use the pool when you knew we couldnt   That was our plan over the holiday weekend   We were told in the booking we could use the pool and the property asked us to leave the pool on the  th of July  The property told our hosts over   weeks prior to our stay  That we couldn u    t use the pool   nWe were very respectful responsible and quiet at the pool however we were informed that due to Covid we couldn u    t be there  We didn u    t have bracelets  there were raging frat parties with pool beer pong and table pong  DJ and frisbee beer golf in the pool on the  rd and  th during the day before we were asked to leave  We truly love the place and we u    re expecting to be in the pool for the  th to see fireworks and get away from the heat as it was listed in the booking with a pool to use and said nothing about a change in pool policy  You had stayed on the phone that you would refund a day and will try to refund   days as it was what our  th and vacation plans were  We would have found a place that had a pool we could use   nOf course as we stated we will not be going to the pool for the rest of our stay  We were told by the property that Airbnb would no longer be allowed on their property and that they had told our host this over   weeks ago  we were the last guests   nNo one got back to us about the refund  nPlease get back to us   Misleading us about pool Use of pool   why we booked Completely misled us  beautiful place could not access it and host said we could in listing and knew three weeks prior that we couldnt   We found out when the management property asked us to leave th pool on the forth of July  the biggest day of the holiday weekend in front of other guests  Embarrassing  we had to wait in the pool for a back and forth between the manager  we ended up leaving the pool and all our holiday plans canceled
703330774,Great place to stay if you like being close to the city life  Grateful your tram was responsive to my messages and call    I would say to send out the check out message earlier  it was sent at        with an       check out  but we had to leave earlier  I was looking for check out information that morning and hoped I had done all the things necessary before leaving   Wasn u    t as clean as I expected  especially with the extra Covid cleaning details  
662430353,Nice price for a quick stay  Remove dirty towels and wash clothes and either remove used toiletries or replenish for new guests 
654364242,Personally had issues getting into my initial unit which also felt like an unsafe area with smoking smells around the unit and the keypad refused to let me in  However host upgraded me to absolutely beautiful unit a couple blocks over for the issues and was very helpful in resolving issues  Like technology can be unpredictable and its not really his fault for the keypad not working        recommend staying with zencity   The window farthest from the tag wont close and the couch area was quite dirty with stains  My recommendation would be to put some kind of sheet over the couch  And also one of the rugs was coming unattached from the ground so it needs to be taped down again  And the couchs back leg was slightly broken I believe  I didnt have much time to use the living area it the whole unit was absolutely beautiful   So actually I couldnt get into the original space because of issues with the key lock but the host upgraded me to a new location much better and safer and nicer than my original unit   Couch area was slightly gross and one of the windows wouldnt close but for the most part it was really clean and amazing  
641847730,Great location 
245085221,Decently nice place Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
649488326,This is a very cool place  nice and clean plus super easy check in  The building is in a great location  walking distance to lots of cool places and the coffee shop downstairs was great  I wanted to give it five stars across the board  but the furniture in the images did not match the furniture in the room  The images showed a table and chairs and a large couch in the main living space  There was only a coffee table and a small  uncomfortable loveseat  Either the pictures need to be retaken or the furniture should be changed out  If not for that  this would be a five star place for sure and I would definitely stay again  I really enjoyed this space  I wanted to give it five stars  I was just really disappointed that the pictures didnt match the actual space when it came to the furniture  Other than that  this is a great spot and I would stay here again   I was disappointed because the furniture in the images did not match the furniture in the room  I had intentionally booked a space with a table and chairs to work comfortably while there  But there was no table and chairs in the room and instead of the large comfy couch in the images it was a very small loveseat   Better furniture
642893433,I love St louis  I left a decent rating but it was essentially a huge party building  There were young kids loud outside our door  Loud on the street  Left food in the hallways  It was abit uncomfortable going in and out of the building  Difficult entry process at first  Black scuff marks on the walls down low 
584871964,Pro    Great Location    Modern Apartment   Con    No flexibility with checkin time  its an automated system that unlocks the door at  PM    At one day the keypad to open the apartment door did not work and it was a big hustle to get in  I came from a run with sweaty clothes on and we had to search on google for a telephone number from the host which was not provided before     The washing machine does not work properly  keeps shutting off during the program and the laundry does not smell clean afterwards 
638727430,When i arrived  i was looking for a fork  but only found one  I found the rest of them  along with a few other dirty dishes  in the dishwasher w the soap pellet untouched  The machine had not been run  On the rug in front of the couch were some crumbs  so I vacuumed  The front left leg on the couch is broken  The comforter in our room had makeup on it  and it had been turned over  The top sheet also had a smudge of make up  I took pics of this  The linens were white  so its tough to hide any stains  No iron was there  but they brought me one the next day   There was a stain on the couch  The fabric could use a cleaning   On the bright side  the apartment had beautiful colors  design and furniture  The kitchen was well stocked  we loved that there was olive oil there  which we had forgotten  Super comfy mattress  Extra linens  Easy check in  Great smell  The cleanliness issues werent dealbreakers  I know a lot must go into cleaning an entire apt  Overall it is a beautiful place and I would stay there again  The cleanliness issues werent dealbreakers  I know a lot must go into cleaning an entire apt  Overall it is a beautiful place and I would stay there again  When i arrived  i was looking for a fork  but only found one  I found the rest of them  along with a few other dirty dishes  in the dishwasher w the soap pellet untouched  The machine had not been run    On the rug in front of the couch were some crumbs  so I vacuumed    The front left leg on the couch is broken  The comforter in our room had makeup on it  and it had been turned over  The top sheet also had a smudge of make up  I took pics of this  The linens were white  so its tough to hide any stains    No iron was there  but they brought me one the next day    There was a stain on the couch  The fabric could use a cleaning     On the bright side  the apartment had beautiful colors  design and furniture    The kitchen was well stocked  we loved that there was olive oil there  which we had forgotten     Super comfy mattress  Extra linens   Easy checkin  Great smell
583333793,The apartment was totally fine  but the photos oversold the experience  Its a pretty standard apartment on the second floor without a lot of furniture or amenities  For the gorgeous photos and price point  we were expecting more  But again  the place was totally fine and we had a good time there  When we got locked out because I had left my phone inside and forgotten the very long code  the super nice front desk was able to let us in and answer our questions  There was ample free parking outside which the host did not know about  because they probably havent been there that many times   The photos oversold the experience   It was a bit confusing 
662686895,Wonderful style and location  Wonderful style and location  The shower glass was not clean 
643004252,Location and price are great Technical problems with app caused slow response 
642990159,Great location  with amazing amenities  Sanitary and beautifully decorated Thank you the place was awesome  Floors were a bit dirty so I just did a quick clean on my own
672716299,Stylish space in rad neighborhood  Steps to wonderful shopping and awesome restaurants  if you had a Brita water pitcher for filtered water in the fridge that would be amazing  Coffee maker was dusty 
662666166,   Offering parking would be good  The street options felt unclear The parking felt unsafe
703901240,Not terrible  You get what you pay for  Wife was having some trouble getting to sleep one night because of the neighboring room playing EDM into the late night    Besides the fridge and dishwasher not being cleaned out  the toilet also did not work for the majority of the first day  I understand that these things happen  but it would have been nice to receive some sort of small refund  since the amenities were not working as advertised    If youre looking for a cheaper place to stay  and you dont mind the chance of having loud neighbors and lazy cleaners  Id say this is a good one to keep in mind   Overall  our   day stay wasnt the worst  Its somewhat functional  and the location is good  We just probably wont choose this one again  Maintenance guy said that he suspects the cleaners are flushing things down the toilet they arent suppose to  as this toilet problem is common   Considering the cleaners also didnt clean out the refrigerator or dishwasher  Id suggest you retrain or rehire your cleaners Refrigerator had some leftover food in it Didnt hear an update about the toilet being fixed for   hours  So I called again then someone came
639070316,Its a nice place to stay  Just needs a little more cleaning and the noise coming from people entering the building through the stairs is just a little yo much  Spider webs on the apartment and spiders all over the apartment
635978393,This is a very stylish  minimal apartment  It was nice place during my week ish stay   Cleanliness  I am disappointed that although the places stated enhanced cleaning measures to combat COVID  I still found crumbs on the stove  left over coffee creamers in the fridge  and even hair on the clean pillowcases in the closet  However  I had my own sanitizing supplies and after I gave the place my own wipe down  it was okay  Amenities Used  The host has a Netflix account set up already  which is nice  The internet connection was solid  which was great for all my zoom calls  I made use of the gym and laundry facilities while I was there  The gym was nice and there wasnt many people in it so I felt safe  They dont have any policy in place for COVID about restricting the number of people in the gym at one time  so just try to go when no one else is there  The laundry room was empty when I used it midday  The washers were pretty clean considering they are shared  Parking  There is plenty of pay parking on the street Laclede  You can pay either via app or using the pay station  Its free after  pm but I didnt feel comfortable leaving my car on the side street overnight so I would park it in the hospital located down Laclede for     overnight  The hospital parking is a quick walk from the apartment so it was very convenient   Area   Keep in mind this is in a busy area  very  very close to a hospital  so you will here a lot of ambulances  firetrucks  and main road traffic day and night  But  like trains  you quickly tune it out  It is in walking distance to a Whole Foods  Shake Shack  and other yummy places   Overall a nice stay  The place itself was so stylish and the furniture was minimal and perfect for me  Having full control of the air conditioner was a plus too  I will say that the check out process left me a bit uneasey  It says to leave the key inside the room  which means I could not lock the door on my way out to check out  It just made me wary about leaving it open   Also  I am so sorry about breaking a cup  I was trying to navigate the dark and was unsuccessful  On AirBNB website  this place was marked as doing more cleaning due to COVID     However  when I came in  I found food crumbs on the stove  left over creamer packets in the fridge  a string bean in the freezer  and hairs on the clean sheets and pillowcases that were stored in the closet  The extra comforter was also on the floor of the closet  The bathroom tub was clogged and drained so slowly for my entire trip  If places are specifying they are doing extra cleaning due to COVID over others  there shouldnt be any left overs from the previous guest 
521244984,Wonderful stay  super super  spacious  Great water pressure  No hair dryer would be my only note 
635173072,A group of friends and I came to Kansas City for the  th  The place was lovely  Very modern and clean  Great view and natural lighting  Huge bathrooms and plenty of space for   people to stay comfortably  My favorite part is the massive and beautiful kitchen  The building also had a pool  Building was quiet and has a parking garage  The place was lovely  My only suggestion would be to have more cream and sugar for coffee  There was coffee and one pack of sugar and one creamer  For a group of    it didnt make much sense  Also the towels in the bathroom cabinet were  strewn about so we were unsure if they were clean or not and did not use them   Parking directions weren u    t clear   Parking instructions werent clear 
628557180,This apartment was very clean and spacious  The check in was easy  Great value and the location was perfect for what we needed for the weekend  Its on a busier street so we could hear the traffic  The air conditioning is from window units  which is a little noisier than I expected  Know that this unit is managed by a company and not an individual  their response time isnt as quick as any other AirBnB I have ever stayed in  The kitchen has the basics but nothing more    like not even paper towels  I had to ask one question twice and another question was never replied to The apartment was on a busy  noisy street
621549634,Theres so much we enjoyed about this place   especially its location  the free in unit washer and dryer  and the clean sheets  amazing closets  smart TV  fast wifi  and a comfortable bed  Other than that  the place felt like a hotel  but not as crisp  There were dust bunnies in corners  leaking bath spigot  visibly dirty rug  and the stovetop hadnt been cleaned when we arrived    They didnt have kitchen amenities  so we had to purchase a knife and other essentials to cook meals    The floors are very very squeaky  and the walls are very very thin  so we heard our neighbors loud and clear  as well as people in the stairwells  mostly all day  every day  Night time wasnt too bad though  We had one issue with a loud neighbor  and it seemed like the host managed to tell them to turn down the music   We were here for a longer duration  so we had to order packages  and one got stolen from downstairs  kitchen amenities  cleaner appearance  insulated walls  v noisy  
671070905,Awesome location  cute space  Two comfortable queen beds and a small pull out bed  futon like   Just steps away from great bars and restaurants and streets lined with lampposts and easy parking  Central to so many great places  The location is amazing  Would love to see more character  more decorations and a sense of home  The bathroom could use a towel rack  a shelf of some kind within the shower for your toiletries  Theres nowhere to put soap  shampoo  etc  The bathroom just needs some better storage  The place itself was great  These are small things that could add a lot and not cost you much at all to add 
644351806,Location is great
455073201,Sehr gute Lage und angenehmer Host  Gerne wieder  Zugang und Code der Schl u  fcsselbox ungenau 
644735379,Location was great and easily accessible  Secure parking available  Place was clean  The only issue I had was with noise  the walls must be very thin because you can hear a lot of what your neighbors are doing 
622207949,Nice place  Common area of the building could be cleaner  The apartment is very nice  very high ceiling  the building was an old factory I think   Just went during the covid   so didnt check around  But host very nice and respond fast  And very nice  Al the amenities are there  Thanks a lot for the stay
231309932,This is probably the worst place and the worst experience I have had in using Airbnb       I had to stood in freezing Chicago winter night for over half hour because the check in instruction does not work  He did not want to give the backup option until all the efforts he told me to try failed  including to warm up the lock by rubbing  breathe and banging it  Imagining doing all these after a long flight in the a freezing night of winter Chicago      Despite I told him that my phone with Airbnb app was going to battery out  please call me on the other phone  He stayed on Airbnb msg only  Luckily  my other phone just had data plan in  Otherwise  I might have to stand in the cold all night or arrange alternative       The interior room is not as clean as the picture  It is probably due to old units and poor house keeping  Some of the things on the wall  for example the intercom  is half falling  The hallway  stairway  and elevator are just unbearably dirty and scary  When I come back from work  I work late   I felt like in a horror movie       I regret booking with   weeks up front  He charges     of payment for all the rest night if I check out early  disregarding how many days ahead of the final check out date       On the last day  my meeting went longer because we need to surely wrap up some works  I missed the check out time by an hour and half  He charged additional fee right way when I arrived airport  I acknowledge that check out time is a a upfront rule  However  given a   weeks good deal for him  it is not unreasonable to expect him to have a bit grace   The check in incident and the shabby hallway  interior were bugging already  On top of that  despite a great deal for you with my two weeks stay  you want to charge additional for I missing the check out time  I will just return a straight frank host with frank honest comments     Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  shower  dust  odors  bathroom  kitchen  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements 
607424877,Great location and overall stay  Comfortable bed and nice big window  view  Bathroom could have been a little cleaner   simply by changing out the shower curtain   Other than that we enjoyed it for the weekend  Thank you so much for opening your place to us  The bed was extremely comfortable and the place was tidy and well laid out  Couldnt locate the key fob to get in the building  thankfully the codes worked throughout the entire stay so we were able to get in and out without the key  The bathroom could have been a little cleaner  mainly the shower curtain  It was pretty dirty and built up on the bottom  Cleaner bathroom and better entry access 
622155959,Wouldnt recommend this unit   AC is malfunctioning in bedroom and dust was so bad that I had to turn off both AC units   Literally got a sore throat from only staying inside unit during quarantine   And couldnt sleep with windows open by of downtown traffic noise Checked in about issues with ac unit and dust in heater   No response   Can not recommend this unit and contacting AirBNB for resolution
641165332,WARNING  For our entire stay the apartment flooded   There was a lot of water that was coming in from the walls and eventually went into the master bedroom and completely soaked the carpet to the point we couldnt walk on it  The hallway was filled with water  The host never once fixed the issue  They said they would get maintenance there and never did  We had to deal with the flooding and actually use our own towels to clean it up since there was not enough   The host is now ignoring my messages despite sending them proof of all the flooding  which they have known about since another guest stated it flooded during their stay as well  I would highly recommend staying somewhere else as this may flood during your stay as well   and the host is not in any rush to help fix it or make it right  It is clear they do not care about their guests safety satisfaction  Horrible experience  I will not be booking with ZenCity again  Instead of trying to make money  put your guests firsts  I have tried to be patient and kind to you throughout this experience and your company has done nothing but ignore the fact you allowed us to stay in a flooded apartment and did NOTHING to help us  You refuse to provide us a refund and ignore my messages  I will never rent from your company again  Host was not concerned at all about the flooding issue happening in our apartment during our stay   was told there was nothing we could do as the apartment hallway completely flooded as well as bedroom floor was soaking wet  Did not even provide extra towels as we had to use our own to clean it up  Never once sent maintenance and never once tried to refund us for all the issues  The host knew of flooding issues happening in the apartment from January and still has this place listed knowing it may flood when it rains 
637498555,Not the cleanest but it is in a great location  I am fairly clean person and would have expected a lot cleaner of the place  The walls had dirt markings and my feet were horribly dirty the minute I took off my socks  I would take time to clean the place thoroughly    You all had great communication  I couldnt get into the building due to the code not working and as soon s I messaged called you got back to me so quick and I greatly appreciate that   It says rooftop but there was kind of access to the roof  no furniture and would lockbehind you   It was just below our personal expectations of stating you have a rooftop and we felt an inaccurate description of location   I am very clean person and I wasnt impressed with the level of cleanliness  The floor left my feet black and their are foot prints and other markings all along the wall  The place its self was picked up but you could tell it haddent been deep cleaned in months 
644332394,The place was very nice  The self check in was easy  The fob was an inconvenience the guess before us lost it but they host worked hard to get us another one before the end of our stay  I was worried about parking but it was fairly easy and I had no issues  I dont know if that was due to covid or construction  I would stay here again 
643999944,Pictures didnt match
707466256,Very clean  very modern space   Ideal location   Easy Check In  quick responses   Building Security told me there is no rooftop access for Air BnB guests  even though that was in the listing   We were under the impression we would have roof access  which we expressly did not   The security told us that AirBnB people were not allowed on the roof at all  as it was a liability     nThere was also not a coffee maker  which wouldve been nice  especially since there was a coffee bean grinder    nFinally  the hot water ran out VERY quickly  which was bizarre for such a high end building  
640108989,A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet  A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet   A total False Advertisement  This wasnt what I thought I booked  Whats advertised in the pictures on this profile was not the place I stayed in  Completely disappointed  Worst Airbnb yet   When I communicated to the Host about the room they stopped replying  False Advertisement Not worth the stay 
643705175,Great location and stay  Parking wasnt an issue  Very friendly and responsive host  Breakfast wasnt included but hopefully theyll fix that in the future Great stay but was missing coffee breakfast  No coffee or breakfast provided 
622286472,Close to bjh and wholefood 
622212332,Nice place  Neighbors were a little loud  but good stay overall 
409638762,Sehr gute Lage  zentral und guter Blick  und guter Gastgeber  Schnelle Antworten  nette Tips und jederzeit hilfsbereit Herzlichen Dank f r die netten Tips
449872055,Great location 
449830730,It doesnt worth the price  I expected a better experience  The room smells wired  I dont mean bad but just cant stand the smell  The aeration is not good  The kitchen is small but enough to cook and dine  It takes   min drive and   min subway to the city center  The place is more like a hotel  and not homy enough  Considering the price I paid  I would not recommend this place  but if they give you price lower than       fees included   you can consider staying here 
662967752,Really love this area of St Louis In my past experiences with the host and unit  communication and service provided was great  Unfortunately the unit I was placed in on this trip was different than what was advertised and no one reached out to tell me about the change   This was a different unit than advertised  Similar but not the same  It was clean and stocked   I was unaware the unit was changed prior to arrival 
603728691,This apartment was nice  but more hotel like than typical air bnbs Ive enjoyed    This is a fourth floor walk up  which I had missed in the listing and was a bit difficult for my mother    My sister and nieces flight was cancelled the day of and we tried to cancel the air bnb since we didnt need so much space and they were not accommodating  Its an understandable business policy  but it was a little disappointing to get not even partial refund for cleaning fee or anything at all  In the end my mom and I stayed even though we didnt need to since we had paid for it  Company not a host so a different experience  to through menu to speak to someone who is more removed from property than typical host Not listed as fourth floor walk up clearly Homier apartment  more comfortable livable furniture  not fourth floor walk up for price
624437894,Nice place  bad experience this time around  Weve stayed here before and had a great experience  however this time wasnt so great  There were no sheets on the bed other than one bed sheet  no blankets or comforters  Didnt get a response to our request for blankets  Also  the sink literally fell through the counter as my girlfriend was cleaning dishes  Never seen that happen before in my life  They were supposed to send someone up to fix it our last night there but nobody ever came 
602359847,Solid place  pretty large in size   good location  easy check in  friendly staff and secure location  very safe    Its about time for a new couch and it takes a bit of coordinating when you have more than one person staying as theres only one key and key fob to enter the elevator and place  but the building staff was super helpful  accommodating   Overall good stay  no major complaints  Thanks for hosting us  Overall  it was a solid stay  Id recommend having someone change the shower curtains out and replacing the living room couch  Also  it was a bit of a challenge coordinating more than one person being able to enter exit due to there only being one key fob and one door key to enter the elevator  Mold on the shower curtain and living room couch was dirty  worn  old  The weekly discount was only     Hardly an incentive for staying a week  especially when better looking  larger places had a     weekly discount 
601510705,Overall good stay  Very spacious and clean  Overall pleasant stay  Very specious for one person stay  Near restaurants and the waterfront  Construction noise on the second morning 
600380232,Lovely place  spacious with good amenities  Mar was very accommodating and great with communication  The washer and dryer and use of the garage were extra bonuses  The lock and key situation was a little excessive and the neighborhood isnt the greatest  But we didnt have any issues with safety and its very close to the Dan Ryan  so it was convenient for transporting  Thanks for having us  You have a lovely home and were very accommodating  I would recommend changing out the rug in the front  It sheds pieces daily that gets tracked around the house  Also  the lock and key situation   is a little overwelming  I would recommend investing in key entry for some of the doors  Otherwise  we enjoyed our time in your place 
623663082,Place was nice and spacious I enjoyed my stay The place was nice I enjoyed my stay The shower was not very clean
659131953,This place is perfectly located and is cozy and comfortable  Other than WiFi and dishwasher issues  the place was amazing and next time Im in St Louis I will try to book this place again   There was no WiFi available during our stay   The dishwasher had dirty water sitting inside of it and the dishes werent completely clean 
703784298,Perfect location for us  very clean and super host  Thank you for letting us stay  we enjoyed it 
598191167,A decent stay  especially for the winter price  I only stayed at this place   nights  and on the first I arrived late from the airport  plus it was dead of winter  so I cant comment too much on the neighborhood or enjoying this place in decent weather  I can concur w other reviews that  despite photo instructions sent to me beforehand  the entry was confusing  and I stood in the dark and pouring rain for a good       min unable to open the lock box  once I finally found it  Fortunately  the host called me back with lightening speed and solved the problem by telling me how to access housekeepings keys  Anyway  the bed and linens were awesome  as were the bathroom toiletries and water pressure  Wifi was great  The floor creaked like crazy  to be expected in some of these older spaces   and I felt bad for the folks staying below me every time I even tip toed in the apartment    plus I could hear their TV  as well  I was hoping to take advantage of the Smart TV Netflix on the night I arrived  but could only get as far as the message  There are too many apps   etc   you must delete     and  There are too many people using this account   Thats ok  because the sofa was super uncomfortable  so I went to bed  Thanks  Was at first happy to get such specific instructions with photos  but upon arrival  in the dark  in the rain  the photos  specifically the signage in the photos  did not meet the actual signage  so I got very confused in the dark  then the code for the lock didnt work so I had to use housekeeping keys after calling the host number  I only stayed for   nights  in the dead of Chicago winter  and to see what was ultimately an     addition  with the many taxes here  airbb service fee and cleaning  to the nightly charge was     a bit absurd  but i dont know that it could have been avoided
472941423,Great location   Parking Garage     overnight if you arent able to find close street parking Great stay  great location 
703853632,Great home
596391750,We enjoyed our stay at this Zencity apartment in Wicker Park  The master bath is fantastic  Great big shower and spa tub with excellent water pressure  Beds are SUPER comfortable    I do have a few nitpicks    Two bags of garbage were sitting in the living room when we arrived  I mentioned this to the host  but the trash remained there for the whole length of our stay    The front entry light was not working  while the steps and porch were icy  not to mention that its a front entry in an urban setting   it should be well lit  Again  I mentioned it to the host to no effect    We stayed in January and the temperature difference between first and second floor is dramatic  If the heat is comfortable on the first floor  you will swelter in the second floor bedrooms  It is also drafty  with cold air pouring through the open chimney flus  The host cant be expected to do anything about this  its just something to be aware of  We enjoyed our stay at this place  The master bath is fantastic  beds are very comfortable  That said  I do think someone should have dropped by to take out the bags of garbage that were left sitting in the living room  Also  there is a front porch security light but it was unclear how to turn it on  I did ask about this when we arrived  The front steps and porch were icy  not to mention that its a front entry in an urban setting   it should be well lit  Bags of garbage sitting in the living room during our stay 
664000244,Nice place
663373353,Great size and location  Walking distance to groceries and coffee  Perfect for a short trip  Front door was extremely difficult to unlock Glass coffee table was not wiped down and there was plastic wrap in the living room If it was properly cleaned and easy to lock unlock
463676369,Super clean and very modern  Good central location to the Lou  No designated parking space with the unit  so be prepared to pay for parking meters on any day besides Sunday   Didnt get a good sense from the ad about the parking situation  which turned out fine since meter parking was only an issue one weekend morning  But that would be good to include in the ad so folks now in the future  
711447542,Very clean Only thing I didnt like was having to wait to check in at  pm  I arrived in Chicago at   am  And then having to check out early at   am
656423302,The place has cleanliness issues and lacked amenities that the host said he would send later  but just false promises The smell was very off putting and a bad start to my trip but the hosts false promises really turned my mood off  I would expect a lot more professionalism for something like zencity  I would have been much more accommodating if the host just said that he couldnt provide anything and acknowledged the smell in the place  There was no oil and the kitchen lacked basic supplies even though it was listed that basic amenities were provided  Specifically no cooking oil and paper towels   As I walked into the bnb the entire place smelled like dirty water  which made it very hard to believe if it was disinfected or cleaned at all  I had to turn all exhaust fans and open the windows to air out the smell The host said he would send airfreshner and oil but all false promises and nothing was delivered
622465106,They changed my Airbnb   hours before but wouldnt reply to my messages or questions regarding it  so I went ahead and went to the new Airbnb provided by them and it was dirty with hair everywhere and a pair or socks under the bed that wasnt mine   Lets me know it wasnt cleaned properly  There was hair everywhere  And not just one specific type  I looked under the bed as I was plugging in my charger and there were a pair of socks sitting there   They werent mine  so that lets me know they differently did not clean  I had multiple questions regarding my stay and they never replied even after they changed my Airbnb they didnt even respond  Not changing the Airbnb   hours before before check in  Actually respond to people thats paying money that have questions  Actually clean the place especially with the virus going around  
659659784,RODENT INFESTATION    UNCLEAN    UNSAFE    TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE    Mouse seen in the kitchen  Rodent traps already placed in the utility closet  Sticky floors  Dirty walls  Towels smelled like cigarette smoke  No salt  pepper  or cooking oil provided as advertised  I am still waiting for a call from management that I was told would happen  and my refund for staying in a rodent infested apartment Stopped responding to issue altogether Good location  Being clean and having described amenities would have helped
654315457,It was nice I seen a mouse running in the kitchen
663897898,The place was nice Thank you The doors was open was able to walk in but not access the elevator
596116389,Nice place     min walk into Chinatown so highly recommend making that walk and checking the area out  Had issues locking the door when leaving  Turns out the magnet wasnt properly placed so that it triggered the locking mechanism  Maybe super glue it so that it doesnt move by accident 
661749717,Great location near lake and amenities   Very roomy unit   Furnishings a little sparse basic   Kitchen fine for reheating and storing leftovers but not equipped well for cooking   Mattress in master bedroom very soft needs replacing   kitchen supplies  Kitchen equipped for actual cooking OR something in write up to be clear it is set up for reheating and storing leftovers but not really cooking   Updating mattress in main bedroom   very used and sunken in uncomfortable
661173417,No WiFi the whole stay  Couldnt work  couldnt use Netflix or any streaming service  The apartment smelled like sewage every single night to the point we didnt even want to be in our room    However the location cannot be beat  Hoping for them that this just happened to be an off week   
449798583,This is in a great neighborhood and is a nice apartment  I would not stay there again though because the bedding  bed  and around the bed were disgusting  To be fair  I have OCD but it should be normal protocol for people to check for bedbugs when traveling  I saw what could be evidence of bedbugs  And the bedding was nasty  I had to go to Target and buy my own sheets  pillow  and comforter just for one night  Because there is no way I would risk bringing bedbugs home with me  Otherwise it was ok with plenty of room to yourself  easy to get in and out  The host was very receptive to my feedback  I think its a busy Airbnb so they may have a lot of turnover and I could have caught them at a time where they didnt do as good of a cleaning job as usual  Thank you  I check for bedbugs so I inspect the bed and around it with a flashlight  First  the comforter had pronounced stains and there was long hairs all over the bedding  It looked like there were possibly bedbugs under the mattress  The floor around the bed had food crumbs and looked like it hadnt been vacuumed in years  If the high cleaning fee was making the place clean  I didnt want to stay in a place that could have bedbugs but I had just driven    hours and was exhausted 
449795653,Everything was as expected  Clean and good location  Thanks for hosting us  Everything was good except for the heating problem  I fully opened the knobs all the time  but the heaters only worked the last day so when we arrived the apartment was extremely hot 
623790667,Great stylish space in a great location    Will definitely look into coming back  Great space just need some soap in the bathroom and comfy chairs on the balcony Comfortable chairs on the balcony
645461541,Let me first start by saying that i hadnt checked into my stay until       PM on July   st        and I checked in with a very pleasant woman    The walls themselves were dirty and we noticed the second we walked in  but we didnt pay much attention  When i walked into the bedroom the towels were dingy and hair hair in them  The shower curtain was yellow and orange  with hair in the shower as well  There were dirty handprints above the bed I was expected to sleep in  In The kitchen  the sponge was not replaced so I can only imagine how dirty the dishes were  In the unc leaned freezer  the ice tray was half full and look as if it was used as an ashtray or something   the previous occupants left   uncased beer  And the microwave was BARELY in working condition  There was a fist print in the refrigerator and the A C was not dusted  Immediately upon noticing all of these things  I contacted a Zencity rep through the Airbnb app and he had me send pictures and seemed as if he wanted to be helpful  It was going smooth until I was told that he  didnt understand what was wrong from the pictures that I sent  so I called  While on hold on the FIRST call  I walked downstairs to speak with the lady that I checked in with  but she was no longer there there was a young man and he was very helpful he provided me a different number  One that I hadnt called already  I got a little further this call  they told me they they would have a property manager call me  I ATTEMPTED to express my concerns with him   frustrated  YES  frantic  YES because it was very hard to even get to speak with him  He immediately cut me off and said  maam  maam   you need to calm down  and proceeded to tell me how he had complaints about me harassing and threatening door staff   which NEVER happened  Even after everything was settled I spoke with the gentleman who only gave me a phone number and was MORE than compassionate and understanding  the Property manager that I spoke with  Gary  told me that security was notified of these false allegations and that they were going to come up and  AND I QUOTE   DRAG me off the property  Im not sure if thats how they run their business but I want no parts and I dont want anyone else to have to encounter this unprofessional business    Not to mention the time i was lied to    When speaking with the Zencity rep through the AirBNB app  he told me that the room was cleaned THE DAY that I checked in            but the whiteboard posted had the date           on it      All in all AirBNB was extremely helpful in getting me my money back  he was friendly and responded to me in a very timely manner so that i wasnt without somewhere to stay my first night in Chicago  He even gave me a voucher for my next stay  So i was satisfied in the end 
645264710,Nice place  Would be nicer if the bed was more sturdy
559677808,Great value and location  Photos are a little misleading but on the whole  space was good  clean and spacious  Lacking some living room furniture and the existing couch was not in great shape and lacked some other amenities but on the whole  they were adequate  Zencity was responsive and helpful 
720501267,Apartment  Check in was very easy  The front door attendant was super friendly and gave us our keys and explained everything we needed to know about the building    This place had everything my girlfriend and I needed to bring in      safely  basic kitchen essentials  cleaning supplies  fresh toiletries  washer   dryer  etc  We were able to make a few meals during the few days we were here  The apartment also had great lighting and a great view since it was located on the top floor    Other residents in the building were very mindful of COVID and would wait for a different elevator and maintain  ft apart as well    Parking  We took two cars and parking wasnt a problem for us  When we arrived at around   PM the first night  the parking lot was full but people were constantly leaving so we were able to grab two spots  no problems  Same goes for the next few days we were there    Location  The location was great too  Safe neighborhood and was within a    minute walk to some great restaurants  Japanese  Thai  Chinese   bodegas  a shopping plaza with Trader Joes Walsgreens etc  So finding food and supplies while we were in town was not bad at all    Promontory Point is literally right across from the apartment and served as a great outdoor walking trail  We were about a    minute drive from Cloud Gate  the Riverwalk  etc    Overall  the next time were in Chicago  I would definitely consider staying here again  Its was like staying in a hotel but not  Thank you so much for letting us stay  The place was really nice and we were glad to bring in      there  Some of the cookware and drinkware had some minor gunk on them  It wasnt too big of a deal but threw us off a bit due to COVID concerns  We were just glad that there were cleaning supplies so we can take care of it ourselves 
720475310,Bang for your buck  Very spacious   Easy to reach host  The building itself is very luxurious and its a steal for the price  Hey guys  The windows have a lot of leak in them   Itll save u money to fix it  Specially the ones near the cooler fixtures in the living room and the bedroom with attached bathroom  The little space between the cooler and window is leaking   Parking is not easily available but everything else was good
661712765,If you like access to TV or internet  do not stay here   No TV and no internet after repeated conversations with Zencity   TV and internet are basic amenities that were not provided as advertised
719772540,So so
655606388,Overall a nice place  a few things that could be fixed but was worth the money  Over all a very nice place  There was so parts that were dirty  I did want you to know the couch had a cigarette burn in it  the coffee grinder was broken  the air was out  and the dryer didnt work  There was also a large amount of light bulbs out  Definitely a cool place and I dont regret staying there  I just suggest those fixes  It was clean for the most part  the bathroom toilet couldve been a bit more clean  The windows in the living room were very dirty  I ended up cleaning them just so my girlfriend wouldnt see it before she arrived  They were pretty good with the communication  the air did go out right after we checked in witch was definitely a warm stay 
717894489,Be careful not to laugh or talk to loud  Youll be threatened with having the police called on you or terminating your stay Laughter should not warrant you threatening me with police presence and possibly terminating my stay  I also requested extra blankets  Ive yet to receive them 
635444547,Outstanding location and good value for its price considering the location   A lot of parking spaces  I enjoyed the stay  The location was outstanding  Spacious for two people  However  the dishwasher was broken  the windows were heavily damaged and difficult to close  Very few towels  extra towels  and lacking paper towel kitchen cloth  Venting system needs work  Too many broken accessories
703824569,We did not enjoy this stay  The apartment was decently clean and in a very convenient location for us  but check in was a nightmare  The apartment was also very bright  the curtains couldnt be closed without blocking the radiator and the window A C units  The apartment was bright and loud and we will not stay again  The apartment was incredibly loud and incredibly bright  It was concerning that the curtains were thick and long and went all the way to the floor in front of the radiator  The curtains were very hot all weekend and we could not move them   We also could not shut the curtains to keep the light out because we would block the A C  The toilet ran intermittently all night  the A C units were loud  the bedroom was bright all night and neither of us slept well although we are notoriously heavy sleepers   Additionally  when we arrived  every single window in the unit was UNLOCKED  For a unit on the second floor surrounded by a walk up roof  this was absolutely unacceptable   Checkin was an absolute nightmare  Our code did not work  setting off a loud beeping alarm after a certain amount of attempts  We were standing in the hallway  holding all our bags  and could not get into the unit  Fortunately  someone answered the phone quickly when we called  but we had to download an app and get everything set up ALL while still standing in the hallway  This was unprofessional and uncomfortable  It also appears this is a known issue  as I now realize previous reviews also said that checkin was awful   Housekeeping also busted in before checkout time with no warning and without knocking  This stay was      uncomfortable and we will not stay again  We thought we were getting a better place than it actually was  The photos looked much nicer than the actual unit 
659673466,Good place to leave your bags  but the air here is hot and stuffy  this place is not nearly as clean as it looked in the photos  other than that i guess its fine  but if you want a clean place  especially if one is going to charge you a     cleaning fee you would hope it would be cleaner  And the window unit was struggling to cool of the livingroom alone  the besroom has no window unit and no A C  not sure they actually cleaned it before either  tell tell signs like human hair in the clean bedding that was not mine  I have a buzz cut and this was long brunette hair    and bugs and crumbs made me wonder       It was not nearly as clean as the pictures  and also the main reason i picked it was because it looked   clean     The girl i checked in with didnt know what i was talking about until she called someone  You would thin for a    dollar cleaning fee the place would be clean  but between hair found in my bed among other things like roaches im not sure its getting much more than a once over 
553620587,good stay for an airbnb pleasab nt stay  the rooms could be a little cleaner  but overall ok
447989700,To be honest  this was MY WORST AirBNB EXPERIENCE  I was completely shocked because I use AirBNB more than the typical hotel   Ive never experienced anything like this through AirBNB  For starters  check in was a little off  You had to go from one building to another just to retrieve the key  I was traveling with Uber   extra stops means more money paid  Im sure they are able to install a similar lockbox with check in keys in the actual building where the guest will be staying  Also  this listing needs more cookware for the kitchen  Being vegan  I make my own meals   would have had to buy a set of knives   other utensils if I decided to cook  My biggest issue was dealing with the unprofesional employees that I had to communicate with during my stay  They made my stay extremely stressful  Their responses were very slow which caused me to almost be in really bad position outside on the streets with no where to go   I had to threaten to leave a   star rating to get any assistance from a manager and the problems just continued even after I was gone  This is a long review but it isnt even HALF of what I experienced while being here  It all would be too long to describe in full  I did enjoy the speaker they had in the apartment  the location   the decor  Wouldnt stay with Zencity again   def wouldnt recommend to anyone else Check in was super inconvenient Poor customer service
593369405,Im glad there were two rooms because the front room has pigeons right outside the window and they are very loud  The walls are also paper thin and I could hear everything the person under me was doing  I feel that there are better spots in Chicago for the same price and I wont be staying here again  Also  if you are planning on having a car while staying here  you have to park   blocks away  Its a hassle because the gate to the alley is constantly being manually locked behind you  do you will end up having to walk all the way around the building  There is no parking  which is clearly stated in the listing  The nearby parking is confusing and Ive been to Chicago several times  I ended up getting a     ticket because each street only has one sign on it that is very small  If you stay here and are driving  park behind the building  two blocks down  The block right behind is permit parking only  Im glad there were two rooms because the front room has pigeons right outside the window and they are very loud  The walls are also paper thin and I could hear everything the person under me was doing  I feel that there are better spots in Chicago for the same price and I wont be staying here again 
661736974,   Room was not the room pictured   Had no hot water going into our  rd day of stay  Called  messaged  pretty much told to sit and wait until someone showed up 
447988664,Great location  friendly residence And very affordable  However this is not one of Zencitys best room representations  The attention to detail that Im used to while staying in one of their residence just wasnt there on this particular room   I would still recommend this location just know that its simply a place to stay    I like staying with Zencity they communicate well and have many great offerings  They always aim to please and do their best to satisfy  I visited      S Hyde Blvd in October of  last year  The building  the room  and the location were all great  It was obvious that there was a lot of pride that had gone into the upkeep of everything   Unfortunately it seems like the room we had on this trip was more or less thrown together just to say that you had a room available   For example there was nothing in the kitchen cabinets that was clean  The wife went for a glass of water and it appeared that the glasses inside the cabinet hadnt been touched in quite a while  There was sawdust or something in the lower cabinets    The smoke alarm continuously chirped  The couch was also very uncomfortable  as it seemed to sink in the middle    If I was staying for longer than just one night on this trip I wouldve informed you guys to let you know of the disappointment I had with this particular room 
446928741,It feels like a hotel  Its nice and modern  It doesnt feel homey in anyway    theres not a lot of soap in the bathroom  again its like a hotel  and theres nothing in the refrigerator  Theres no room for garbage either  This is the type of place youd stay for a night or two  There was stuff on the sheets and hair  Getting rid of that big lamp    its a hazard  Also adding more soap  shampoo  and stuff like that in the bathroom 
580932994,We had a great stay in KC  Definitely recommend this house if you are coming to KC  Location is perfect 
720492399,Location was perfect  Thank you to Zenicity for hosting 
705408654,Cozy studio apartment in the Plaza  Great location  Good privacy  Apartment itself is nothing special but it was a nice month long stay for us  I paid for the missing fob  yet I can still return the fob if you need it  I dont care  The entire place smelt like stale cigarettes  We used an entire fabreeze odor eliminator canister over the course of a few days and that eventually got the smell out  The carpet flooring is not helping with this issue  im sure  Other than that  everything was neat and tidy for us upon check in 
664890363,Great location  host was very prompt in her replies  and the apt was great  Enjoyed my stay as I was able to get a lot of work done as well as relax   Thank you for letting me stay at your apartment  There was quite a lot of hair in the bathroom  especially in the shower  as well as the bed   It wasnt a huge issue for me to simply wipe it up in the bathroom and wipe it off the bed    Otherwise  I had no issues 
627373633,Place was nice  Couldnt figure out how to change the thermostat and  host was not very helpful  The screen on the thermostat was not turning on at all  Also couldnt figure out how to turn on the outside lights that were located on the patio  host did not respond at all about the lights  The location of the place was very nice  not too far from downtown or some nice restaurants  Areas were filled with dust 
719414002,Great space close to both the park and some good local eateries  Lovely place  It was a pleasure staying with you all  The rug in the living room had some crushed chips and some things left by previous guest 
701877239,The apartment appeared to be anew listing and was a nice size  decorated well and had easy access   Parking on street   blocks away and cleanliness issues are deal breakers   Wont stay again  This appeared to be a newly listed apartment   Parking and cleanliness issues are a deal breaker   Parking was listed as   Free   On premise   in the main description but also listed as    No on site parking   in the rules section   Actually  there is only on street parking   blocks away   There is a new electronic lock on the apartment door   It has a touch screen but only wakes up if you touch the bottom left corner  size      x          Touching the entire screen didnt work    Would have been much easier to find it with a short note on the door or with check in instructions   Also  check in instructions show to use the wooden stairs   These are in immediate need of replacement  Empty water bottles were under the sofa and there were huge  Dust Bunnies  under the bed   Makes you wonder what cleaning and disinfection procedures were really completed  Accepting the reservation took over    hours    A question concerning parking was only answered with check in codes   days later     I had to send   text messages and finally call for check in instructions  door codes and entry instructions when we got within   hour of arrival     The texts had no reply for   hours  Building number is very hard to see  due to vegetation  Issues listed above  Cleanliness  parking  timely response  Check in instructions 
671877024,You really get what you pay for  Me and my girlfriend were looking for a few days away and we found this for cheap  really the only issue we had was the toilet backing up and overflowing all over the bathroom and leaving the apartment smelling like sewage  There was nobody in the apartment to get help from  the phone number provided for the apartment did not connect  and the host took a while to respond when we were dealing with someone elses feces overflowing onto the floor  We were left without a bathroom for the majority of the day we were staying there because it smelled so bad   Everything inside the building was what was stated  however parking was a pain  as there is not metered parking around the building  its all     hour parking during the day   A prior guest had clogged the toilet and the toilet backed up and overflowed  after notifying the owner in the afternoon  a plumber didnt arrive until later that night  leaving us without a toilet and the smell of sewage filling the apartment while the contents of the toilet overflowed onto the ground  After that  a cleaner did not arrive for another hour  leaving the apartment smelling like sewage for the majority of our day at the house  The hallway outside of the apartment smelled like weed  A toilet that did not overflow
662439756,So first of all let me just say the place is beautiful but it absolutely is not what they have shown in the pictures   The whole entire layout is different and it looks like theres a balcony but there is not  Second of all I got there and the air conditioning didnt work at all  I reached out to the host and they said they would contact maintenance and bring me fans  They also said they would give me a partial refund for my inconvenience  I NEVER RECEIVED EITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS  It was    degrees In Kansas City when I arrived  I was literally drenched in sweat before I even unpacked a single thing  In the beginning the host was very responsive and I truly thought I would get at least the fans and hopefully my  partial refund  that THEY suggested to give me  I honestly am so disappointed in the way they handled this situation because I have stayed in a different air bnb through Zencity and didnt have a single issue so I thought the experience would be great  Honestly  if they would have at least brought the fans I wouldnt be so upset  It was soooo not  They have been ignoring me ever since I checked out and have yet to give me my refund as promised  I do not understand why they handled this the way they did but I definitely wont be booking any more AirBnBs through these people  The location was great though  very close to everything but thats about it  You guys are so unprofessional for the way you handled my stay  No air conditioning  it never got fixed and you said you would bring me fans and give me a partial refund and I never received either of those things  I will be notifying Air BNB and figuring out how I can get my refund because this is absolutely ridiculous
718605787,You will love the location  Many restaurants and stores to explore just steps from the apartment  This is a beautiful apartment in a beautiful location  My only issue was the heat and then the electricity that blew  I used to live in St Louis county  I never knew the CWE was so nice  I wish we couldve stayed   No heat  The radiators need servicing  
674008633,Great place to stay if youre in town Great place  only issue was the bathroom room sink counter and tub    it was hair all over the counter like a man had shaved their before we arrived   it was invisible to the eye only way to know it was there was to wipe it   
635454218,Some deficiencies in home supplies at the apartment  bring extra toilet paper   but hopefully the hosts will address the issues we raised in our feedback  Nice cool room and very clean on arrival  Would recommend if youre not counting on any supplies listed for kitchen and bath  So we were pretty disappointed with several things during the visit  The place had a half roll of toilet paper and half roll of paper towels and when we ran out of toilet paper and emailed  the suggestion was to check under the sink  which wed already done  we checked everywhere    When we replied that there was no more  there was no response  We bought our own  Were sorry  but thats the very baseline of good hosting    In addition  only two towels were provided  and they didnt even match  One was a large bath towel  and the other was a quite small one  There should be matching towels  and extra towels   In terms of kitchen items provided  there is only a single flimsy fork and two spoons left on the house  If youre going to say you have them  wed suggest you replace the set   Lastly  the ice machine in the freezer is broken  and simply spewing water into the freezer  We were able to manually turn it off  but no ice  no extra ice tray  and no obvious way to fix the ice machine   So there are several ready improvements wed recommend your getting on top of door future guests   Also we had vehicles using our dedicated parking spot during our stay  which may be outside your control  but wanted to make you aware of it    Thanks  Andrew and Carmen No toilet paper or paper towels    Sent an email to them and they suggested checking under the sink but when we advised that there was no extra toilet paper we never got a response Extra toilet paper  extra paper towels  extra silverware  extra towels  two provided didnt even match 
670218219,Great place in the heart of the city   Limited parking  Thank you for being a great host   The apartment met our needs and was very updated and stylish   The parking was the main issue   Probably should have arrived earlier   Was a little scary arriving late in the heart of the city trying to get parking 
717654965,The place was clean and comfortable enough  However  the people who met us at check in and check out werent wearing masks  It made me feel unsafe  because if people arent wearing masks  I wonder how closely the appropriate safety protocols are being followed in the place generally  People who met us at checkin and checkout werent wearing masks 
638455326,This place was good  It had everything we needed for a stay in St  Louis  and only steps away from Forest Park  The only downside was that the WiFi went in and out and the garbage disposal was broken  but the host was quick with  communication 
638503350,Nice small cozy place Hair on the floor
592312261,The place was styled nicely and it was in a great location  We found free street parking near by that was less than a   minute walk  The communication was great  However  the cleanliness of the place was a bit disappointing  Other than that this place was a good spot to stay the night at for a weekend in the city   Thank you so much for hosting us  The place was styled nicely and it was in a great location  We found free parking near by  Your rapid communication was greatly appreciated  Having the option to assess Netflix was great as we were able to watch a comida special before heading out for dinner last night  My suggestion to making this place a   star Airbnb is to fix the bottom boards under the mattress on the bed frame in all the rooms and to do a better job of cleaning  The bed sheets had stains and the bed frames were failing apart  The floors were not vacuumed swept either  as I found a piece of wine cork in the kitchen  The shower curtain was old and dirty  The communication was great and the place was styled nicely  However  the cleanness of the place was surprisingly very disappointing 
592298863,Lovely space  great location  Directions provided for where to find the key were a bit confusing  Key was available in a labeled tin on a table in the unit  rather than on a hook by the door as indicated in the check in message I received through Airbnb  Initial response to my booking and the message with checkin information were both very timely  but I received no responses to my replies to these messages 
664062163,Great location and great facilities The bed and sofa were extremely uncomfortable to us and you may want to think about replacing them  The front door screen did not work when we got there  and once we got into the apartment the fob did not work in the front or back doors  but it did on the parking gate  When we called  I was very impressed that you answered quickly and were able to buzz us into the building  Also you replaced the fob the next day which we appreciated Floors were dirty  shower was dirty  Found female hair on pillows
662952749,Apartment was different then listing and got water didnt work
638174370,Great experience  Would definitely recommend  Thank you for allowing us to share t our home 
665482822,Great place and value 
702533437,Nice place to stay   Does need some minor maintenance  Light bulb needed replaced above vanity   Only one roll of toilet paper was available for   nights  The kitchen was very under supplied   We were told early Saturday morning that someone would deliver items   When we checked out Wednesday morning  those supplies had not been delivered  The rating is because of supplies not being available 
663292967,Loved the neighborhood in and around Lafayette Square and the many great restaurants  coffee shops  parks  etc  especially Clementines creamery and Ted Drewes frozen custard   as well the other sections of town including downtown St  Louis that are all nearby  no more than       minute drive to most places   the management company were there to help and address issues in prompt fashion and were welcoming in other ways outside door box wasnt working
658614424,Make sure that the unit your booking is the unit you are viewing in the advertising  Although the unit I did stay in was decent  it was not what I was looking for in a   day stay  Parking can be very tough  Its all on street and you have to look for the spare free parking other then that its all metered parking  Was a different unit then what was in picture  No washer and dryer in unit like pictures and laundry in basement didn u    t work  Locked out after first time leaving  Keypad stopped working  Took about   min to get anyone to respond  Then had to download an app to get into the keypad  Then app stopped working a day into the stay The pictures matched the unit I was put in
719748447,Overall room was smaller than expected  Surface clean but could use a deeper clean   Easy flexible check in  however no direct contact available with host   No direct contact available  Looked clean overall  Smelled less clean  couch and shower slight BO smell

443784334,Good economic choice for places to stay in the area  Was sent to   different lock boxes over    hours before finally getting the keys to the apt  The host responded quickly to messages over the AirBNB messenger  but when I tried to call the number listed at midnight on the night I checked in because my keys didnt work and I couldnt get in to the apt  the person that answered was extremely unhelpful  I realize messenger is usually convenient  but when a customer needs a guaranteed response  i e  when they are stranded outside the apt in the middle of the night   the number listed needs to be able to reach someone that can help 
656059050,This was a pretty standard  minimalist one bedroom apartment   We did have a few issues  There wasnt a remote for the TV  so we couldnt use it   There was creamer in the fridge  but no coffee and only   packet of sugar   The shower didnt drain so water pooled around our ankles when we showered   Also  there was no actual dining table  just a coffee table in front of the sofa   A dining table would be much more comfortable for when it comes to eating meals  and given COVID     folks are eating take out a lot these days   There were also only   forks  which is kind of strange   Good points  The bed was SUPER comfortable   we  had plenty of linens and shampoo conditioner  as well as hand soap and soap for doing dishes etc  There is a shared  credit card operated laundry room down the hall  bring your own laundry detergent    The pool was closed  as well as the nicer common rooms   The gym was open but we didnt use it  All in all  we appreciated our stay because it was a good rate for being exactly where we needed to be  Thank you  There wasnt a remote for the TV in our room   It would also be great to have coffee and sugar to go with the creamer in the fridge   The shower didnt drain and water pooled around our feet  Other than that  it was as we expected  The bed was SUPER comfortable  Thank you 
637890297,Great place for one or two people  Couch had some questionable stains but other than that the place is great  Amazing little get away and great value for price   Would recommend to anyone  Couch had stains  not sure what they were   Also some cups and pans had irremovable stains
660645400,The location is great for those seeking lake front fun  Walkable to the running path and beach   A little too removed from public transport to be convenient and street parking is hell so dont attempt that  The closest restaurants are a few minutes walk   I had some cleanliness issues and some facilities upkeep issues which I hope the host will resolve  With minor improvements like decent pillows  a better shower head  better cleanliness this could be really great  For me it was just average which is a shame  Honestly this was the first truly disappointing experience I have ever had  I understand youre a corporate  airbnb renter and as such I would expect at least the attention to detail of a moderate hotel chain  I would think twice before staying with zencity again which is a shame  I think the place is fine an d it was just okay  but it could be great with a little bit more care and thats what Ive come to expect from Airbnb as a whole  nLoose toilet seat nDoor off hallway nGrubby old school Shower head that could be amazing with a simple        shower head nHand soap dispenser in bathroom that was totally empty even though there was a full bottle underneath the sink   Like everything else just okay  a key in a little metal case without any other instructions not exactly the   welcome kit  noted in the communications Dust bunnies under the bed  Dirty AC vents intake and exhaust  Stained carpets  Ddidnt feel it lived up to the expectation and cleaning seemed rushed  Didnt feel like there was a particular concern about my reporting stained carpets doors off rails     I will make sure you dont get blamed  is not the sign of caring customer service  A clean place that is properly maintained

662410507,This was our  st First booking with Airbnb  Considering Covid   and the disclaimers stating additional cleaning will be done  That was Not the case  We had to use our Clorox cleaning wipes to clean the bathrooms  the kitchen  the refrigerator Ect  The floors were not clean  The rug wasnt vacuumed  There was a dirty air filter in the laundry room just sitting there for who knows how long  The corners of the bathrooms havent been cleaned in a longtime  There were chip bags under the beds  I reached out to Zencity provided pictures and they said theres nothing they can do  They charge a cleaning fee but the apartment wasnt cleaned for our stay  After several calls and emails they said they cant do anything  All I asked is to be refunded the cleaning fee  They refuse to make this right  I will Not be booking with this company again  Waiting for Stuart which is a supervisor to contact me back   This was our  st First booking with Airbnb  Considering Covid   and the disclaimers stating additional cleaning will be done  That was Not the case  We had to use our Clorox cleaning wipes to clean the bathrooms  the kitchen  the refrigerator  The floors were not clean  The rug wasn u    t vacuumed  There was a dirty air filter in the laundry room just sitting there  The corners of the bathrooms haven u    t been cleaned in a longtime  There were chip bags under the beds  I reached out to Zencity provided pictures and they said there u    s nothing they can do  They charge a cleaning fee but the apartment wasn u    t cleaned for our stay  After several calls and emails they said they can u    t do anything  All I asked is to be refunded the cleaning fee  They refuse to make this right  I will Not be booking with this company again   They blew me off by saying well investigate and get back to you  That never happened and they knew they werent going to help me  They even stalled so I cant even get help from Airbnb  This is not okay all  Just be honest with people  We spent over        for our   day stay  Honesty goes along way  You shouldnt waist peoples time
638448866,Great stay with a cozy feel
624557749,Amazing location  Very stylish and open concept space  Comfortable and clean  Would stay again  Thanks for letting us stay  Great location
619430171,The place was a mess from the previous guests  Obviously the cleaners didnt come through  I contacted the host and didnt get a reply until I contacted air bnb directly  He assured me the cleaners would come the next day  we had to scramble to find a place to stay somewhere else the first night because there was no clean bedding or towels or detergent to wash them  In the morning he again did not reply to my messages about a refund for the first night or when I also asked what time the cleaners would be by because they still werent there by       pm  He didnt respond until I contacted air bnb directly again and they got me a new place to stay and a full refund  Air bnb came through and helped me out a lot but I can not say that for the host here
670519353,We absolutely loved this space  Theres so much to do and eat in walking distance  It was very spacious and accommodating  I would       return  Thanks so much for your hospitality  We had a little bit of trouble with the locks but we were able to make sure that the bottom was locked it wasnt a huge issue  There were a few ants in the bathroom but it wasnt a huge issue either  Spraying some ant spray or getting a couple ant traps for the bathroom might do the trick  Overall  it was a GREAT experience and I would       come back gain  Thank you again 
661296240,The apartment is a basement apartment where the bedroom window was left open  the window screen was up and was not able to be locked which is concerning   The apartment otherwise was fine  but I couldnt get past the safety concern with anyone being able to have access into the bedroom of this apartment   I left and stayed in a hotel but was still charged the price for the majority of the stay for my booking   which should not be the case as I left for safety concerns   The apartment is a basement apartment where the bedroom window was left open and was not able to be locked which is concerning   poor customer service when I had a safety concern with the host
657074158,Good value for last minute find  could be a little bit more well kept  cleaning wise   Other than that nice walk to the lake for morning swims  Nice coffee next door  Need a deep cleaner  Rug has crumbs  sheets had yellow spots  shower curtain had mold  dust in most common spaces  Front desk people didnt answer the phone
327931331,Great location The space was really neat and cozy  but I would suggest getting someone in to spray down the place To get rid of roaches  There was   baby roaches in the kitchen  small baby roaches usually indicate a bigger problem  It may not be your space in general thats infested but your neighbors might be  Possibly even previous guest brought them in 
717221898,Nice apartment with adequate amenities  basic and stylish  Very clear instructions on how to check in and nice host 
637398395,Overall a nice stylish stay  There are plenty of nearby dining options  Comfy and thoughtful 
701177315,The actual unit received was not the same as the picture   There was a flood in the unit during the stay   While the Zencity representative was very nice  no compensation was offered despite the major inconvenience of a serious flood and resulting smell   A discount should have been provided 
658679459,Great location and has gated parking   Only issues we had was access to the door to the apartment and hearing the people above us all night  Thank you for letting us stay in the apartment   Great location and I loved the it had gated parking  The door lock wasnt opening  it was late   I did call and message  and did respond   Door has to be aligned shut to open  The floors needed to be swept   For the most part seemed clean   We did see mice in the basement hallway going to the elevator  never in the apartment 
664642666,It was a great location with easy check in  There was plenty of space and we loved having two beds and baths   Our own issue was that the showers both had hair and random crumbs in it  There was no hand soap and the toilet was dirty in our bathroom as well   We brought up the issue with the shower to the host and we got no response 
667086542,Fantastic location  extremely close to UChicago  nice neighborhood Thank you  we had a nice stay
550907297,This apartment is a   bedroom  which implies there should be seating for at least   people   This apartment in fact has seating for   people  maybe       We had    people  and at times had to pull in seats for the kitchen  which definitely were not as comfortable  Also  the only coffee maker in the apartment is a French press   Although I love French press coffee  its not practical for an apartment that is for    people  This apartment is a   bedroom  which implies there should be seating for at least   people   This apartment in fact has seating for   people  maybe       We had    people  and at times had to pull in seats for the kitchen  which definitely were not as comfortable  Also  the only coffee maker in the apartment is a French press   Although I love French press coffee  its not practical for an apartment that is for    people 
610609883,Great location  so many eateries and bars close by but also a quick    min drive to downtown clubs  The place is a bit messy overall  it looked like it hadnt been deep cleaned  found other peoples stuff under the bed  This wasnt a huge issue because my group was out a lot during the day night  Also  there wasnt enough towels for my group of   and no detergent to be able to wash them  slight inconvenience  but overall good stay for the price  thank you for having us  we had a good overall experience  I suggest hiring cleaners to deep clean the place  it wouldve been nice to have extra towels or detergent to be able to wash them   Did not look like the pictures  The floors were scratched up throughout the place  which is not a major issue but the bathrooms and bedrooms were messy  the shower did not look clean  We found socks and an inhaler underneath one bed  not ours  The place was okay overall but we ran into the issue of not enough towels  no detergent to wash them  a bit messy just looked like it hasnt been cleaned 
661779196,We enjoyed our stay here  The location is very convenient  The space is smaller than it looks in the pictures but it was very sufficient  I stayed with   other friends   Not enough trash in the house  only   small bins upstairs    in the kitchen    in the toilet   Hosts seem quiet picky  my friends and I cleaned the house when we left  there wasnt a big trash outside the airbnb so we neatly put all the trash neatly in a corner but the host still charged us for not disposing it  They definitely need to work on communicating their expectations better   Smaller than expected from photos  Towels had stains Charged us for trash when that was never communicated 
662639849,Was not fully cleaned  Absolutely ridiculous to charge what they are charging to clean the place just to come into it already lived in  The place should be actually cleaned by a cleaning service if you want to charge  times the nights stay   Television sound did not work  The kitchen drawers fall when you pull them out   Door took a long time to figure out  Trash was full  Marks inside the toilet bowl  Asked if there was early check in  no response  Tried to add a guest  no response 
274221206,This is a lovely unit and a great location   Our host was responsive to messages  though we did have some issues  There were not enough essential supplies  only   towels  not enough dishes and kitchenware  one bed was missing a blanket  for our group of seven adults and an infant  Also  apparently the tankless water heater had been set very low and we didnt know why we didnt have any hot water for showers and dish washing until we were provided with instructions for setting the correct temperature  These issues were resolved by the host the following afternoon  but it meant some of us didnt get showers the first morning and couldnt properly wash dishes and baby bottles  In addition  the blinds  which were operated electronically  didnt work and because of this  in the room with two sofabeds  streetlights kept us awake  Our host advised upon our arrival that the previous nights guests had created damage to the blinds as well as other areas of the unit  and that new ones had been ordered but would not be available during our stay  It would have been nice to have had a temporary covering to keep out the light  We were never able to get the television to work as it indicated that the account had not been activated  Most of the issues were resolved  with the exception of the TV  though the resolutions could have been more timely  The beds in the bedrooms were reported to be quite comfortable  the two sofa beds would be best for kids  I understand unexpected events can happen  and appreciate that our host was responsive to our messages  though a better initial supply of essentials that were to be included in the rental would have been appreciated      Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  Additional comments   u   cEssential household supplies that were to be included were insufficiently stocked for the number of guests   u   d   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions  Additional comments   Code to unit was provided early in the afternoon of check in even though Airbnb sent communications saying that the code would be provided three days in advance of the check in day    Great location  The room with the sofabeds had audible street noise all through the night 
666480448,Very spacious and wonderful location  Thank you so much for everything  We had a pleasant stay 
195236496,It sort of feels like a model home  looks very nice  but not always functional  It also just seems incredibly new and designed entirely just to be an Airbnb  with price tags still on the pillows  Pros  Very modern and spacious  and great location if youre looking to hang at Douglas Park every day like we were  Filtered water in the fridge  dishwasher  washer and dryer  The beds feel GREAT  Cons  The TV never worked  and the wifi had to be restarted so didnt work the first day  Once it did  it was often slow and we just used data instead  The keurig was hit or miss  there is are exposed bulbs without shades  and there is no hand soap  The positioning of the windows is such that not a lot of light comes in during the day  The TV never worked for us  and you never replied to my comment about the fact that there should be a covering over the exposed bulbs in the second bedroom   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  
610579660,Upon arriving at the listing and getting settled  we noticed that leftover from previous guest were in the frog and freezer  The sheets were covered in hair and appeared unclean  Bathroom sink and mirrors were not clean  Mud was on steps and floor  Sticky fingerprints on the cups in the cabinet  It was late at night  after    pm   so not much could be done until the next day  After communicating with three different managers of the property  which was frustrating  the cleaning crew came back the next day and cleaned everything and changed the sheets  The steps leading from the front door up to the apartment are very steep corner steps with no handrail  Difficult to maneuver with luggage  Would not recommend for guests who are elderly or who have small children  Listing states its within walking distance to city attractions  and it is a little over a mile from Crown Plaza  but I would not recommend walking through the neighborhood  Thermostat would go down to     at      am  and the only way to adjust it was to manually change the temp  you couldnt change the schedule  so that was inconvenient since it was cold out and having to get out of bed to turn up the heat was not desirable    It was a nice space with good size bedrooms and two bathrooms  Kitchen had everything youd need to eat there  Beds were not the most comfortable  but fine for a couple of nights   States the listing is within walking distance of city attractions  The listing is a mile or more from attractions  AND you have to walk through a very rough neighborhood  I would not suggest doing so   n nAlso  description needs to state or show a picture of the very steep corner staircase that leads from front door up to apartment  Carrying luggage up is difficult  Installing a handrail would be very beneficial  Would not recommend for elderly guests or guests with small children   Bathrooms sinks were dirty and splashes were on the mirrors  so who knows about the rest of the bathroom  Lots of hair on bedsheets that made bed appear very unclean  Leftover food from previous guests left in refrigerator and freezer  Cups in cabinet had sticky fingerprints all over them  Will is listed as the host  When I had a complaint about the cleanliness of the space and messaged through the Air BnB app  Will was not the person to respond  When I messaged to ask if the cleaning crew was finished thoroughly cleaning the space  no one responded back to me  Finally found a phone number to contact Will  who informed me he was no longer the manager of the space but has sublet it to someone else  He did get in contact with one of the new managers who then contacted me  This person was a totally different person than who had messaged me on the app  So I had to explain myself three different times to three different people  which was very frustrating  Described as being close to city attractions  walking distance  in an up and coming neighborhood  While the listing is a little over a mile from places like Crown Plaza  it is not a neighborhood I would ever feel safe walking through  Cleanliness  Better area neighborhood 
598703711,This place was very nice inside and convenient to walk to the park  restaurants  and shops in Lafayette Square  My only complaints are that the apartment did not have a key fob for the gated parking that is promised in the amenities  I called about this fob and talked to a representative but did not hear anything back during my stay  Also the complex hallways and the apartment have an overbearing air freshener smell  Did not have key fob for parking Common areas and apartment had an extremely strong air freshener smell No response after I called about the key fob
634028092,Easy  clean  and the laundry was a great touch 
666794966,It was nice   
578118633,Conveniently located quaint cottage with a super responsive host   Note that the neighborhood is exactly as the host describes  an eclectic inner city neighborhood    It might not be important to everyone  but only one of the bathrooms had a shower   The host had breakfast foods in the kitchen   The host also went above and beyond by shoveling fresh snow on the walkway between the driveway and the front door  Thanks for being such a wonderful host   We really appreciated your quick responses   The house was everything you said it would be  but I do have a few suggestions if youre interested      since the lighting is a little complicated   you might want to consider labeling switches and even including small signs in appropriate areas describing some of the items currently kept in the guest information booklet     dont forget to check on your ice maker     the internet was hit or miss   We didnt look for the router  but you might consider putting a timer on it so that it re sets in the middle of the night   It didnt affect our trip at all  it was just something we noticed   By the way  upon arrival  all of the doors except the front door were unlocked   I dont know if that was your plan   This wasnt a big deal since we were four guys  but it might have made a young family uneasy   Thanks again for a wonderful stay   It would have been helpful to note that one of the bathrooms did not have a shower  
470048850,Nice  clean place  Good location in Hyde Park  close to stores  transportation and the U of Chicago campus 
493615869,It only gets bad points because of our check in  The house itself was great  Good size for   people    person would be perfect  Its a visibly old building  but the inside of the house was fairly new and modernized  Nice open space  Plenty of closet space  Bed was very very comfortable  Inside of building did smell  but at least the house didnt  Difficult finding the house  Idk if there were  but there should be explicit directions that its to the right of the elevator  and not around the hall like the signs say  We didnt get to use the kitchen but it was a nice size  AC worked perfectly  Plenty of hot water  Loved that there was a full length mirror  Would have loved a couch or sofa  Didnt use the tv WiFi but good to know theyre available  Front desk concierge was no where to be found  We waited over an hour until they finally showed up and provided no reason when asked why it took so long 
492919137,I would not choose to stay here again  Upon arriving the directions were great describing where the lockbox was but  locating our room took a bit  A message about where the stairwell was located and that it was on the second floor would have been helpful  I read the reviews saying the place was very clean but  unfortunately I entered to find a studio apartment with no couch  as it was listed   a white comforter that was stained up quite a bit speckled with black curly hairs when pulling back the sheets  The bathroom also had black hairs in the shower to match  The coffee pot as described in amenities was a French press that had a broken plunger making it useless for coffee  I attempted to use the hair dryer that was provided in the bathroom as I didnt bring my own  I turned it on and it began to smoke  Thankfully my trip was short  I spent a total of   hrs here for a total of       I would have been better off sleeping in my car 
667562516,Decent place  good location  Near the el train so its pretty loud in the front bedroom throughout the night   Be sure to try the taco place downstairs  Maybe leave multiple keys or a backup  Its a two bedroom Airbnb and there is only one key  which makes it easy to forget the key in the apartment  We got locked out and had to be let in by a neighbor  and she mentioned that this has happened several times 
441075293,This was by far my worst AirBnB experience and I can only advise everybody else to not make the same mistake and book the apartment   The entire apartment was extremely unhygienic and dirty   there were hairs and even traces of food in both of the beds  In addition  the floor had obviously not been cleaned and the table in the living room was so dirty that we couldnt even put our things on it   When I informed Zencity about these issues  they did not take any action  regardless of the exorbitant price that we paid for the apartment  Once I brought attention to this problem again  they stopped replying at all  so dont except any cooperation or assistance from their side  Is that how you treat your customers   The final disappointed happened the day of our check out  We were supposed to leave at    am  However  Zencitys cleaning staff entered the apartment about half an hour earlier without a warning  At that time  I was coming right out of the shower  covered with nothing but a towel  I felt extremely violated in my privacy   All in all  our stay has been beyond terrible and I certainly cant recommend neither the apartment nor the host  I am still waiting to hear back from you 
667507820,very well cleaned and a good location  though the apartment has a bit more wear on than in the pictures  the space is much more beat up than it looks  the wifi listing was the wrong address but the correct password  
667567578,The location cant be beat  Right in the middle of everything  Walkable distance to lots of restaurants and stores  Parking was a pain and I would have appreciated a spot with the place because you end up having to walk each time you leave    There were some dirty glasses and a plate  along with some dirty spots on the comforter which was a bit disturbing    Overall  an adorable place in a great area  There were dirty glasses and a plate in the cabinet  The comforter had some dirty spots  Street parking was a nuisance  but was in the listing just hadnt seen it 
123294349,Super convenient location  right next to a starbucks and easy walk to close by restaurants  Whole foods nearby too  Michigan ave shopping is blocks away  Great price 
623825288,Nice location
703005296,Amazing view  Great hosts  Responsive  helpful   kind  Amazing view  I would skip the soft furniture  Could be cleaner 
668109965,Great location  Thanks for being a good host  Beautiful area  But the place could use a better clean 
704655876,Something I Didnt Expect
635997055,The apartment is not bad  I felt safe the whole time I was there  It is convenient to many shops and restaurants  The mattress was super firm as were the pillows  That was tough to get comfortable with  I would just suggest responding to request would have made the stay more satisfying  Other than that I was fine  Walked into the bathroom to find the toilet filled with hair and other particles  It was on and around the toilet which made me feel like the whole apartment wasnt cleaned properly  It was nasty and Especially during a global pandemic I mentioned my issue about cleanliness to the host and even sent pictures  However there was no response given  The cleanliness was a factor for me  I had to go to the grocery store and purchase cleaning supplies  just to return and clean the space for peace of mind 
508283324,The apartment shows signs of wear and tear  The wooden floor was creaking  The location is good and communication with owner was good  It fell short of expectations based on the pictures and description    apartment could be cleaned more thoroughly including outside stairs   a small investment could help it look and function better  more towels  fixing simple things  more kitchen utensils etc   fix the blinds remote  Quality of the apartment was not good  It was advertised as brand new but throughout the apartment there were things that needed fixing  The whole floor was creaking  the doors were creaking  The toilet in the bathroom was wobbly at the base  Kitchen faucet was not sturdy  Baseboards in the bathroom were dirty
660334756,If safety  cleanliness and communication is important to you I wouldnt suggest booking  Photos are deceiving  I left and canceled Not even knowing where I would go  But I knew I wasnt going to stay there  Please take the time to go to place and look around  Would you want your family Coming from out of town to stay here or experience  bad communication or for place to not be ready at time stated on booking  I suggest serious upgrade s including entry and inform people to be careful in this area  Cleaning is so important especially during this COVID   times and I m disappointed that this is Not top priority with your company   The photos in add don u    t show stains dirty window and the bad area  Thank  I asked for early check in since I was driving from out of town when i booked  Didnt get a response so I assumed it was alright  I was told I couldnt and place wouldnt be ready at the time stated I could check in  They would notify me  They didnt notify me at all I have photos of sofa  with stains carpet  stains   walls need painting  Windows dirty  There is a wire going across the floor that is so dangerous  We were getting bit by bugs  Rust around shower in bathroom  In need of upgrade and  TLC  Horrible at communicating  Question s asked at booking NOT answered  Even asked several times with no response i was told they would notify me when place was ready  Sat out front for        No response Area looks very unsafe  People around and going in and out of building  suspicious  looking  Dirty and not so neat looking surroundings  For the area and the looks of the place   dirty furniture and carpet  price was a little high  I expected  better 
291366972,The place is remodeled in good shape  the shower is tough for someone of average size  the loft area would be okay for   kids but not adults  parking is tough with the narrow and steep incline driveway  Thanks for having us   The only thing to consider is the   loft   space is not much of a space  I would be interested to know the dimensions of the area where you have to crawl through to go to the sleeping area  Also the sleeping area doesnt have a mattress    The area seems to be a little run down  for example there is a house across the street that has the windows and doors covered with boards  it needs to be tore down  PArking is not ideal as the driveway is very narrow and a steep incline  For the money it seemed we could have maybe stayed at a decent hotel for equivalent price
310634719,The apartment that sleeps   was newly renovated   had great possibilities   We had a group of   staying here  Brian Host did great allowing us an early check  in as we all came in to Chicago for my sons wedding weekend   Brian informed me a couple hours prior to arrival that the some of the shades   a bedroom door had been ruined by guests the night before  He also told me later that a towel rack had been torn down by them    Brian said he tentatively fixed all those items but had to get special parts for all before they could be permanently fixed   Unfortunately  the towel rack wouldnt stay up  the door wouldnt shut   the windows in the common area didnt all have shades   Shortly after we all arrived we realized that there were only   place settings of dishes  cups  plates  cereal bowls   I sent my husband to the store to pick up some paper products to get us by   When he returned we realized there were no serving dishes or serving utensils   As we started to get ready for the rehearsal dinner  we found only   bath towels  no wash cloths     hand towel in the   bathrooms    I messaged Brian on this right away and reminded him we had   people staying there   Brian never responded       Later we also realized the only bed pillows were the ones in shams not pillow cases  For the   sofa beds we were only able to find   set of sheets  There were   pillows found but only   pillow case    It was bad enough that the towel rack  shades  door had been ruined but then not to have the necessary towels  linens   dishes was unacceptable for a unit that was available for up to   people   Then to have the host not acknowledge my message on the shortage of bath towels  washcloths   dishes was very unprofessional   It really makes me question the integrity of the host   I am very embarrassed that I asked special friends to stay with us at this Airbnb    Listed to sleep   people however we had   people in our group   There were only   bath towels provided    hand towel  no wash cloths for   bathrooms   There was only   coffee cups    plates     cereal bowls  No serving bowls  platters  utensils  pans  There were no dish towels only dish cloths were in a cupboard   Brian provided the code prior to an early check in request  And he informed me that the place was damaged by drunken guests the night before our stay was to begin  Though he said he tentatively attached the towel rack that had been ripped off the wall  it didnt stay attached   The place smelled like paint when we arrived   We found that our feet turned black if we walked on the floor barefooted   Brian didnt respond when I alerted him that we didnt have enough towels or dishes for the number of guests       though he listed the place was for up to   guests   I had informed Brian months ago that the   of us were coming into town for my sons wedding  Unbelievable that a host would not respond to apologize   personally deliver what was needed since we were already staying in a damaged apartment  
616391083,Horrible host  not worth the money for the smell  broken toilet and dirty sunken couch  Dont recommend zen city at all stay away  Overlooked and ignored my questions 
670232755,              
670582553,If youre looking for a cheap Airbnb this is the best for you The ceiling was peeling also was dirty in the mist random spots
670538933,Parking is ridiculous took an hour to find a park  Plumbing was horrible  Toilet was clogged for almost   days of my   day stay Terrible plumbing  Very disgusting   embarrassing  I need a discount on my stay  Ive had the worst experience  Very small bed   uncomfortable  The toilet was clogged for almost   days before maintenance came Took forever for host to find maintenance No parking   horrible Definitely not worth the money
717674417,Very well located  stylish space  The space isnt well lit  bulbs were burned out and you need at least one more floor lamp  One more comfortable chair in the living room would be good We had to wait an extra       minutes before checking in because the space wasnt ready The space was very bare bones   no extras and no guide for the guests
717288295,Unsanitary bathroom and bedroom  Small and large hairs all over the shower  clearly not cleaned   Small and large hairs all over the linen  Not cleaned properly   Cleaning supplies found in the place were  fresheners   No laundry soap for the washer  Likely does not have proper cleaning supplies  ex laundry detergent  to clean between stays  Hot water for shower did not work well  Had to cancel stay    Host did let me retrieve forgotten item   Hot water in shower did not work  Unsanitary bathroom and bedroom  Small and large hairs all over the shower  clearly not cleaned   Small and large hairs all over the linen  Not cleaned properly   Cleaning supplies found in the place were  fresheners   No laundry soap for the washer  Likely does not have proper cleaning supplies  ex laundry detergent  to clean between stays  Poor insulation Had to get a full refund through Airbnb because owner was not willing to fulfill request  Hot water in shower did not work  Wanted us to clean  Very very unsanitary 
717152522,the price was attractive for   bed  BUT     the unit is in poor condition meaning  the sofa is broken and not practical to seat  bedroom pillows are suggy and old  no hangers cleaningness is on the bad side   over all good location easy to get in  but if Im paying tjis amount expected to get practical thing for my comfort   its annoying me to see that the sofa is completely broken  and NO one care   someone clean the home and notice it for sure  you need to update your unit  sofa is broken and not practical  bedroom pillows are old saggy and grows  missing blinds at guest bedroom  no hangers for clothes  cleaningness of unit is bad especially the floor was with guie spots and unit smell funky  had to buy refresher to unit and open windows   broken sofa  stools too  floor was steaky  dryer was full with lint and unclean area  sofa is broken and dirty   seems like cleaning service did cleaning surface from the top  the quality and condition of unit is poor for the money i payed 
717923623,It was great other than the horrible parking   broken elevator  I had to park   blocks away and walk back to the building in the snow even though theres parking for the apartment residents  The place was on the fifth floor and I had to take the steps with tons of bags  Thanks  it was a great place to stay 
667801793,The place was good however it should be more cleaned  the couch was smelling bad and the kitchen was dirty 
664884339,This apartment was okay   The location is about two miles away from the pin on the map  putting it closer to the Museum  not the hospital  which was why we chose this location    The cleaning was subpar  we found that the bathroom was noticeably less clean than it probably should have been and the rug in front of the TV seemed dirty   During COVID  this isnt what we were hoping for   Parking on the street was fine and they offer Netflix which was nice   The location  other than the incorrect pin was great  it just wasnt what we were looking for when we booked  I would highly recommend adjusting the pin on the map for the location of this listing   As well as taking extra care on cleaning during the COVID    situation   Communicating known damage of the facilities would have been preferred as well because adding a walk through to assess the apartment when we got there added additional stress to our stay   The location pin in the listing was approximately two miles away from the actual location  which was why we booked this specific listing   The rug in the common space seemed to have a decent amount of debris  the fan in the bathroom was full of dust  and the bathroom toilet seat had a hair crusted onto the seat   Very disappointing  especially during COVID  The communication was spotty   There were slow responses and not responding to very direct questions   There was also damage in the apartment  a damaged picture frame  a transition strip that was loose  that should have been previously communicated so we didnt have to feel like we needed to perform our own walk through just to feel comfortable  This location was pinned closer to the hospital  when it is much closer to the Museum   This wouldnt have normally been an issue  but the entire purpose of our stay was to be closer to the hospital 
573983639,Great location  Nicely appointed  Very comfortable and modern  beware of the construction that is currently going on  It starts very early in the morning and doesnt end until much later in the evening  It was the only thing that detracted from the place but its a big deal  It would behoove you to be a bit more specific in regard to the construction situation 
704887242,This place is great  affordable  clean  and has a great view  great location  Everything was great except for the dirty and smelly linen and couch  There was a musty body odor smell on the couch  it is time for that fabric to be washed  The pillows were musty as well as the back up linens of another blanket and the sheets  Its gross and an important part of any accommodations is clean linen  Linen really needs to be cleaned in between stays it seems it was skipped before my stay which is disappointing  The bed linen looked and smelled fairly cleaned out of all the pillows two didnt smell musty  I am happy with my  st Airbnb experience I would book this place again  Hopefully l meme will be more attended to  I just cant believe I packed up all of my things except for my toiletries I forgot which is disappointing  I didnt realize until later I didnt think there is anyway for me to get them back but if there is please let me know  Thank you  The lobby doors are locked going to front desk  so you get in if someone is arriving or leaving  Maybe there is a way to ring the front desk  The place was at a quick glance clean my biggest issue was a lingering musty smell in the air  the place was stuffy  When you sit on the couch it smells musty in which I mean a body odor musty  The couch fabrics need to be cleaned  Then to make it worse some of the bed pillow cases were musty  I checked out the back up linen in the closet like sheets and an extra blanket and it all smelt musty  So pretty much seems the linen had not been cleaned since after previous occupants  The place was clean but linen is important we have to sleep and sit on these things its gross thinking your sleeping in someones sweaty bed  I did not have to contact host I would not know the responsive 
669663564,Very nice accommodations  paying for parking was the only issue  Thanks for a great stay 
669614725,It felt like a home away from home        would rent again Thanks for being a great host 
721030788,Place as was shown in photos and hosts were very responsive  Overall great stay 
668843874,Super comfy bed  A nice stay for a little weekend getaway  Great location  Great value  Loved the space  Personally had no issues   got good value for what we paid 
667081096,  
668104642,Nice place  quiet and clean   Poor rehab work and finishing  poor HVAc drainage contributing to organic growth  poor shower cleaning full of mildew and growth   Light switches dont operate logically  different rooms operate switches from other rooms and so on  very poor electrical work 
622087278,Perfect for traveling for work 
715763499,PROS  Very convenient location  clean  and had almost everything I needed  Host was very responsive   CONS  I had important zoom calls during my stay and the WiFi wasnt working the entire time  I had to stand in the hallway to get wifi signal from another unit  and it was quite frustrating   WiFi was not working during my stay 
670518270,This place is on a perfect location  Close to everything  The space was really cute  comfy and Id definitely come back  Needed a few cleaning and painting finishing touches but that was no big deal I had to sweep the floors upon arrival  some of the blinds needed to be replaced and the place needed a fresh coat of paint  Those werent deal breakers though  it was super cute and comfy
669654090,Private  professional stay with support availability   Very nice  Comfortable interaction with others in passing  Immediate response from leasing agency agency and front desk   Thank you   Parking better than anticipated  Value added with longer stay 
615800777,The place was clean and modern  had plenty of space for three people  and a great location for us to explore downtown   lots of shops and restaurants nearby  One thing to note is that theres an event venue right below the apartment  which can be noisy when its in use   we were there on a Saturday night and could hear loud music from the wedding reception below us till      at night  so might be difficult if you want to go to bed early on a weekend night  Otherwise we enjoyed the place and it had everything we needed  Thanks for everything  we enjoyed our stay and the place was nice  The only thing we would change was that it felt a little bare   we thought it would feel cozier with a little more decor like rugs  plants  throw blankets etc  Also could use a couple more curtains for the windows that dont have them  But overall it was comfortable and we had everything we needed  Appreciated the coffee and basics like salt  pepper and olive oil in the kitchen 
669164771,Communication response time VERY poor  Zero access to amenities   washer dryer gym  bathroom wasnt very clean  Bought my own cleaning supplies  Would not stay here again  Communication Nonexistent
615226289,the space was beautiful and looks just like pictures  the only frustrating part was the lack of response to a couple questions I had regarding parking    and not responding at all to messages when I wasnt able to locate the key fob as well  Not having the FOB makes parking and getting into the building a bit difficult  You cant get into the gated parking or the side door of the building  The location is perfect and the area is nice  There are cute bars restaurants within walking distance and the view from the space is gorgeous  the space was beautiful and exactly liked the pictures   the location was awesome  But responding to my questions and assistance with finding the key FOB would have been helpful  We werent able to park in the closed in parking because we couldnt get in the lot or the door inside the lot to the building without the FOB  Also  not having to punch in the code every time we needed to get back in the door would have been helpful   Another small suggestion might be to provide a few more towels 
614321879,I love staying here  However  with this particular unit  the key fob was missing  I reached out about that and the TV not working and got one replay saying they would try to get me a key fob soon and asked what was wrong with the tv and maybe they could help  When I emailed back what was wrong with the TV but I was more concerned with the key fob  I received no other communication  I adore this space and will continue staying here but I am very upset with the lack of communication  I am upset about this apartment  It was gorgeous but the lack of a response when I reached out is troublesome  Wrote multiple times about the missing key fob and also TV not working  No one responded back 
669048345,Wohnung sehr sauber  super Lage  super Kommunikation und sehr nett Hallo Slawik   bemerke bei der n chsten Vermietung an junge Leute am besten  dass man sehr leise sein soll     Liebe Gr  e  Franzi
664059334,Good location  older home with very steep skinny steps so no older people should rent this location  Also old tub hard for my father in law to use  I already messaged him privately  Photos were not in accurate they were just very bright and made the place look newer and nicer than it was  Food in fridge was moldy and coffee grounds in coffee maker old and nasty
703279002,Nice place the rooftop will be awesome when its finished    club Aura across the street looked pretty fun   Didnt have much cleaning supplies  Didnt have a key for the trash room and back entrance to the building
701831562,   Turn both locks clockwise   the door knob is fixed and wont ever turn from the outside  This took us some figuring  While this unit does not allow smoking  it has been smoked in previously and the smell of stale cigarettes was strong and permeated our clothing after staying there  The neighborhood is awesome and the kitchen is a little bare  no measuring cups  for instance  but there is a toaster and coffee pot   but has new appliances  The dishwasher wont run unless the switch on the wall is activated  Good place to stay if the price is right  but there are lots of  pretty thoughtful  college students around so things can get a little lively on the weekends  They neighbors were really friendly and helpful when we had issues unlocking the door of the unit and the neighborhood is great  The floors throughout the building are incredibly loud  you can hear every movement in the upstairs unit   Perhaps this is already priced into the unit  but it certainly wasnt obvious when we were booking  Also  the light fixture in the main  living  room would not full illuminate on our last day   it could be the lightbulbs  as they would glow slightly but never fully light up    Thanks for letting us stay at your place    Again  the unit has been smoked in and there are holes in the floors   While the host sent instructions on the lock box location  which were helpful  We found  as others had described in their reviews  that working the lots on the door took some insight and understanding  both locks require the key to be turned clockwise and the knob is fixed from the outside   which was frustrating  We figured it out  but it took about    minutes and several conversations with other tenants at      am  The apartment smelled of stale cigarette smoke which was apparent when first entering  Upon returning to our own home  all of our clothes and belongings also smelled of stale cigarette smoke  There are several holes in the floor  mostly in the living tv room  and we saw a mouse in the kitchen  A guide book in the unit would be very helpful  There are idiosynchrasies to the unit that took effort to figure out   including that fact that the dishwasher is only activated when a switch in the kitchen is turned to  on   Chiefly  not being smoked in  With cleaning fee included  one could stay at a decent hotel downtown for a similar price and not smell like smoke 
716258487,Stayed for a couple weeks while my apartment got renovated   Worked a treat 
643345451,This apartment was super comfortable  clean and conveniently located  Overall  would stay here again  especially for solo or business travel   Pros   Heart of Lakeview  well connected to public transit  abundant  paid  street parking outside  Very clean  Extremely easy and clear self check in and check out  quick and clear responses to all questions  Could have been betters   Literally right over the Belmont subway stop  the trains pull up just below the balcony  This makes for slightly less privacy  but it was actually very quiet and not at all disruptive  except for when on the balcony    The only parking option is paid street parking  which requires regular monitoring by mobile app  except for overnight 
711263783, 
636863009,Good for overnight stay  nothing more then overnight  Very hotel like  make sure to bring all your own supplies  soap  toothpaste etc   and extra towels   Glad we had our lawn chairs in the car to sit on the balcony as there were no seats  coffee table No soap No paper towels    roll of tp Understandable that guests provide  there own things  But every airbnb i have stayed at has had soad  toothpaste  condiments  Just something to consider
705945239,The location is the best part of the apartment  Its a nice street well illuminated close to bars and restaurants  The bathroom however is the worst part of the apartment  The rest of the apartment is okay   The photos are taken to show a nice bathroom  When we arrived the bathroom was not as portrayed as in the pictures  It was older  uglier and dirty   The rest of the apartment was okay   I had booked an apartment for one day and then cancelled and booked another apartment for a week  I thought I was booking with  another host but it was the same person  They provided me with the wrong address and caused some confusion in the beginning but nothing too upsetting with checkin  We arrived and the apartment had not been cleaned  everything was left on the floors and the apartment hadnt even been vacuumed   We didnt straight up leave because we didnt have anywhere else to go and were tired because one of us just arrived from a    hour flight  I understand that if a person has an emergency they need to leave but I dont understand how you can say a place is ready when it isnt  The host took a little while to help us understand what was happening  see problems above  but then responded quickly  The location is perfect but this was not a pleasant stay and not worth my money 
707116688,    clean  great location  spacious        fridge door  toilet seat  microwave  and dishwasher broken in rental  Radiator in one bathroom leaking water  Trash in hallway  Smoke detector in hallway beeped the entire stay  Significant stains on couch and chair in living room  We were quite disappointed in rental  Fridge door  microwave  and dishwasher broken in rental  Radiator in bathroom leaking water  Trash in hallway  Smoke detector in hallway beeped the entire stay  Significant stains on couch and chair in living room   Broken amenities   Did not respond when I asked a question about heat  Fridge door  microwave  and dishwasher broken in rental  Radiator in bathroom leaking water  Trash in hallway  Smoke detector in hallway beeped the entire stay  Significant stains on couch and chair in living room 
719829726,It was great place to stay  Location was very good and it was very clean  It would be better to provide more accurate instructions for check in  And Check out procedure is little awkward  I had to come out and drive my car out from parking lot and come back to unit to return fob key and come down to my car again 
672163291,AirBnB ers  please beware of this apartment  If your intention is to stay at a place that is clean this is not the place to stay  The bed linens were infested with hair from previous occupants  not just the one before us  but throughout the existence of this air bnb   They also smelled of body odor  The bathrooms were DIRTY with stains and hairs  It seemed as if the counter tops had not even been wiped down  There was an awful stench throughout the apartment  almost of sewage   The walls and baseboards are dirty and full of dust  The overall condition of the apartment is filthy and not worth a penny of your money  The views through the  very tall  windows are inaccessible if youre below    but beautiful if you meet the height requirement just be careful  you might inhale a dead bug from the windowsill s  that was never wiped away  The host does not respond quickly  The location is great  but the apartment is not worth the location  Inaccurate description of the cleanliness of the apartment   The photos depicted a clean space but that is not at all what my family and I walked in to   Bed sheets were full of hair  Sofa had multiple stains and hairs  Bathrooms were not wiped clean  The tubs had multiple stains from the previous occupants  The window sills were full of dead bugs  The walls and baseboards were dirty and full of dust  The entire apartment had an awful stench  Spider webs in numerous corners of the apartment  Delayed responses Accuracy of description and cleanliness of the space
706923918,Comfy Airbnb that looks just like the pictures  But some loud construction noises in the morning in the unit we were in
713466442,A good apartment for those looking to stay downtown on a budget  We were able to walk the whole of downtown and rarely needed to use the car  You must purchase parking separately which means youll have a bit of a walk from car to room  The apartment building smelled of weed most of the time we were there but it was never too bad once you got inside the apartment  Apartment was great  loved the furnishing  Window sills
660246068,Booked for two nights   stayed less than an hour due to  critters  as he calls it on the pillow  I was told to cancel my booking which would result in me receiving none of my money back for a place I didnt even stay in  Besides the bugs the place is beautiful 
713277648,Great safe area close to the hospital  Thank you   
703040391,Pros  Very spacious and charming Enough bedding and towels  Enough glasses   silverware  and plates Cons  No master bathroom  Very  very dimly lit kitchen Very dimly lit bedrooms and common areas  more lighting is needed all around the place Not enough cooking pans  serving bowls   platters   and cooking utensils  Blinds are hard to pull up and down
700419721,Dont stay here  Its not like the pictures Re evaluate the units door  Its broken and anyone could have gotten into that elevator and up to the room levels and kicked it in   In the inner city and there was so description of that  Photos looked much more modern and cleaner than the place was  The amenities listed were there  like a microwave and a fully loaded kitchen  We couldn u    t even make ramen noodles   Scuffed walls  broken door I feel like we shouldve been told that we would be more downtown  I almost got my purse stolen a block away  For it to be what I expected  More modern and secure  The door was wiggly because it was broken 
672126883,Really enjoyed my stay at Zencitys place  The location is everything  There is a shake shack and whole foods directly across the a street  There are also other really great restaurants within walking distance as well  Zencitys place was really clean and had a full kitchen with lots of pots pans  dishes and utensils  The bed was fairly comfortable and had a lot of pillows  The communication was also very superb  The only complaint I have is that the washer did not work and I stayed there for a week and could not wash my clothes  Zencity did communicate that they had put in a work order with maintenance  but the issue was never fixed  Did not like that  But besides that  I would definitely recommend Zencitys place   If the washer that was displayed in the pictures actually worked 
671588126,Great stylish space  Very comfortable and accommodating  Parking is difficult on the weekends with the Main Street being closed  Would prefer to use the garage parking in the building if they would allow  Overall good experience  The elevator we had access to with the parking kept being reserved without notice so we would have to go out and around the building to access the other side  Either a key to the stairs or garage parking would help tremendously 
706577184,Check in a little complicated  Place was clean over all good stay  But there is no gym on location and the pool closes at  pm which is very misleading   Was told Id get a discount because of that and havnt revived one  The man I spoke to said I would be getting a discount and I dont see that  There u    s no gym  And the pool closes at  pm  
636493695,Overall a nice place to stay  Barebones for the kitchen   no towels  and the bathroom door handle was broken  Great location  cool building  great views  and communicative hosts 
618601780,Really clean comfortable place 
659124602,Great view and location but needs deep cleaned badly  I had to send in many pictures of uncleanliness  The sheets in one of the bedrooms had pubic and strands of hair on them  Upon arrival  we were forces to wash the linen to both of the beds  sweep floors  and clean spider webs from the walls and window ceilings  Lots of scuff marks on the walls  The location and scenery outdoors were amazing  Unfortunately  the place needs some deep cleaning and a new couch  The couch is filthy and we had to place a comforter on it before sitting on it  It was disgusting 
639071985,The room number is incorrect  on the directions  Couldnt find room  WiFi didnt work causing me to miss a meeting which really tainted my experience here  Clean nice room  Gave us a late checkout which was nice  The room number is incorrect  on your directions  WiFi didnt work 
669129296,Great if you plan to visit the City Museum  Coffee beans and a grinder with no lid make it hard to enjoy a cup of coffee   The place was extremely clean  and right now  that is the MOST important thing  Thank you  Would have liked to have information earlier in the day to facilitate planning  Very few restaurants in walking distance  Parking was less than ideal  Noisy at night  Beautiful space  but sparse uncomfortable furniture  I would have been thrilled to pay a little more for a place that felt more like a home and not an open concept cement room  Views were very nice 
640214182,Nice place downtown 
631530867,The unit itself and the location are great  Check in was a little tricky and the building wasnt the most sanitary   That said  when you get into the room  the space is lovely   very stylish and felt clean  The check in instructions said that I could go through an internal door  but the door required the fab  The touch pad at the front was impossible to see in the sunlight   I requested a few       minutes  minutes early check in so I could join a work call  and despite the room being ready  I wasnt allowed   not the usual hospitality I get from airbnb The elevator had dog pee in it for a couple days  and the hallways were not clean
624299911,Great place to stay 
706605876,This place  as well as the view is absolutely beautiful  My only complaint is how squeaky the bed is  Great for sleeping  bad for fun night with your partner  I would stay here again certainly 
152489601,Brians place was very clean  modern  and the beds were very comfortable  Really cool touch with the soap dispensers in the shower   Thank you for hosting us  
671118756,Very cute single apartment with enough amenities to make it cozy for a long stay  Zencity is so accommodating and very quick to respond any time you reach out  Pretty clean apartment as well  I appreciated that there were some cleaning supplies available   especially a small vacuum  thank you    As long as you can figure out a good parking routine  the location is great and within walking distance of everything downtown  Thank you for always being quick to respond and so accommodating  I appreciated the space that you provided and will definitely keep Zencity in mind when booking future trips   I work remotely so having a desk or table area is very important  One was in the photos and listed in the amenities so I wasn u    t worried  Upon arriving  I noticed there wasn u    t one at this location so I reached out to Zencity and asked if there was any way to get one  They were very accommodating and delivered a desk and chair   I appreciated all of the kitchen amenities that were made available  There were some dishes that werent clean so I ended up running everything through the dishwasher when I got there 
656452072,Nice location and stylish spot  with wireless phone charger  not bad  Couldnt find tv remote  room is not cleaned throughout  host respond time is late  address given was different than how it appears on map confused me at first  long door code hard to quickly remember  Living room  there were trash and left over food compartment under couch
667528383,The apartment was beautiful  The level of clean isnt even comparable to most places that Ive stayed at The security guard was also a big help on what to do once you get inside   which can be confusing   Its location is spot on for accessibility to food  night life  etc    Thank you for sharing this place it was exactly what we needed for a quick getaway  Gave  stars due to check in issues   the website allowed for an earlier check in  which I chose  and coming from out of town early only to be told that there is no early check in    Made for a rough start as we walked around for   hours due to this error  So please fix this on your site   Check in details on website differ in person
670194218,Solid location  great communication with Zencity and nice downtown view 
632560310,I really enjoyed our stay  Our host lived close by and was very responsive 
668694845,Clean quaint apartment in the Pilsen area  parking was a challenge in that area but overall my stay was nice Your place is very nice  however I would suggest that you add more appliances such as an electric coffee pot  Also  maybe offer more towels as well  It would be nice if another television was in the home as well  There was a small mishap in the building  but it was handled immediately  Overall my stay was nice and I would stay there again
668780514,The best part about this place is the location  Its close to everything  Bed was comfy and the kitchen was nice    we used it to make a great dinner  The living room area is not as pristine as the photos show  some holes and scuffs on the walls   but its a decent spot for the right price   There were more holes    scuffs than portrayed in the photos  Seemed like there was still work being done to renovate  A maintenance person also tried to come during our stay without notice from the host  
622031060,When I visit Chicago Zencity is my go to  There were ants in the bathroom and well as the kitchen
623016699,Great and convenient location to central west end  forest park  and Barnes Jewish hospital  Friendly doormen  and secure locations Our experience was good  however the bedroom and living room was dirty  There was some black makeup smears on the pillows and bedspread sheets  and debris on the floor in the living room and bedroom 
701168281,The roads in the area are very narrow   Hard to navigate with a truck   Close to great restaurants  Beautiful complex   Very quiet  More dishes would be nice I had to do laundry to have clean towels It took   days for the host to respond
656705548,Very nice space  quite close to the downtown area  My friend and I had a great time during our visit to St  Louis  and our stay with you only helped nurture our fun  I appreciated the inclusion of an ironing board and iron in the closet and I really enjoyed the easy reading material you left out in the common area  I particularly loved learning more about Freida Kahlo    The only issue I took with the space were reoccurring handprints and marks on the walls in the bedroom  bathroom  and living room  Everything else appeared very sanitary    Thank you for having us  I hope you find continued success   Randy
653885905,Make sure you take pictures of things look suspicious to ensure you dont get charge for anything you didnt do The first place never got cleaned before I arrived  Not trying to charge me for a smoking fee when I did nothing of the sort
547627084,Zencity is in a great neighborhood near public transportation and restaurants in Lincoln Park   The host was excellent with communication  The communication with the host was very quick and good   We appreciated the photo showing the key box and the front door   very helpful   Thanks especially for that  Not that the place wasnt clean  but EVERY TIME we entered it  even on the last day  it smelled VERY strongly of cleaning products   We always needed to open the window and door to air it out  The name of your unit is ZenCity   I expected natural cleaning products that dont leave a harsh odor   Towel hooks and coffee are also basics I expected to find 
547282069,This units BEST feature is the location    My goodness   It literally couldnt be more convenient for our weekend Chicago stay    It is right next door to the Belmont  red line  station   You literally walk out the door and up the stairs to the train  and from there can easily get downtown or wherever else    We thought we must have been on the opposite side of the building from the tracks because we barely heard the train at all    So we were surprised when we looked out the window in the day and saw that the window overlooked the train tracks     That is some amazing sound proofing    The unit is a modern studio    sleeping  dining  kitchen areas are all in the same space     There is a big TV on a swing arm that already has Netflix and other services installed   To watch from bed    The unit has good amenities  washer dryer  stove  dishwasher  big fridge   The street it is on is nice  there are a number of cafes and restaurants   Theres a nice little produce market across the street    So we were able to cook a few things  buy fresh fruit   Got my Chicago style dog on the first floor of the building at the Devil Dawgs   That helped me get that Chicago to do checklist item done   and it was good     The only problem we had was there was an inordinate amount of hair on the floors in the bathroom  on the sheets    The rest of the unit was clean   but if all that hair was everywhere it kind of gave us a suspicious feeling wondering how well everything else was cleaned     We got over it  but if that one little bit was fixed it would have been a       experience  Recommend switching out the white sheets with darker sheets   I understand that hair happens    But might as well make it a little harder to spot  The place was relatively clean   But the amount of hair we found  especially the short and curly variety    all over the floor and bathroom and in the bed sheets  kind of made us feel slightly suspicious about the cleanliness of everything in the apartment     But id say these things happen and i there were extra sheets in the closet which we switched out  I realize we arrived during Chicago Marathon so the price was  x higher than normal   i understand   and I feel the price we paid still wasnt bad in that context    But imagining if it was     the price that would have been too good to be true 
633653625,Dont expect much
717300131,Do not rent from them   I was giving crappy check in instructions then asked cancel with the print of full refund only to be scammed       You wrong for not giving me my   back knowing I never stepped foot on your place but its ok because nothing good will come your way for scamming me        Wasn u    t replying right away  Check in didnt work   days straight   The host had me to cancel stating Id get my full refund only to then not agree to give it back   I never stepped foot inside here  still did not get my   back   I had to call more then once to get response   No parking Horrible host money hungry 
611669327,Our stay was great  The location seemed to be in a very safe part of the city and was close to most tourist attractions  Our room had everything we needed for our stay  Our only problem was that we expected to have a fob for private  gated parking  We contacted the host and they said they were working on getting a replacement to us as soon as possible  We were there   days    nights and never received this fob  Luckily there was plenty of room on the road and felt like a safe enough neighborhood to leave my vehicle on the street  The hallways had a very strong smell of room freshener that was way too strong  Made my husband and I nauseous every time we left our room  Our room also had a wet dog smell that went away after a couple nights  Overall good experience and very nice room for the price  Thank you for having us  I would recommend getting rid of the hallway air freshener that is always putting out smells  It was sickeningly strong and made us both nauseous each time we went in the hallway  A setting that sprays every some odd minutes would be just fine  The elevator was strange  It was very off putting as the rest of building was very classy and updated  Every time we got in we made a comment about it  We were also very disappointed that we never received the fob for parking  There was also garbage bags and some smaller garbage that was left in the hallway our entire stay 
438823887,Nice apartment in an interesting  and safe  area   Very convenient for U Chicago  and also easy to get downtown by bus or train   Several decent restaurants and shops within just a few blocks   The apartment was spacious and comfortable  and would have been perfect if there wasnt a problem with the wifi  that was eventually resolved   When the resident says the wifi doesnt work   believe them and get it fixed right away  Instructions for finding key werent quite as clear as they could have been  e g  key box was on the wall outside  which wasnt how the description made it sound   I feel I could have sorted out the wifi issue very quickly if Id had direct contact with a human being instead of the AirBnB mediated message postings 
659654913,The place is really great and an awesome value for the price you pay  Great amenities  great location and views from the property and easy access  only challenge is no free parking but it makes up for it on everything else  Defunitedly a great place to stay if youre visiting KCMO  was my first time in the city and zencitys place is one I would recommend to stay for anyone  Hope you enjoy it like I did   Nana   Thanks for accommodating me and doing what you could to rectify the situation I experienced  Definitely would have liked a better check in process and compensation for my inconveniences but the original place was great and up to expectations and I appreciate the opportunity to stay there   The first listing  the photos didn u    t not look like the actual place  the photos looked way better than the actual place looked   I was intentionally left a broken key fob that didnt work and caused me a lot for inconvenience checking in  went through a lot of stress lugging luggage back and forth from one place to another and having to stay on my feet for a long time trying to figure the situation out after an incredibly long drive was so exhausting  And when I was put in a different place for the night which was not what I booked  I only received a refund of     in comparison to the      I paid in total in compensation for all my inconvenience and adjustment having to stay in a place I did not like very much and having to do all the moving again because my choice was limited due to the timing  Overall it was not the most pleasant and stress free experience I expected for my first time visiting Kansas City  MO  Definitely did not meet the expectations I had but was also not too bad overall as the original place I booked and eventually moved into the second day and stayed in was up to my expectations and was exactly what I wanted  Thank you 
721595008,enjoyable stay but not the best amenities dirty dishes parking was difficult
615825277,Overall  very clean and stylish place on a good location  for a good price  Check in was clunky and took significant effort to get appropriate instructions  WiFi was spotty at times  No check in instructions sent  Difficulty reaching host via messaging  had to call
717719008,Th hey had damages to the apartment and blamed me for it and the host kept messaging about a party and there was only me and my sisters there  He disturbed us the entire time  I was bothered all night about things already discussed before the booking  The couch and chairs were broken
716305574,The stay was okay  was able to find parking and food options were abundant  for a  quick staycation  We had a difficult time accessing keys to unit but representative was both responsive and patient  Space is also bigger than photos which was exciting   Bring cookware  mixing bowls spices measuring cups  if you decide to cook  Overall decent stay for price  The stay was okay  my bf actually went earlier than I did and had a fairly difficult time accessing entry  More specifically the key lock  he actually had the cops called on him as he struggled to get in the unit  After talking to a representative  Jacqueline my bf was able to figure out what to do so kudos to her  She was v understanding and patient through it all  During our stay  My bf and I stayed in and cooked and it wouldve been nice to have more table space and cookware  mixing bowls  spices  measuring cups   It also wouldve been helpful to have disinfecting spray wipes as there was some dirt spots  I also had an incident with the closet door  Not sure how it happened as the door opened and shut perfectly fine  it actually fell on my head while I was looking through my suitcase  thank you for being understanding  Overall it was a decent stay 
627469989,Not bad place  Thought it was a little bigger  Went in the middle of a riot but over all  Its a pretty decent place We called zencity and told about our issue and they told us they cant do anything about it We was in the middle of the riot downtown in st  Louis tried to call and let some one know  Nobody even got back with me  We didnt stay out second night and had to going somewhere else to sleep
644759764,This spot was perfect for visiting friends in the city 
671899764,Parking was horrible but thats all of Chicago  Other than that it was nice
437457678,Very comfortable place to stay with plenty of room  Great location within walking distance to lots of restaurants  stores  and parks  Communication with host was exceptional  Easy check in and check out  Included in me email  I really appreciate the communication
437443289,Great location   convenient for Lincoln Park  Old Town and the L to get into the city Hi  The apartment location is really good  The challenges we had were a lot of the light switches didnt work and there were cleanliness issues in the main bathroom and kitchen  Also  when taking a bath there seemed to be a slight leak which we couldnt work out where it was coming from  With respect to the shower   because there was only   shower curtain  water tended to get everywhere   would be easy to buy a second shower curtain and also maybe replace the shower head  Bathroom floor seemed to be dirty as did the bath and window area  Kitchen was also slightly dirty  ALso   the entrance hall to the building and stairs to the apartment were dirty Bathroom and kitchen need updating 
547266939,The building and apartment are STUNNING and the location can not be beat  However  be aware that if booking a   bedroom unit you will only receive   set of keys  This proved to be an issue as myself and a colleague were traveling together and were on two separate schedules  Zencity wanted to charge us a non refundable     for a second set of keys  We also had an issue with a Zencity rep entering our unit completely unannounced and without a uniform or any credentials  A simple heads up regarding this visit wouldve been appreciated  Highly suggest offering   sets of keys for a   bedroom unit 
711861728,Really enjoyed my stay  the place was very clean and they responded quickly to my request to extend my stay  Had an issue with the blue tooth door on my last day  my code was not reactivated during my extended stay   It took an hour to get resolved but had to be locked out of the apartment late at night  Other than that  my stay was great and I do plan to return 
610540497,Unsafe practices  other people had access to my unit  belongings were moved and an item stolen    Stay at your own risk  Your company utilizes unsafe business practices and seems to care very little about guest safety 
112900451,Easy  fast  comfortable  All was good and easy  Position central and Chris was a great host  Satisfied 
700221443,The floors creak very loudly   The walls are thin but theres not a lot of foot traffic on the same floor    They missed a few areas when cleaning before our arrival  but nothing major    The location is great and you can walk everywhere  The street is very noisy  even at night  Theres a fantastic bar right next to the entrance  Baileys Range    Last time I stayed  I had no issues with parking  This time  the meters closed  I didnt know they could do that   and I had to park a block away in a garage  which I then lost my car in  There were prints on the window and some surfaces 
565705908,Brians place is not what you expect if youre only seeing it from the outside  Looks can be deceiving  Inside  the place is nice and spacious and perfect for a large group  The only thing I will add is that cleanliness could be worked on a bit  The showers werent cleaned very well and there were no cleaning tools for the floors  We ended up bringing our own cleaning supplies to ensure we could spruce the place up a bit  especially after reading some of the prior reviews  The trash can pedal was broken when we arrived but other than that  we enjoyed our stay  I like the area because its a kind of busy neighborhood but the apartment is out of the way   I would stay here again and I would recommend  Brian  I appreciate your hospitality and quick responses  I would suggest offering a few more cleaning supplies like a broom or a swiffer for your guests to keep the floors clean  The trash can was broken when we arrived but I chose not to make a fuss because it was not that big of a deal to us  We brought most of our own cleaning supplies after reading your previous reviews  Other than that  the place was great for our needs  Thanks so much  Kitchen trash can was damaged as well as dryer unit in space  We saw a few centipedes  floors were a bit dusty  showers werent sparkly clean  A few additional cleaning supplies so we could disinfect  sweep  or swiffer the floors  Other than that the space was great 
707146999,What you see in the pictures is what you get  In a lovely part of town  There was some minor cleaning things missed  Overall a nice place to stay  would recommend  
707139081,Zencity is   of the best   There was a strong and weird smell in the apartment  Otherwise  great space   There was a wierd smell in the apartment
707117156,It was very nice  there was no mention of the unit not having central AC  but wasnt an issue after some windows were opened  The oven and a few dishes were dirty though  They might need new cleaning team 
635472492,Convenient location  Dog feces outside door
635467869,Zencitys communication was great and she was able to accommodate an early check in  The kitchen is equipped with a lot of things  The only thing that my girlfriend and I didnt really like was the  cleaning   In consideration whats going on in the world right now  the apartment was not that clean  especially the bathroom  The ceiling seems to be molding from the top which is really unpleasant 
659676040,The place was nice and cozy  I liked that the coffee shop was down the road and we could walk to it  Would definitely stay here again  Dog hair on the floor and coffee table
706611990,Great stylish  br location close to many amenities  Couch is very stiff  other than that the apt was great  Central location  Thanks Carpet could need a deep clean
721659707,Place was in a great location  Only issues were there was trouble with the keypad code and the trash wasnt taken out from the previous guest  Wasnt cleaned very well  The codes for the keypads were wrong and I had to go through this process to download an app with a Bluetooth key which only one person could have  Very inconvenient
635730981,This was a great place  The area sounded a little dangerous  There were many gun shots  Having access the roof top 
546537587,The location of this apartment is nice if you want to spend time in Hyde Park  Getting to downtown Chicago is fairly easy on the buses or the Metra  The apartment is very large and clean  but the common spaces are not cozy or comfortable  We only had two people  and there is very little seating to relax in or hang out  and what is there is very uncomfortable  The beds were very comfortable  There was a problem with water coming in and flooding the floor of the bedroom and kitchen  I was not able to use the closet or walk on much of the carpet in the bedroom nor was I able to cook in the kitchen  Someone was apparently sent during the day while we were gone without letting us know  When we came back  it was worse than before and not cleaned up at all  I was not provided with anything to clean up the mess  The communication around the experience with the flooding was minimal  If it were my place  I wouldve responded immediately  and shown up at the door with towels in hand  The beds were comfortable  but the rest of the furniture left a lot to be desired  It was incredibly uncomfortable to sit on the couch  The place is huge  but the lack of furniture made it hard to enjoy the space 
719460988,Great location  STOP   No heat for   days except for a on bedroom space heart   Freezing   Workers can two different times   Could not fix first time night  Finally got it working the  rd day but left the work mess    Loud clanging radiators all through the night  like a bunch of spoons rolling around in a dryer  that were trying to work but didnt  Unbearably loud   Arrived to dirty dishwasher  soiled living room furniture  toilets that take two flushes to get  residue  down the chute  door knobs coming off    I mean  yes the location is great but this entire experience has been more than disappointing  This place was NOT ready to rent   no heat  old apartment   Dishwasher had a lot of caked on food in its   the couch and chair in living room were soiled 
546371550,Would not stay again  Marijuana smell  bad smelling water  dirty building  Thanks for great communication  See what you are trying to do with the place  needs a lot of work  Would suggest having a discussion with the neighbors regarding hallway areas  There was a marijuana smell from the moment we walked in  Sheets had a wet feel to them  Money would have been better spent on hotel 
673991776,We really enjoyed our stay  The neighborhood was amazing  and the rooms were clean and simple  Would recommend for anyone looking to stay in a vibrant Chicago neighborhood for a reasonable price  We really enjoyed our stay  despite the incident with the neighbor and their couch  The location is amazing and we really enjoyed walking around the neighborhood  Thanks for the stay 
662138647,Clean  cute  comfortable  We just stayed one night but it would have been great for an extended stay  Kitchen is fully equipped  There are lots of restaurants and groceries within walking distance  Bring an eye mask because the bedroom gets a lot of sunlight in the morning  The rooftop terrace was lovely  Super cute place  Maybe some room darkening curtains in the bedroom would help  So sunny    The key code didnt work  The attendant was able to let us in w a physical key but was unable to give us the key so we had to pester him to get in the room when we came and went  ZenCity tried to remedy it w a phone app key but then that stopped working 
123778609,We had a great stay in Chris place  Perfect location for seeing Chicago   There were only   minor issues     The furnace was very loud and would wake us up early     check in was not as smooth as I thought  The scooter was not black so we had to make a guess as to where it was  And there were actually   scooters with lock boxes which made me nervous but I did find the right box  Suggest to improve your instructions  But overall you have a great place and we really enjoyed our stay    Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home 
564308120,The heating didnt work in this place  Not a good situation to be in when its winter in Chicago  They did bring in a space heater to try to heat the place  but it was still below    degrees in the apartment  They brought in extra heaters after I notified them it was still cold  I do appreciate the good communication from them  but it was still not an ideal situation   Heater didnt work 
673448864,Good value for the price  Its off the beaten path and offers comfortable accommodations  I know it is out of your control  but the lobby was very dirty  Like it had not been cleaned in weeks  We enjoyed and felt comfortable in the condo and found it to be clean except for underneath the bed  Being a condo  the lobby and other common areas where very dirty and noisy 
544220463,the good  great location and overall quiet the bad no parking spots ever stairs very steep smells like old sheets very old and polyester bed not good and i believe the neighbors downstairs smoke the ugly  mold on the bathroom  sofa its very dirty  air conditioner unit not working  windows very dirty  its just not what zen city use to offer  not worth the      my    cents  the bathroom has mold and the curtain shower is very dirty with scum the towel handle bar was broken the air conditioner unit its broken and the sofa has stains all over  the sheets are made of polyester and they get extremely hot
638176094,The place was nice The ceiling had a lot of dirt build up and alot of paint needed to be touched up
574801448,Overall the place was nice and had an excellent location  but there were several little problems which really irked us  It was difficult to find the room  we had super noisy neighbours  who I believe are also airbnb guests   and WiFi dropped out very frequently  We werent supplied with a bin and when we messaged to rectify this  they said theyd drop one off but didnt  Biggest thing that annoyed us was the cleanliness   if you are charging a     cleaning fee  already ridiculously high   I expect the place to be absolutely spotless  There was dust all over the windowsills and around the skirting boards in the bathroom  as well as fingerprints on the walls and mirror  The carpet hadnt been properly vacuumed and I stepped on a screw  IF these problems are acknowledged and rectified  I would recommend this place  You wrote to go to ground floor when the elevator actually says basement level  Some signage when on that floor wouldve been useful as we had no idea  Dust along skirting boards in bathroom  windows all had heaps of dust  there was a loose screwdriver in the carpet which I stepped on whilst barefoot  Walls and mirror in bedroom had fingerprints  We didnt have a bin  asked for one and then they just never brought one over  Very unimpressed  Cleaning fee was ridiculous
653551484,needs to be cleaned and ready to move in i arrived and had to take out   bags of trash  there were bits of broken window treatment all over the floor  both beds had been slept in  the kitchen was a mess  and some of the furniture was broken 
585383888,They are ok parking is veryhard to find   Missing washer dryer and dishwasher broken  
661870535,Good place   Just no hot water all weekend No hot water at all No hot water all weekend
672108169,Its a great space to come its close to a lot of restaurants and the zoo  Me and my family enjoyed our stay  I would definitely do it again  The host responded very fast and was on top of everything if I needed it  There were dead ants around the inside lining of the freezer
599325632,I Love staying great space  property and host 
445146037,Great location  huge space  and quiet building  All minor questions I had during the stay were answered almost immediately  Overall great stay  Just a few minor things you might want to know    one fire alarm was dead  my sister is paranoid and checks   and there were only two coffee mugs  Also had to open the windows a lot because the cleaning chemical smell was very intense  Check in details changed right when we got there  Hard to check in via the apartment intercom  couldnt hear us even when no street noise
669134716,This place was not cleaned at all prior to me arriving  Floor was dirty and sticky  The entire place was dirty  The entire place had not been cleaned  I had to sweep  There was hair everywhere and dirt  Had it been cleaned  There was a quiet time but the entire building was loud 
551838714,Ok  Smell was irritating   Media was better than expected  Sadly we had a mouse in the flat   Room deodorant was  breathtaking  
669638649,Pretty solid place and location  Cant complain about the overall stay  I literally Couldnt get into the apartment without someone who lives their letting us in  Their were no instructions on how to find a key or use the code box in the entrance 
112773271,Great neighborhood  average apartment  close to everything and value for the price  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  Additional comments   u   cThere was quite a bit of noise at night from other tenants   u   d   The lack of a deadbolt was very disconcerting and I did have to block the door at night to make sure it closed     
544215359,This apartment is in a great location and is very affordable  however it is not clean and is falling apart at the seams  There was mold and mildew everywhere  The refrigerator was covered in something that resembled vomit  The bathroom sink wouldnt drain and was leaking from its base  The curtain rods and bathroom rods were falling off the walls  probably due to the moisture causing the mold  The owner dismissed my concerns and said the appliances were just old  Old and dirty are two completely different things 
717986524,Checked in very late after driving    hours  still couldnt find it in me to stay  Absolute filth  The lockbox was jammed  instructions complex  parking was scarce  neighborhood sketch  but the icing on the shit cake was the condo itself  Floors have never been mopped  carpets had NEVER been vacuumed  Toilet had pee in it and wouldnt flush  It felt like someone had left their dirty house unexpectedly and then we checked in  The tv was on  couch was clearly recently slept on  dirty laundry in the bedrooms  Trash in the cans and they had the nerve to leave one piece of paper on the paper towel roll as decoration  AVOID THIS PLACE   
105457520,For this area  the cost of the apartment was a great value  I stayed in Chicago for a short time and wasnt planning on spending a lot of time in a hotel  which was double the price   so it was great for what I needed  Check out was the best  simple and easy  However  the building IS under construction   the construction started right outside the window at  am  on the weekdays  that was not ideal  Also  there is a fire station nearby    if youre not a heavy sleeper  some earplugs would be good to have      
301170327,Place is alright  Its in Obamas former neighbourhood and his former place is not too far away  The place was okay with Netflix and a working kitchen  Bathroom door was a bit squeaky  Also on the day of check out there was no possibility of keeping our luggage  With a serviced apartment I would have expected something differently  so we had to figure out an alternative  Otherwise the place is quite okay 
584747833,Got locked out of airbnb  they resolved it later then expected 
104844919,The apartment was an overal letdown  The listing was advertised to have things like a gym and laundry room  Both were currently not available for guests  There were no curtains in the bedroom with bright lampposts in front of the window  Little things such as the internet password were no where to be found  meaning I had to contact the host  Upstairs and downstairs neighbours are loud  amplified in with an older building  The apartment was not particularly clean  especially the bathrooms  Chris tried to help where he could  Curtains were fixed and he was very responsive  However  it didnt chance the fact that I checked into a hotel after a number of nights  Not a place I would recommend if youre planning to stay for a couple of weeks for business    Limited number of photos do not give a good overall impression of the apartment  Amenities were not there as advertised    House manual of some sort would be useful  Especially if internet is down as was in my case   Bathrooms were not clean  Hear from a number of people visible in both bathrooms  The cleaners only clean visible  horizontal surfaces  Under couches and cabinets there hasnt been cleaned in months  Footprints were visbile in windowsills   Chris was quick in his responses  Location is great  It is a main road through downtown so can be busy throughout the night  
669631650,Great location and great value 
196270320,Ubicacion excelente  La Tv no andaba  Anfitrion no va a recibirte  las llaves te las da de manera muy compleja  dentro de una motocicleta con un codigo   le pedi por favor que me ayude ya que estoy embarazada y se nego  No vino a recibirme ni al momento de irme  y luego me acus  de haber roto una cafetera   Demasiado caluroso para pasar    grados  el apartamento no tiene aire y son dos pisos por escalera  en mi estado y SOLA fue muy complejo    u   cLa tv no andaba u   d  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions  entering the home  Additional comments   Estoy embarazada y ni siquiera vino   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  bathroom  shower  dust  Additional comments   Habia tela ara as se nota que limpian por arr arriba   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements  Additional comments   Instrucciones complejas   
297320803,Great place  I was going to give you a   star  but not taking care of the gas leak was really an issue for me  It is not safe to be around gas leaks  thats the only reason gas companies have added smell to it  so people can detect it because is really bad 
102240732,We arrived on a late train  the access to keys  at our convenience was great  Apartment was just how it looks in pics  stark  with no frivolities  but cool in that city loft sort of way     Our host answered questions quickly  Made sure we had opportunity to ask for any amenities or extras we might need and didnt require two day stay      I have no issues with this stay  and if I was in same situation  would definitely stay again  and maybe even longer so we could  explore the neighborhood  It had some cute taverns and food spots right there on the same block      Oh  and Im a very light sleeper  and I had no problems with noise level In This location  It was actually quieter than I expected in an older multi family building in a city setting      Thanks     We only used   forks  but I had to throw   in the sink before I found two that were clean  and I live with   boys under     and they do the dishes     Aside from location  aged charm  and availability not much plus here  On a weekend where there wasnt so much going on in town  I have a feeling that this spot wouldnt rent at this price for a couple  
99692562,The location was perfect  everywhere is walkable or a short uber ride away  The apartment was nice  especially once we figured out there was AC  Chris communicates on directions and questions in an efficient manner  There was scaffolding around the building which definitely detracted  but thats probably not always there  Overall  a good place to stay in downtown   There is scaffolding all around the building which definitely detracts from the apartment and the current view out the window   There was no key in the lockbox which was a little frustrating but he was quick to come and resolve the problem  other than that  very good communication and directions  A little pricey but mainly due to the taxes and what not  great location though 
93986666,Chris was great  kept in constant contact  Directions to get into the unit were perfect and easy  The unit is nice and clean   Great for a     person weekend trip at a reasonable price in a prime location       The room itself is perfect  great for     people spending a weekend in Chicago  The hallway to get in to the room is a little sketchy and dirty  Not the renters fault  but people should be aware   Unit itself though is great   
706919262,Such a great layout and space  The place was clean but can definitely use a deep cleaning to make it pristine  While I appreciate white linens  they did have stains  Also beware of noise complaints from the neighbors  There were a couple blinds in the unit that were broken  No big deal but just mentioning what I noticed  Place wasnt dirty but bathrooms need deep cleaning  In fact the entire unit needs a deep cleaning

72338679,The location of this one bedroom flat was terrific  close by the  Red Line  subway   high end shopping  Water Tower Place  is nearby     s of bars and restaurants of all sorts are also right around the corner  Rush Street    The apartment was clean  everything worked   My stay was on a Sunday evening and I could hear music coming from outside  a bar nearby  But it didnt last past       PM or so       To summarize  this is the perfect place for the location  but amenities were non existent  no information about the wifi connections such as in a  welcome book of instructions to the flat  were to be found  I had to call to find out the password  and the outside scaffolding on the building Im sure will not be up forever           
543341573,I really wanted to give them a    but because of the issue I had  I have to get them at       Everything everything was actor about the listing  I really like the place in a way Its set up  Now I never saw a washer and dryer on the premises like the listing said  I parked on the premises and I dont think I took anybody so I cuz I park in the same spot every night and there are still several open spots  Its a nice happening area  You can walk two different things  The apartment is about   to    minutes away from the arch  The mattress was amazing   Cons  Theres a the hospital the next quarter so you here and see ambulances all night long  They dont have someone else there and buy for emergencies after hours  I had issues with the tub backing up so I wasnt able to take a bath  Keep an emergency crew on hand for after hour or weekend issues  Test to make sure the everything in the harm is working properly 
285765017,The apartment was fitted with basic amenities  and was clean and stylish  However air conditioning unit was quite old and didnt work very well  Aside from this we enjoyed our stay and apartment is as the photos show  only perhaps a little smaller than portrayed   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  size of home   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   Struggled a lot with the lock box   
66500748,The location was really great  Lots great restaurants and bars nearby  Enjoyed my stay          
718098013,Really wish it was a better experience for my first interaction with Zencity   The pictures implicated that the room was a lot bigger  The room was unacceptable and the guest were put to blame  Upon arrival the house keeper didnt have us booked at all the room was wrecked there were blades on the floor the microwave was dirty the washer was filled with dirty dishes there was a black sticky substance on the toilet seat and water stains on the counter top and mirrors   Sprayed but not wiped 
542543046,The apartment was in a good location and our stay was okay   The furniture looked nice but the beds were uncomfortable   The host directly asked me to leave a   star review and then tried to charge me for a broken mirror that was damaged before we arrived   I dont think I would stay at a Zencity place again  Messaged me asking for a   star review but then submitted a false claim for damage through Airbnb  The place looked nice but the beds and couches were uncomfortable and the rate I paid was quite high 
541714092,good feeling home    noisy road only thing that really bothered me thank you for good feeling home front door was stuck   seemed code was not right    bathtub not totaly clean  in livingrooom few hair was not able to get the  door open at arrival   receptionist helped and arranged a worker to make the door run smooth very noisy at busy road cleaner   
63297302,Great location  Big apartment with high ceilings and pretty  historic details  Pictures are accurate  and this was a very convenient and fun place to stay in Chicago  Collin repeatedly reached out to make sure we were enjoying ourselves   If you are worried about finding parking close to the apartment  we found a close overnight lot using  spot hero          
625512729,Great place just house keeping need to work on there work  House Keeping
717715230,I would not recommend this company or property to anyone  Horrible holiday trip for the amount of money I spent  One issue after another with no response from any member of management  Pictures are deceiving  waste of time and money for my daughter and I   There was one towel  it actually had shampoo and conditioner  There was no working lights in bedroom or working ceiling fan  The bed sheets were a wrinkled mess  There was no extra pillows  sheets or even an extra blanket  The pictures clearly were better than in actuality    For the most part it was clean  Not sure when the last person has stayed there so it maybe have been sitting  There was trash in bathroom area  bathtub was dirty and there was trash under the bed  Broken blinds in living area  so I was unable to open or pull up blinds so it was pretty dark inside  I called several times to let management know about problems and I was very unhappy with room  I was told he was in a meeting  which apparently lasted the entire day  This was a terrible night that got worse in the am  To begin my holiday stay I was welcomed by an elevator that did not allow me to use it so I end up waking seven flights of stairs to my room  This continues as trip is still in progress  Several people were and called with no response except manager was in a meeting  I tried to reach out to remedy the issues and find a new place however no one has responded to my emails or calls  It is very inconvenient to deal with all the issues when a large amount of money was paid  Tried to enjoy a holiday trip  instead Im stuck here till I checkout  I wouldnt recommend Zencity  unfortunately I didnt research the properties or the company 
613339404,The location and cleanliness made up for bad communication and the door was hard to get into 
438780836,Very clean suite with views across the street to the park  Definitely preferable to a hotel because of the kitchen for my business trip  There were two WiFi issues   one which we addressed where for the first    hours we were back and forth troubleshooting and the network name and password werent as advertised  and then there was a building wide    hour blackout on WiFi the next weekend as well    Also  the AC was very loud and the room ran hot but Im not sure how to address that The listings location was fine but in person  right on the park on a major street  its not as easy to get from place to place as Id expected  Also  maybe just my room but there was a lot of road noise especially being next door to BJC
435872809,Pros     Building has an elevator    Quiet most of the time  after   PM really quiet    Apartment has most amenities  stove top and oven  big fridge  iron and ironing table    Close to Target and CVS Pharmacy  Some restaurants nearby  Also close to Mccormick center     min drive away    Apartment is big  with   bathrooms    Cons    Apartment was really dirty  there was dirt and hair everywhere  even on the walls  Really never saw such a dirty apartment  The windows were almost opaque with grime  Also it smelled quite bad  The bathtub was dirty and the drain was clogged     Interior is really  really old  by the way  old does not necessarily mean vintage  with dirty carpets  dirty couch  dirty windows and cracked walls  Most doors did not close shut    I had heat in the apartment for   days out of    Due to the cold temperature in the apartment  I caught a cold    Lack of toiletries  only shampoo and shower gel were present    The lock on the entrance door is quite flimsy  would not leave valuables inside unattended   The apartment has very old  not vintage   decaying furnishings  Cracks everywhere  doors were not closing shut  There was no soap at the sink or bathtub  Bathtub had a clogged drain  Had to  buy soap  Draino and Lysol  to clean the bathtub    Dirt and hair all over the place  hair even on the walls in the bathroom and on the vanity table   Outside windows have lost almost all transparency due to grime  Cleaning  toiletries  proper heating and refurbishing 
639084516,We had a good time at the Elm Cottage  The neighborhood is quiet and green  it is easy to go for a walk or a run  Close to everything by car as well  The house is simple but comfortable and Slawik is easily available for anything you need  Thank you  We made it back to Santa Fe and Cincinnati  We had a good time  thank you for everything  Merci  
595085355,Great building
203830343,I was disappointed with this accommodation  The apartment was not clean and smelled like smoke  We booked for two days  but only stayed for one  We stayed the second night at a hotel  The listing said the apartment slept three people  but there was only one blanket so my friend and I shared the bed and the blanket  Great location   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  odors  shower  floors and carpet  Additional comments   Dirty toilet  dirty shower were my main complaints     Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  Additional comments   We were unable to get in touch with the host on the day we checked in      Very expensive for what it was   
268670991,This studio is comfortable and very accessible to downtown   There are some great local restaurants and a food market nearby   Chris was responsive with any questions I had   I already have plans to return  Thank you for the accommodations   It is very conveniently located to my work   It would be helpful to leave instructions on how to use the TV   It would also be easier to have  Keurig for one cup of coffee rather than the French Press   But thanks for the nice towels   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
402810972,This apartment has excellent views and convenient access to the CTA bus lines  making it easy to travel around the city  The rooms are relatively clean  although the furniture is a bit worn and the sink and dishwasher had some problems when we arrived  Overall  Zencity does a fairly good job of managing its properties  particularly as it pertains to check in and check out  Not a bad value for a city where rooms can be prohibitively expensive  Thank you again for hosting us  I let the front desk know about some problems with the sink and dishwasher  but otherwise our stay was pleasant  I would also recommend replenishing the body wash and shampoo for the shower 
594473572,Ive happily used ZenCitys places before  Generally theyre great locations and very convenient  This apartment was quaint  and well apportioned with great light  Had a little issue with cleanliness from last tenant  but ZenCity took care of this quickly  I would recommend them in the future  Walls had smudges  bathroom needed to be swept vacuumed
630252825,Cute place  close to a lot of things downtown 
704647080,The apartment is spacious and stylish  I enjoyed my stay   Its on the ground floor so you have to keep the blinds drawn  but its not much of a bother as there isnt a ton of foot traffic outside  Good news is that the gym is on the ground level as well and is pretty nice for an apartment building  The shower is huge and the bathroom is nice    easily fixed cons    They had changed the sheets and pillowcases  however the not the comforter and there were hairs on it from the previous tenant  not cool      Also the furniture  while super cute  looks worn and the large couch had a white stain from a previous stay  I was out of the apartment most of the time but decided to just avoid that space while relaxing     There is no Brita or water filter on the fridge so I had to stock up on water from the nearby Fields Food  The large couch had white stains on it
433452421,Zencity provides a comfortable and beautiful living environment 
541044836,A great spot for a quick trip to town  Within walking distance to several places and easy to get downtown  Would recommend  Thanks for a wonderful stay  The living room looked like it could have benefitted from a good vacuuming and the microwave could have been a bit cleaner  but the rest of the place was super clean  Only mentioning here as a suggestion for a close look  but nothing that made me feel uncomfortable  A really great spot and fantastic communication 
575264501,My mom and I stayed here while she was visiting me from Texas  I live in Chicago  but I dont have a place of my own  so I rented out Zencitys place for her visit  Overall  it was a good experience  Its not too far from the Loop  a    min bus ride or a    min Lyft Uber  My moms only complaint was lack of hot water  It was hot enough for me  but it didnt ever get super hot  Just warm   and lack of water pressure  My only complaint is that it was a bit hot  Even with cool temperatures outside  it could get rather stuffy inside  We cracked a window  and aside from the street noise  this made it more comfortable in the apartment  But other than those little things  the space was clean and comfortable and a good value for the price   No a  c  Water was lukewarm   A fan or two  The space was nice  but it was hot 
644345103,Nice view  has laundry if youre planning on staying a long time  It is a bit of a hassle to constantly have to be let in by the door man  who were very nice  but its more inconvenient than a hotel  There was never a pool and there is not a pool according to the front desk so thats a bit outrageous that it is in the description  Netflix didnt work even after reset  Strangely placed lamp caused me to injure my head when I got up in the middle of the night  right by the bed   Please be careful I would hate someone to injure themselves worse or better yet remove that lamp  Bathroom tub had hairs in it from another person  Just get a hotel  Netflix didnt work  logged out tried to reset and they would not give me the password Better off just getting a hotel at that price
573615052,This place was NOT what I expected  The pictures make it look newer than what it really is  The apartment could use a upgrade ESPECIALLY the bathroom  the tub was peeling   The only new thing in this apartment was the bedroom and living room floor  This place had a very unpleasant odor  Im not sure what it was but you should definitely consider a new house keeper and plug ins  This place had the bare minimum just a heads up  You might want to bring your own towel and washcloth  they only provided   of each  I do NOT use the same cloth on my face that Ive used to wash my body  No full body mirror only the bathroom  This place almost seems like a college dorm  Im being honest it wasnt what I expected  I booked based usually based on the reviews and this was inaccurate  Parking is HORRIBLE  The only   positive things about this place was the view of Lake Michigan  its definitely a safe place  and the location was close to food spots  Other than that I wasnt satisfied  Ive stayed in much better Airbnbs in the past  I hope you take a lot of these issues into consideration to help avoid complaints  Please consider a apartment upgrade  not just the floor  I was very unsatisfied but I had no choice but to stay  Thank God it wasnt for my entire trip  Never again    The number on the building DID not match what the email said  Very misleading   Again the place was hard to find  When giving out the address you should say the regent towers and give the actual numbers on the outside of the building which was different  That entire block was the      block so Im not sure where exactly you got the      from  And i never receive a welcome kit The bathrooms needs to be upgraded   The shower peeling is unacceptable  The entire apartment had a funky odor     Consider plug ins  This place wasnt the best  The pictures doesnt add up  Not at that block is numbered in the     s and the building is called regent tower or something like that  Thats what you should tell people  I have no idea where you all got      from but i never saw those numbers If people were honest with their reviews and the host  This place had the bare minimum  horrible parking  hard to find  a odor  and it needs a full upgrade not just the floor  ESPECIALLY THE BATHROOM  
432693929,Student type well located functional building Try significantly upgrading LR furniture and accurately represent the property in the listing  Location is great   I think the description should say it is a well situated old building that is student style living  Also the couch and LR table legs are broken  and the couch cannot really be used as a bed  The floor in the last bing room had ants Better furniture  Less student noise   we had students screaming until midnight
432371105,My husband  son  and I stayed in this apartment for over a week  while our St  Louis home was on the market  We were looking for a cozy place to relax in the heart of the city to unwind  We felt the apartment is most suitable for individuals or families who need quick access to the nearby hospitals  and who are less bothered by the helicopter landings and ongoing noise of emergency responders  Though the interior is modern  the building is dated without central heating and air  and lacks a strong WIFI signal  which affected our ability to work from the apartment and to relax with the Smart TV  The kitchen was stocked with the bare minimum  four coffee mugs and settings for three people  We felt it lacked basic necessities  such as a towel and a mixing bowl  It would have helped to have a list of emergency numbers  directions for trash and recycling  info on parking  nearby activities  among other things   We felt the apartment was not adequately stocked for a two bedroom with three people  who stayed for more than a week  There were only four coffee cups  glasses  plates  and bowls  which meant we had to continually hand wash  We didnt find a kitchen towel and had to use pots and pans to make a simple salad   Wifi signal was weak and intermittent  which affected the Smart TV and caused it to go on and off  signal was almost non existent in the back bedrooms  We also found the hanging storage in the closet didnt fit for our winter clothes and was not enough for an extended stay  again for three people  Additional hangers might have helped  The fitted sheets dont fit properly on the bed  and easily come off  so that you are left sleeping on a plastic mattress  An information sheet regarding parking  trash   recycling  emergency contacts  etc  would also be helpful   I asked to change the booking to an earlier date and didnt receive a response  The location is as described  but its proximity next to the hospital   great for patients and students   makes it quite noisy and difficult to sleep with helicopter landings and emergency responders  I should have been more aware of this in booking this location  The ventilation system   window units   are loud and either blow too much air or do not circulate the air when turned down  When we tried to manage with them off  the air was stale and with the windows open  the street noise was a problem  Though the apartment has been updated  the building is dated and does not support modern amenities  such as central air  ceiling fans for ventilation and quality wi fi  I felt the price was high based on the quality of the building  The power strip that was nailed to the back of an end table fell off  We felt that the owner had provided the bare minimum to equip the apartment 
669204620,This honestly was a cool stay   Everything cleaned Guest above was extremely loud
709780708,Super annoying    if we put Music in that tv she was text me   min later       we cant even Watch a movie in peace          that place is nice just not clean we had to clean myself to feel Good      
603661782,The space was clean and nice  It was enjoyable to stay there  However  we were unable to access the off street secured parking our entire stay which made that part less than desirable  Overall  nice place  Would stay again  Thank you for sharing the wonderful space  It was very nice and clean and we enjoyed our stay  It would have been perfect if we could have been able to access secured off street parking   Was promised off street secured parking  Did not receive that  For me  that was one of the selling points  The previous guest took the key fob for the secured parking and the issue was not resolved  I continued to reach out about the issue and the resolution but there was little communication on their part and ultimate no resolution  
569753789,Positives   Excellent part of the city  full amenities  good communication   Negatives   Old building  could hear people through the walls   Overall  we enjoyed our stay but believe we have had better value during previous AirBnB experiences  Overpriced
431269667,Location was great  Apartment was nice  The WiFi details in the apartment and in the house manual were incorrect and once the correct information was conveyed  the service was still unavailable for the first day   Internet details were incorrect and did not work the first day we were there  
545067969,This place is a quick walk to the Museum of Science and Industry  The advertised price was the actual price 
571955222,Fun  artsy space in great neighborhood  Apartment very clean and comfortable  Love view of city  and CTA train that runs past  with very little noise    City living     We enjoyed our stay  And we did appreciate attentive responses to requests about wifi TV not working  and access to second set of keys  But we did feel inconvenienced with no TV wifi entire stay   Initially no mention of fourth floor walk up  and sounded like there was laundry available   Hallways were quite worn and carpet dirty  We had no Wifi or TV available entire stay  A small refund for inconvenience would be appreciated  We used much of our personal data to watch a movie on our phone   
647843075,Great  secure location  One suggestion is to please let guests know where to put their trash  Thanks 
625644527,This spot is really nice  It is more of an apartment setting than any regular stay  That is what we liked  Once you step into the building to check in  you feel like it is an upscale hotel  The only problem was that you can hear everyone around you leaving and making noise  There was some weird noises at night and in the daytime  where we couldnt figure out where the noise was coming from  In addition  the thermometer doesnt really work properly  Other than that  the place was really good  There were no problems 
622869891,Quite place to just relax Thank you for sharing your home its beautiful  I especially love the shower Multiple doors   difficulty  finding mailroom for key It was    the city isnt always the safest place to be
242362757,Great place  Highly recommend staying here  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  Additional comments   u   cTv didn u    t work u   d  
559164118,Overall a good place to stay minus the issues I raised that are all correctable  Dishes left in dishwasher  dishes had  milk residue Ensure WiFi information is correct for unit
621224694,The location is great  very close to Forest Park  Keep in mind it is very close to the hospital so ambulance sounds are frequent  Great natural light and arrangement of the space  The washer and dryer is shared and located in the basement  Many restaurants and grocery stores with in walking distance 
557299015,Nicely located in Lincoln Park  The service was very professional  Space is nice  but the building is run down   The space is nice but the building is quite grungy  The comforter under the duvet was heavily stained
435869528,I did not have a good experience with Zencity  Upon my arrival to the apartment I found the back door facing the alleyway partially open and unlocked  Unable to figure out the locking mechanism I called for assistance  The call center could not help me  Between that and the extremely noisy neighbor I opted to stay elsewhere that night   They suggested different fixes throughout the day the next day  all of which I had tried  until their last suggestion was something new and actually worked to fix the door   My main concern was that Zencity never sent someone to check on the issue and seemed unable to do so even if they had wanted to   The inability to respond to guest issues and emergencies will be why I will most likely not stay with Zencity in the future  The biggest issue with my stay was that I was unable to lock the back door my first night  The apartment was easily accessible from the back alley  The people I called were unable to help me resolve the issue so for my safety I was forced to spend the night elsewhere  spending an extra      at the only available hotel in the vicinity  Over the course of the next day they were able to find someone who knew how to operate the unusual lock  In the future please be sure to have your cleaning staff secure the door or leave instructions for guests on how to do so as the lock is not intuitive  Responsive but not located in the area so unable too assist with any issues  Also did not know who to contact to give me assistance with issues 
624225406, 
709762523,Really enjoyed  staying at the steelyard  The location is great  liked having a gym  rooms were quiet from noise from neighbors  and Internet was fast  Had an issue with the blue tooth door  to no ones fault  those things can happen  but ZenCity was very difficult to deal with for service  Long hold times     min   multiple times during the stay while being locked out of the apartment  They arent local so the site ended up being responsible to offer a solution  Customer service is not very friendly or understanding 
424412266,Fast Response  Easy check in 
425026586,Very clean  good sized space for a couples get away  Had everything we needed and was in a nice part of town  Thank you for letting us stay with you  it was a nice place  I would check on the water in the kitchen because cold water didnt seem to be working in that part of the apartment  Also letting guests know how to turn down the heat would have been helpful  It was a bit of a struggle getting the keys at a later check in time and the name of the check in location would have been a beneficial touch to figuring out if we were in the right place  Maybe if there was a Brita water filter in the space the water in the kitchen was hot and would not turn cold  Also the room was steaming hot so maybe information on how to turn the heat up or down
551683574,  Took a while to figure out to use key pad  Even though it was very simple in the end  Needs a deep cleaning and new paint  Bathroom ceiling is bad  corners of shower dirty  wall by light switch dirty  Two days before we came I had to email and call to get the codes to get in  Earlier communication  About the keys would have been better so I wasnt worried I would be stranded  Make it more homey  less sterile 
526200975,Nice  affordable place to stay  Was worried about parking but it wasnt really a problem 
435466151,The place looked as pictured and was a great place for the price  I gave it   stars because the finishes looked like a quick remodel instead of quality finishes  The ease of check in was great  It felt more like a consistent hotel type of experience rather than some of the Airbnbs I have stayed at in the past 
594047139,Location is great  but they did not clean properly before we got there  They also let us into the room late as well  But overall  it wasnt the worst  Upon arrival  the room looked very nice but when I went to inspect the bedroom there were a lot of black hairs all over the bed  and red stains on the pillow case and comforter  It looked like blood staining  There were also scuffs all over the walls of the entire place  and inside of the closet of the bedroom were lots of weird staining on the walls  Overall  the bedroom needed to be cleaned much better  I dont think they washed the sheets and comforter at all  There was also leftover food in the fridge from the last people who stayed there  I expected it to be spotless  especially after being denied an early check in so that they could  properly clean   So  that was a bit disappointing  But the location was nice and the building workers were very kind  For the location  and the cleanliness  it should be at a lower price per night 
633841136,Super clean and at a beautiful spot
202494809,Fantastic location  It was so easy to hop on to the red line  Can be loud with sirens sometimes  but thats part of being downtown  Older place with a lot of character  My only complaint was with the check in process as the lock box holding the key had an incorrect code and we were soaked from attempting to open it in the rain  However  Chris got back to us quickly with the correct code to get into the lock box Minor things could be repaired such as the leaky bathroom faucet  the entrance closet door  and the toilet paper holder  But other than that everything was fantastic  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions  Additional comments   The code on the lock box was different   
524759690,   
524336275,Great place to stay  Two main issues   there is only AC in living room and was hot to sleep  Window shade in bedroom wouldnt close so also lots of sun right in morning 
593367997,Nice place 
640535502,Very flexible with providing us a new place since the previous renters ruined the original place we booked  The fire alarm was dying so beeped every two minutes for five hours until we resorted to pulling the battery out so we could sleep since maintenance never came 
712679782,Apartment felt bare and a little unclean   If youre looking for cozy  this is not it   If youre looking for a relatively large apartment in a very good Lincoln Park location  this may be it 
658603378,Very cozy space that cant be beat when it comes to location 
415393681,Book with them     If anything is wrong they definitely will respond doesnt matter what time it is Thanks again     Besides the start it ended up being a great trip  Little bumpy start finished well would like to book another 
721526480,Would recommend  Walking distance from a lot of city amenities  Water was cold in the kitchen  And other than parking it was a good stay  Would recommend   Parking  Parking
721700503,Cool place to stay  great location but we had some issues with clean environment but they had great service and helped worked it all out 
708698572,If you get this specific unit make sure to not hit your head on the sink when using the toilet  Other than that its a great deal   Hit my head about   times on the sink when using the toilet  This left a pretty bad taste in my mouth as I had to take Tylenol for the headache  Other than that great experience 
583325465,Overall this truly is a really beautiful place to stay  But there were a handful of things that didnt work properly that we really  really wish had  I feel like this place has potential to be an even higher value with the following   Ensure kitchenware is truly clean before allowing a new tenant to come in  Oil on cookware is unappealing  Also you should look into putting oven mitts in the space   Bathroom  just invest in some bathroom spray for after poops and a full size shampoo  conditioner   body wash  It wont be much more expensive than buying all the tiny single use ones and makes it feel much homier and less like a cold hotel  Also  the toilet was installed improperly on the spring and therefore lurches every time you sit down  Id get that checked out  Also recommend two ply toilet paper and paper towels  The rest of the place is so plush and nice  dont cut corners on these simple and easy amenities   Not sure if its just because its a basement unit but the WiFi does NOT consistently work  Cuts out and boots you off consistently  This is something I had asked about before so it really shouldnt have been a problem  but it was  If the basement has a hard time holding onto WiFi  invest in an extender  Nothing worse than needing to get work done and not being able to do it from your Airbnb   It was not evident to me from the listing that it was an underground unit  There are windows lining the top of the walls that go to the street  Black out curtains were great in the bedroom  I suggest them for living room as well  Had someone stop and look in  crouch  while we were inside and not clothed    The door connected to the parking lot did not lock  fob access  and it took   ish days to actually lock after we complained  Did not make us feel safe as one night when we left  we noticed a man in the lot checking cars for valuables to steal    Safety is a huge priority  This is why we werent keen on soulard originally but the door shouldve been locked  I believe it was due to construction  but it still should be secure      of the time   Should really make an effort to make it transparent in the listing that theres currently construction    especially since this affects doors being left unlocked  noise during the day  and the place being generally littered with flecks  dust  construction bits  etc  Also dog poop all over the front entrance carpet the first two days    its so important to keep the place clean  And dust free or at least be transparent that there will be dust for asthmatics    The water in the shower does not stay cold for long  I would try to find a way to fix this  Impossible for two people to take subsequent showers  We showered together to keep the water hot long enough but thats not everyones situation   Washer does not drain water  This can be a real stick in the mud if youre trying to wash your clothes and get somewhere   issue wasnt resolved during our stay sadly  We had to wring out our wet  dirty clothes  hand wash  and then hang all over the shower to get them to dry  Thats a basic amenity I was disappointed we did not have for our stay during the very busy holidays    Vent is exceptionally loud and the apartment for some reason will not change temperature quickly  Our thermostat was at    most the time and no matter how much we tinkered with the settings  we couldnt get it down to a more comfortable temperature   Finally  its an underground unit and there must be access somewhere as there are ants around in the kitchen      Overall it is literally a beautiful space  The kitchen is gorgeous  The bed is SO comfortable  Its aesthetically so pleasing  But if you want to make it a true value  please address those issues      On a positive note  if you are looking for a visually pleasing place to stay and dont need very reliable WiFi or washing machine  the rest of this is pretty okay to deal with  The listing isnt one of the most expensive in the area and you have to take that into account  The TV will buffer from time to time but the kitchen appliances work and I cannot express how comfortable the bed is  If you can deal with a very minor inconveniences  the main safety issue of the door is now fixed   and a big of construction  Id stay here again  Unfortunately  it didnt quite suit all our needs and I think if some of these issues get addressed  it could be a fantastic spot    Overall this truly is a really beautiful place to stay  But there were a handful of things that didnt work properly that we really  really wish had  Im just dropping by

were more obvious  There are several touches that couldve made it a better value  Including clean amenities  working WiFi and dishwasher  locked doors  properly installed toilet  etc  very nice place but just leaving some constructive criticism 
627577864,I had an issue checking in  The code that I used for the box worked but the box was jammed so I couldnt get my key and fob for my room  I had to call and get my key from the master keychain  I went my whole trip without having a fob to get me on the elevator or into the building  I had to either wait for someone or ask the person at the front desk who had no association with zencity  to let me in  That was a pain in the butt  Other than that  the place was clean  it was fully stocked like it was someones home  and well furnished  I guess I wasnt expecting its surroundings to be what they were but that wasnt a huge deal  I had an issue checking in  The code that I used for the box worked but the box was jammed so I couldnt get my key and fob for my room  I had to call and get my key from the master keychain  I went my whole trip without having a fob to get me on the elevator or into the building  I had to either wait for someone or ask the person at the front desk who had no association with zencity  to let me in  That was a pain in the butt 
413624553,I hate to write negative reviews and I pretty much never do  but I was really disappointed in my stay at this apartment and it negatively affected my experience in Chicago     The unit was run down     I felt unsafe in the unit  I am a small     person  and I could have easily kicked the door down i e  the bolt lock on the door wouldnt have actually prevented someone from breaking into the unit     The bathroom sink and bathroom tub didnt have a steady water stream coming out of them  It was difficult to shower or use the bathroom sink because of this     By far  the worst thing about this unit was that it was extremely cold  There is no way to adjust the AC  The unit is run off of three radiators  One in the living room  bedroom and bathroom  The bathroom and bedroom ones worked  but were still too cold for me  The living room radiator was obviously damaged i e  it had duck tape and water dripping from it into a pot  The living room stayed at a low    degree temperature the entire time  I had to scurry between the bedroom and the bathroom in order to minimize my time in the cold kitchen living room  I did message the host about it and they didnt indicate that there was any way for me to control the unit  Overall  Im really disappointed because I decided to pay more money to stay in this unit in comparison to some of the surrounding units because I thought that I was ensuring there wouldnt be issues with my stay   The house manual says   Feel free to adjust the AC temp to your liking     there was no way to control the AC from the apartment  The living room radiator was clearly damaged  The living room was in the low    degrees my entire stay  I asked the host about AC control and they said I jut needed to wait for the radiator to turn on   There were issues with the heater that were unresolved This place was priced higher relative to the other places to stay in the surrounding area  I chose to pay a higher price thinking that the ZenCity apartment would be much better than the others 
511724655,Very welcoming and clean Couldve had a tv in bedroom  Clearer descriptions of whats in room  Some outlets didnt work and the shower took a while to warm up
454129186,Simple apartment in a nice building  Good location  Loved being close to the lakeshore trail  Hey zencity   Overall had a good stay but as I mentioned in my note  the bathroom floor was really dirty    And less important but the pillows and bed are pretty uncomfortable    Might also be helpful to leave notes on how to make the apt cooler    Thanks Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom 
593341472,Great location and stylist space  Bright natural light  A little too much noise from the bar and bargoers below 
510209041,Its a really nice space with wonderful shops and restaurants nearby   AC wasn u    t working  
453772224,Good location  It touch when you are a Corporate entity for AirBnB   I would suggest better communication and better response   For instance we came back into the room and with no warning there was a repair man in unit   No quick resolve on lock issues  no explanation on parking until we arrived   No explanation on parking  Problems with locks and no quick solution No text ever worked  They were cut off and it was so frustrating 
413518084,The Good   Apartment was in a great location in Hyde Park  I was visiting UChicago and it was an easy walk to campus  with several restaurants  cafes  and a drug store also nearby  Accessing the apartment was easy  with clear instructions and a lockbox in place  Zencity was prompt and helpful with communication throughout the process  and was quick to answer any questions or concerns I might have  The apartment was well stocked with amenities  including an iron  a steamer  a lint roller  extra towels  etc  It is well sized for one or two individuals with a small gas stove  a full sized refrigerator  and a small breakfast nook  I enjoyed the low key decorating style    The Bad   Water pressure in the bathroom wasnt great I usually ended up washing my hands in the bathtub because the waterflow in the sink was frustratingly slow  There was some hair around the bathtub and toilet  which didnt bother me  but I can imagine other future guests may be particular about that  As other reviewers have noted  the lighting in the main room is unusual the kitchen lights need to be on to use the outlets on the far side of the apartment  which is where the television is located  This wasnt a problem for me  but again  I can imagine other guests wanting to be able to watch television without the lights on or wanting to watch TV right before they go to sleep    The Ugly   My phone charger and headphones inexplicably went missing on my second day here   The room came stocked with a phone charger  and a charitable explanation would be that someone came in while I was gone to retrieve that charger and accidentally mistook my charger for that one  It is also POSSIBLE that I may have put my headphones in my pocket and subsequently lost them outside of the apartment  I think this is the most likely explanation for how both items ended up missing   A less charitable explanation would be that someone deliberately took two items that were placed right inside the door of my room      I spoke with the Zencity management about this  and they assured me that no one on their crew came into my room while I was staying there  And I can understand how ridiculous this sounds from their perspective  if someone told me that his phone charger went missing  I would assume he had misplaced it and it was somewhere in his bag  or hed left it in the bathroom  or left it at Starbucks or something  But I am clinically OCD about my stuff  I rarely misplace things  let alone lose them  and I spent several hours scouring the apartment  unpacking my luggage over and over again  and even sorting through the trash can multiple times in an effort to find these items  I am quite confident that I do not have these items  and I am genuinely perplexed as to how they went missing  It seems unlikely that anyone on a cleaning crew or a landlord with an extra key would take the time to come into my room and take these two small things  But any other possible explanations I can think of a burglary with no signs of forced entry  A previously unknown occasion of sleepwalking where I took these items outside the apartment  seem even more far fetched   I dont mean to be throwing around reckless accusations  I chose this apartment because it was well reviewed  and it sounds like most guests have had a really positive time staying here  But this was my experience  I left feeling uncomfortable and unnerved that someone had gone through my stuff  This is the first time when using Airbnb in which I feel like my trust has been violated  and while I dont think it was prompted by any personal animus again  I think the most likely explanation is that someone came into my room and took my phone charger by mistake I would not stay here again  Some hair in the shower  and around the toilet base 
413492683,This place was pretty nice  Looks just like the pictures  Sheets should be cleaned between guest  including pillows and all   Overall just should have been a bit more cleaner in general 
413474412,Nice location  free parking in front of building 
439232297,Just need a parking spot
717933019,Wonderful location  Very tight space  efficient for   person staying there and if youre just there to shower and sleep  Tight space and not enough room for   people staying  The building is old so expect some sewage issues  but the unit is nice and as clean as it can be in an old building 
412844225,This place was exactly as pictured  The balcony was awesome to have its very spacious  Couch wasnt that comfy but we made due  Mattress was comfy   Your place was awesome   other than the cleanliness we were very pleased  I understand most hosts dont clean there own places and hire outside of themselves but man it was bad it was like someone made the bed and left  We also noticed we didnt get hot water at night time Kitchen was filthy and there was oily residue left over on the bathroom counters from who knows what Having all the regular cooking amenities  if balcony was up kept
580435075,I loved this stay  The style of the apartment reminds me of the property brothers lol  The only issue was with the wifi  kept getting kicked out of the connection  but overall great place  I loved this stay  The style of the apartment reminds me of the property brothers lol  The only issue was with the wifi  kept getting kicked out of the connection  but overall great place 
507629763,Creaky floors  thin walls  fast response  no WiFi or tv channels to view  For the amount they want should have just gotten a hotel  It was clean and the instructions to checking in were simple   Creaking floors  Thin walls you can hear everyone  Was just as pricey as a hotel  
409759483,the location and price are both great  and the check in process is straightforward  my first issue is that the radiators in the apartment have covers on them with clutter on top  denying access to the control valves  thereby making the whole apartment hotter than    degrees the whole time  when I contacted the host about it they said there were control valves on the bottom of the radiators  however this was not true  the only valves were blocked by metal covers and clutter  the second issue was that the host scheduled maintenance repairs in the bathroom during the time that I paid for to stay there  expecting me to let the workers in and watch them while they did the repairs  I dont pay to be a housesitter and ensure repairs are done when I book an Airbnb    the place being so hot the whole time with no solution aside from keeping all the windows open made the experience much less enjoyable than it should have been  but it was a nice place otherwise  rotten food smell upon first entering  but it went away and didnt come back  they were good about responding in a timely manner  however the responses didnt provide proper help  their radiators have covers over them that prevented access to the control valves  and the covers have random clutter on them preventing them from being opened  they told me the valves were accessible from the bottom  however this was not the case  as a result  the entire place was well over    degrees the entire stay  making it extremely uncomfortable 
631234728,Love this place  Id stay again G  unit needs attention on the ceiling areas  because the hole in the bathroom ceiling with water splashing on you everytime your in there was a bit much  I love staying with you guys but  that experience I wasnt happy with  Broking screen on front door camera If the ceiling in the restroom wasnt broken and water didnt splash on me every time I used the restroom
626319708,This was my first time to KC and was really looking forward to going to my girlfriends hometown  The view was absolutely amazing  But checking in was a hassle  The code to the lockbox was incorrect so had to call management to issue us a new box  When we opened that box we got a key  but had no key fob to open the doors     luckily a couple who was staying there to was able to let us in with them  Having to open multiple lock boxes just to get a key and key fob was ridiculous  We arrived at          minutes before check in  and we did not have our key and keyfob until   PM  We get upstairs and are shocked with how dirty the place was  there was food on the cabinets  hair in the shower and on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed  We asked if we could check in early and were told that wouldnt happen because they needed to clean the place  They obviously didnt or did a HORRIBLE job at it  There were no trash bags in the unit either  Ive stayed with other companies like VRBO or Homeaway  this was my first Airbnb experience and other than the view  it was absolutely horrendous  My girlfriend and I slept on the couch the entire visit since there was hair on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed   Private   This was my first time to KC and was really looking forward to going to my girlfriends hometown  The view was absolutely amazing  But checking in was a hassle  The code to the lockbox was incorrect so had to call management to issue us a new box  When we opened that box we got a key  but had no key fob to open the doors     luckily a couple who was staying there to was able to let us in with them  Having to open multiple lock boxes just to get a key and key fob was ridiculous  We arrived at          minutes before check in  and we did not have our key and keyfob until   PM  We get upstairs and are shocked with how dirty the place was  there was food on the cabinets  hair in the shower and on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed  We asked if we could check in early and were told that wouldnt happen because they needed to clean the place  They obviously didnt or did a HORRIBLE job at it  There were no trash bags in the unit either  Ive stayed with other companies like VRBO or Homeaway  this was my first Airbnb experience and other than the view  it was absolutely horrendous  My girlfriend and I slept on the couch the entire visit since there was hair on the bed and a condom wrapper under the bed  
503855584,nice place to stay in a safe neighborhood  check in was super easy  recommend  
452637202,This location was great and it a huge and spacious apartment  However  the cleanliness of the apartment was very lack luster  We had to clean the floors of the apartment as there was still dust and pet hair     on the floor   The bathroom was a little difficult to maneuver with the claw bathtub  There is no proper way to absorb or drain liquid that inevitably gets out of the bathtub   and we had to take a mop to the floor every night   Check in instructions  Host didnt respond and they were still cleaning past check in It had very unclean flooring  After their cleaning crew left   we had to sweep and mop as there was still a lot of pet hair     on the floors and some black stuff
647057825,Very convenient and nice area  Apartment was comfortable but bathroom was not properly cleaned  Thank you for allowing me to stay here but I really didnt appreciate messaging about how the bathroom was unclean and sent pictures and got no response  I paid a cleaning fee and still had places that were not      clean 
624757765,I would have enjoyed to know some of the amenities  such as the rooftop  were closed  but it was really nice  The kitchen was spacious and the room was definitely amazing 
191233672,I loved the location of the air bnb  I would recommend public transportation or uber rides if staying in the area because parking is hard to find  Overall it was a convenient place to stay   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  Additional comments   Cobwebs and trash near the door  
577493538,Great place exactly as shown in pics  Very cool exposed brick vibe  Great location near Wash Ave nightlife  Nice secure building  Only challenges were     super cool James Bond shower looks awesome but the low water pressure and lack of a shower curtain makes it a not so pleasant experience  and    having only one physical key and not an electronic lock requires coordination to access the place and can be a pain  Had issues getting in the front door  Instructions were inaccurate 
412079359,WiFi didnt work the whole time I was there  The mattress is completely broken in  my back still hurts from   nights of restless sleep  Theres a barking dog next door and also a loud crashing sound  Ice machine  at least once an hour  No extra blankets for the    degree Chicago weather  Thank you trying to have people fix the WiFi for me but Im not tech savvy and did I that I could on multiple devices to try and figure it out  Please replace the mattress for people with back problems  Theres a barking dog next door and also a loud crashing sound  Ice machine  at least once an hour  No extra blankets for the    degree weather  WiFi wasn u    t working the entire time I was there  The mattress is totally broken in  I kept sinking towards the middle  My back still hurts from   nights of restless sleep  Front desk didnt know who Zencity was  Insisted I show them a reservation which I was scared to do because Zencity told me explicitly not to mention Airbnb  Didnt feel good to be put in a situation like that Although the WiFi was out I had people trying to solve it ASAP which was appreciated  Even though it didnt amount to the WiFi getting fixed
639555954,Nice space  Didnt appreciate the late notice that the check in process had changed  Wish there were towels or some type of indication that there would be none  Overall great space  quiet  Found a lot of random hair  not sure if it belonged to a pet but that was certainly unpleasant  I would recommend 
638747838,Clean  centrally located  Great size  I enjoyed the space l and the instructions were clear  However I left something in the apartment  reached out and got an I initial response only to never hear from you guys again regarding my left item 
656724391,The property is just as it seems  Stylish  clean  and very convenient for walking to restaurants  We enjoyed renting scooters and exploring Forrest Park  Cleanliness is always appreciated  but during Covid it was especially great to see  Thank you for being a great  st experience  There were some lights and plugs not working  We messagedour host  but never received a response  We were able to resolve the problem ourselves  by resetting the fuse  A little overpriced compared to similar properties  due to the extra costs attached 
622641093,By all means did not have a bad experience  was just frustrating that the wifi wasnt very good and that we had better results when we connected the smart tv to my hotspot on my phone instead of the wifi provided  Also got zero responses when asking for suggestions on how to fix it which was a little irritating but all in all id say its worth a weekend getaway  Responses were great at first but then all of a sudden got no responses whatsoever when we were having trouble with the wifi  Had to resort to using the hotspot on my phone to connect to the smart tv which worked better than the actual wifi provided 
631158984,The place was okay  We were barely there  Had a funny smell 
409360588,Great place  Had a slightly difficult check in with the lockbox  Keep in mind that the host responds more quickly to direct messages  Otherwise location and amenities are excellent value and Chris made sure I had everything I needed  Thanks for the comfortable stay  Other than the difficult check in I had a great time  Had difficulty with the lock box  It was partially jammed  I didnt realize the host responded more quickly to direct messages rather than phone calls  which route to a central calling bank for Zencity  I was out in the cold rain for    minutes trying to figure out the lock box 
702586477,Great location  large park  groceries and restaurants around  Gym downstairs and terrace on the roof  stuff responded promptly    However  quite expensive and   the sink was clogged upon arrival  slit above the conditioner  it took several days to turn the heating on   the impression was negative   Good for those who are traveling for treatment in barns Jewish hospital   Photos show you new apartment  however it u    s much used already  Quite expensive but   the sink was clogged upon arrival  slit above the conditioner  it took several days to turn the heating on
408149321,Its the cutest little stylish spot  Im  a coffee girl so the French coffee  press was DOPE  The bed was comfy too   I love the area  Plenty of stores in the area and public trans to downtown is easy  I would DEFINITELY  stay again  Might just have to check behind housekeeping though  Counter was dirty  The comforter from the closet had foodstains 
710609315,Great place to stay  Instructions on parking and getting checked in where a little confusing but overall good experience  Place doesnt look like the photos but is still very cute 
622529890,Place was listed as non smoking  Terrible smoke smell and cigarette butts in this apartment  Bed sheets stained  Hair in bathroom sink  Leftover food in refrigerator which stunk  Reached out twice  no resolve was ever offered  Very disappointed  Will never stay with Zencity again  Asked for partial refund  no response  Refrigerator had food in it and stunk  Bed sheets had stains  Cigarette butts and suppose to be non smoking apartment  Reached out to host twice to explain situation of place smelling  like smoke  First response was  okay  thanks for letting me know    no resolve  Second time I contacted host  no response 
162615592,Cool space to crash in  comfortable bed  Warehouse atmosphere means more noise so better for people who dont mind a slightly less private experience  Noise machine   portable AC were a plus   Hey Chris  I really appreciated how quickly you responded to my question and the ease of check in check out  Also  the bed was very comfortable   I gave   stars instead of   because the space is really cool but has SO much more potential  Ive spent lots of time in warehouses   artist spaces and there a few things that could make the place more inviting  touching up the holes in the walls   repaint  if the walls were a neutral color they wouldnt be noticeable   could even look cool  The extension cords running across the floor were a bummer   I ended up rerouting some chords to not trip  Also  the outlet that the ball shaped light was plugged into was out   The noise pollution was mentioned in in the listing but since the bed is directly underneath your neighbors living area there was cigarette smoke all night  too  This can be helped if you moved the bed to another wall or down the wall  This would help solve some of the lack of outlets near the bed too  Dust   slight odor in the bathroom was unfortunate   I took a broom and knocked down a bunch of cobwebs   Your space really is awesome  just not as inviting as I had hoped  Wish you the best of luck in the future   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust 
709085252,Great location  Additional seating in the living room and changing to a couch that pulls out to a bed would make it marketable as a sleeps   space  Mounting tv higher would give you space for more seating options   Beautiful space and great location 
579403426,The place is beautiful and clean  You get all the basic amenities  The check in process was a little frustrating  but once that was done  the rest of my stay was pleasant  The brick walls are a great accent to the space  Information about checking in was not sent  I had to call and it was a frustrating process 
630834729,Very spacious in a good location  Ball park village in walking distance  Would recommend staying 
646727621,Great place 
625344121,Great decor  quick responses from the team  I enjoyed the space  there was a slight bug issue I had to take care of when I first arrived but check in was very smooth and thank you for adjusting the thermostat  It seems someone adjusted it even before I got a response so thank you  Kitchen   bedroom were very clean  Bathroom was decent  The trash was more than half full when I arrived  I felt it shouldve been taken out prior to my stay  I had to take time to escort   bull flys out the window as they flew around for quite some time   I had to take care of a spider shortly after getting settled in 
622583659,The place was very clean kind of simple and the host was slow responses but a lot of that was due to coronavirus I would give it an overall     to   stars out of five
622581212,Very peaceful  I enjoyed the coffee bar and spectacular view  Quiet place to do work or relax 
479941797,Trash place no parking 
400631648,Easy check in  excellent amenities  poor customer service  When I reached out about debris on the floors  their response was that I should vacuum it up  When I reached out about there being no wifi  their response was that the codes are at the bottom of the router  they werent   But the apartment is just as advertised  with a lovely partial view of the lake  and if you have trouble  reach out to Airbnb support to have them mediate 
575870985,This place was very nice  The only issues I had were that the WiFi never worked the entirety of my stay  thus making the Roku TV in the living room useless  I did not contact them about this because I figured I could fix it myself by connecting disconnecting the tv to the WiFi  Also  I had accidentally left two items there and had contacted host to ask if I could go back into the apartment to get my belongings  and they never answered  Its been a week or so and still no reply  They hadnt had too many issues replying to me prior  besides it was a little late of a response at times  Regardless  I would likely stay here again 
400324578,Great place to stay 
408149084,Needs better window coverings   Area is just ok  Overall good and good beds and clean  Need better window dressing Ok area Ok  needs black out Curtins  Rooms are way too bright
400313894,Experience was OK  Location was fine  relative to UChicago  Plenty of space in the apartment  Bedroom door and bathroom door didnt close properly  however  Couch was worn in and pretty uncomfortable  Very average experience  but given the other reviews expected much more   I was left expecting more  space was good  but far from expectations  lock box didnt work properly  still made it in but had to use Cleaners keys  where the lockbox was unlocked  raising security concerns  the place just felt like it was falling apart a bit  none of the doors closed properly  soap dispenser didnt work  notified Zencity upon arrival 
661814750,Great Location  Nice assigned parking   Great amenities within the building  Great Location  Nice assigned parking   Great amenities within the building 
635173560,My Boyfriend and I  booked the room for the Fourth of July weekend  The space was great and we enjoyed our stay  There were some small holes located in the bathroom    scratches on some of the walls   and the fact that you are next door to the Hospital  you should know you will hear ambulances frequently  There is also no washer and dryer in the unit   so you will have to pay Other than these things we had a great time  There is a roof top with a great view and grill which we took advantage of  My Boyfriend and I  booked the room for the Fourth of July weekend  The space was great and we enjoyed our stay  There were some small holes located in the bathroom    scratches on some of the walls   and the fact that you are next door to the Hospital  you should know you will hear ambulances frequently  There is also no washer and dryer in the unit   so you will have to pay Other than these things we had a great time  There is a roof top with a great view and grill which we took advantage of 
721692348,Nice place  Clean  Great location  Would stay here again  Microwave handle was broken and there were stains on two of the pillow cases  The instructions for entering the main bldg door were confusing and incorrect 
299241896,Host was very responsive to emails  directions to get in were very clear   we had no problem settling in   The location was perfect   just blocks from out friends and great restaurants and the train    The upstairs occupants had a party the night we arrived  pretty noisy   Not sure if the upstairs unit was tenant occupied or another Airbnb unit  just an FYI  Over all the place was great  the only thing that could have been better is the noise from the party above us   This could have been a private unit or another Airbnb   The sound transfer between the unit and the unit above was not great  while the party was going on we could hear squeaky foot steps and loud talking   We were tired so falling asleep was not a problem  thought the owner should know   The shared common area with other unit s  were not well kept 
649053332,Great place and amazing hospitality 
368296100,This apartment is ideally located as the neighborhood is wonderful  Please note that parking is difficult to find and in most cases is not free  The apartment is very spacious and comfortable  In addition to my other comments  This property appeared not to be owned by an individual  When I got to the residence not only did I struggle to find parking  the keys were not in the lockbox  I sent a message via the app but then I also called to get a call center who didnt really show any empathy that there were no keys in the lock box  The agent said that she would make it an urgent message but couldnt say when someone would call me back  In the meantime  Chris responded and asked me to try the backup lockbox which was also empty  He then asked me to try the cleaners box which had multiple sets of keys  I am guessing that they own multiple apartments in this building   One set of keys allowed me to get into my designated apartment  Please note that ALL   lockbox combinations were set to just one number difference than the actual combination  This did NOT give me a very safe feeling  I realize that the owner of this listing may not have control over the initial area when entering the building and the staircase but it was disgusting and left a bad impression  When you are paying a cleaning fee you expect the areas to be clean   Listing says wifi not included and confirmed that it was included  The listing says free street parking  This is not exactly true as it is only free for part from like midnight to   am   This property appeared not to be owned by an individual  When I got to the residence not only did I struggle to find parking  the keys were not in the lockbox  I sent a message via the app but then I also called to get a call center who didnt really show any empathy that there were no keys in the lock box  The agent said that she would make it an urgent message but couldnt say when someone would call me back  In the meantime  Chris responded and asked me to try the backup lockbox which was also empty  He then asked me to try the cleaners box which had multiple sets of keys  I am guessing that they own multiple apartments in this building   One set of keys allowed me to get into my designated apartment  Please note that ALL   lockbox combinations were set to just one number difference than the actual combination  This did NOT give me a very safe feeling  Once I got in I confirmed with Chris and he JUST offered me an apology  I wouldnt consider this good customer service  The floor in the kitchen didnt seem to be thoroughly washed  Along baseboard wasnt clean and only found this when I bent down to pick up something  Behind bathtub was also a little dirty  I realize that the owner of this listing may not have control over the initial area when entering the building and the staircase but it was disgusting and left a bad impression  When you are paying a cleaning fee you expect the areas to be clean  See Check In comments  Please see my comments in the other areas 
195990350,Good stay  Nice location and charming studio  However poor isolation so the place can be quite noisy  foot step  neighbors   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom 
477075904,Solid
476163087,I really liked the space and its closer to Hyde park downtown to get around to all the restaurants and bars  The lockbox was jammed and when I called they were no help and I had to figure it out by myself
613784962,Great location   good value  A short uber ride to the city center and all main attractions 
613759708,Very nice place  Just make sure if u have a car to arrangements for parking Thanks for being a great host
631887064,This was very clean and perfect for   days
473487004,Very nice place to stay just get parking figured out ahead of time  I would suggest that you get parking passes for that side parking lot and up your charge to cover them  The parking is so inconvenient  I rent a lot of air bnbs and even in New Jersey they provided us with parking passes  Which cost the host every day  We got tickets for parking in the street and then paid     a day to park in the parking garage   Parking  Parking Parking
659202120,The place was nice inside and it had a great view  However  trying to communicate with the host was very difficult  I left some keys on accident and it was quite difficult to get ahold of them  Also when checking in  it was difficult to find the correct location 
104406444,Great location  Unique building with LOTS of character  Clean space  A lot of room  Area can get sketchy at night so safety is important    flights of stairs can get tiring so be prepared for the workout  Overall really enjoyed my stay  
661673508,This airbnb was in a great location  In walking distance to river market  power and light  or even crossroads if you like to walk  Street parking was free for the weekend  The host had very clear directions on how to get into the airbnb   Overall great experience 
101532902,While  there was a key problem due to landlord cutting off lock boxes Chris was there to work with me and everything worked out fine        
641116129,great place
716943529,The airbnb was true to the pictures on the listing  Very good location to get out and about on foot or quick drive with the family  Lots of entertaining things to explore in a   mile radius 
366454782,There were several issues during my stay  Upon entry there was a harsh odor in addition to the smell of cigarettes  Additionally  the linens were stained  the tub was clogged and would not drain  and the bathroom sink was not working properly either  They were however pretty responsive and did their best to fix the tub  not the odor   Overall  made the best of it but would not stay again nor recommend  There were several issues during my stay  Upon entry there was a harsh odor in addition to the smell of cigarettes  Additionally  the linens were stained  the tub was clogged and would not drain  and the bathroom sink was not working properly either  They were however pretty responsive and did their best to fix the tub  not the odor   If it had been throughly cleaned before guests arrived 
624963000,About what was expected 
633061024,Great location  Close to down town by car ride  Fixing the door handle go get into the Apartment  it was very difficult to open  Also the cigarette smoke was very disturbing 
666867196,I have stayed with Zencity now a handful of times  hoping the experience would eventually get better since the properties are so beautiful  It becomes obvious that their customer service is ran by an automated response system   you very rarely get to talk to an actual person  There have been occasions where Ive actually called instead of messaging   never actually spoke to a person  On all of my stays but one  I have received the check in information as much as   hours after the check in time  As well as checking into an apartment only to realize that its a completely different home than advertised without the promised amenities  I advise you to save the time   hassle  For very similar pricing you can find equally if not better listings in the area  Stay away from Zencity  You can find better deals staying at hotel in the same area
365628688,This was a good spot for a cheap  quick stay  Not very comfortable for spending time in  very small  not the nicest accomodations   but if youre just looking for somewhere to crash while you explore the city then Id say its worth it  Thank you for the good communication   quick responses and clear directions  See other feedback for suggestions on improvement   Looks a lot nicer in photos than in real life  Also  there were little querks with amenities that werent mentioned  The apartment had radiators for heat  which made strange sounds that were pretty irritating  Also  the hallways leading to the room smelled like pee and marijuana  Which isnt the apartment owners fault  but just something to be aware of  
68497013,This location was perfect for our extended weekend   close walking distance to Michigan Avenue and   blocks from the  L    The apartment was comfortable  quiet and we felt right at home   The grocery store is close by    blocks  so we were able to mix in some  home cooking  along with visiting some of our favorite restaurants   This was our first Airbnb experience and Collin made a great first impression   We will definitely look to make this location our  home away from home  during our next Chicago trip   Thank you Collin      Not a deal breaker but the baseboards in the bathroom were a little dirty   not sure the cleaning service caught those during their past visit    
571865692,Great place   Very clean and nice  I would definitely stay again 
624841794,Neat house  It worked out perfect for our quick family get away  Thank you so much  This worked out perfect for what we needed 
613098837,Unit was clean with modern furnishings   The location was ideal   minutes to downtown  arch  anheiseur Busch  sports complex  etc   Units are below ground  if you chose to open windows  someone can easily get in as there are no screens  Direction to the unit was not clear once youve entered the complex  Being able to control the units thermostat was an issue   Ive requested for the pin to be able to change the temperature but was not successful   The customer should be able to adjust the temperature to their liking   The unit was programmed at    degrees   which was unacceptable 
362972727,A wonderful  clean space  located perfectly in the midst of shops and restaurants  Would stay again  The space was great and easy to find  I appreciated how clean and organized it was  and didnt come across any major issues  One minor complaint was when we entered it smelled very strongly of marijuana 
613227951,The place was clean and Zencity is very responsive  Checkin was very simple and the location was perfect for where we needed to be  Only downside is that the place is a bit outdated 
613152183,If you are a night person that did not want to sleep at night then this place is       PERFECT for you   Every night we did not get to sleep until      AM    The neighborhood upstairs was very INCONSIDERATE  VERY VERY VERY  NONSTOP MAKING NOISE  STOMPING  SCRAPING the FURNITURE across the floor  LOUD MUSIC  AT      AM STOMPING WALKING DOWN THE STAIR    All these started from      PM to      AM    And this happened EVERY NIGHT since I was there      
651000975,Other than water leak and mildew ell it was an ok place to stay Spend a lot of time cleaning up water and trying not to fall when you walk out of the room onto the vinyl floor Water damage with the smell of mildew Wet carpet  kids would walk from the carpet area and end up slipping and fell a couple times
360463138,My stay was good it was nice and cozy I just honestly think they shouldnt charge for a cleaning fee if it is not going to be clean when you arrive  My stay was great I just think It could have been more cleaner   The cleanness   Towels were not clean
462078116,Place is in a great neighborhood  Beautiful part of Chicago  The drive up lake shore drive is amazing  The only thing is the place had ants not red ants but sugar ants  There were ants in the living room 
360421252,Good place  great for solo travelers although public transport in Chicago may get tiresome sometimes  The place is within    mins of the tourist spots 
359353020,Great value and perfect place to spend the night before watching the game  Great location  We didnt get much chance to explore but its super close to tons of shops 
632600899,This was worst experience with Airbnb  The bed had hair all over I asked for new sheets and even those  looked nasty     there were no pots or pans to cook with no even a dish towel     no paper towels in the kitchen      there was no dish soap or dish towel to clean off the couple plates they had        I would like a full refund because this was just the worst really  This was hair all over the bed and I asked for new sheet and even those where unclean If the bed was clean 
717165877,They monitor you its scary actually
672142128,This is a well traveled very busy location  If you like constant action then this is the place for you  It is not meant for children and families or a quiet retreat  Very loud location
652242490,In my opinion this unit was not in rentable condition but not all bad  Good  location  beds  linens  size  furnishings  Bad  Not very clean  mold in bedroom  ceiling fan not installed correctly and fell from  ceiling  shower drain clogged  This unit was not In rentable condition  Should spend some time and attention on this unit  Floors were not clean  Stovetop was dirty  Countertops were sticky  Closet in bedroom had mold floor to ceiling  Cleaner  things not broken  This was more like a college dorm room apartment than a place for a professional to stay  Terrible smell in the common areas of the building the place needs more attention 
569746290,I will definitely recommend you stay at Zencity  The place is located close to Soulard and Downtown  There is work being done on the building so its modern and clean  The instructions on entering the building was received later and the biggest Left over crumbs on the couch were our only concerns  This could have been on my end but I never received the instructions on how to enter the build  I had to call the host who promptly responded  The couch had crumbs all over it 
456842639,Good location  Place was smaller than expected  No internet during whole stay  Thanks for hosting   There was no internet access  and no tv service   The internet connection was not working and despite of contacting the host about the issue  the problem was not resolve during our   day stay  We had no tv access either because it work using internet   It was dusty under the beds and common areas  The host responded to my messages but their responses were not helpful  The price was to high for the place 
455304029,Great for a quick visit to Chicago   Very responsive staff   Location made everything easy   Try the coffee shop downstairs  Thanks so much for the quick replies when the bed broke   I appreciate the discount as well   Thank you   Angle of photos betrayed size and decor of apt   It does not feel very welcoming   It can use a table in the dining room and a bed that is not so close to the floor   The shower curtain in the first bathroom needs replacement   Bed issues were very inconvenient   Generally  the apartment is a very cold and could use a soft touch 
592683851,The place has some nice space and it is incredibly close to bus stops going every direction  Lots of food options right outside  Zen city was nice to work with and check in was very easy  The neighborhood is pretty nice  The space is nicely designed and has a good feel overall     There were a few cleanliness issues that were a bit of a turn off  There was a stain in the middle of the couch and what looked like pasta sauce on one of the bed comforters   Generally  the stay here was good  just not great  We would consider staying again  There was what looked like tomato sauce stain on the bedroom comforter  a stain in the middle of the couch  and pans were put away only half clean
512611304,Place was fine Lock box didnt properly lock
621442623,Very nice place 
702750719,This was our first time staying at an air bnb so we didnt know what to expect so we went with the info on the host site  We arrived early booking site issue  we added flight info arriving at   am and after trying the code in the rain for about    min we called the host  They had the arrival time at     we are in st louis with nothing to do until  pm straight off a place with luggage   glad we had a rental car because if you uber or lyft we would have been stuck outside for all that time  We booked our stay in advance and when we arrived check in process was difficult  for someone who has never used intercom and lockbox systems before the directions were unclear  Finally at about     we get to check in  Place was large but basic  If you are looking for luxary or all the amenenties this is not the place for you  Alot of space   small full cheap bed but it does have a ton of closet space and   bathrooms  No jacuzzi  No parking  No Pool  No smoking  We booked ahead of time and when we got there there was   towels in the whole place for   people for   days  Take you own everything  If you are a smoker this place is not for you way to much to have to go through to get in and out  Also the biggest disasspointment it says by the arch and shows pic of the arch all lit up  THE ARCH IS NO WHERE IN SITE FROM THIS PLACE  I would have booked a different place where we would see the arch  Over all we will book again with airbnb   when i booked i booked beacuse it says at the arch and also shows pic at the arch and the arch was not even close by and you cant see it from any level of this place there is literally nothing just a place to sleep  np jacuzzi no pool  cant smoke  no parking   check in time was off we had to wait in the rain  the key was not in the proper place we couldnt check in on time  there was no clear insrtuctions on how to get in step by step you can tell whoever is cleaning the place is doing the bare min  there was dust all over  The floors had hair all over them  they prob just dust the service and call it a day we stayed for   days they had   towel in there per person  not acceptable  the reservation is made well in advance and it they dont provide it needs to state that
618102951,Overall  I would appreciate it as good  Why not excellent      Not completely clean dishes  A cup of lipstick remained on the cup      The bed was not clean  It seems like someone was already asleep there  It was crumpled and had hair   It is convenient to pick up the keys when settling  The apartments have almost everything you need for a living  We lived for almost a month  The kitchen is just short of refrigerated containers and a corkscrew to open the wine  The lobby also has a games room  a gym and free hot drinks  Overall  I would appreciate it as good  Why not excellent      Not completely clean dishes  A cup of lipstick remained on the cup      The bed was not clean  It seems like someone was already asleep there  It was cramped and someone left his hair on bed   It is convenient to pick up the keys when settling  The apartments have almost everything you need for a living  We lived for almost a month  The kitchen is just short of refrigerated containers and a corkscrew to open the wine  The lobby also has a games room  a gym and free hot drinks 
673544620,A stylish space in a great location  Great for a small group staying in a studio 
449510025,Well designed place  super close to area restaurants and bars  Host is not weary of charging full price for anything that is perceived as damaged 
449494975,The space is great  it is super clean and check in and communication was easy and helpful  We really enjoyed staying and completely recommend it Thanks for letting us stay in the apartment  it was super clean and comfortable Not many things stores around
449452110,Good location and spacious apartment   Staircase is a bit tricky if you have mobility issues or larger luggage   Apartment was bright and clean  but common hallway area was not  The entry way and stairs were filthy and really gave me a bad feeling about coming  home    Also  the stairs and shower were difficult for an older person   I think you should put a rubber mat into the tub   The apartment was clean and nicely laid out  but a few more dishes  silverware  etc  would have been nice 
567464766,The elevators were  down for most of our stay  Checkout with all our heavy luggage and   flights of stairs and a Health condition is no joke  Having to go up and down flights of stairs a few times to add to the parking meter really sucked   The floorboards creak insanely loud all over the place  But it seems to be this way in the whole bdg  not just this unit    Bathtub was dirty and bathroom countertop was not really clean  They offered to send a housekeeper but it was hours later so we didnt oblige  Cute simple decor  Great location  But I wont stay here again for the price with these issues  Non working elevator made transporting several heavy luggage up and downstairs very difficult  Dirty tub and sink countertop Clean bathroom and working elevator  Less creaky floors 
592185448,Great location great view minimal living space The door knob on the bathroom was loose  Dryer sheets woukd be nice  Needed dryer sheets  No snacks were available   Floors were dusty and crummy  A bit pricy for the quality of furniture
590133972,Super clean  the bed was VERY comfortable and an easy check in process 
350881460,I was a bit surprised with my experience with this Zencity property since I have had such great customer service and experiences in the past     Nonetheless my trip short there were some negatives involved   All in all I did enjoy that there were more positives that outweighed the bad things which is why I wish I could give a     star rating     At any rate I would still highly recommend  Zencity  despite the circumstances I experienced at this one location   Thank you  Shae Hey Chris   Thank you for allowing me to stay in another one of your properties   However I was a bit let down with this last property   I would highly recommend checking out the area prior to listing and ensure that theyre actually as clean as listed because I found the bathroom and linen as well as the couch were not that clean   For example   The linen was not very clean as I am use too seeing or dealing with Zencity   I noticed stains on the couch in the living room and stains and hair on the linen in the bedroom plus the bathroom was not that clean as well   The tub had blonde hair in it as well as  I had to basically disinfect and clean everything before I used it because I was surprised that the property was not as clean as I was used to seeing from past and previous experiences   Although it was a bit surprising considering that I have had such great experiences in the past   Nonetheless there were some negatives involved   All in all I did enjoy that there were more positives that outweighed the bad things which is why I wish I could give a     star rating   At any rate I would still highly recommend  Zencity  despite the circumstances I experienced at this one location   Thank you  Shae  Although the layout of the property was as listed however the accuracy in the cleanliness was not on point   The linen was not very clean as I am use too seeing or dealing with Zencity   I noticed stains on the couch and linen in the bedroom and the bathroom was not that clean as well   The tub had blonde hair in it as well as the bedding and I had to basically disinfect and clean everything before I used it because I was surprised that the property was not as clean as I was used to seeing from past and previous experiences   I was a bit disappointed however I wasnt completely let down because there were other positives that out weight some of the negatives   I wish I could give a     instead but I only have the options of     stars 
590770989,Love the apartment complex  Its in a great location and really close to the park and shops at CWE  If youre flying in for a couple days I would highly recommend it  but if youre staying for awhile be aware that there is no on site parking so I had to park at the hospital which cost     a day  Other than that  it was a nice place and a very stylish apartment 
444919841,Enjoyed the apartment  Very convenient for visiting my son and family  Only issue was the alley side bedroom  The outlets didnt seem to be working  Wasnt a huge issue  May have just been a breaker
401072017,n 
589292720,We had a good  week long stay in the apartment  The location is amazing  the apartment is pretty quiet considering the location on Milwaukee  and the El   and the space is large and bright  Because this apartment is not someones home  the furniture is a little cold and less comfortable than it could be    the pillows on the beds were especially disappointing  There were also some small maintenance issues with the shower that a person who lives in the home would have just dealt with  Wed still stay again if we needed a place in Chicago  so I guess that says all you need to know  As I mentioned in our messages  the shower is in need of some attention  For the most part  we had a great stay  Thanks 
643667578,The place is very roomy and overall very comfortable   I loved a lot of the vintage touches especially the claw foot bathtub upstairs    The only issue I  had was the WiFi was spotty at best and the one time we wanted to sit and watch some Netflix we werent able to do so   I did message the host and he responded right away with attempted troubleshooting but even when there was a connection it was just not strong enough to stream anything   OVERALL  I would definitely recommend the property again because of the location  style and comfort 
589225652,Good location and spacious apartment  highly recommended  
588947195,Stylish place  I really enjoyed my stay here  The Tv has subscriptions for Netflix  Hulu and amazon prime  But when I checked in  I found someone elses hair on the pillow and quilt 
616445798,Hosts were hard to reach  Had a bad key that only worked half the time Bad key  wouldnt open door Hosts were hard to reach didnt respond
586213324,This is a great space for a lone traveler  located very close to transportation and a number of conveniences  Bathroom and kitchen are outdated and not accurately represented in all photos  but living room and bedroom are nice and spacious   Bathroom and kitchen photos in listing are different  nicer than actual unit  Different bathroom than that pictured in listing   old and dingy
439244960,COol place to stay close to other amenities
586264728,Great location  easy and fast communication with Zencity  Apartment was on third floor   Close to restaurants and shops  great neighborhood  Thoroughly enjoyed our time at this location  Would rent again  Thank you for the great space  Location was great  Enjoyed my time there  I unfortunately cracked one of the wine glasses  my apologies  Overall had a great time and would return to location  Thank you
439231520,Nice and clean apartment Great location   No air conditioner in the bedroom  thankfully it was not hot   Quick check in   Would absolutely stay again  O air conditioning in bedroom 
438849671,Well run company   I recommend staying with them   I mean Zencity  not Airbnb  Hey I docked points for the checkin process   Nobodys perfect but we should be honest with one another and not merely value inflated scores that tell us nothing useful  Thank you for your hospitality 
707881052,Staying right off the plaza for under       Great value  the place itself is minimally decorated  but is perfectly functional for a quick stay 
437416197,Be prepared to pay for parking  A couple of light bulbs were blown  Overall it was a nice place  Parking is extremely limited on the street  Be prepared to pay for overnight parking garage at about     during weekdays and over     on weekends 
584773116,Great place for the price  As the listing mentions  I wouldnt recommend it if having an L station right outside your window will bother you  but otherwise no issues  Thanks for the great deal for the weekend 
436267161,pretty good but shower does not function properly
435850692,Amazing location if you are attending a show at McCormick Place     minute walk and a   minute Uber  Could not ask for more convenience with the location especially at the price compared to local hotels  Had some issues with wi fi which was an issue for me as I was working  Double check that they have been corrected if you need wi fi   Wi fi was very poor  My request for credit due to poor wi fi was initially ignored
434804845,I would have forgiven several thigs and given a five star review because the bedroom was nice  but they tried to charge me      for some cheap chair I never touched   Room was nice but building was a little run down and sketchy overall  Told me I couldnt check in early because the space needed to be cleaned    then the bathroom wasnt clean  hair on the floor and in the bath shower Quick to response until I refused to pay      for a cheap particle board chair I didnt use strange part of town would have given five starts anyway if they didnt try to charge me      for a chair I didnt break
591599892,The place looks great in the pictures but it is the complete opposite  The place is dirty and smells like there is a gas leak in there  The couch and carpet in the living room are filthy  The bathroom was partly clean  the sink was nasty   The bed sheets were full of stains and long hair  The place gives you a good impression in the pics but its the complete opposite  The price might seem good but trust me    its not worth it  I stayed there   days and it was a bad experience  I just moved to another Airbnb   miles away for the same night rate and its super amazing  Also the parking is if you get lucky to find a spot 
591166690,Good space  Grwat locale  Just a little dirty
469937021,Great location   near the hospital  Easy to check in 
630581413,Great place to stay 
431173110,One bedroom flat in building with college dorm vibe  Not the most tasteful art on the walls    of   windows in the unit open and the radiator doesnt turn off 
429353090,Great place  and though help can be a bit slow to arrive  for rare technical issues   they are effective  Well prepared location and fantastic amenities and general stay  would recommend  Everything except comms and tech issue were perfect  Will be a repeat customer 
718886963,Its what you could expect for a downtown apartment  smelt like alcohol and weed in the hallways  neighbors were a bit loud and you could hear partying  but it was a Saturday night  It didnt bother us  but maybe if you have young kids it wouldnt be the most wholesome weekend stay  It looks exactly as pictured  the space is nothing special  but its a great value for the location  Thanks for hosting us  Maybe include instructions in the check in process for how to lock the door  hold down unlock button on keypad  and our key fob was broken  Other than that it was a nice stay   Looks just like the pictures  It wasnt unclean  just a little grungy  low quality  For example  bathroom toilet paper holder was broken  or stains on the walls and such but it wasnt unclean  Definitely a good value for the location the space itself was nothing special  just your standard Airbnb  It was what we needed for a night 
580442055,Nice place  Decently clean Overall the place was really nice and clean  However it smelled awful or weed  which didnt go away  and there was black hair on the shower wall  Also  poop in the toilet        Dolman St   The kitchen smelled like weed  There was poop in the toilet  And black hair on the shower wall  Cleaner
703301907,Great place  great location  had an issue with toilet  zencity were quick to respond and quick to get maintenance out  Would highly recommend and will he back to stay again
622151789,Its a great location and the view I had was pretty sweet  Parking was easy to find  The room itself  not a lot of bells and whistles  You have your basics for a good restful night  I would definitely stay here again  the price was incredible and the location amazing 
426007162,Great location with amazing amenities  I had issues with the wifi  It would be great if they could resolve the issue 
641813644,The apartment was clean  had enough space and was easy to get to  The area isnt the best  but to be expected  There is also no microwave in the apartment  so keep that in mind if that is important to you  Overall  the stay was okay and I would rent again 
425644357,Great location and awesome double deck space for warmer weather 
579864338,Very stylish place and in a very good location  Less than a mile walk to downtown  However tons of construction going on in the complex  Will be very nice when its finished   A few amenities which were listed were under construction still  The gym  and the rooftop lounge were not complete   Bathroom still showed signs of construction  Grout stains on the tile and grout stuck on shower floor
628796557,Its perfect to work at from Home
645306829,I was very surprised at how filthy the place was  the host were very slow about fixing the issue and sending people to clean the mess  Its cheap though so you get what you pay for but hopefully they fix the issue as soon as possible  other than that it wouldve been perfect  very nice spot in a good location  please just take care of your cleaning people so they take better care of your business  invest in candles  always keep the air blowing even if no one is there  the floor was dirty and had t been swept before they ran the duster mop across the floor  the sheets were dirty  the extra sheets were dirty  i smelled terribly  i was overall just very disgusted  used my t shirts as pillow cases  house cleaner never came  it wasnt urgent to fix my issue  i couldve paid for a hotel and atleast had housekeeping come asap or gotten a new room  but overall good concept 
669935197,I would NOT recommend this apartment to anyone  I was looking for a modern cozy apartment  but this was anything but that  The apartment did NOT look like the pictures that were posted  It was outdated and misrepresented  According  to Zencity the place recently underwent a renovation which is why the pictures differ from actual apartment  However  the said  renovations  made the apartment look worse  The apartment was not clean to my satisfaction  The apartment window seals were dirty and the blinds were COVERED with dust  The toilet was broken  I have a video  and a light was blew out in the bathroom  The apartment is located in CWE  loved that  but they are doing construction  Construction workers wake you up at the crack of dawn  if youre in to that kind of thing   GO FOR IT   The people who represented Zencity were anything  but helpful  They were snippy and rude  You can see them argue with customers in the review comments under other postings  You can count on that they ARENT going to do the right thing by their customers  All they can offer you are excuses and insincere apologies  Do not book with Zencity   If you are looking to rent here RUN     A total catfish  This apartment looks NOTHING like the pictures  which the exception of the sheets on the bed  Next to the cleanliness  THIS WAS MY BIGGEST CONCERN  They lure you in with a modern look  but the apartment has anything but that  I u    m unable to upload pics of the actual apartment  When I notified Zencity of my concern they stated the apartment had recent renovations  I thought renovations where supposed to make spaces look better   not worse  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE      The apartment was not cleaned to my satisfaction  The window seals were dirty and the blinds were so dirty that they were gray instead of white  When I brought this up to Zencity  they did not see it as a concern and advised me that this was the apartment that I booked  Zencity is RUDE and unapologetic  As you can see on other posts they like to argue with their customers and point the finger  No responsibility  Location is not horrible because it is in the CWE  but they are doing construction and you can here it every morning at the crack of dawn  If you are looking for a getaway to get rest   dont stay here  The apartment looking as host presented in photos 
420786026,A few of the lights were burnt out or dim and the tub wasnt super clean but the location was peaceful and price was okay  Bathroom was unclean
587225126,Very nice place  Some things in the apartment were broke 
651068790,Great place to stay  So many great coffee shops   restaurants 
671236306,Overall a really great space   It was clean  stylish and had a great location   Kitchen is pretty sparsely equipped  for example  there was only one spoon  Overall was a great experience   We had a parking emergency and your folks were great   Kitchen could use some drinking glasses and there was only one spoon 
710999289,Excellent location    Thanks for a great stay 
249742301,No the value for the stay pay Over all thank you  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  listing description   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust 
646408043,Location is nice  parking wasnt bad during my visit and Brian responded quickly when I had questions 
719170753,Beautiful spot and very clean  For a long stay they unfortunately didnt have any broom  toilet cleaner  or a can opener 
700437510,Great location and cute space  Thank you for being a great host  the place is so cute and in a great location  Only issue we had was with the stains on the couch and pillows as well as the comforter and the mold on the shower curtain  Other than that  awesome  Shower curtain molded and stains on comforter and couch pillows
612015461,Great space  Beautiful location
718844499,I have had much better experience  Place wasnt cleaned very good
643398254,The property was located in a great area with access to many amenities   The space was the perfect size   Very quaint  modern space  Thank you for hosting us during our stay in Chicago   We will definitely consider Zencity when for our next trip to the area  Couch upholstery could use some cleaning   Found a few sheets on the sheets 
348858552,Chris at Zen City was easily accessible and left clear instructions for check in  The apartment came as advertised  The bed was uncomfortable and could benefit from a pillow topper  There was no thermostat in the apartment so it felt quite warm overall  But overall  the experience was good  Helpful to have a lint roller  Thanks for having me 
722178615,Meh but still nice The place was a bit messy and had crumbs all over and scribbles like kids were there before everything els for the value though was great  Parking  Housing projects
612010563,My stay was nice  check in was super easy and quick  the apartment was alright   cant beat the price  EXCEPT for a couple things  the minute i walked in the apartment it had a really unpleasant smell  so i bought some air freshner   helped a lil bit    the bathroom couldve been cleaner  no biggie  the bed sheets and towels had stains on them but they looked washed    you should get new ones    Other than that it was a quiet place to stay  OH and nice view  Thank you for allowing me to be a guest 
406224327,nice if you need a quick place to rest your head
700265059,Honestly a great Airbnb in a beautiful are  alittle far from the airport and from the tourist spots but still a great deal  My only problem was the rude staff and waiting hours to check in just to be told  people have lunch breaks you know 
611317288,Enjoyed our stay with Zencity in Chicago  Communication and check in were super helpful and easy to follow  Location in Wicker Park is outstanding and steps from loads of fun bars and breweries 
646349974,Good location  decent value  decent amenities  but it just was not very clean  You need a new cleaning company  Nothing looked like it had been cleaned  Like moldings had dirt on them  floor didnt look swept  and there what looked like to be black mold on the ceiling where the shower was  I could be wrong  but it looked like it was 
714267798,Its a nice and spacious place for the price 
400603841,          Thanks
610052149,This place was really cute and modern  It was loud with traffic being right next to a busy street  but it wasnt a problem for us  The bed was very comfortable and the windows let the light in beautifully  My only complaint  as listed in other reviews  is that there was no key fob for the gated parking lot as promised  I did ask if I could get one  They said they would work on it  but I never got one  Not a huge issue as there was plenty of street parking  However  for me I wanted the gated area being a young woman on my own and wanted to feel safe at night  even though its a safe neighborhood  and it was closer to the elevator for loading and unloading   Not a big deal over all  Just as a heads up However  this place was a nice stay and the hosts had great communication  I would recommend this place  The place was very pretty  It was loud but thats just how it sometimes with traffic and thin doors  My main complaint was that Even though there was street parking  I was disappointed that there was no fob for the parking area  When I asked about it  you said you were  working  on it but there is plenty of parking out front  When I pay for something I want what is said to be included  It was a huge issue but it would have been a little easier because it was closer to the elevator  Messages were quick until I asked about that question Nd it was never resolved  Other than that we had a great stay and would stay here again  It was nicely decorated and very modern 
400034583,Very nice place  Close to downtown Just a couple of things the apartment was very cold   The temperature dropped and there werent any extra blankets or anyway to turn up the heat  The other thing is the tv wasnt displaying or playing the content once you picked a app or movie  Not sure if it was a signal issue  Other than that thanks for your hospitality   P s work on a bottom lock didnt like that I couldnt properly secure the apt  after I left 
562430504,Amazing view of lake shore drive 
368680008,Reliable communication  nice place parking can be a little tricky This worked out great only thing was missed having local tv for news  Great location  Parking
569800514,This is my first poor experience with Airbnb  it was a mess from the beginning  The toilet leaked dirty water into the floor  there was exposed wiring  the shower didnt drain  The host was extremely responsive and sent maintenance out to correct the issues in a reasonable amount of time  but not being able to use the shower or toilet for periods of time  shower out of service for over    hours   shouldnt happen in any place you stay  Its a great location building and these issues should now be corrected   Other notes   I didnt realize until after booking that there is no parking available  so be prepared to pay to park or have to park a block away as street parking is limited    The wifi is very very weak  we had to hot spot our phones to even stream a youtube video   Listed as workspace friendly  but the wifi was too poor to work from home  They also claim to have basic amenities to cook  but there wasnt even salt and pepper available  
366889013,I highly recommend this place
366406089,The apartment was pretty good  comfortable space  However  when there were issues brought up the host neglected  very slow responses  The radiator leaked and a couple drawers were broken in the kitchen  the remote was also missing  The key was a bit hard to fit in the front door The host would take at least five hours on average to respond to problems that I brought up
673950074,Nice studio apartment  just small  Clean  easy access
628942484,Overall the places and value of this company are great but the people skills we ran into were well below average  Sneaky practices and bad support teams locally  First place was amazing  The second was going well and then the lady ruined it  Kitchen and bathroom disarray
361837593,Nice place for price  Based on pictures i thought that this location would be a bit larger but i made do with what i had   The place was kind of cold at night  Heat really didnt blow out had to use oven to warm up apartment 
628928296,Very stylish  The stained bedding made me question the cleanliness  Replace those pillow cases and begging  Stained bedding is tacky  The bedding is stained really bad and its sickening  The pillows to be exact  Im not sure what stained it  new pillows are needed  Parking
600408481,Super nice space for the price  and good location if you have an event at uptown   I think the batteries in the   thermostats of the unit I had are dying because they kept resetting themselves to    degrees and it kept getting really cold  Other then that I loved the place  
361538535,Nice and clean as always
712259696,A very nice place in downtown Kansas City  about a mile and a half walk from Union Station  Parking is included which is nice so you dont have to hunt for a space and pay a meter  The hot water runs out very quickly in the bathroom   It was confusing if parking was included or not in the description  I had to message the host to get clarification  The key fob opens the garage under the building but you are not allowed to park in here  just the parking lot across the street  
610611487,Modern and comfortable apartment  Great location nearby downtown Chicago   Finding street parking can be a bit difficult causing you to park a couple blocks away  The day when we arrived I heard the furnace working fine but the following day after going site seeing we came back to a very cold apartment   I checked the thermostat and the furnace was off  It seemed if someone had came into the apartment and turned off the furnace  I was never given instructions for checking in  I had to call to get the instructions  In the instructions it said to get key from lock box but they failed to specify the lock boxes where on the gate next to the house not the one on the stairs located by the building door  Also upon arrival all the doors were unlocked so I had to check to make sure no one was inside the apartment Some areas seemed dusty such as the window in the upstairs bathroom  There were long hairs left behind in the upstairs shower also 
182014014,Great location with reasonable price  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  wifi   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs 
609276587,The place is exactly what is pictured and is in a great location on the West Side of St  Louis  We had issues with gaining access to the unit because it has an automatic security lock that doesnt match up with the door frame correctly  The place was amazing and had a wonderful aesthetic  It was in the perfect location for us and we enjoyed our stay for the most part  The thing that ruined it was the fact that the security lock on the door was not lined up with the door frame which caused major issues with locking and unlocking  I was concerned about parking my car in the side lot because the spots were numbered  Usually that means that each tenant is assigned a spot number  but I couldnt find a spot number in their check in information so I was worried I parked in someone elses spot  After I asked the host they promptly responded that I could park in any spot  We called and left a message with Zencity about the fact that our unique access code wasnt working to unlock the door to the unit  We left all of our information as well as what issues we were experiencing and we were never called back  Fortunately after struggling with the door for quite some time we figured out that the lock doesnt line up correctly with the door frame  So after you enter the access code you have to pull on the handle then turn the handle and push in quickly in order to get the door to open 
661821739,The apartment was not the one pictured  The bedroom and living area are separated   The location of the apartment is good  Located very close to Main Street 
358024837,okay  but couch not very good for sleeping living room floor lamp seemed to not work  lightbulb   listed as sleeping    but my daughter found the couch pretty uncomfortable 
609250180,Great property  Quiet and close to everything  Will stay again 
622519297,Late responses  which caused me to have    mins to figure out another place to stay and not be charged for a late fee Wasnt able to find out if I could extendend until   mins before check out very inconvenient considering I have a lot of stuff  But the place was nice and safe
609955250,Lovely prewar apartment with new kitchen   Unfortunately dishes were filthy and pots greasy so had to clean them myself  and management refused partial reimbursement of cleaning fee  It is unfortunate that you are operating on a one time rathe than a repeat customer model   Not reimbursing partially the cleaning fee I thought was quite reasonable   First you said you would make it right  then you went back on your word Hefty cleaning fee for very unclean dishes
355750534,the place was very clean and they had lots of extra things that u may sometimes forget when packing   the host was great as far as communication but there was a stench in the building like bad plumbing  The sofa in the apartment was  very uncomfortable otherwise the stay was great   
592716261,Overall the location was great  but hallway flooding and broken locks on the window made us feel unsafe  Issues were addressed and improvements were made  They had minor flooding in the hallway
422211073,Finding parking was a hassle  The place overall was cute and nice to stay at for the night  Some areas were a bit messy  but it smelled fresh  If you stay here  it does get pretty hot  Be sure to keep the windows open and the ceiling fan on  The area was nice and quiet  No loud neighbors 
347682093,As advertised   good location in Hyde Park  exactly what we were looking for   We had some issues with the shower  as others have described  but nothing that would stop us from staying again  The temperature in the shower is really funky   started out good  but then started fluctuating between freezing and scorching  which made it hard to shower 
646408838,Overall  I was very disappointed in my stay here and would not stay again unless some things were improved     Ill say the good things first  Zencitys communication   customer service was great   They got back to texts in about    minutes every time   Also  this is  or at least could be  a beautiful apartment   location  It is right along the L train which is great for access to the city but does cause some noise and people waiting for the train can see right in the windows so theres also its no privacy   Shades that open from the bottom would be nice so you can still see the horizon but block commuters view    That said  theres A LOT to improve at this location  It seems like it hasnt really been up kept and really needs some love to make it better   FOR EXAMPLE    there was mold growing visibly on the bathroom ceiling  both bedside lamps were very broken and not very useable   half the light bulbs burnt out    there was hair on the floor upon arrival  very gross     the throw rug under the bed was very grimy  the garbage was broken  not much privacy from L commuters   and the kitchen sink kept backing up     Honestly  I expected more from Zencity and was disappointed   It ended being a good stay but could have been far better   I hope things can be improved and to stay again if so  It is a beautiful location and I think Zencity has the potential to do better  Hi   thanks for your quick replies   Your communication was great   That said  I think theres a lot to improve at this location   It is a beautiful unit and can be great but seems like it hasnt really been up kept and really needs some love to make it better    E g   mold in the bathroom  two broken bedside lamps  half the light bulbs burnt out  hair on the floor upon arrival  grimy carpet  etc     I expected more from Zencity and was disappointed   It ended being a good stay but could have been far better   I hope to stay with you again and dont mean to insult you all  I just want to be honest to help improve things   Thanks again   hope youre well    Sincerely  James
351689495,Unit very basic and lacking in warmth   very bare bones  hanging  closet  a joke  Total lack of atmosphere  Poor shower head  Information lacking on use of TV 
608827715,The apartment itself was nice with a good location  but the bathroom and kitchen werent very clean which was frustrating  There was a used washcloth and leftover shampoo left in the shower  and almost all of the dishes we used had to be washed first because they were very dirty  Im not sure why the cleaning fee was      We couldnt park our car at the house because the person befor us took the key with them and they didnt tell us until we called them and they didnt have a replacement key  so we couldnt use the parking  Other than that it was fine though We were unable to find the key card for the parking lot  After searching for a long time  we finally called to ask and they said the person before us must have taken it with them  so we should park on the street  It ended up working out but it was frustrating The apartment was really dirty  considering we payed a    dollar cleaning fee  There were dirty rags and used shampoo bottles left in the shower  the mirror was dirty  there were dirty pots  pans  and silverware put back in the drawers without being washed
647033725,Overall  this was a really great place  good location and outside of the city so you dont have to deal with all the city traffic  The kitchen is great but they lack proper cooking and eating supplies 
629102362,This apartment was cute and I love the decor but there were a couple of things wrong with the apartment and the trains omg Hair all over the tub shower curtain liner had hard dried up stuff on it the mat to step out of the shower on was dirty Not being near the train we couldnt watch tv or sleep
555294053,The location was great but we ended up getting locked out of our loft for some reason that no one cannot explain  The host blaimed the loft manager for the locks they left on but also said it was not the first time it happened  We had to pay a locksmith to break in the lock so we can get in  I think its horrible that we did not get a refund for paying the locksmith  We waited for almost   hours with   babies just for the host  to tell us he couldnt let us in  He promised a refund for the Saturday night but I asked about it He ignored my messages and this wont be the end of it  We also tried to get our clothes back that we left in the dryer  and he only responded back one time and after that we heard nothing back  I tried calling and no answer nor call back  So now we are also stuck with no refund or our clothes back  Get your stuff in order and more organized  Im sorry this had to go this route but I refuse to let it be unnoticed I think its horrible that we did not get a refund for paying the locksmith  We waited for almost   hours with   babies just for your company to tell us you couldnt let us in  You ignored my messages and this wont be the end of it  We also tried to get our clothes back and you only responded back one time and after that we heard nothing back  I tried calling and no answer nor call back  Get your stuff in order and more organized  Im sorry this had to go this route but I refuse to let it be unnoticed Got locked out room  was stuck outside for almost   hours with my wife and       year old then WE had to pay      to a locksman to break in the loft because the  handyman  the host sent had no idea how to get us in  And they refused to refund us or pay us back When we asked about our refund to pay us back to get inside theyre loft they did not respond back AT ALL and we forgot clothes in the dryer and tried to set something up to get them but they only responded once and after that would not respond anymore so we are stuck without those clothes
548058196,Good location for being downtown St  Louis and the restaurant below has the BEST MALTS ever  The burgers were just as good  The place is neat   clean  The walls are thin  so you might hear other people  but other than that  it was a worth staying at  We did that in a message already 
569091554,We enjoyed our stay with Zencity  Check in was easy  the apartment was a    minute walk to Wicker Park  and was great value for the price  Overall  we really enjoyed our stay  the place was nice and in a great location  However  the bathroom needs some work and the photos in your listing should be replaced with accurate photos    Thanks for the hospitality   Amanda  The photos in the listing were not photos of the apartment we rented  While there were similarities  it was not an accurate reflection of where we stayed   Overall  the apartment was nice and clean but the window in the bathtub was covered in mould and it needs a fresh shower curtain 
185050301,Very clean and well kept apartment  Not much to do in the neighbourhood  a nice domestic university area  Thanks for a nice stay  Nice apt but not much in the neighbourhood 
607419303,The stay was a slight mess with a late check in due to the cleaning crew getting to the apartment the same time we arrived  we actually helped the cleaning crew clean an hour after leaving to give them time to clean   the place had been smoked in by the guest prior to our stay  speaking to multiple ZenCity agents with little response using the AirBnB app  the WiFi was slow and information listed in regards to name of network were incorrect and the cleaning crew walking into the apartment while we were sleeping which was very alarming  The location was great for us and the actual property was clean  Everyone has off days and plans dont always go as planned so we tried to be understanding  The cleaning crew did have their work cut out for them and they apologized  The stay started off rough but while there the bed was comfy and the kitchen was great  The stay was a slight mess with a late check in due to the cleaning crew getting to the apartment the same time we arrived  we actually helped the cleaning crew clean an hour after leaving to give them time to clean   the place had been smoked in by the guest prior to our stay  speaking to multiple ZenCity agents with little response using the AirBnB app  the WiFi was slow and information listed in regards to name of network were incorrect and the cleaning crew walking into the apartment while we were sleeping which was very alarming  The location was great for us and the actual property was clean  Everyone has off days and plans dont always go as planned so we tried to be understanding  The cleaning crew did have their work cut out for them and they apologized  The stay started off rough but while there the bed was comfy and the kitchen was great 
672412619,The location was great  Right on the streetcar route making it very easy to see the sights around KC BUT     The garage entrance instructions that were given to us were incorrect  The gate was broken and we had to call security to tell us where to go  We ended up having to pay     just to drop our bags off at the room    Then apartment was very minimalistic and had everything you would need for your stay as well as a great view of downtown BUT     There was a drainage issue in one of the bathroom sinks  The water would not drain and there were tons of black flies coming out of the drain area  My husband thinks they were coming from the sewer line  I messaged the hosts and they responded saying that it was probably because we left a window open   we were on the   th floor and no windows were ever opened    All in all  it was a fine place to stay and in a good location  Hopefully they fix the sink issues before the next guests arrive   The parking garage gate was broken so we ended up having to pay    dollars to bring the cars in to drop bags off   It was difficult to find the lockbox since we had to use a different entrance   Incorrect instructions on how to enter the garage at the property  There was a drainage issue in the bathroom that caused a lot of flies to appear 
109919836,Great place  superb decoration  good location  kind of cold and very noisy at night  bring your ear plugs  Very good place to stay though  Great place  superb decoration  good location  kind of cold and very noisy at night    It is very noisy at night Chris  I know is not your fault but it is difficult to get sleep  But so is Chicago  never sleeps isnt it  
342447167,Very clean apartment in neighborhood brimming with character  Rapid response time from host  Ran into a few major issues that were quickly resolved after communicating with the host  While we sincerely appreciated the overall cleanliness of the apartment and ease of check in  we feel negatively towards our experience because of the wrongful request of         post check out  Resolution was swift  but we will not be back  Very clean  but had a strange smell  Turns out that the smell was a wet  mildewed rug someone had balled up and left in the closet prior to our arrival  Host attempted to charge us almost      for rug replacement  However  after contacting the host the issue was quickly resolved  Great neighborhood and located next to promontory point  offering unparalleled views of the city and Lake Michigan  Approx     mins away  in car  from city center 
611321709,If you want to be harassed every time you walk into the building this is the place for you 
340687713,Clean and simple studio apartment for reasonable cost and in close proximity to University of Chicagos campus   I realize this is totally unforeseen  but the water throughout the apartment was not working in the morning which was bad timing since I needed to get ready for an interview later that morning and it didn u    t come back on before I checked out  
342409040,Excellent location  apartment was clean and safe  lots of work going on in the building making a bit of noise  Instructions were clear but a bit difficult to locate the lock box Very reasonable price  however quite a bit of noise from construction in the building during our stay 
564334083,Greater location  right in the heart of Lincoln Park   Very very close to many bars and restaurants  Great location  but we were not aware it was above a bar that stays open until well past our bedtime  
342356539,Good enough Hyde Park location  Very small unit  Walkable during daylight hours  Some funky body wash or something in the shower  Not at all clear if this was intentional or left from a previous guest  Didnt know there were   different buildings with the same street number  Key fob works for both buildings  Although there is a parking lot on site you cant park there  There were however a few undesirable looking people doing major automotive repairs in the lot  Nice enough neighborhood for Hyde Park 
640623051,A pretty decent stay 
333833150,Convenient place to stay  great communication  There is a smell upon entering the apartment 
599986191,alright place  slow responses
332608349,The location and proximity to UChicago is the best feature   The place was a bit smaller than anticipated  particularly the kitchen and living area   The apartment was old  but obviously clean  I believe some may have gotten sick in the hallway leading to the apartment  The stench in the hallway was rather horrible 
479055850,I would recommend just dont forget your key cause your not gonna be helped out It was great other than the whole getting locked out and not being helped thing  I got locked out of the apartment at a little after    am in the morning  I had to call twice before I got in touch with someone and once I did she said that she would put it down as in emergency  Four hours later I still hadnt heard from them at all  Finally someone living in the apartment let me in and I was able to get back in my room but it was no help from them
403810368,Very nice place to stay        mins from the heart of the city   No groceries stores in the area though  Washer did not work   the tv stopped working 
329780280,If you are looking for a place with little character or a non lived in feeling then this place will be good  In trading charm for sterility  it could be a bit cleaner in some places   but generally it was fine  just not what I was looking for   In terms of cleanliness  I definitely was underwhelmed due to the shower and linen situation   The linens on the bed seemed unfresh   the sheets and pillow cases had several hairs all over them and the cover for the comforter had definitely not been washed for a while    The bathroom shower curtain was covered in mildew and needs to be updated   The lobby and elevator smelled terrible  I didnt feel terribly safe at night walking from parking lot back to the apartment  Also   definitely street parking is a problem 
456491688,Awesome super clean really comfy bed roof was awesome    Light switches on some walls dont do anything Awesome super clean really comfy bed roof was awesome   
456459231,if you want to go to an airbnb with an unresponsive host then this will be a perfect place  The heat was pumping on when it was    degrees out  We tried turning it off multiple times and contacting the host but never heard back  If someone contacts you about an issue please do your job and respond back in a prompt fashion  We had contacted multiple times about the heat not being able to turn off  I also had messaged about the sheets being dirty  The sheets were not clean 
173061398,We stayed for   nights  Great location for what we needed  The price was right    The place didnt look or feel secure when we first got there  But the neighborhood seemed safe enough  There were a lot of street noise near the TV room  especially sirens  But the bedroom was quiet   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  shower  bugs  bathroom  kitchen  Additional comments   Mold on shower curtain  spiders in window corners  cherry pits left behind  floor appeared dirty in kitchen     
477664879,This was a lovely clean apartment in a great location  I was in Chicago for a conference at McCormick place and it was the perfect location for me  a ten minute walk with a starbucks and market on the way  There was a lovely selection of restaurants close by so for me it was perfect to be close to but not within the conference crowds during the week  I would most def  stay again  most of the time the responses were quick and things were taken care of  There was one or two times I needed to remind but not a big deal at all  Thank you for looking after me on my stay  I would highly recommend your business   accommodation  The smoke alarm sounds outside the apartment was slightly annoying  thank goodness the aircon shut it out  
673594506,Great location  Nice balcony and cozy spot  Normal city sounds if that doesnt bother you  Really nice having your own private parking spot and the security of the building made us feel safe  A couple minor issues with light bulbs burnt out and some dirty dishes but would stay at one of their properties again 
326587115,The location was quiet and lovely  and close to any conveniences you might want  Apartment was clean and comfortable   The TV was missing a fire stick  
624440056,This was a decent stay  The location is great  There was slight issues with the amenities and with the customer service and cleanliness  But in all it was an okay stay  The TV  and fire stick did not work at all  I notified the front desk on the issue and they advise that probably the batteries were dead in the fire stick remote and that was why I was not able to use it  They also did not provide a new set of batteries and I was not able to fully enjoy my time at the location  Also the bed was stained on the sheets also the bathroom curtain was stained  The sign in the room stating who cleaned the room and at what time was not noted at all 
672712501,This space was spacious and clean  We struggled to get to our room after getting there after the parking garage had closed  but eventually made it  Great location 
629060251,Great location with easy check in  Was a little dissapointed in overall appearance  Lots of marks on the walls throughout the whole unit and very large  old water damage above the bathroom door 
629084056,Good location  Walking distance to gas station  pharmacy  upscale restaurants and shopping  hospital  huge park and much more  Extremely comfortable beds  Could stand to be a bit cleaner but overall great for the money and location  Lots of free street parking near by and great views  Would recommend more toilet paper and paper towels for future guests  The beds were awesome  I wish I knew where you got the mattresses because they were extremely comfortable  The whole place could really use a deep cleaning  Could definitely tell that housekeeping did a quick once over 
622802305,Great deal for the price  Was great deal and had no other issues other than it could have been cleaned better  Cleaning wasnt taken care of before we arrived  Had dirty toilets and dirty dishes in the cabinets 
628922820,Good location Not a great space if youre not a fan of roaches CockRoach Still waiting on a response for a refund  I had to leave after being there only a couple hours because there was a huge cockroach in the bathroom
653516621,What you see is exactly what you get nothing less  Would recommend and would for sure stay there again  Thank you for allowing me to stay in ur well put together space for being a good host 
653515602,Perfect location in the downtown area 
622590987,Great location great view Maintenance had to enter during my stay which was not very preferable
579032994,Small studio apt that gives you all you need for a basic and comfortable stay 
545572806,The photographer should get an Academy Award for Photographers  We DO NOT recommend this place   Stayed in AirBNBs all over the world and NEVER been in anyplace so gross   Staircase is really dirty and the mold spores are palatable  Once in the apartment  the smell is ok  not great  but ok  The furnishings are very sparse  No dressers on which to put jewelry   change   you know  a spot to empty your pocket contents  Do not look under the sink cabinets   YIKES   They offered an insta pot water heater  a french press  and the remnants of a bag of coffee which we had no idea how long it had been in the cabinet and whose hands had been in the bag   it is flu season  ya know  No ice trays  but a     used bag of ice   again  flu season   They did bring a fresh bag of coffee and   ice trays on day   of our   day stay   No salt  pepper  sugar or sweetener  Two mirrors over the   bath sinks   be sure what you pack will look good  cause there is no chance to check before going out   unless you can get your reflection in the TV  Tub is a safety hazard   Big climb into the claw footed tub with nothing to hold onto   Take care not to trip on the too  long curtain  Also  be very careful about the coffee table   it is concave and will swallow  whatever you set on the edge   go for the center to be safe  Linens and towels were fine  mini toiletries ok  bed was good  location was great  communication was very good and they were very nice  Not much  zen  from Zencity  tho  My advice   keep looking  As you know  we were much less than impressed  You can read my review   Sorry   gotta be honest  For what it was  it was too expensive  I guess we paid for the location  but wed have rather stayed in a different neighborhood under better conditions 
622576994,very nice and clean place  conveniently located  Entering the building at checkin and exiting it after checkout was not as easy as I would have expected It was a nice stay  Leaving the building at time of checkout is a little tricky because the key fob apparently is needed to exit the parking garage
348654242,                                                                                                                                                                                        
348363545,Good place to stay 
312497462,Was a good place   
607227467,Great place to stay  not too far for the center  in a nice neighborhood  The unit is very well equipped and cozy  The kitchen is well designed so you can easily prepare meals and save by eating in  Its roomy for a couple  Note though that the unit is above the street and you may want to pack ear plugs for the night  We had a great time in St Louis and were glad to stay at Zencity  Thanks for the great stay   The unit is really nice  As said before  the cleaning crew didnt do a good job  kitchen countertops were not clean  sink was not clean  bathroom in general was not clean and the shower in particular was really not clean  Also  the AC heating vent in the bedroom is very noisy  The windows do not provide good noise or thermal insulation  Apart from that  the unit is very well equipped  it feels quite cozy and its great to have a closed parking lot  Check in out were very easy 
310474972,nice place perfect location   Chris nothing new to say  I am so sorry  wish you work the things i told you out  Anyway you where very cool as always thank you  limpieza  falta limpieza y detalles de los elementos de la casa
622640715,It was a great get a way  The directions stated to take the elevator to the  th floor upon arrival   This was not possible without a key fob   A resident had to scan us to the  th floor  Rug was very dirty   Looked like it had never been vacuumed   Threads and debris all over it 
309683596,Zencitys apt has a lot of great things going for it  The location in Hyde Park was awesome   Plenty of shops to dining options  The space itself is roomy  very clean and well appointed  WiFi worked well  Parking wasnt a hassle  I was able to park on the street by the building easily every time  Never having to drive around the block once  And self checkin and out were relatively easy  My only gripe with the apartment was the AC  Theres a small AC unit in the living room  but not in the bathroom and that AC just wasnt cutting it for me  The only fan was also the one mounted on the ceiling in the living room  So I just couldnt get comfortable enough to sleep due to the warm and muggy weather we were having  Guessing the weather usually cool in Chicago  Anyways  I ended up dragging the bed mattress into to living room right by the AC so I could be cool enough to sleep  Other then that there were minor issues with the building itself which Im assuming was beyond Zencitys control  like the need for two separate keys just to get to the apartment door  The hallways in the building being particularly warm and smelly  as well as the elevator which broke down the evening I needed it the most when I was moving my all three of my heavy cases which l need for work   All in All I feel Zencity makes an huge honest effort to provide a clean comfortable space  but the planets were somehow aligned to work against them    A  C was a listed amenity  but was only in the living room  Not in the bedroom where it probably mattered more  at least for me   
308032596,if u   fussy   this place is not   u   electricity very funky  that ac kitchen light and bedside light issue should have been fixed before u rented   kitchen cabinets outside and in need cleaning  no shades on windows means u wake up as soon as sun rises  no stores nearby so a nice touch would have been coffee available  water pressure terrible in bathroom and no hooks to hang clothes  bathtub narrow and curved  I fell the first time I used it  u need to put something down  I almost broke a bone  bathroom floor rug  could be cleaner  hallways smell awful    only bed is shown     cabinets and refrigerator
304447298,Lovely place   Its better you drive or uber   Value for money  Overall I had a good stay  Its pleasing to know that Former president Barrack Obama use to live around here  Ill be back   Outside the building pretty much isn u    t as new   the elevator as well  But inside the apartment are pretty much ok  Itll help if details on how far it is to the airport is included in the details 
535130642,Very nice location in a nice neighborhood  close to L red line  close to the lake shore  close to the Lincoln zoo  Easy and immediate communication with management  If you do not mind loud music until      or      am coming for the bars below the apartment  I did not mind it   it is a very nice place  I would book it again  I wold implement the quality buying a new couch  the one in the apartment was not usable  very uncomfortable  Very nice location  Very easy communication  very appreciated  The music from the   bars on the sidewalk did not bother us but  as another reviewer said  just specify it in your ad  A new and comfortable couch 
304465243,Place wasnt super clean  but location is great and check in was smooth  hair left in bathtub  food  hair clips  and nail clippings in common areas 
597429522,Parking is not as bad as other reviewers have said  Pretty easy to find public spaces around the corner  and a private garage for     a night 
303513121,Very nice place  Although be aware that there is only ONE small window a c unit placed in the living room  If you are planning on staying here in warmer months be prepared to sleep on the floor in the living room by the window unit just to stay SLIGHTLY cooler throughout the night as the bedroom is way too hot   Only one small window a  c unit in the living room  Bedroom was too hot  Both had to sleep on the floor in the living room and even then  still sweated   
640602010,The apartment was clean  and the location was great for us as it was down the street from my sister who we were visiting  We went during Covid and was looking forward to using the kitchen instead of eating out  While there is a stove and a fridge  the pots and pans situation is a little bleak  I would recommend bringing your own so you know you have what you need  There was no kitchen knife  or measuring cups as an example  This may not be a huge deal to most as people typically are going out when they visit somewhere  but for us we chose it because it had a full kitchen and then were a little frustrated with the commodities of it  My sister typically brought her own over  One of the instructions is to head  up  the stairs  and through the first door  You cant get through the first door because you need the key fob  You have to go DOWN the stairs  to the elevator  and then you can access the apartment door  So took a while to figure it out in a new space  Kitchen dishwasher was already full of dirty dishes so just had to run it  Not a huge deal  but reason I gave   stars 
710620726,NA Get better housekeeping Cracks in the walls  area rug was dirty  and shelves were not placed 
298784049,Easy communication  Chris  thinks of everything that you would need and is very responsive    Great  layout and very clean   Thanks for all the amenities  House was in great shape and appreciated the netflix and  Amazon  sling    Beds were very comfortable  We all felt at home    I wish there was a mention of the construction being done in the building  A little dusty for my taste  but great work done in the loft itself  Felt very comfortable most of the time   
532921594,This is a solid apartment in a good location  Spacious and relatively clean  although there were a couple dustballs on the bedroom floor when I checked in  didnt really bother me though   The kitchen is equipped with everything you need  They supply you with all essential toiletries and more  Bed is comfortable as well  Wifi is fast  Check in and check out couldnt be easier  The only downside which other reviewers have mentioned is the very poor cell phone service  I use AT T  in the apartment and in the building as well but its not something you can blame Zenicity for  Also  a tad bit expensive for what you get but overall a great spot 
297877697,correct  difficulte a stationner  terrasse geniale probablement rajouter ustensiles de cuisine  bols a salade  tasses verre a vin  pas assez de  coutaux pour    pas verre a vin  tiroirs et armoires plus ou moins propres
590806382,It was a great place to stay  very clean and modern  The location was a bit off for us  we would have preferred to stay downtown or closer to more stores restaurants  The price was great for what you get  A little coffee shop attached to the building was very convenient  Also  the front desk attendant was really nice and welcoming  She even gave us her parking spot when we checked in  Our stay was great  Theres just a few things that would make it excellent  We had a group of four and it was hard to do our own thing with only one key to the building and room  Also  the living room didnt have enough seating comfortably  One of us basically had to hang out on our room  Lastly  the smaller bedroom needed a mirror   other than that  everything was great  the lady at the front desk was so nice and even gave us her parking spot when she checked in  As described  but far from downtown 
590782049,This space was in a really fun and cute neighborhood  The check in was simple   accessible  The only reason our stay did not merit full marks was that the walls of the apartment are very thin and there was a lot of construction noise and loud music in the unit above  often early in the morning  This was not a deal breaker  just worth noting  Overall a very comfortable  clean and convenient space     Also while there is not provided parking we had very little trouble finding close street parking 
340364273,very nice clean place 
339453438,This is a nice place to rent if you are ok with bare basics  The neighborhood was safe  Downtown is one bus ride to and from so its easy to get around from this location  The host doesnt set up the apartment very nicely so be prepared to bring everything you need  The dishes were dirty and the toilet seat and kitchen counters needed to be wiped down  This space is REALLY tiny  Looks way bigger on the photos but its basically a room with a bed  a mini kitchen that is fully functional  and a bathroom  Its super cute though  The last air bnb I sated in had new toiletries and she stocked the fridge with some waters and juice  It would have been nice to have a note and a little more amenities especially for the price  Also was disappointed with the size of the place and the cleanliness   The pictures make the space look A LOT bigger than it actually is  The kitchen had crumbs on the counter and the bathroom toilet needed to be wiped
710277870,Had trouble checking in with speaker system they use and there were dirty glasses  But overall a nice stay after everything 
628349360,This guy accused me of all kinds of stuff that wasnt true tried to blame me for his broken window and accused me of absurd things then wanted to request more money from me    for the maid to have to wash a few dishes when I was rushed out with people knocking at the door at       I paid a cleaning fee once and would have cleaned the few dishes had I not been rushed out at           I dont know if hes just hurting for money or what his deal is but I was shocked and appalled
714710387,Feels more like a hospital setting   the space is extremely small
337530589,La unidad es muy comoda en muy buena ubicaci n   el lugar por fuera es un poco viejo pero muy c modo  lo  nico malo fue que al llegar al self check in a las   am nuestras llaves no estaban y al recibir el duplicado hab a gente en nuestra unidad tardaron   hora para darnos otra unidad  La unidad es muy buena  tiene todo lo que se necesita lo malo solo fue el error que cometieron al tener a otras personas en la unidad que nos correspond a y hacernos esperar a esas horas de la madrugada  sugiero un poco m s cuidado con las reservaciones  fuera de eso todo excelente   La TV nunca funciono  el internet si estuvo muy bien  igual como la comodidad y limpieza   Al llegar a las   am en el self check in no estaba la llave y cuando nos pasaron el duplicado hab a gente en nuestra unidad completamente desagradable esa noche  despu s de   hora nos ofrecieron otra unidad para pasar la noche  Tardaron   hora para resolvernos lo de la unidad que ya estaba ocupada por otras personas 
405177761,Neighborhood feels quiet and safe  close proximity to places to dine out as well as the university  Coffee or breakfast not provided so make sure you have other plans for that  Kitchen is stocked with utensils for you to make your own meals  Very nice TV  Shower knob is backwards  so turn it all the way to cold to get hot water  The apartment building it is in has an old dormitory feel to it and was a little dirty  but the apartment itself feels better  Old radiators do make noise  but you can get used to it  Overall a good deal  Thank you so much for hosting  The space in general was nice but it really felt like it needed to be vacuumed well  including the carpet in the common area  It might also be a good idea to make a note somewhere that the knob in the shower is backwards  so you have to turn it all the way to cold to get the hot water to come out  I noticed in a review from someone else they thought it didnt have hot water because they didnt figure out that the shower knob works backwards  Took me a while to figure it out  The radiator in the living space seems to leak  small pool of water on the floor under it   which is totally fine but since Im not used to radiator heat I wasnt sure if that was a problem or not  so just making a note to people about that too  Overall I was very grateful to have accommodations so close to the university for my class  The neighborhood is nice and very quiet  felt very safe  Thank you 
285431100,Pleasure visiting to Chicago nice apartment    Thank you for everything   It was a pleasure staying at your place         
284590070,The apartment is a house of cards  Items to look cool  but nothing readibly usable  The soulless apartment and careless reponses  appears to be a company that bought the building and made it as cheap as possible while trying to still mimic Airbnbs    u   cHouse of cards  A tv that wasnt even plugged in  just there to look like an apartment  Coffee bean to look cool but no way to make coffee  Apartment temperature kept getting wirelessly changed throughout the day after we kept trying to set it    It was    u   d   Completely careless aboit questions  Felt like they just wanted to get rid of you  One of many instances  i asked them about parking for the weekend and they answered as simple as there is hourly parking    Sent mr a message as soon as i left that i have    Soulless house of cards  A company that bought a building and tried to make as much as possible without doing a single thing  
283302904,It was a nice place just like the pictures I only wish it was bigger   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  size of home   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions 
334619020,For the cost  I was expecting a little more from the building and the space but overall I give   stars   Loved the open windows   amenities but I wasnt able to use the Wi Fi due to an outage in the area which sucked  Host Chris  was good with communication and was readily available to chat at anytime which made a good experience  Only negatives are the place is right behind the space where the elevator is so I heard humming throughout the entire night and I left a personal item but wasnt able to retrieve it before the next guest came so it was never returned   so make sure to double check behind yourself to not leave anything behind  Thanks again for the stay  Nice place   loved the open windows  It just sucks you couldnt find a way to return my charger  Older building   the main lobby area   walkway was very cluttered   outdated 
650242608,Great Area  Nice and Peaceful  A lot of stores and restaurants around the area 
650619178,  
170461458,Great location in a great neighborhood  but would be hard pressed to again Kay what I did when I can get a     star hotel in the area for the same or less thru online booking services  
276750623,Overall nice place  We would have felt we got our value if the place had been clean and was a little more comfortable in terms of furnishing   It looks in photos much more comfortable then it is   for example  the beds were smaller than they looked so my boyfriend and I could not sleep in the same room    Floors and hand rails were sticky  Lots of dust  And in general  it just did not look like it had been cleaned by a professional in a very long time 
643701772,Place is very modern and nice  pictures are accurate  my only issue was no hot water  the A C didnt blow as cold as Id like  and the bathroom hadnt been cleaned  if those things are corrected this place has great potential  Place is very modern and nice  pictures are accurate  my only issue was no hot water  the A C didnt blow as cold as Id like  and the bathroom hadnt been cleaned  if those things are corrected this place has great potential 
404882442,Great spot  great place  Loads of space and nice features  Excellent location in Wicker Park area  The front steps were pretty icy given the weather at the time  but in spite of that everything was excellent  Great place  great location  and easy check in and out  The front steps were treacherous and could use some attention when there is freezing rain and snow accumulation 
718808108,The bed wasnt very comfortable  which was really all we needed the place for  But otherwise a great value and good location  The bed was uncomfortable  Sags to middle  Key fob doesnt work  Had to use code for entire stay 
608061053,The building is nice  Theres a front desk service and the employees were extremely friendly  The unit itself was big  two bathrooms and a very spacious bedroom  Good location  too  Had a couple hiccups with the internet and some noice due to some maintenance work the building is doing right now  Putting in new windows   so its loud early in the mornings but other than that  a great stay  There were a couple hiccups with check in and the room not being cleaned on time  as well as some real noise issues  and internet outage  but other than that the space was overall good 
275243643,Great location  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
603854433,Great location and easy parking
607780881,Beautiful space in a very accommodating building  It is hard to find parking in the area late at night  It would have been nice to have had basic cooking oil and salt and pepper 
607768831,This place has a fabulous view and comfy  stylish furniture  Would definitely stay here again  This place has a fabulous view  The furniture is very comfortable as well  I would suggest more towels and a bit more attention to cleanliness of the bathroom  found a few hairs upon arrival  
331432337,We enjoyed our overall stay  but a lack of kitchen amenities was very frustrating  for example  only a single wine glass  no spatula  no salt and pepper  and so forth   Nevertheless  the excellent location and beautiful nighttime view made up for these negative points  I would highly recommend this location for a short visit to Chicago  We enjoyed the stay overall  but the lack of kitchen amenities was frustrating  Nevertheless  the excellent location and beautiful nighttime view made up for these negative points   The kitchen amenities were minimal  only a single wine glass  no spatula  not salt and pepper  and so forth    The windows were really dirty  which defies the purpose of having a beautiful view 
271536483,Great apartment in a great location    u   cI couldnt find the lock box right away with the instructions given u   d  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions  entering the home  Additional comments   Apartment is on the other side of the building  not buy Apt     or      I found it eventually   
271203301,Super cute little place  Perfect for a quiet night  The walls are a little thin and the halls smell a bit off  but the actual apartment is perfect  I would stay again for sure   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  
331030009,Location wise  this place was great  Its only about a five  to    minute walk to Wicker Park  which has a ton of food and bar options  I do wish it were a tad cleaner  just an extra dusting and some air freshener would do   but overall  I was happy with my stay  Thanks for getting back to me so quickly  Great communication  All in all  this was a clean space  but there were places in the house  next to beds  on top of counters  etc   that needed a little extra dusting  One of the sheet sets also had a pink stain of some sort   Not a big deal  but still   There was also a lot of flies in the apartment  which were in the back bedroom 
330577984,The place was clean although the neighborhood was a bit tougher than we would thought  Also a bit difficult to find but we were navigating at night  Very communicative host  though  Directions to check in were difficult to follow 
607368325,Very clean unit  Easy check in  host responded in timely matter  Due for some maintenance  but other then that no complaints 
650210048,Good location  cute little court yard   Could have been a bit cleaner  Had some issues with the door handle not wanting to unlock the door to the apartment   Otherwise  nice place  The door handle lock to get directly into the apartment does not seem to work very well  The key would go in but it would take a few tries to get it to catch within the lock and open up  The bathroom was not as clean as expected  The plates were still wet in the kitchen cabinets   Could have used kitchen towels or paper towel 
607338138,Clean and minimal space  Great location  We stayed for a weekend and thanks to the location had a good vantage point to explore  On our second day we had difficulty to get into the apartment due to the lock passcode expiring  It would took us some time to reach the host and solve the issue  It would have been so much better if there were a      support line to reach Zencity  We had a lock issue in the apartment due to an expired passcode  We tried calling Zencity from the phone number provided however no one picked up  Eventually  we were able to reach them through messaging but it would have been a much better experience if there was a      support line to call  We had a lock issue in the apartment due to an expired passcode  We tried calling Zencity from the phone number provided however no one picked up  Eventually  we were able to reach them through messaging but it would have been a much better experience if there was a      support line to call  The listing was pretty barren  For the price  I was hoping we could be provided stuff like coffee tea etc

554531487,Great location Thank you    Please consider making a coffee maker and coffee available for future quests  I would have like to have access to coffee and coffee maker in the apartment 
404583884,incredible view  grand building  nice little apartment  I enjoyed the experience  thank you very much  I enjoyed the stay a lot  incredible view  nice apartment  it was a little smaller than I expected  and the cleaning fee seemed a little much  especially for how the flat was    hairs on the floor  but otherwise it was really great  thanks again  wasnt bad at all  just not as clean as you might like cleaning fee   was extortionate
327875529,Very convenient for visitors to the University of Chicago   On street parking was available   Clean and attractive apartment   The web page listed a sofa  which we planned for my son to sleep on   The apartment had only a chaise  chair  
327392465,The apartment is in a great location away from street noise   It was very clean and nicely appointed although there was no desk   The bed squeaks so put the mattress on the floor  The bed was horribly squeeky   We should have taken the mattress off and put it on the floor   The list of amenities said   Laptop friendly workspace  nA table or desk with space for a laptop and a chair that u    s comfortable to work in    There wasnt anything like that  
607298539,Very spacious  Lots of stairs though  Only one bathroom for such a big space  Overall not to bad 
606848213,Very easy check in and check out process  Great location and trendy apartment  The L is pretty loud since it is so close to the apartment location
629278063,Great location above sip   savor coffee house When arrived the couch was broken and never replaced for   week our entire stay   That was a huge inconvenience  wish  That I could have received a discount or half off coupon for my next stay 
662968387,Nice and quiet place
605943196,Great location for University of Chicago visit  Secure building and timely response from staff  You need to get a new mattress and pillows  Lumpy mattress and sub standard pillows 
605491293,Decent place to stay barring the stairs especially when you have significant luggage to take with you  Stairs inconvenient for luggage and some amenities were not restocked up to last enough  when i was supposed to stay for about for a week  Everything else was OK 
605480688,Quick response and friendly communication  Thank you 
605441013,Great place to stay  close to everything  The building itself is well kept with a ton of amenities including free cappuccinos in the morning  Overall it was good  It was a bit loud    there is a gap below the front door that really makes everything that happens right outside the door easy to hear 
650549349,Overall nice  affordable place to stay in  My only issues were with the cleanliness in the bathroom and loud AC unit in the bedroom 
712666401,A great place for two people exploring the downtown area  The bedroom area  living space  kitchen  and bathroom are clean and have everything you need  While the location is convenient for visiting downtown  we could walk to the City Museum  for example   we would not feel comfortable walking around at night  I also did not like having to park my car on the street  Overall  I recommend  We enjoyed our stay  Thank you  The location is downtown  So very close to a lot of important place   we walked to the City Museum  for example  But  I did feel like we needed to exercise caution at night  and I felt a bit uneasy parking my car overnight on the street 
629115223,Unreliable WiFi   not the cleanest bathroom  Ok for the price  I had to wait in the lobby for    minutes because the previous renter had not returned their keys by   pm  There were bugs everywhere in the bathroom  Could not get ahold of host when I had no WiFi 
708541466,Our stay at Zencity was very short lived  Upon entering the apartment  the tables  toilets  walls and flooring were not clean  The whole place smelled horrible because the dishwasher was full of water and dishes  We had to leave right after when checked in related to the poor conditions  Although we did have great and expeditious responses from customer service  we still were not fully refunded what we originally paid  I would not consider renting from zencity in the future  I wanted to say thank for your quick response and customer service  but this apartment really needs some upkeep and deep cleaning performed before it is rented out again  I am also upset that I lost one night on my refund  But I was pleased with the quick responses from Marty   The photos made the place look clean and upscale  When in reality  it was the complete opposite   The tables  toilets  walls and floors were disgusting  The whole place smelled like dead fish because the dishwasher was full of water and dishes  It was absolutely not worth the listed price 
613217513,Nice location  off the lake great view  Thanks for the apartment very nice place and great location  Just one down fall  the couch was not really great  I think it needs to be replace but overall nice stay
244464967,Its was a cool place   u   cTv was broken  u   d 
722206578,Hopefully the cleanliness of he apartment was just an oversight and the cleaning lady forgot  I tried to communicate my issue with you all before leaving a review that might hurt your business  but I had no reply   Parking was uncovered and farther than parking on street in front  We had a snow days before my stay and my spot was not shoveled and very icy   I dont think this apartment was cleaned at all  Pillow cases were incredibly wrinkled and smooth where a head would have laid  Found two hairs on the back side of the pillow cases  Carpet was not vacuumed  Dirty broken cup in bathroom  and coffee maker was super dirty  wrote my complaints to host and never heard back a dirty apartment is worth   to me
316591744,Had a great experience here  Very modern  The location was great as it is walking distance to many businesses yet not too far from downtown  No complaints at all  No suggestions  it was an awesome experience   Seemed a little bigger from photos but still great  Would be PERFECT with designated parking but still in a great location 
707838681,Great place  only complaint is the A C was off for the entire Apartment building  But it was not the Hosts fault  Other than that great for the price 
538991349,I came for the Chicago Half Marathon at Jackson Park so the location was great to be close to the event location as well as only   min away from downtown   The apartment is spacious and big enough for two  There are some nice touches but nothing too thoughtful  I enjoyed my stay but the communication with the host wasnt as I expected  I had unforeseen trip changes and arrived one day later  My request to make adjustments to the booking wasnt recognized  It felt like communicating with a robot and receiving automatic messages  Thanks for letting me stay at the apartment  Everything was fine except I was looking forward to a response in regards to my request  No response to request to adjust booking due to unforeseen trip changes   flight cancellation due to severe weather
158391559,Chris was very helpful in the planning period and answered emails very rapidly  The location is truly amazing within a few minutes walk of many key sites  The entrance to the apartment is less than ideal  through a shared back courtyard with large bins and up a small creaky stairwell past the entrance of one of the lower level apartments which is the back of a busy  sometimes noisy  working restaurant kitchen  The apartment itself is very impressive  hugely spacious  big bedroom and bathroom  latter is just behind the kitchen  and open plan living room with large TV  All together a comfortable and convenient stay    We had an issue with the Amazon prime  Also in the book it mentions there is a     promo code with Lyft   this turned out to be only       Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home 
604560884,Zencitys place was very clean and in a good location  Be informed that there is no parking space for the apartment but there is parking close by  Overall  it was a good experience and reasonably priced  This is definitely a host to stay with when visiting Chicago  Thanks Zencity  Thanks so much for your hospitality  My husband enjoyed the stay and was able to take care of business in a comfortable and clean apartment  Thanks again 
235179285,Great central location in Hyde Park  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  
673945092,This was a great place  great location  and beautiful apartment  My only downfall was the towel situation  We had   guests and asked for a towel for each guest  Unfortunately we only got   full size towels    smaller towel  and   wash cloths  I requested more towels but it took them until almost the last day to drop them off 
640129277,Overall a fantastic location close to a beautiful neighborhood  The only issue we had was the fact that other guests dont know how to respect an Airbnb like it was their own home and the walls were very scuffed and lots of water stains on the paint as well    a fresh coat of paint and this place would be perfect  The only thing I would say is that the place overall was very clean but there should be a new coat of  non flat  paint for the whole apartment because people apparently dont know how to treat an Airbnb like their own and the walls were very scuffed and dirty with water spots 
719494909,Easy communication  Great location  The place was sparkling clean and very stylish  I would recommend this place to my friends and family if they need a place to stay in Kansas City  We enjoyed our staying at your place  Great location  the place was clean  easy covered parking and easy communication  My only suggestion is to invest in a better mattress  I tried the mattress in both rooms and they could be more comfortable  We only stayed   nights and it was the most we could stand   Thank you for the staying   Paula 
719767361,The apartment was almost all clean   outside of the bathroom tub which was cleaned within    hours  and was nicely decorated  It was in a nice location  The issue is really with the customer service  A company hosts this Airbnb and so we expected to interact with customer service representatives who were efficient  professional  and pleasant  Unfortunately  we did not have that experience at all  We attempted to extend the Airbnb by   day  The day was available on Airbnb and we figured there would not be any issues in extending  We attempted to extend   days prior to our check out date and did not receive any correspondence from the company until the day we were supposed to check out  They called us in the afternoon and told us there were folks waiting outside to clean and asked us whether we were going to check out  I tried to explain that we had requested an extension  The representative said that despite that   business days had past  their team of representatives had failed to see the request  They also said that they saw it today and attempted to approve it but because they saw it after   am they could not approve it  They said  your only option is to pay an additional    for the remaining day  They did not express any empathy or understanding or acknowledge their negligence and lack of responsiveness  Eventually  the customer service representative became rude and quite patronizing over the phone  even trying to give me unsolicited advice about how I should go about things in the future  We decided to go ahead and leave    All things considered  could we have reminded the customer service representatives that there was an outstanding request  sure  But  thats not our job as a customer  I expect that the customer service and their team can manage their work without their customers needing to intervene  I was disappointed to see that for Zencity  that is not the case  Code to get in was complicated  long  and not correct  Took us about    minutes to be able to get in  Bathtub was dirty upon arrival  I called them and they cleaned it the next day  Zencity waited two days to respond about the extension  Truly  they never did respond to the request  they just called to say that somebody was at the apartment to clean it  They never gave check out instructions and never replied to our extension request to deny or approve  It was very unclear what was happening  The customer service rep told me that nobody even looked at the request until the day we ended up having to leave  Neither of the two days that passed were holidays or weekends  Both were business days  Ultimately their negligence caused a lot of miscommunication  Their customer service over the phone was terrible  Condescending  patronizing  and unhelpful  They do not take responsibility for their actions  The apartment is great and the price is good  but the customer service experience is awful 
547635540,the apartment met our expectations   cleanliness and functionality   Great location   place of command Thank you for your hospitality   it was nice to be with you for a week   Best Regards
650186116,I recommend it Everything was nice except the shower that wasnt clean  Thanks Stinks
311173223,We moved out after night   of a planned   night stay due to cleanliness and maintenance issues  Situation made good by Airbnb after only a small refund offered by the host     Property was still being serviced when we arrived to check in
671243531,This is a great place for a quick weekend trip  Location is great and close to everything  Very secluded and safe  We could walk to most places from the apartment  The only thing is to be weary about the train when booking  The blue line CTA is directly behind the apartment so you can hear the train all night morning long 
433447615,This Airbnb is almost perfect  The location was very convenient for my needs  close to a Walgreens  restaurants and bars  and UChicagos campus  As a woman  I felt pretty safe walking nearby    The check in instructions were clear and the pictures are very accurate  I thought the place was spotless  which felt comfortable    The only issue is the shower  as other guests have described  It has very low water pressure  which makes it hard to fully bathe  Given that  I wouldnt stay here for more than a couple nights until its fixed    Overall  though  a really good Airbnb experience  Hi there  thanks for hosting me  I overall thought the place was great and very true to the description  HOWEVER  you absolutely need to get the shower fixed  Its really quite impossible to bathe with the shower like that  the water pressure is extremely low and doesnt reach your body even if youre directly under the showerhead   If it werent for that  your place would be perfect 
624742483,You need to buy a new couch   VERY uncomfortable to the point where you really cant even lay on it       I had to buy my own cushions with a board underneath to make it bearable    refrigerator
583400579,Terrific location and very secure  We were a    minute walk to our sons condo  location was super  Fix the screen in the living space since the windows need to be open all the time  Dont understand why mgmt  has the heat so high in the entire building     A little stark  way too hot  and the space could use a second mirror   A piece of broken glass the size of a quarter on the bedroom floor  Just missed stepping on it  The location was secure and in a great location  The TV was silly at best 
624459770,Super easy check in  Location and parking were no problem at all which can be tough in Chicago  Unfortunately with the pandemic most of the amenities   pool tables  gym  etc were closed so that was a tad bit of a bummer  Place was clean and minimal  Only real cons were that there was a power outage during our stay that lasted about an hour  And that I was at times a bit hot in the apartment  Theres isnt central air or a thermostat  just a window unit in the living room   the bedroom is down the hall   so it was hard to kind of control the temp in the house  Overall I would consider staying here again 
671111881,Great stay  Thanks for such a wonderful space  Also  it would have been nice to have parking accommodations  Parking validation 
224581249,Chriss place is in a great location with uber being a great way to get places quick  The space was perfect for   people  The shower was cold every time though  He provided netflix and cards which made for a great extra touches       Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bedroom   
629655151,Good location  The screen on the outside of the building was broken  A resident happened to be sitting in his car and he let us in the building and said the screen has been broken and had been having major issues The sink has some food particles in it  And the shower had some shavings in it
618693237,Its a beautiful place  I just advise you to inspect carefully that its cleaned  Hair all over the shower  The bed linens also had hair all thru them  At first I picked them up and threw it  however there was so many hairs that it was obvious the blankets hadnt been washed so I washed them on my own  There were crumbs on the counter and A TOE NAIL ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR  Aesthetically the unit looked nice  but sitting down and noticing all the small hick ups were not acceptable especially since I paid a cleaning fee  I would like a refund for that  I took pictures and sent them in  I called a few times and was not able to get in contact with my host  It went to voicemail several times before reaching someone  It was pertinent to speak with someone because the door codes didnt not work upon arrival  Better cleaning      
220960770,                                                           Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  
713923430,Not the best communication from this management company  Cleanliness issues  Better to go with privately run airbnbs  We werent told that we would have to pay for parking Stains on floor in kitchen  dusty floors  stains on walls   doors Did not give us check in instructions the day before until I asked  Said we couldnt check in   hr early because someone booked it for one night last min so they had to clean but the board in the condo clearly states the last cleaning was a week before our arrival
475717858,Rooms were much more basic than expected especially considering the price   Carpet and couch were very musty looking  wood was scratched up throughout the place and basic things like side tables didnt exist  Overall was quite disappointed especially since its managed by a management company    Had an old and tired feel  Ended up moving my family out early  Rooms were much more basic than expected especially considering the price   Carpet and couch were very musty looking  wood was scratched up through the place and basic things like side tables didnt exist  Overall was quite disappointed especially since its managed by a management company  Super old and tired feel 
652317201,Nice location and very spacious  No complete privacy due to soft loft build  We enjoyed our stay for the most part  Not as clean as we wouldve liked  Entire place had an odor and so did the couch 
309051305,great building and nice unit  although the host was responsive the unit could have been cleaner   wasnt cleaned very thoroughly 
309034207,Pretty nice apartment in an aging high rise  Views of the lake area decent  Place was clean and well furnished

308508612,The pictures are accurate with the exception of minor cleanliness issues  Very chic decor and building  Excellent location walking distance to many points of interest and dinning options  The building personnel are friendly and beyond helpful  Very stylish decor and excellent location  The building personnel were extremely helpful as well   Lost key charge was stated as     but was asked for     by the host   There were unsettling stains on the bedroom carpet and shower curtain  The bathroom needed to be mopped and there were dirty dishes put away in the cupboard

204743428,Clean  funky  comfortable place to crash  the common area entrance isnt the cleanest but it doesnt speak to the unit itself  which is fine  Hi Chris  The bed was comfy and the place was clean  But coming into the unit was a little creepy  Lots of clutter in the common area and the crudely scrawled sign on the door was not a good welcome  Also  one of the lights in the bathroom doesnt work   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  Additional comments   u   cThe unit was clean and fine  the foyer was very cluttered and off putting   u   d    Entry through the alley was a little creepy   
195991049,Chriss place was great  It was close to a bunch of great places to eat  get coffee  and a quick walk to major tourist attractions  I loved the location  but it was pretty hot this week and I had some trouble sleeping   The kitchen was well stocked and the place was very comfortable  I would stay here again  but maybe not in a heat wave  Hey Chris    as a host myself it rubbed me the wrong way to be asked for   stars and private feedback  I actually had a great stay at your place  but I think its important for guests to know if there are any issues with a place  Its what I love about Airbnb  The transparency makes this community great      Thanks 
140968935,The place is wonderfully located  It is walking distance from Water Tower place  and near many eateries etc  That is its main charm  But it can be noisy at night  especially weekend nights  And its dark  Only one bedroom has windows  The other bedroom and living area do not  When I stayed there  the kitchen was not adequately equipped even for coffee and tea   It was shocking that there were only two cups  We were three people  at least six cups should be there  No kettle either  And the apartment was so noisy on Friday night    Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  amenities   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable

651027682,Accurate great location and always Zencity stylish  Thanks for a great place to stay  The bathtub took   hours to drain  Probably needs unclogged  Also someones hair was all over the bathroom floor  I think the cleaning person didnt do the floors bc there was dirty door prints and the sink had I think toothpaste in it  Otherwise the threshold to the bathroom definitely should get fixed bc u could get hurt on it 
651023180,The apartment is good for a stay if you are interested in being downtown  as its not a far walk to the Arch and other attractions in the area  There are some decent bars and restaurants nearby as well  The listing mentions a roof  but there isnt actually roof access  Overall the place was a decent choice for my working trip 
620184502,Although  I didnt get to stay in the beautiful apartment due to unforeseen circumstances  communication was fast and effective and check in was well explained  Although  I didnt get to stay in the beautiful apartment due to unforeseen circumstances  communication was fast and effective and check in was well explained 
301718501,We liked this clean  serene apartment in heart of Hyde Park  It was an easy walk for us to enjoy dinner in the neighborhood  and a short jaunt to the University of Chicago  where our activities were centered   The building is architecturally charming and very safe  Host gave clear directions for secure entry access  Sleeping on couch rather tricky  even for a small  fit person like myself  The bedroom  however  was spacious and well appointed   Had to give that over to my tall teenager    We loved the location and the serenity  security and cleanliness of your apartment  thank you   The couch in the common space isnt really suitable for an adult to sleep on  Im            pounds   lean  limber and fit  I found the couch too short to fully stretch out  too narrow to stay asleep on without nearly falling off   I slept on the floor the second night   Consider noting the couch dimensions in the listing so guests can prepare  Or  better yet  invest in a sleeper sofa or futon couch   Apartment rate reflects using common space for sleeping  As noted above  couch is too small for even small  flexible adult to sleep on

614530775,It was a spacious space  When checking in  make sure to swipe on the black keypad on the door in order to bring up the code to get into the space  Bed was all memory foam which some may like  Shampoo  conditioner  body wash  and body lotion were provided as well as pots  pans  and cutlery for the kitchen  Parking is a bit difficult to find but we eventually found spots in the neighborhood a block down  Overall the stay was okay  Unfortunately  the bed was way too hard for our bodies and we didnt get much sleep  My guest ended up leaving the second night because of the bed  Also  the cleaning people showed up almost    minutes before check out and knocked on the door while I was getting dressed  Parking was also difficult to find 
344408147,There was a terrifying domestic disturbance in the apartment next door  The police came and diffused the situation but according to the other neighbor  this happens all the time  There was no WiFi and the  owner  of the Airbnb told us several times the WiFI was fixed when it wasnt  This is the problem with these Airbnbs that are one of many owned by the same company  The actual owner lives far away from the property and has several people who work for them  making it near impossible to get issues resolved  Thanks for nothing   Zen City   The host gave us inaccurate information over and over again 
179544950,The location was fantastic and apartment was as described  Check in and communication were very easy   I would stay here again if available   Thanks

708049817,Looked much nicer in the photos  The couch wasnt very nice  We had several maintenance people randomly show up unannounced to do work  Made me feel on edge the rest of  our stay Looked much nicer in the photos  The couch wasnt very nice  We had several maintenance people randomly show up unannounced to do work  Made me feel on edge the rest of  our stay
299276538,Great location in Hyde Park with easy access to surrounding area and downtown  Super easy check in   Thank you for your prompt communications  
628793919,Place was great   Parking is city curbside and a challenge to find one at times  Place itself was good  but had to park two blocks away   This was a challenge when you had stuff to carry 
159822777,The apartment is clean and well situated  Chris is very responsive and easy to communicate with  The kitchen is minimally equipt so dont plan on preparing any elaborate meals  Also the entrance to the building is through a service alley of sorts which is fine and all but a little dingy  All in all a serviceable place to stay if you want to be in this part of town  I suggest adding a can opener and maybe a microwave to the kitchen kit  Also it would be nice to have some blackout shades in the bedroom as its quite bright in that room both day and night 
295479979,Great space  Ask about the light switches before hand  Other than that  amazing place to stay in the city

144817165,Centrally located  basic accommodation  The toilet runs a lot and the handle is about to fall off  The place had kind of a funky smell to it  Other than that   great location and really appreciated the easy check in    u   cLess well lit than I expected   living room was dark    hours a day  u   d   Seemed overpriced for what it was  We could have gotten a hotel in the area for less than we paid for the Air BnB 
603875427,Was great
714710499,Everything was great expect I found things in the house from the last person  and my car got broken into as well Car broken into
132886280,Recomendable   u   cEntrada sucia u   d 
603135192,Location was ideal for our night in the city  Walkable to restaurants in Lincoln Square  Apartment had a minimalist vibe  no bells and whistles  but was clean and comfortable 
137979975,Chriss place was a fairly old but reasonably comfortable apartment in a good location It was good value  Chris was friendly and helpful  Thanks for letting me stay in your apartment Chris  It was fine only for the frozen lock box issue   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  noise  Additional comments   u   cThere was some renovation work being done during my stay  Apartment whilst fine was not as good as appeared in photos  u   d    Apartment was reasonably clean  
603125891,Apartment looked as it did in pictures  Dish soap dispenser didnt work but I was able to just open it and get the soap I needed  More thorough cleaning and inspection should be done  There was urine on the toilet when I arrived and the bedroom closet door was off the hinge  but I was able to communicate that very easily and got a response very quickly  My car got towed so I had to pay for a     Uber as well as      to get my vehicle out because stickers covered all street signs but that isnt the air bnbs fault  Had trouble entering the room with keypad  Instructions werent clear enough as to which code should be entered  Many of the dishes were dirty and needed to be rewashed  Bedroom closet door off the hinges  Bathroom clearly hadnt been thoroughly cleaned given there was urine on the toilet  I also had trouble using the soap dispenser in kitchen
136930038,We stayed at Chriss place for a girls weekend  The apartment is clean and they provide everything you would need   guidebook  Apple TV  snacks  etc  Its small but more than enough space for the two of us  The elevator was broken and the apartment is on the  th floor  The apartment building itself is VERY quiet and we were scolded for talking to loudly  We were also treated rudely when we were not checked out by      even though checkout time is listed as       u   cElevator was out of order and we were given no heads up we would have to carry our bags to the  th floor  We were reprimanded by someone for   talking too loudly    u   d   The check out time listed is  pm  Maribel arrived at      and was extremely rude since we were not out yet   
405687885,Beautiful view  love the minimalist home and the huge windows  What a beautiful place  Clean cozy cute homey place  The only think I didnt like about this is that they are very strict and do not allow late checkout which I think is an unreasonable expectation  Late check out  Being strict on check out time is unreasonable 
721725932,Very clean very nice place and a awesome bed   Was no condiments tho so if cooking be sure to take some    Other than that it was a awesome stay  Need some condiments and we seen two giant cockroaches go across the floor in living room haha    Not a big deal just wanted to let you know for future Guest
125043563,It is a great place  Location perfect and all the amenities that you would need are available  Highly recomend staying here   It was really an awesome apartment  The construction was a bit frustrating  but otherwise great stay    Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  Additional comments   u   cConstruction in the hallway for a few mornings  We turned the tv up to drown it out  The workers were pounding hammers on the door and other side of the wall  Otherwise  the apt  was perfect   u   d  
621553224,The apartment was very nice and conveniently located  Due to the current shut down of most things  I was able to park right outside of the building and for free  Only issue I had was that the neighbors above could easily be heard through the walls  Great value  would stay again  The place was very nice except when I first entered the apartment in smelled heavily of marijuana and the floors had not been cleaned and the neighbors above me were heard very was little through walls but I would stay again  Thanks so much 
703021061,The place was great  I suggest bringing your own bed sheets and covers because they were stained but besides that the views were amazing  Make sure you figure out your own parking  I suggest getting Parking app its works for only  hrs at a time til  pm thats when parking is free  The bedding was stained and the place wasnt properly cleaned whoever Jasmin is she didnt clean well  The fans were dirty I felt a little uneasy because of it  Every thing was accurate ish I wish the zen city page would have made it clear that the balcony was shared by everyone but it u    s was okay   The Bed covers were dirty and the wall in the bathroom look like someone didnt clean well the back up bed cover had stains too   The fan wasnt cleaned
601825907,Nice place to stay  with a large space  good bedrooms  safety neighborhood  clean and good price  The only negative point was the Heather Machine that is located inside the room and during the night makes a bite of noise  Besides that  I recommend this place to anyone and on the next time that I came to Chicago  I will try to rent this place  Add more informations about the places to through away the garbage  Some things on the kitchen were not so clean as expected  but nothing so bad 
710925363,Comfortable garden apartment  great value  Zencity are responsive and easy to communicate with  Thanks 
621548115,Very clean home 
666423624,Its was pretty small but it was a decent stay  Thanks Spider webs everywhere 
709646828,Very clean and beautiful view  Host responds quickly and room has great amenities Not very flexible with timing
102258043,Very conveniently located  Fun little apartment     Chris is a great host      
97415912,I found the handoff didnt work  I was running as fast as I could to a work dinner and the key handoff didnt workout  the key wasnt there I had to reach out to the rental place   There was really no proactive engagement at all   Location was acceptable but I think overpriced   Communication is difficult   Shower photos would be a big improvement     As Chris knows  the handoff didnt workout  Many layers of communication w  different parties makes direct communication difficult   
93631547,Prime location  close to everything you need  Chris was an incredible host and available anytime       
658718470,The space is beautiful  Actually true to the pictures and the location is great  Its a bit far from the rail line station but i found it was still good  I will say that the apartment is on the  th floor and if you have any accessibility issues or hate climbing stairs  this is not the place for you  Seriously  the stairs were uneven and its hard to see at night but the space itself is nice and comfortable  The space is beautiful but it wouldve been nice to have a second key or even a keyless system for two guests
633867976,Apartment in the city
83176712,Great location for everything we planned during our visit   Easy to find  easy check in  easy to subway  etc    Everything was as described      
77883367,The apartment was comfortable and in a great area  River North is a centrally located neighborhood   It had the necessary basics  it is not a primary residence home  Collin was easily contactable when the directions on Airbnb lead us to the incorrect address          
285809713,Unit was as described in the listing  Great location and free parking  While the hall has wall mounted ac  bedroom doesnt  Bedroom does get hot in a sunny day  We understand its an older building  Given that there is no ac in bedroom it was really hot  We slept in the hall  Common area has intolerable smell 
81899875,This is a great apartment and Chris was an excellent host  He made sure we had everything we needed prior to our stay  We absolutely LOVED the location and hope to stay here again when were back in Chicago      Bathroom couldve been a bit cleaner  There were hair strands on the bathroom floor when we arrived  
75216128,Collin was very welcoming and available to respond to question  The apartment is in a wonderful historic building with high ceilings  crown molding and a large kitchen  While its located on a busy street  the bedroom is away from the street and I was not bothered by street noise at all       better sweeping cleaning   hair on the floor  Not awful  but could be better   
70892127,Collin was quick to respond to any communication   The apartment was easy to find and as described   The location was very convenient  very close to Michigan Avenue and to the conference I was attending  Whole Foods was a short walk away and it was helpful to have some groceries on hand during the week   There were a lot of options to dine out nearby  and Starbucks is next door   I expect noise when I am staying in the city  but found that the apartment was quite noisy   I would stay again      Used open bottles in the shower  water in the fridge   Otherwise very clean    
68373222,Collin was a terrific host  easy to communicate with and responded promptly to questions and requests  The apartment is pretty much as pictured but you do have to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom so is probably best suited for a couple or single person  Amazing location         
62766255,My boyfriend and I had an amazing time staying at Collins apartment in Chicago   it is the perfect location in River North  with great restaurants nearby and easy access to all of the sites  The apartment was spacious and cozy  and Collin was really accessible and helpful the entire trip   checking in on us to make sure we were comfortable and giving us recommendations around the city  I highly recommend this listing and would definitely stay here again         
54224110,Collin was a great host  he made sure we had everything we needed and provided all sorts of recommendations for things to do and places to eat  The place itself was very nice and spacious  comfortably sleeping up to   people  The location cannot be beat  Its right in the heart of downtown  walking distance to everything worth seeing      The only downfalls of the place are that its right above a busy street with a lot of noisy people walking by till the last hours of night  The old fashioned windows also let in a lot of cold  We had the heat running full blast all night and it was still very chilly          
633817445,Good clean space  Provided all the tools i needed for a good stay
672646083,The apartment looks exactly like the pictures  The only cons was the odd smell in the basement living room that never went away and there are not curtains on the large windows which people can look in  The owner responds fast and gave us a extra key  There is parking best to find it in the morning  it was great space for the two of us
597062274,Great place to stay  Only down fall  parking was frustrating  Thanks  it was great  Little more direction on parking would have been helpful though 
589775409,Quiet area and apartment  Very nice and I felt safe  It is on the third floor  and difficult to find parking  so I recommend setting up parking arrangements  if carrying luggage  Thanks for hosting    u   f  No response to questions about   It may be the filter setting for Air B that is not clear before a deposit  but knowing I was going to be on the third floor needing to haul a wheelchair would have allowed me to chose elsewhere  It was hard  but I did like the place and stay 
571832075,An odd place to stay  Felt very bare with not much on the walls and an odd style which seemed like they valued the look of he furniture vs  the actual comfort  Check was easy and no direct need to communicate with the host  Location has good access to the L  Random  but all the light switches and toilet were rather low to the ground  Just a note for taller individuals  Could have been better with more things on the walls  Felt very bare   Not sure what was up with this place  but everything was set up for a human of a smaller stature   Check in was easy and instructions were clear  Generally clean  Both the sink and shower were clogged  Never communicated  But also didnt need to  Location was good  For the feel and dynamic of this place  I did not think this was a good value  Couch was terribly uncomfortable to sit on 
588495115,Zencitys service and communication was good  The staff of the building was very helpful and friendly  The apartment itself was perfect for   ppl  Kitchen  bathroom  and bedroom had all the necessities  There was a little noise issue due to the person above but it wasnt horrible  Outside of that  it was an overall good experience    If I were to visit Chicago again I would consider rebooking  Thank you for your communication and services    We didnt have many issues except for the strange smell that came out of the closet  and the light bulb of the main living room being out  Also upon our arrival the toilet wasnt sparkling clean so we had to run a hand on it briefly    Other than that the apartment was fine  And the location and staff was great 
600411237,It is very clean  It was easy to find and as expected  There isnt any cable or really a place to eat  The kitchen wasnt really usable because it only have pots and pans  dishes and silverware  There was nothing to make a salad in and would have had to buy everything even salt and pepper 
568563880,Advise not to park in the U  Car got broken into  Advise future costumers not to park in the U  Ask the front desk what the U is  Its about    ft from the residences  My car got broken into window shattered and belongings stolen while parked on the premises of the residence which is the U 
526912727,Great neighborhood  stylish and minimal decor  no extras   easy check in   Note that this is a  loft     one of the bedrooms shares a wall with the living room that doesnt go fully up to the ceiling   so anything thats going on in the living room you can hear in the bedroom and vice versa  Something to keep in mind if youre traveling with kids  sensitive to noise  etc   I wish the listing had specified that one of the bedrooms is not entirely sealed off  high open window directly into the living room   
601860371,About what the reviews said loud neighbors parking was a pain  and great location 
558211047,This was my first stay via Airbnb  I had some issues booking and there is no W D as was in the listing title  other than that  not a bad place  Next time I am in town Ill likely stay with someone else to see if it goes a bit smoother  This worked out pretty well  I was very annoyed with the booking processes where I had to book twice  Other than that and the description being wrong with no W D  the place was as advertised   Thanks  No W D as in the title  
599300342,A great place  Quiet and close to a lot of stores
578436508,Nice place to stay at  Clean  Close location to everything   Visitor policy with additional fees needs to be in the description  Along with information that there is only Netflix tv access unless you have personal log in information to  listed  certain Roku tv apps  Heat is basically  one  setting only or doesn u    t work well   Water dirty Spots on all dish wear  glasses  silverware  plates   Overall very clean 
548034239,The apartment is suitably located  just a few metros stop from downtown  The bed is comfortable  media supports the most popular streaming services  Netflix  Amazon  YouTube  The only one aspect the visitors must be aware of is narrow and steep stairs you would have to get over to get round of the apartment  Hi  Thanks for the hospitality  I enjoyed the apparent  The only a couple of things to improve  shower curtain and the hot tap might be replaced as it is leaking   The building condition 
599274697,Nice place
599028017,Great Location and super clean place Thanks you for everything
541110244,Pros  This place is very spacious and well decorated  It is in a great location and easy to check in   Cons  Parking in this area is very hard to come by  The tub was dirty when I arrived and they forgot the toiletries   All in all it was a positive stay  Bathtub was dirty and no toiletries   Parking in the area was also terrible   There were no toiletries when I arrived  Parking was also terrible in the area   The tub was really dirty when I arrived 
191479810,Good place to stay  but for me it was a major problem that the wifi didnt work  Chris gave me instructions on how to re start the router   but no luck   Otherwise it was a good stay  very easy check in  Chris was very responsive  and the bed was comfortable and it was quiet 
191208387,Chris place is in the perfect location  close to lots of nightlife etc  The apartment is comfortable and Chris is a helpful host  Hi Chris  Thanks for your hospitality  We enjoyed staying at your place 
521225059,Environment is good and clean  Please inform every thing clearly at the booking conformation  As Zencity asking   money for Fob  building entrance sensor desk  but I drop it to reception desk   Check out time was not mention as standard   My booking was up to   st August      but we have to check out on   st  We expected check out on  st September        Not fully explained about check in and check out time 
261632346,Great place  Overall was fine  Hosts manager was in contact the whole time    Only complaints was one of the toilets got stopped up while we there and while we could connect to the WiFi there was no internet so probably a problem with the broadband company or router   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  wifi   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom 
650998829,The unit was clean  easy to access and in a good location for my trip  The only issue I had was that one of the neighbors smoked cigars and each night when I returned to the unit there was an overwhelming smell in the apartment  The only issue I had was with the smell of cigar smoke  Every night when I arrived back there was an overwhelming smell of cigar in the unit  I understand it was from a neighboring unit which you cant control but it definitely affected my stay  I saw that the unit had its own AC   heater and was surprised that so much air was coming from the other units 
520617078,Great location but nonstreet parking is at least   blocks away  AC is window units only  Loud window units  Shower and bathroom floor are a slip hazard  A great place for a family of three  young couple  or single adult less than     I dont know who the personnel serve in the lobby  but I do know it wasnt me  After the checkin experience  I felt very uncomfortable asking anything  The last question I asked was where the I could do my laundry  The person at the lobby desk was unresponsive first and inaccurately answered when I had to repeat the question  A resident nearby corrected her and helped me   Parking was four blocks away  Window AC had to be on entire stay to keep rooms comfortable  Personnel in lobby were not customer oriented and I felt as though I was doing them a favor by not asking a question  
474946261,Nice  quiet location  Clean apartment  Close walk to many shops and restaurants  Thanks for a great visit  We loved the area  it was nice and quiet  clean space  A few suggestions  maybe an additional light in the walkway to the entrance  between the houses    it was dark until the first light came on  hooks in bathroom for towels  Thank you  we overall enjoyed our stay 
520596793,    
601077434,Amazing place but make sure you know how to cool a home  Host has a message machine and never returned our calls  There was no way to adjust the temp  It was very hot and uncomfortable  Host never got back to us after several messages 
710962860,This place was the worst AirBnB experience I have ever had  The people are not communicative and do not try to help  I highly recommend not renting from this company  Wifi bad  place unclean  tv broken  support unhelpful        Wifi horrible  appliances bad  can hear everyone outside and above you  Hair on the sheets  diry floors  dirty bathroom Horrible took weeks to respond to emails and when talking over the phone people who said they would come out to fix an issue never did  The only good part of the listing Find another spot
556041791,We were pretty disappointed in limited ability to watch live TV  We were reduced to watching Sunday Night Football on our cell phones  even though it airs on NBC and should be easily available  The most frustrating part of that is that we subscribe to a streaming TV service and could easily have just added that app on the Roku and signed in to our own account  and of course log out   remove the app when done   but the the Roku has been locked down and requires a pin to add any new apps  Have stayed at multiple vaca rentals and have never come across this issue before  During the heating season  youd need some really great earplugs to be able to sleep through the tea kettle shrieking noise that the radiators create all night  Between that and the creaky  saggy mattress and the fact that it was hotter than hades  we fought for every minute of sleep that we got  The cost is reasonable  just not sure if its reasonable enough given some pretty big flaws  On the upside  the place is very nicely located in Hyde Park and very walkable to lots of great restaurants and the U of C campus   hospitals  Building seems pretty safe   secure  and check in was very easy  Was disappointed in limited ability to watch live TV  We were reduced to watching Sunday Night Football on our cell phones  even though it airs on NBC and should be easily available  During the heating season  youd need some really great earplugs to be able to sleep through the tea kettle shrieking noise that the radiators create all night  Between that and the creaky  saggy mattress  we fought for every minute of sleep that we got  The cost is reasonable  just not sure if its reasonable enough given some pretty big flaws  On the upside  the place is very nicely located in Hyde Park and very walkable to lots of great restaurants and the U of C campus   hospitals  Building seems pretty safe   secure  and check in was very easy 
472876814,Upon arriving the aesthetic of the building is very cute but the inside has a very odd smell so i didnt know what to expect about the listing but once we arrived at the seventh floor and opened the door my best friend and i were pleasantly surprised with the apartment  It was super cute and looked exactly like the pictures  it made me think of how my first apartment looked and gave me little feelings of nostalgia  The location was great too  Hyde Park is a busy neighborhood and we werent far from anything  Even our door dash delivery guy was able to find our building easily  I loved this location  would def stay again 
714710103,Nice space and convenient location  There were some used towels still in the bathroom burg the rest of the apt seemed to be clean
517767840,The place was ok  it wasnt as updated as I would have liked but it was clean  enough space for everyone  a safe secure building  and the neighborhood was quiet and safe  I would book here again  The tub wasnt fully cleaned out  There were hair and a mild ring around the tub  The host was good with reaching out and sending emails to check on us  The place can be a bit more updated  The beds wear very uncomfortable 
709223829,Good location Details of how to get to the apt inside the building was very confusing Wasnt able to control temperature  no wine opener available  hot water ran out very quickly in shower  WiFi took a while to figure out
633016191,parking is not free its expensive parking is ridiculous you should have a place where the people staying at the air bnb can park for free the sides around the beds parking fees
594052595,Great location and wonderful Air Bnb  Thank you so much for letting us stay in your Air Bnb      The key fob was missing for the parking lot was missing  
593690139,Honestly very disappointed  The space is as pictured and would make for a lovely stay if I didnt have to listen to the so sound of construction in be the building from early morning to late evening   I wouldnt be so upset if I had been told it was a possibility  but that didnt happen  Also instructions on finding the back units were all kinds of wrong  Wont be back  the space the hassel  I am very disappointed with this place  Sounds of construction every morning  construction materials everywhere  Not a pleasant experience at all  Directions for check in were incorrect 
591211251,Awesome unit with great amenities and location   The only warning I have if you stay is a business trip I would not recommend  the internet didnt work had to utilize my hot spot off my phone  You have a serious internet issue   Internet was non existing 
280621026,This apartment is located well within the small downtown of Hyde Park  There are a few cafes and restaurants close by with a Target around the corner for convenience    When my wife and I were first contacted by Chris we felt a bit misled since the apartment we stayed in is on the first floor  but this is not described anywhere  The only piece of info to indicate this is a photo of the balcony which seems to be more than a story up  but its in fact just a couple feet off the ground  As we are not very familiar with this city we would rather have been above the first floor  so this indication would be important for future guests   Within    minutes of arriving we heard noise on the room adjacent and one above us  I gave it some time  but then contacted Chris when nothing changed  He responded that he has never had problems with noise  and was regretful that we are experiencing it  Peace and quiet are extremely important to me  and I did not find that here  I understand that in the city youll hear people outside police cars  but there was little of that here  Constant banging from above and beside us  We could actually listen to conversations from people in both of these apartments  Ive honestly never been to an Air BnB  or even hotel rather  that has been this loud   Aside from those issues the apartment was very clean  All the appliances were working except for the water and ice dispenser on the fridge which isnt a huge deal  Plenty of hot water  and good water pressure from the shower  A small addition that l enjoyed was the automatic soap dispensers in the bathroom and kitchen    All in all the stay was okay  but the noise really ruined it for us  The only bright side is that it kept us out of the apartment most of the day night  and forced us to enjoy the sights of Chicago   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos  listing description  size of home   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements 
671874978,Didnt recieve key fob so wasnt able to check out any amenities  Slow response from host
454562654,Very prompt response Thank you for quick response Cockroach
546442907,Great place  bathroom is a bit small and be aware despite this being s   bedroom  you will only get you one fob  needed to operate elevators   main door  doorman leaves late night  midnight till  am   But  they were able to secure us a extra  but only because another unit was unbooked   Bathroom size was much smaller than realized  towel holder was broken and towels on floor   while they said it would be fixed  it wasn u    t  also only one key fob which took me asking  begging for second and push back that the staff would have to buy one from the building  Inconsistent response times  sometimes super fast  other times radio silence for a day
579371207,Zencity Corp was quick to respond to any issues  but each message was from a different person at the corporation and some messages werent transmitted through their management structure  When I checked in  the staff told me that when I checked out  I should leave the key on the table  I did this  and the next day woke up to an email that they were trying to charge me     dollars for not returning the key  Zencity Corp owns a lot of convenient airbnbs in the area  but I wouldnt stay with them again after this  Attempted to charge     dollars for me not returning the key  although I left it exactly where they asked me to 
578686518,Great place to stay 
658050724,This place was horrible  Its a crumby apartment  but what made it insufferable was that it was filled with a stench of cigarette smoke  We were forced to leave and contacted the host to receive a refund  but the host had still not responded  I am requesting that you immediately issue us a refund The entire apartment smelled of cigarette smoke Refund requested but no response
705163002,Nice place  Very modern up to date style  Full kitchen amenities  Living area and bedroom were nice size  Bathroom was nice but could be cleaner  On site gated parking was nice but the actual apartment was difficult to find  Overall nice stay for the price but the fees were a bit high for not being quite as clean as Id like  Very high cleaning fees for not being very clean
663371633,Very nice place with reliable host  Definitely recommend  Water pressure was low  Could use some more silverware  Other than that it was great  Very clean and the location was perfect for us 
715747122,Good area  walking distance from a few things  Not a far drive from grocery stores food  Downfall is it took a long time to hear back on host  expect to not hear back for possibly    hours     parking can be limited but if you drive around a couple times until something will open up 
279754433,This is a really nice apartment building with friendly concierge staff at the main entry  The location is amazing with a beautiful view and its easy to walk to the store or the train  The apartment was not clean when I arrived and there was no flexibility on an early check in  due to the apartment getting cleaned   Chris was responsive as far as my issues but I dont think Id stay here again due to the issues that I had and some never being fixed   The television services didnt work and after letting the host know repeatedly   the issue was never fixed   The apartment appeared to have been spot cleaned  The carpet was not vacuumed having crumbs  foot prints  hair  fuzz  a bottle of nail polish on the floor and the like  The counters had crumbs and food smears  The bathroom tub was not clean and I only showered once because it felt slimy   The comforter had stains on it  I vacuumed  cleaned all surfaces and would have washed the linens if there would have been washing detergent in the unit 
626555781,Cool little space  clean crisp feel  ZERO parking   Parking 
582146673,This space served its purpose  Parking was a bit of a pain but other than that the apartment was clean and perfect for the holiday trip   Didnt have a coffee pot as listed  Reached out but ending up just borrowing one from someone else   Parking was a pain 
626523620,This apartment is a great option for those who want to spend their money on the many attractions of KC and not on lodging  Overall  we had a good experience  and would consider staying at the apartment again the next time we go to KC  The key to the apartment was not available until I called the host   This is due to a change that I made to the reservation  The duvet in one of the bedrooms reeked of sweat 
578378379,The apartment was exactly as the photos showed   comfortably furnished  with well functioning appliances  We stayed for about a week while a family member was at the nearby hospital  The kitchen was great in terms of appliances and the usefulness of the basic pots  but rather bare in terms of things you might want in an apartment vs  a hotel   specifically  a good cutting knife  We had some initial housekeeping cleaning service related issues  and Zencity was very responsive via email  It would be REALLY helpful to have   sets of keys for a   bedroom  Shower liner was a bit orange and grungy  never remembered to reach out after out of bathroom 
506402720,Would not stay here again  sadly  Room was small if adequate  but halls and common spaces were dingy  hot  and smelly  Put simply  This feels like a former dorm because it is  Details like pungent and persistent cleaning products  cheap pillows  and loud appliances made the place more photogenic than it was comfortable  That and a string of errors  Key not there upon arrival  misdirected maintenance visit  and internet down after first day  Zencity team was very responsive and polite  but this place is not ready for prime time  and certainly not worth the high price relative to location   This is my first negative Airbnb review  apologies   Please do not use existing cleaning product  It reeks of cheap chemicals  forced me to vacate room for long stretches  and never went away over the course of entire visit  and Im not particularly sensitive to smell     Also note that fridge  even when unused and seemingly on a low setting  roars idly  both unpleasantly noisy and energy inefficient    Last  pillows are about the cheapest you can find  Lumpy  synthetic  insubstantial   Sorry to sound negative  I travel a ton  and use Airbnb constantly  but this is my first non five star review   Common areas not well represented  Key not available upon arrival Dingy halls   strong and persistent smell of cleaning product in room Too pricey given quality  location
430419593,Overall  a very nice place to stay  Everything is new and clean  Be aware that there is considerable traffic noise  ambulance sirens  etc  heading to the nearby hospital  as the building is right on a major thoroughfare   During our stay  we had persistent issues with the Internet working at sufficient speed to actually get on websites  Zencity was responsive to our requests  but no one was able to fix our issue during our stay    Other than that  everything was fine  Thank you for your responsiveness to our Internet issues  It was unfortunate that they were never able to be resolved  Hopefully  he will be able to rectify that for future guests   Other than the Internet  the unit was great  especially given the price 
430000054,This is a great place and worth the money  Excellent hosts  Shower curtain was moldy on the bottom   otherwise it was spotless and included all cleaning supplies 
460636760,A  I couldn u    t find the lockbox I had to wait outside for an hour  I think I shouldnt have to pay a cleaning fee if I have to go in cleaning thing like the bathroom and other spaces
503591948,After I could not get a key out of the automatic lock box at the property  I was without a place to sleep for almost    hours overnight  The property Managers access code for their lock box was incorrect on the initial email and the subsequent code sent failed to open the key repository     After numerous phone calls to an answering service and only a single message sent by the Airbnb app  I was finally granted a refund from Airbnb  The number supplied to Airbnb and on their website does not go to any actual employee of the company but a answering service    The property Management company of these apartments is disconnected from the St Louis area  after having stayed in a property in the same facility that you manage I was looking forward to staying here again  Your communication and technical facilities are lacking   The messages from the host did not help in this situation   When finally contacted about the key box not being accessible and me being locked out for the first day of my trip  a non apology was sent   They stated as if the lock box   seemed   not to work   The property Managers failed to ensure I could enter the property  I had only   hours sleep in a terrible motel before heading to work  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me  The property Manager only responded once during my support request overnight  After the information they gave me was ineffective  they didnt respond again until almost   hours later  Their support line after      p m  is a message taking service  nothing more  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me  I cannot comment on this item because the property manager could not supply a key to the property to me 
613210517,Great location and very attentive management  Sheets were dirty when we came in  hair on them  and neighbor had music playing all night our first night  BUT otherwise a very pleasant experience  Easy in and out  Very clean aside from the sheets which was an easy fix  Great location  Would consider renting again 
503259970,Great view  but not very comfortable for the price  Great location  decent space  but compares poorly to a hotel room in terms of amenities for the price   We didnt reach out while there because we were simply too busy   Should mention that there is no dresser  one poor futon in LR  one dining room chair for the LR  one lightbulb in LR  no instructions for TV and trash  no recycling container  Two teaspoons in service for eight  no bathmat for slippery bathtub  etc   Vents were filthy  Fridge needed work  Shower curtain was stained and needs to be replaced  No info booklet
534492129,This is a hip   very clean and well appointed apartment in a convenient location   Please be aware that the room is located directly above the train track   Although the sound proofing is quite effective  the room did not get dark at night because of the lights from the train platform    Also  there is only one key given for the room  so if members of your party are going to be separated and want to enter at different times  you will have to replace the key in the lock box a block away every time you leave and enter  and it makes coming in and out at different times extremely inconvenient  Thank you for your communication with us   I hope you can fix the key issue   The room is pretty cool  very clean  and the set up is interesting  just not as described or what we expected   I feel you omitted information until it was too late to cancel   The issue of having only one key fob for entrance was a big problem for us all weekend and disallowed us even using the room the first night   We were helping our daughter who has just moved and were on different schedules trying to get things done    It was very inconvenient to not be able to come and go because we could not get in   We also did not realize the room was literally on top of the train track   Again  you omitted information that would have influenced my choice of this room   I did not know I would not encounter a person   The description of being like a hotel led me to believe there was a person or some kind of staff overseeing this process  There was no mention that the room was literally on top of the train train platform  Although the sound proofing is effective  we were aware of the train every time it came   Also  we could not open the blinds because people were looking up into our room when they were on the platform   Some people probably find this really cool  but we felt we should have been made aware of it   The biggest problem was actually not the noise  but the fact that the room never got dark   the blinds are not effective in shutting out the light from the train platform  We absolutely needed a key for each person   The other reason for this rating is that the room does not get dark at night   The lights from the train platform are on all night long and the blinds do not make the room dark   Even given the key fob issue  i would have rated it a   if the room had been dark at night 
497501758,Wicker Park is a great location and this unitis in a spacious unit for a family to visit Chicago  Great living space  W really enjoyed the location and the size of the unit  The tv did not have instructions to operate basic tv  It could have been cleaner  Floors and vents where dusty  Kitchen stools had crumbs in them  Master Bathroom had mold and mildew  The backdoor was unlocked when we arrived  Difficult to lock this door  Otherwise we would not have a problem spending this amount on the unit  There was a coffee machine but no coffee cups   The entire apartment was dusty  The vents showed a lot of dust on them in the master bedroom  The master bathroom shower had mold and mildew  The shampoo and soap dispenser  which is old and not working should be removed  Only collecting more mildew  For the price  I expected a clean unit  The location was great especially since I have family blocks away 
576120232,An incredible space  Definitely recommend  We loved our stay   just would have loved to put our car securely in the lot rather than on the street   nokey fob for supposed free parking 
609259613,If you are going to stay here  know that there are lots of dogs  some of which howl very loudly   and parking is very scarce       min walk   But the view was amazing  bed and couch were very cozy  but we did find a few crumbs on the living room carpet   WiFi password was incorrect  and parking was unclear  Found a giant toenail on the living room carpet  along with some  hopefully  food scraps  And a brown smear on the bathroom floor Dogs are very allowed AND loud in the building  Less noise  Cleanliness  closer parking
622642151,This space is clean  comfortably furnished  although a bit spare  and located in a great area in Chicago  Thank you for the accommodations   The furnishings are a bit spare  but the space was clean and comfortable 
566159172,The space was neat  stylish and close to restaurants  shopping  and a local grocer  Tub was dirty and water did not flow well  Bathroom was very small 
573248366,Nice place     only complaint is it is still under construction and the noise starts early Let guests know they will be encountering construction noise early in the morning   Still a construction site     work on all sides of the place started before   
622466879,awesome check in  nice entertainment provided  some pics can be misleading for studio   bedrooms but overall i would continue to book here photos were misleading   listed as   bedroom and not a studio  Barely any kitchen accessories  no kitchen vent when cooking  boxed in environment  Check in is never an issue with zencity  ive been successful with you all before this is just a misleading listing so my expectations were set high due to the previous stay i had before this one 
622727242,Not a bad place     But I think that couch needs to be replaced  In the picture it shows  the broken left arm was carefully concealed with that piece of cloth  Just repair or replace that for the sake of future guests    Other than that  a good place 
492789098,For the money this place was appointed with the bare minimums      the description says the bed was a queen  pretty sure it was a full  regardless it was not comfortable    The blinds were all bent and since the place it literally one one room it did not provide much privacy from the pool courtyard and sunlight poured in in the morning    There was only a French press for coffee  and no one told us to bring our own coffee    I have stayed in several Airbnbs and that seems like a standard  along with maybe some bottled water   There was none of either    There was loud banging in the rooms near us until about   pm   There were no instructions on using the TV and Direct TV   And their  Welcome Kit  they said we would receive on check in was literally a broken cardboard  box with a key in it    Also plan on paying additional for parking   We used Spot Hero App and the parking structure attached cost us     a night    Also would have been nice had they explained that there was a parking structure attached  had to figure all that out on our own  even after asking about parking  Oh and the elevators made terrible shaking and grinding noises    Honestly I wouldnt stay here again  We were pretty disappointed with the space    While it was clean  the bed was I believe a full  not a queen  very uncomfortable    No coffee  bare minimum appointments    Blinds in windows are broken and bent not keeping our morning light or providing privacy from pool  courtyard in the room   Don u    t think it was a queen  pretty sure it was a full   No extras at all     bare minimum for experience  not even a coffee maker  French press but no one told us to bring our own coffee   loud banging all night in room  bent broken blinds that did not keep light out 
193752163,This place was pretty solid  I just needed a place to sleep and refresh while working in Chicago  Location was convenient  Quite space in the city  Parking was not that much of an issue  Thanks again Chris   I enjoyed my stay  Your place was fine for my occasion in Chicago  The only thing that bothered me was the water leaking from the toilet and the good sized bug crawling on the bathroom floor   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  wifi  Additional comments   u   cWifi network ID and password were not correct  Had to look on back of router to find information  u   d   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs  bathroom  Additional comments   Toilet issue  Leaking water coming from toilet upon flush   Brown beetle of some kind crawling round sink in bathroom   
631169213,Photos are accurate  I hope your stay is better than mine was  Missing key  Kitchen and bathroom unclean  Sitting area  couch  had noticeable food crumb build up in the seams Cheaper
700463041,Owner is friendly and his place is good choice but a little bit hard to find the parking and need to clean more some part   lot of dust in main room 
613087902,Unfortunately  I cannot say that this stay was as I expected it to be  The place is very spacious  bright and interesting  and the location is excellent  However  the place has been  neglected  the furniture is uncomfortable  and it needs a very deep cleaning  paint touch ups and some repairs  I cannot recommend this place for future stays unless it is properly refreshed  At this time its pretty obvious that Zencity is just maximizing the profit from renting the place out and is decidedly not focused on providing what I have come to expect from     stays in various AirBnBs over the past     years  You really should take this place off the market until you do a very deep cleaning and touching up of the unit  The place has a dingy feel  the furniture is atrocious and dirty and in general I would not stay there again   The photos make the place appear cleaner than it actually is   The door pin code doesnt have to be that long  The entire place needs deep cleaning  It has a dingy appearance  theres lots of dust bunnies and hair behind the bed headboards  there is lint and hair from previous guests on the small carpeted areas  Better cleanliness of the place would have been appreciated  It had a rather overused look and had this been a regular hotel I would have refused the room 
544617078,Clean  modern  perfect business travel stay  It is at a big street so quite loud but the apartment was great  Was a great stay  we will be back
623184531,Recommended    It was some black sticky stuff on the kitchen floor it needed mopped but I would book again   Thank you Enjoyed my stay and I definitely recommend
623097269,Great place to stay
468990927,Our stay was fine  the place very clean however the noise and cigarette smell from other units was rather prominent  If you are a light sleeper do not book this unit   the A C is in the bedroom and churns on and runs a very loud shaking motor  The neighbors below are full time tenants and liked to play loud rap music late into the evening  We were grateful for the French press and leftover coffee beans   There were also zero batteries in the TV remote and after emailing the host  we didnt hear back for over    hours and no one came to provide batteries  but the wifi was good and fast thankfully  Hi  I might suggest providing earplugs for your guests  and extra batteries for the TV remote  I would also write a note and put next to door on how to lock the patio door   its very frustrating  And a pair of scissors in stocked kitchen would have been helpful 
488824867,This apartment is in a great location  The rooftop patio has great views  Chinatown is nearby  try Happy Lamb and Hing Kee for great food    A train station for the redline is only a few blocks away  Check out the Divvy bikes for another way to get around the city and explore the miles of bike path along the lakeshore  The apartment is trendy yet comfortable  The curtains still let in the city light even at night but the bed is comfy  Overall a great location  Thanks for the stay  We loved the location and the rooftop patio  It could use some personal touches to get it from good to great  Some ideas   a welcome note local recommendations printed guidebook    extra towels   recycling   towel racks hooks in the bathroom   tissues  blackout curtains in the bedroom   kitchen utensils  containers  baggies  more cutlery   clock alarm in the bedroom   dish towels and hand towels in the kitchen
601826493,Great location  Great amenities  Great unit  We enjoyed our stay  Loved the space and location  Thank you  Chiefsssssss    
601450953,Overall had a nice stay for the weekend in this apartment  The neighborhood is very conveniently located to get to many different St  Louis locations  Overall a good stay  Without the key it was pretty inconvenient for parking and entering the apartment  I chose the location over others based on having the gated parking area so was disappointed that we then had to find street parking when we returned each evening  The building was as described as well as the process but there was no key to access parking and the code to the door was really long so if I didnt have my phone when I left the place I wouldnt get back in  When notified of the lack of key the hosts said theyd get it there as soon as possible but it never came  The whole weekend we were there a spilling of tomatoes dressing was directly outside our door and people had garbage bags in the hallways  It did not smell pleasant  Responses were quick but communication did not solve issues 
485827440,Luv it  Very clean  Love the place and its really clean  however the bedframe needs to be tightened it makes a lot of noise 
468981471,Expect a nice apartment with a very safe environment and quick response times from the host   I thought your apartment was really nice  smelled and looked clean  and you had very fast response times  Thanks for hosting us There were spiders in my shower
468905289,We had a really good stay at this apartment  Everything was modern and clean  There is only one tv in the living room  if that matters to you  and only     spoons forks  and around the same on towels  but other than that everything was great   We loved the location and would definitely stay again  The room was very nice and we really enjoyed our stay  It would be nice to also have another tv in one of the other bedrooms    not just the living room  
616799829,Overall  the experience was just okay  After we arrived  we were welcomed by the maid telling us that she had just gotten there and needed time to clean the place  We arrived a few minutes after the said check in time  so we were not early  This essentially messed up all plans  as we were only visiting for a few days and had a tight itinerary  We were then told that there is a fob to get in out of the parking lot  This was one of the main reasons we chose this place  as the location was right around an unsettling area  We were told the guests before us took the fob home  and that they would get us a new one  We never got one  or word that they were working on it  Finally  when we got to the room the second time  we were immediately sweating  as the thermostat was  locked at    degrees  The thermostat and temperature was an issue the entire stay  Would not come back again  or recommend this stay  Dont say that check in is at  pm if the room will not be ready  cleaned  and available at  pm  Wasnt allowed to check in when it says  never got our parking fob  etc 
497708872,The place has great space for a large group  AC is better in the front  unit though  The back unit could get a little warm  Overall the place is awesome with the pool tables Thanks again Brian 
704218862,The location was perfect for us  and great for access to lots of things  It was stylish and comfortable and was exactly what we needed for the weekend   There was an unpleasant odor when we first got there that slowly seemed to dissipate or we just got used to it  not sure which one    One of the showers was unusable because of a large exposed window to the building next door  It looks like there may have been some kind of window treatment at some point  but was absolutely nothing there now  Hopefully  they address this before the next guest   No idea where or what we were supposed to do with trash  Thankfully  we only filled the can once so it never became a big deal   All of that said  it was a great location  was clean and comfortable  and we definitely go back  The shower in one of the bathrooms was unusable because of a large exposed window to the building next door   There was an odd  unpleasant odor when we came in almost like something had died somewhere   No idea what to do with trash   The shower in one of the bathrooms was unusable because of a large exposed window to the building next door  
555441561,We booked this condo based on the location and the photos   It was very run down  with mold in several places   We had to purchase cheap sandals to wear in the bathroom   Would not stay here again   The photos make the condo look very nice  it is not   The entire condo was dirty   There is black mold on baseboards and heating registers   There was hair throughout the bathroom and bedding 
483545027,Hi  Your place was nice and quaint  I really like it  My boyfriend and I enjoyed it  Hi  Your place was nice and quaint  I really like it  It was a bit small for my boyfriend and I  I would only make two suggestions  Maybe a cleaner  nicer shower curtain   the one in the bathroom was a bit dirty at the bottom  In addition  maybe a couch with arm rest to relax on 
660638539,No one deserves to get money robed from them  If you agree dont book with zencity  They are thieves  This small unit is next to a unit occupied by a full time tenant of the building  If you lucky enough you will hear punk rock  screamo  and tribal music blaring all night with one one to turn to help for but knocking on a stranger door who gets in fights with his party guest alot   lol  People coming and going all night  dogs barking  horns honking  Drag racing and cruising on the street out the bedroom window   Not safe cops always rolling around  Save yourself days of trouble trying to get a refund  This is not a pretty looking part of downtown  smoke stacks right out front billowing smelly fumes all day and night  The hosting company does not respond personally everything is automated by a  rd party add on service  You will not experience that if you stay with a real human in a real house with a real host  You are booking a motel  I brought it to their attention that the listing was      misleading the guy confirmed I was at the right address and right unit  He told me there was no where to transfer me then hung up and blocked my number I wasnt on the phone for more than   seconds before he hung up  The photos are  brightened with photoshop  There was rotten take out food in the refrigerator with a receipt dated             I booked           The towels are stiff and old  Calling the number listed again the next day because Airbnb told me to reach out one more time  He said if I called again he would take my security deposit wow  Please do not stay with this  company  not even if your desperate
545065018,Very stylish interior  Good location  Quiet room  Clarify how to operate the dial on the door  No pool  Cheaper fees
552512689,Great location close to restaurant  shops  downtown and other tourist activities   Clean apartment  nicely decorated and quaint  Off street parking can be tricky but can be found  I would recommend this apartment  I would suggest room blackening curtains in the bedrooms as the street lights show through the blinds   Loved the location  walking distance to restaurants and shops  Parking was difficult but it was the weekend and a lot of people were out  It is a great location   Off street parking was difficult to find on the weekend  
458949544,Perfect location  smaller than expected  much too expensive for what you get  We paid over      for   nights on a space that is now listed at     night  Dusty everywhere  bathroom was moldy and extremely small  The AC unit does not cool the whole place and you cant have the AC on and watch tv at the same time  The host was quick to respond that was cool  and Hyde Park is so beautiful with so much fun stuff to do 
622467066,Overall good place to stay for a night or two The door thats the host instructed us to go to to enter the building was locked thank God we found another door that was unlocked on the second floor so we can get it Not a good or safe location in St  Louis
457715919,Clean and tidy  Netflix bonus Chris was responsive and helpful   I am disappointed by the lack of response from someone unlocking and opening my door  however thankfully nothing happened  Definitely need a better hot water heater  However   I was please with the cleanliness and the Netflix bonus   Might try again   Hot water was lacking in bathroom   Took over        minutes to warm  Never got hot   Someone entered opened the apartment door during the evening  Thankfully nothing happened   I reported it and Mallory responded  assuring  me I had the only electronic code  however the lock was turn key  I responded with this and was not responded to  Netflix inclusion was great 
575833531,Really great deal  A full apartment in a beautiful  old building  Check in check out was a breeze  Apartment was clean and quiet   great for a crash pad  Location was great for visiting Hyde Park and close to an express bus that takes you downtown  Highly recommend  A very awesome deal you are providing your customers  My main feedback would be to not tell your guests how you should rate them on Airbnb  i e    stars   Also it took a bit of figuring out to get on WiFi  I didnt realize I needed to find the chalkboard in the kitchen 
575573459,This space is great for a few nights stay  While we were comfortable in the space  the low water pressure in the shower  the cramped bedroom and the thin walls were definitely some downfalls of the space  You can hear everything that goes on outside and inside of the apartment  despite the  abided by  thankfully  quiet hours  Other than those minor details  our stay was pleasant  The space is clean  and the amenities it offers are awesome 
472941077,A great apartment in a great location  We really enjoyed our stay in Bucktown  Walking distance to all you need and easy to park a car on the street  Highly recommended if youre staying in Chicago  Hi Chris   We had a great stay and we really liked your apartment  Good communication and good directions to find the key  We were positively surprised to find that the apartment had a washing machine since this was not in the description  Cheers  Niklas  Looking at the pictures  we expected the apartment to face West Cortland Str  so it was not clear for us that the apartment was located in the yard   The apartment was very clean  To give a good first expression  the stairs outside the apartment could do with a cleaning and to make it extra nice  the stairs down to the basement could be painted  It is a really nice apartment  We noted that the window in the kitchen was a bit difficult to open and maybe should be looked at  Also the  beds were a bit narrow and close to the wall to use as double beds 
357142795,Great place  I will most definitely book again  I think you should have self check in out or early check in and later check out  Its a great place and loved everything but that  Thank you  Late check in and early check out
711896229,This was a very nice place in a great location  I really dont like to give negative reviews so Ill put this info in a private note  Certain items really need attention  The kitchen and baths were not cleaned thoroughly and that was especially a concern because of Covid      The tub needed a better cleaner product  The toilet was dirty inside  Given that the place looked recently renovated I would not have expected the tub to look like there was old residue  We had to wipe down all the surfaces in the kitchen and baths  The microwave was also dirty inside  The kitchen trash can was soiled and there was no trash liners  The cleaning service came back the next day and serviced the property  I really appreciated that since it was thanksgiving   I could tell that the floors were not properly cleaned because there was debris in the corners in the bedroom and kitchen area  This is a very nice place but needs a bit more attention to detail related to cleaning  There did not seem to be enhanced cleaning protocols  The door locks were being changed when we arrived  We had to wait a bit before entering Long wait times on hold when we called about gaining access This was a very nice place  recently renovated  and the location was great  Our biggest concern was the cleanliness
598114952,We really appreciated all of the upscale amenities this place had to offer  and the location was great  We had an issue with the parking arrangements  but overall we would recommend and stay here again when we come back to the area  We appreciate the upscale look and style of this place so much  We loved staying there  and the security features were awesome  We only wish we could have used the private parking area  not necessarily because we needed to but because its what we had expected upon arrival  Everything else was great for us  thanks for the great place   The parking situation was a little frustrating for us  The guest that stayed before us took the key fob for the private parking area  so we had to park on the street both nights  Its an understandable issue  however we stayed for   days and two nights and it didnt get taken care of  We would have given a solid   stars for everything if we didnt have to park on the street  
449432594,large  comfortable apartment in good location
470897825,This place is just ok   it was much older and in worse shape than the photographs showed  Bathroom was very dark   The doorman at the key pick up place was somewhat unhelpful and made me feel like  it was inconvenient that I was there  Also said I should have printed out the confirmation of reservation  not just have it on my phone  well it was in Hyde Park     its not an area you feel safe going back to when it gets dark  bed was terrible  Pillows were thin and old  Place just smelled old and a bit damp   Window air conditioning was not really adequate to cool space 
435136906,The location is great   close to Forest Park and restaurants  As I said in an email  the internet was up and down which was a bit frustrating  The internet was up and down   I emailed a couple of times and the response was a bit slow

199989553,Modern  clean studio in the heart of Chicago  Loads of amenities  pool  fitness center  in apartment laundry  wine openers  etc  Not having cable was slightly annoying  although becoming the norm  since the Amazon Prime account needed a password that wasnt listed in the book   The only real issue I had with the rental was having to specifically lie to the building attendant about why I was there  Im assuming they dont allow you to rent the apartments through Airbnb   Your communication was good  I would recommend including the passwords in the book so guests dont have to wait hours for a response before thy can watch TV  The apartment was nice  very clean  modern cute  etc  but I felt VERY comfortable lying about the fact youre renting the apartment through AirBnB  especially when we were having issues with the lock on the front door  I guess I would just recommend you make that very clear in your listing    u   cI was very uncomfortable lying about the AirBnB  u   d 
599028160,Great space in a historic building  However  be aware of issues involving parking and the neighborhood  The parking situation and neighborhood are the downsides to this otherwise great space  It would be great if there was secured parking someplace the building or in a gated spot nearby  The sketchy people on the street at all hours of day night  usually pan handling for money or making inappropriate comments about my wife  were not only annoying but a legitimate safety concern  Numerous times  police arrived at the gas station nearby  On one occasion in particular  the officer pulled up to us as we left for dinner asking if we had heard  two shots  in the past few minutes  Not sure what could be done  but it would be a deterrent for me to rent the space again  The trash cans were full when we arrived  Otherwise  the apartment was clean  The neighborhood is concerning  especially at night  We were approached for money by people from a nearby shelter multiple times  We did not feel safe walking outside at night 
586133711,Great place and location   Asked about a parking key and they never got back with us  The busy road near by could be an issue for light sleepers  Asked about a parking key and they never got back with us 
260075610,My stay at Chris place was exactly what I needed for my brief work trip to the area  I found convenient free street parking  let myself in with an easy lockbox system  and slept soundly  The apartment is simple  clean and architecturally charming with basic amenities  The kitchen is well designed and Chris was helpful and responsive to my questions  Thanks Chris for hosting last minute and for the tip on SpotHero  Ill definitely use the app from now on when traveling for work in Chicago 
591585715,It was a very nice clean new place  A little noise with construction  and I never got a fob to park in the parking lot  Other than that it was great  It looks just like the pictures  Very nice place thanks for the stay   I didn u    t have a fob to park in the parking lot   When I asked to get a fob for the parking lot they said theyd work on it but never responded after that and I didnt get one 
259269756,Great location for downtown activities  Safe neighborhood  As advertised  Nice apartment  instructions concerning identification for arrival a little awkward   u   eNo TV service  several light bulbs non functional  overall nice apartment and good location u   c 
603129763,Nice place Building layout was a bit confusing at first
610025261,The stay itself was alright but I wouldnt recommend it for light sleepers  Any and all noises in the building stairwell hallway can be heard from the bedrooms as if it were right outside your door  Comforter was dirty
198229747,Great location  good communication with host  The building is a little on the older side and had some old building quirks  but the apartment itself is nicely outfitted  The shower makes a kind of distressing noise when the water is running   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  Additional comments   u   cLaundry not available u   d   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust 
251758911,Great place   clean   modern and very trendy  All the latest movies and channels  Had plentiful extra towels and amenities like coffee   utensils   modern furniture   etc  Bed was like sleeping on a cloud   super comfortable  Very nice and clean  Exceptional cleanliness  Inside was great  The outside stairs leading up to   nd floor look a little bit  sketchy  but I guess there is nothing you can do about that   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  photos    Parking was a little bit scarce    but you could find a spot   just had to search     
623540729,Clean place in a nice area  There is a rodent behind the fridge that comes out 
635434920,The floors are disgusting  you can tell they didnt Mop or sweep before us   There was bugs everywhere  the ac barley worked  PLENTY of things were broken like no doorknobs   shower was messed up  the doors barley closed   Nothings was wiped down  This place has a lot of potential with the area it is sadly its not taken care of  
250286596,Its no frills  But right for the cost   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  Additional comments   u   cIt wasnt much of a place   No frills  Very basic  But fir the price it was about right   u   d  
587885468,I think this apartment would be best for business travelers   Not ideal for holiday travel or light sleepers  Hi Zencity There are a few things that lead me to believe the apartment wasnt quite user ready      the address was not correct   I arrived very late after dark so this gave me a bit of anxiety when checking in      it was very very cold in the apartment and it took quite a while for the temperature to rise   the hot water runs out VERY QUICKLY   My boyfriend took a very quick shower and i was not able to finish my shower afterwards before the hot water ran out      I arrived very late and so went to bed with intentions of sleeping in   Please note this trip was for personal vacation holiday travel   Because of the construction in the building  the fire alarm in the complex went off around      am   It was VERY cold outside and I had to sit in the car until about      when the fire department was able to turn off the alarms    very loud construction noise continued the first morning until around   am   For a business trip this would have been fine but I was very unhappy about the noise because my plan was to have a relaxed vacation with lots of sleep    some how water is escaping the shower stall and runs all over the bathroom floor   I have a photo of where the water seems to be coming from   Thursday morning there were construction workers doing electrical work in a closet just across the hall from the apartment door   The actual work did not create much noise at all BUT They had a boombox radio on very loud   That is very inconsiderate     constantly finding hair on the floors and couch was very unpleasant      I kept my gym clothes on the floor in the closet   When retreating them I found layers of saw dust all over my clothes because the baseboards had never been wiped off from the renovations     I really didnt like that the apartment unit door does not meet the floor   There is a pretty wide space at least an inch between the floor and the door for cold air  noise  and if any pests or rodents are in the building they now have easy access to your apartment     Lastly   I would have liked to know in advance that this until was in the basement of the complex and also a corner garden until where all the windows are facing high foot traffic areas  It could be a nice   star rental but these details prevented me from having a seamless  relaxing stay   More than happy to discuss if you have any other questions   Confirmation said address was        Actual address is        There is no      on Dolman   Also would prefer to know in advance that unit was a basement unit where all windows faced high foot traffic areas   Building hallways were very dirty  building materials were sitting in the halls  Lots of hair on the floors  carpet  and area rug inside the unit   There were layers of saw dust along baseboards inside the unit 
704479555,The place was so stylish and nice  We will definitely book again on our next visit  The stay at your location was wonderful  Definitely will book again on the next visit  Most of the areas in the house was very clean  However  there was food stains on the comforter  We had to wash the sheets and comforter 
719158773,The value for this location was awesome  The communication was pretty bad  Check in instructions came later than check in and the number to call was unresponsive most of the time  They should fire the cleaning company as there was dirt and food from the previous guests  and we had to clean more before we were able to get comfortable 
246882693,The place was not clean  very dusty floor  on the day of my arrival   the host had it cleaned the next day on my request   I was not given a key needed for entering the gym   pool and my request for the key was ignored    I was asked to lie to the neighbors   management that Im a certain local corporate guest  not an Airbnb guest    Check in was not convenient  Nobody was at the property to hand me the key   I was asked to go somewhere to find it  This can be very bad if you are arriving at night   hauling a luggage    If you dont care about these issues  it is a very nice property in great location   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  very dusty  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable 
246890119,My trip started well yet ended unpleasantly  Chris is responsive via email  The unit gets good natural light and the minimalist decor is nice  But when I got locked out of the unit  he was no help  I asked him to provide a number to maintenance and he didnt  Luckily someone saw me helpless and standing in the hallway for over an hour and told me whom to call  The building maintenance staff had to drill and remove the lock  but they finally let me in  I was locked out for over two hours  I prefer to leave more positive reviews  but I want to be honest and help others so that you dont have my same experience  I feel that leaving this negative review may result in my receiving a negative review from the host  But I am ok with this because my review may help other potential guests  I prefer to be honest and transparent  The much longer version is below  The positives  The unit has so much natural light  The unit is a corner unit so there are lots of windows  The units minimalist decor is nice too  Chris was responsive via email  When I told him about a mildew like odor in the unit  he sent three people to check on the odor  However  none of them were able to fix it  The area rug in the bedroom reeked of the mildew smell  so I folded it and placed it in the closet  I decided to check out early because the odor was too strong  Even one of his staff confirmed the foul odor  Chris let me me check out after    am  which I appreciated  When I told him that I wanted a refund for the remaining nights  he messaged me   I am happy to refund you the remaining portion of your stay  however  I ask that you leave a positive review  I have hosted many guests here and have not had an odor issue before  If that is acceptable to you  I will have Airbnb cancel the remaining portion of your stay and issue the refund   I found this odd because reviews should be honest  And I responded that I would leave an honest review  I previously emailed Chris that the key to the unit wasnt working properly to unlock the deadbolt  And guess what  I ended up getting locked out of the unit right before I checked out  In desperation  I emailed him repeatedly and asked for a number to his staff or maintenance  He would not provide any phone number and his response was to jimmy the lock  Chris did not offer any support beyond jimmying and playing with the lock  After finally finding a phone number to the building manager  two maintenance staff drilled and removed the lock from the door  Luckily  this happened during the daytime  What if this happened at night  I mightve been stranded  Chris never emailed to see if I got in  I do not see myself renting    Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  strong odor  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  Additional comments   host emailed me but did not help when I was locked out      my experience was not good    
246492116,I booked Chris place to stay at for a very short trip to Chicago to look for a place to live as I am moving for a new job  Check in was very easy and the place was clean and as pictured  We arrived quite late and went to bed  The next day we awoke to find no hot water in the shower  it was   deg outside  but hot water in the sink   Myself and traveling companion could not shower  thankfully we were just going to look at condos  I notified Chris who said maintenance would come to investigate   He did check in with me in the afternoon to ask if the situation had been remedied  but we had not returned to the apartment to be able to verify this  We were gone from the apt from    am  midnight  When we returned  we still no hot water at all  sink or shower now  at this time and I notified Chris about this   We were still unable to shower so again had to meet with our real estate agent unshowered   still    deg outside     I did not hear from him until we were ready to check out  when he did allow us to leave our luggage for   hours  free of charge     While Chris reacting to our issue calling maintenance  the problem was not fixed and his communication of was a bit delayed on this  He was regretful for the issue  but did not offer any partial refund or to stay in another of his apartments in the complex which we not rented  as we could see in this on Airbnb   He also then said we scratched very inexpensive plastic chairs in his apartment  which we didnt even use while there and charged us for these  which was an insult after not being able to shower for   days      I know mechanical things happen and they are out of control the property owner  he dealt with our issue initially in an appropriate manner but the end result was unsatisfactory  Thankfully this trip as not for a job interview or an important even where being unshowered x  days would have been less an appropriate     I also am aware that people all over the world take cold showers  but I have a medical condition where I should not get cold and it was only    degrees wind chill in Chicago at the time    u   cNot really vintage u   d 
624667454,Great space  Situated right on Washington St  Make sure you being your own water  unless youre drinking tap   The building is safe  however  I would stay alert getting to the building from wherever you park     min walk to the Arch  and lots of restaurants nearby  Beautiful location  didnt feel completely safe while trying to get to the building  however the  building itself was very safe and we were able to get around fairly well 
709208579,This place was nice  It appeared clean and well maintained  The check in was a bit tricky  Parking was easy in the nearby parking garage    The location was great for what I was looking for  The photo of the key station was never attached and it did not work when I arrived  I had to call to get help  which eventually worked out  but was not ideal  The key slot I needed ended up being jammed which could have been avoided had someone checked for accuracy before my stay  The entry door also never let me in with the  spoken code and I had to wait for someone to happen to be opening the door 
672389351,Great location  Clean  simple apartment  None of the soap dispensers worked  High fees in addition to nightly rate
197992207,Clean apartment that looks just like the pictures  Communication with Chris before during my stay was great  However  the apartment is located right next to a train station and nine commuter train tracks  so even with the windows closed  you will hear the constant sound of trains  bells  and horns starting early in the morning  Hey Chris  Great apartment except the sound of trains is a major issue  I would not have stayed there had I known how loud they would have been in the apartment   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  Additional comments   u   cChris fails to mention the constant sound of trains in his posting  u   d    The apartment is right next to the train station and   commuter train tracks  
243128091,Enjoyed our stay  It is a great location Hey Chris  we enjoyed our stay with you  Just a couple of things for next time   There were very few towels in the apartment and only a couple of mugs for tea  The front door was very hard to get in and out of also   Thanks for having us
715918707,Great place and location  Best value for the location    Pictures are a true reflection on space  Lovely place and location  just needs deep cleaning on areas that are easily overlooked like behind doors and behind bathroom sinks  Host never attendent to my concerns however host was great at emailing back   But not correcting issues brought up 
711454414,  
83281468,Overall a great stay  Central location with an easy walk or Uber to many popular destinations  Pictures online represent the space well and the bed was very comfortable  There were a few issues with communication that could easily be fixed  such as incorrect address  wrong code to enter building and lack of keys  The hosts did respond and fixed all of these issues and were flexible on our checkout time which we appreciated 
581666437,The location was great  I would recommend this Airbnb if you are looking for a long or short stay  Thank you for hosting us  The location is great and the apartment was decorated well  Since I stayed for a week and Had to use public laundromat since the washer didnt work  Everything else was pretty good  Washer didn u    t work  I notified them and they were quick to respond back  Everything else was pretty good 
581687667,Nice place  Has everything you need  Clean   Everything within walking distance  Comfortable   WiFi isnt good  Couldnt even watch Netflix  and had issues even listening to music online  I had a video conference call that I ended up going somewhere else to do because the Wifi wasnt dependable    Zencity did respond very quickly when I let them know about the poor Wi Fi  They did offer some other options but those werent good either unfortunately    If you do not need Wi Fi  this is the perfect place to stay  Everything else was great 
576883427,A very spacious apartment in a great location for fantastic price   The key fob was missing to park in the lot behind the building   With the building still be under construction  the ventilation system had yet to be cleaned  When we turned on the heat  you could see the white construction dust coating accumulate on the furniture and floor   Not healthy stuff to breath in  And one of the bathrooms had not been vacuumed 
238450899,nice freshly repainted airbnb appartment  perfect location when visiting students at UChicago  downtown Hyde park  good size  BUT The third guest  who pays  sleeps on a sofa  NOT a sofabed   the mattress is very uncomfortable  and there are no linens or towels for this guest  when I asked  linens and towels were delivered the next day only  at  pm  Kind of too late  Too bad  because the location is great   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  Additional comments   u   cthe sofa bed could not be unfolded  the mattress was really bad  and there was no linen or towel for the person sleeping on the sofa for   h u   d  
626431172,The space was nice and very comfortable  Nice view and large open loft  Parking was less than adequate and the host provided no direction on where to park  which wasnt helpful to a non local  Otherwise the loft was nice and we had a great stay  More directions on parking would have been helpful 
623434801,It was clean and in a great location  Had some problems with the lock but hopefully its fixed soon  Great value for the price  but be ready to pay for parking  Please fix that lock  It was such a struggle to get in since the sensors did not line up  The lock on the door didnt always work  I was told someone would come by to fix it and they never did  I spent    mins trying to get in one morning and couldnt get ahold of anyone and no one ever followed up 
626530179,I love It here I always stay here  great location and cool amenities  Thanks I always enjoy my stay  there was a few things that arent usually an issue  The bed linen was full of hair and makeup  the toilet rim could have been cleaned better as well  and there was a comforter outside the front door from my arrival until I left  It just seems as it was a rush cleaning job  Thanks This was unusual its normally always very clean Just make sure linens are cleaned properly and things are not left out of place 
522170953,A few Pros and Cons  PROS  Amazing location     minute walk to cute restaurants and bars  cute apartment  super comfortable bed  quick responses from Zencity  apartment lobby staff were so nice and helpful    CONS  Shower was dirty and didnt drain  Had long black hairs on the shower wall and tub floor  Stood in   inches of water while I showered  When I brought it up to Zencity they said  thanks for your feedback  well inform the cleaning service  and never apologized   Parking was not ideal and was not described accurately in the listing  The listing states  no on site parking   What it doesnt list is that your options are street parking or garage parking  Street parking is impossible to find and is not always free  We NEVER found street parking  Garage parking is     per night  So  be prepared to pay for your parking  Guests should know this before booking  and it was pretty deceiving on the listing  When I brought this up to Zencity  they said that they do state  free parking is available off site  but they will work on making it more clear in the listing   Know that finding free parking is about like finding a winning lottery ticket  so  although it may be  available   you probably wont find it   OVERALL  Parking and shower aside  we really did love our stay  The location is top notch and the apartment was really nice  However  Im not sure wed stay here again   Apartment and location was exactly as described  but the parking situation is extremely deceiving and is not described well at all  It simply says   no on site parking    But what this means is you either have to find street parking  which is very difficult and isnt always free  or park in a nearby garage  which will cost you     per night  They should prepare their guests for this expense  and they do not   Apartment overall was clean and tidy  but the bathroom was not cleaned  particularly the shower  There were long black hairs all over the shower walls and the tub floor  Also  the tub did not drain while taking a shower  so I was standing in   inches of water during my shower  When I brought this to Zencitys attention  they stated  thanks for the feedback  we will let our cleaning service know  and didnt seem very apologetic  Communication was good and fast  just not very apologetic when problems were brought up  Parking
433015660,The host was great at communicating around check in and check out time  I had a good experience staying at the apartment  Thank you for letting me check in early  The floor was a little dusty  it made me wish I had slippers  If it were a little bit cleaner
667086465,This is a cute place  and in a great area  The only downside was the dirt and grime on cupboards and floors  The outdoor heater didnt work which was a bummer  but we used the grill to keep us toasty while we enjoyed the outdoors     We loved the massive master bathroom 
700000505,Wonderful location  Easy check in and check out  Great amenities and will certainly stay in one of their properties again  The areas were clean  However the front of kitchen and bathroom cabinets had not been wiped down  You could see the remnants of food lotion on them  I wiped them down myself  Also  the walls are white and I could see that the walls were dirty  not filthy  but enough where you notice  Overall  it was a good experience and I would certainly stay in another one of your properties 
512836952,Good location  but wasnt clean and didnt have a deck as mentioned   just an unsafe  unfinished tar roof with no furniture   There was no deck  This is my biggest problem  because its the reason I booked this apartment  There was an unsafe fire escape and an unsafe  unfinished rooftop covered in tar with no railings  There was no deck  and again both locations were very unsafe and were not usable   The floor was so dirty that it turned my feet black with just a small amount of walking around  The dishes were dirty   one of the  clean  glasses even had lipstick on it  The bathroom had mold and mildew  and it had clearly not been cleaned for some time  Besides these things  the were minor stains spots on the sofa and the walls throughout the apartment were dirty  Truth about the listing  deck  and clean 
508959172,I have never had a poor experience with Airbnb but I was less than thrilled with this property  even as a place to stay and sleep  less than   hrs while driving through  Upon arriving around   p the place was      the window air conditioner was off  and I was greeted by a cockroach the size of my hand in the bathroom  The bedroom door was broken off the hinges  unable to close and the bedroom fan had a very thick layer of dust on it so I could not turn it on   On the surface the place looked decent enough but it was very grimey on baseboards  visibly under bathroom tub  bathroom window ledge moldy and crumbling  The couch was also broken and very uncomfortable   If this was what I was expecting and priced much lower  no more than     it would have been fine but I was upset by the misrepresentation through pictures and for the cost I could have just stayed in a hotel off the highway which I did the night before and was much more comfortable  The check in was easy and the location   availability of street parking was great but the property mgmt  should be doing a much better job maintaining the property  We were not thrilled with things being broken and extremely dirty   especially bedroom fan  You are overcharging and misrepresenting your rental for what it is  Would not stay at or recommend your properties   The place is depicted as clean and minimalist  minimalist it is  clean or comfortable it was not  Surface level it looked OK but felt very grimey  Bedroom door also broken off hinges  unable to close  Couch was broken  caving in  very uncomfortable   Biggest cockroaches I have ever seen  disintegrating window ledge in bathroom  inch thick of dust on bedroom fan   could not turn it on  general grime seen under bathtub  baseboards  etc  Surface level it looked OK but felt very grimey  Bedroom door also broken off hinges  unable to close  Couch was broken  caving in  very uncomfortable  I would have felt OK staying here if it was no more than      I could have stayed in a clean hotel for the cost of this place and recommended that fir others 
504453164,Location is convenient if you need to be close to McCormick Place  Clean place  clear instructions  quiet neighbourhood  More kitchen ustensils would be appreciated  Fixing the shower would be nice  And maybe a coffee maker with some complimentary coffee   more things to be able to cook
500173322,This unit is well maintained   The L train is relatively far away  but bus service on the    and    routes will easily get you downtown and are a short walk from the building  Please include a larger table in the kitchen area of the unit   There is barely enough room for two people to sit with plates  much less laptops  Since the unit accommodates up to four people  I think the table should seat that many people   The description for laundry requires improvement  It should say that the laundry is coin operated and is located in the basement   The description should give directions to the laundry room   I had to ask ZenCity how to get to the laundry and what keys are required   The lock core on the entryway to the building requires replacement  The core pushes in to the door  preventing you from unlocking the door   It requires substantial effort to position the lock so it may be opened 
502490967,The Bed was comfortable and the location is nice  but the dishwasher didnt work  the Electric water boiler didnt work  and the Extra linens were dirty  There also wasnt enough dishware for four people  For the price  we expected these amenities to be available  For      a night the dishwasher should work  the hot water boiler should work  and the extra linen should be clean 
657507077,It was nice
227661446,Clean house and easy to take uber  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home 
573624066,Alright if you want a clean and comfortable place for a night or two  The faucet in the bathroom washbasin leaks even after both taps are fully shut  There is a bad tobacco odor in the place coming from the vents or the cabinets in the kitchen  Also sounds from the other parts of th building are heard particularly loudly and are disturbing  Otherwise the place is good  clean  peaceful and the communication was easy  reliable and quick  A bit complicated   involves picking up a key at one place and then walking elsewhere to use it  Not an ideal procedure to follow in the cold  after dark There should be pictures of the outdoor too on the AirBnB app so that we get a better idea of the neighborhood  It was quite deserted and spooky  Easier check in  no tobacco odor in the room
225455450,The noise from the air heater filled the entire apt  Like you were on a plane taking off  Also the host was unreachable and the wifi password was wrong in the instructions   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  wifi  noise  Additional comments   u   cLoud air heater     u   d   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  shower or tub  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  Additional comments   Wrong wifi password  no number to call host    
719806851,Great place to stay  Host and I were able to resolve issues that arose  Thank you for the clear instructions and provided a nice place to stay  Happy New Year   No keys upon arrival  Couldnt secure my belongings  Bed top sheet had ink stains and other kind of stains  Bathtub had some hair inside 
573591562,This apartment was in a great location for my trip to the University of Chicago and close to some cute restaurants in Hyde Park  Its in an older building that is nicely updated  but there were some minor maintenance quirks in the apartment itself  The pictures reflect the space accurately  except that there isnt great lighting in the apartment  and since its getting dark at       it was pretty dark most of the time I was there  This place had all my basic needs covered for my stay  but didnt feel especially cozy  Hi there  The apartment was convenient and nice but I rated it three stars because I found it a bit depressing with the low light and sparse furniture  Some better lighting would go a long way 
224630468,Love the apartment  Amazing location        Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host didnt respond   
626439223,The  host  that message you  dont speak proper english  It smells like weed everywhere  Too loud at night because of people throwing parties  The  step by step  instructions were shit  I even messaged you guys for help  because what I was told was incorrect  Then whomever responded back to me  said that it was my fault  You guys need to learn proper english  A few minute drive to downtown  that was nice and handy 
709886456,Zencity is a convenient  place in a good area  however  communication is  slow and I wouldnt say they are a host that values hospitality  Though I wasnt bothered by this  I just want travelers to know that this is the place to book if you can check in and check out without any special accommodation requests 
666795062,Good location  Easy check in  No curtain in the living room  Balcony  better cleaning  curtain in living room to provide privacy 
666518077,Nice   straight  Everything was nice
472386199,Fine for a day or two  but if u can  bring your own cooking utensils because the kitchen is sorely lacking  Paint peeling and weird stains on carpet  but otherwise a nice apartment  Dog in yard below barks A LOT  so bring earplugs if you are a late riser  Hot water takes a while to start but it is there  Water pressure  not so much  It served the purpose I needed   Amenities are listed but not accurate  It said kitchen with all cookware and dishes  Yet  i had to go buy several items i needed to cook with  Also i needed the first aid kit they said they had  and it turned out to be only band aids and Neosporin  Not cool   Large stain on Carpet Slow responses  I asked for something and by the time i got a response i had already gone to Walmart and gotten what i needed  Also they didnt offer to bring me what i needed  Just told me that it should be in there  If im asking for it  its obviously not in there 
471990721,Apartment is nicely decorated  beds very comfy and kitchen was well outfitted  Location was great near restaurants and a Whole Foods  My only complaint is that apartment is near several large hospitals and so you are subjected to noise from ambulances coming and going this seemed more obvious at night as we were trying to sleep   Location of apartment near two large hospitals meant we were subjected to ambulance sirens late at night and early in the a m  
702339977,It is a very nice space and felt safe in the building  Yet  the listing shows   bedrooms and I was only able to use    There is mold all in the closet in one of the bedrooms  and you can feel a difference in the air quality  I ended up sharing a bed with my other traveler  If the mold issue is taken care of  I would give   stars all around  There is mold in the bedroom   Was only able to use   instead of   bedrooms from the mold   There is mold in the closet in the bedroom that is not safe   I did not feel comfortable sleeping in a room with mold so I was only able to use one of the bedrooms 
468540971,Nice little space   Clean   Host is a great communicator   Close to Blueline to OHare   Does not have air conditioning  You all were excellent communicators through the hot water problems and access hiccup   Thank you   If the space had air conditioning Id use it frequently  but without and the summer coming  Ill wait until the weather cools to use it again   Thanks for the stay   No hot water for first night and morning  unexpected by Zencity and me   but Zencity communicated very effectively and I appreciate it   Several doors at location   Clearer address labeling would have been helpful  Was entirely accurate   Not a five star location  but good  Air conditioning   I get a spot on Fulton Market for less  and the space is  x size with awesome amenities and space aesthetics 
215597328,Many of the previous reports are correct but some points  this is a business with rental apartments and not a real Airbnb     No books of instructions so I couldnt work TV   and when I informed Chris he just said sorry   didnt bring it    You are actually facing multiple train rails  loudy    Close neighborhood not interesting nor feels good to walk around    Kitchen dirty with no essentials   salt  knife   Overall disappointing  I am sure Airbnb didnt mean for this impersonal attitude It was very insulting for you not to react to the fact that I had no explanation book   no way to work tv You were notified   but did nothing about it  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  amenities  Additional comments   u   cNo real working tv nor video  u   d   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  kitchen  Additional comments   Greasy cultry    Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements  host unreachable  Additional comments   The doorman didnt find right key    A bit off center   feels like your sitting over train station  
342321579,This is a great location and a really cool classic building from the beginning of the   th Century   Staff at the front desk were delightful   The studio looks just like the picture   Whenever I had a question  the host got back to me straight away  The bed is memory foam or similar   some people love that  Hi Chris  I found the location great and nice old building with delightful staff   Your place looked just ike the pictures and you were very responsive to my queries   However   I did not find the bed comfortable and there was no other real place to sit in the room   one or two comfortable chairs instead of the banquette and the straight chair would have been much better   Also  no reading light on my side of the bed and no bedside table on that side were a little inconvenient   As I mentioned  the loud fridge kept me up  Thank you for getting right back to me when I emailed you 
672965074,DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY   I hope this review will save EVERYONE from ever having to deal with what we endured on what was supposed to be a fun family getaway  I have NEVER taken the time to write a review  but this experience was so unbelievably awful  that I wont waste the opportunity to help warn others about this terrible company    We purchased a unit that specifically  listed it had   queen beds to accommodate our family  Zen City posted a listing for a unit with exactly that in an area that was relatively close to the things we wanted to see and do in downtown St Louis  so we purchased the unit   As soon as we get to the unit  we knew something was wrong  The first thing we noticed was that the place was absolutely filthy  Hair and dirt EVERYWHERE  So what does that hefty  cleaning fee  they charge go towards I wonder  Certainly not CLEANING THE UNIT   So  right off the bat  that was disgusting    Next thing we noticed was that we didnt have the   queen beds we were supposed to have  We got in late  but we contacted the host right away to tell them these things  They ended up trying to go into the listing and CHANGING THE LISTING  to the unit they had put us in  Luckily  we still had pictures of the original listing we purchased and our confirmation email showing everything we were supposed to have    This company repeatedly try to put the blame on us saying several times  Oh  I see how you could have been confused  and  Sorry  you must have overlooked and bought a different listing   after we kept providing proof of what we originally purchased   As you may have already guessed  this host refused make the situation right  hung up on us  and told us to go through AirBnB  So  we did  AirBnB immediately saw right through this deceitful company  They saw that they tried to update the listing AFTER we initially contacted them  as well as the lies they told through the messenger  We ended up receiving a FULL REFUND  and immediately got our belongings out of that nasty dump and went to a nearby hotel  where we were able to salvage the rest of our trip    Of course  this company will do anything other than accept responsibility and be accountable for their deceitful actions  so Im sure we received a delusional review in response to this one  reminds me of a    year old child throwing a tantrum screaming  I know you are  but what am I       However  if this review can save ANYONE from having to deal with this God awful company  then taking the time to write this review will have been well worth it   DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST    Please stop messaging us through AirBnB messenger  You act like a little twelve year old who is so insecure that they feel like they have to have the last word  You lied  You got caught  Be an adult and own it   This host deceivingly posted pictures of a different unit with different accommodations  only to get caught and try to deny it  AirBnB saw right through their lies and issued us a full refund  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST   We were given a completely different unit than we purchased  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  This host will charge you a  cleaning fee  without even cleaning the place  Hair and dirt all over the bathroom  dirty floors  etc  Absolutely disgusting  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  They do nothing but lie  even when they are caught red handed  Thankfully  AirBnB saw right through them and issued us a full refund  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  Regardless of where the location is  this company is ran by horrible human beings  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST  After getting a FULL REFUND from AirBnB due to the outright lying and deception of Zen City  we found much better value at a hotel nearby that didnt have hair and dirt al over the floor  DO NOT RENT FROM THIS HOST 
210470491,Chriss place is a mixed bag  Some things are great   the fresh linen and comfy bed and the natural light but other things are a little lackluster   The noise from other rooms and the greasy crockery  If youre a tea drinker  you wont love it here  Theres no kettle  and milk is a few blocks away  Best suited to coffee drinkers and people on a budget  Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise  wifi   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  floors and carpet 
585374831,Nice place   a bit spartan  very clean  great kitchen  but heating issues and communication issues  For some reason  the text messages sent by Zencity were arriving in partial form   At the beginning  for check in   there was e mail backup for the missing messages  so it wasnt a major issue   However  when we arrived on a fairly warm day  the temperature in the apartment was    degrees   We looked for instructions on how to adjust the heating  couldnt find them  turned the thermostat up to    but there was no change in temperature   The next morning  the outdoor temperature had started to drop and the interior temperature was    degrees   I asked for guidance from Zencity by both SMS and e mail   I provided an alternate  U S   phone for messages and also an alternate e mail address   I received no communication to either  of these options   On Monday at      PM a partial message arrived on my Mexican phone from Zencity    Hi Colleen   Sorry to hear it may be a      Then  at      PM   Zencity   Hi  Colleen  Just checking in   were you      I replied to the partial message at      PM    Yes trying to get in touch about the heating   Its down to    degrees   Please help   Urgent   Thanks   E mail  please   Anyway  the issue was never resolved and we spent some chilly days and nights there  Working heat that guests can adjust 
585158276,The worst place to stay ever  when I read the reviews for this place I was comfortable but then when I got there I was shocked  The host wasnt helpful when you ask about places around the apartment  The apartment was super small and different from the pictures that were provided  The most problem that I faced is I cant adjust the AC temp  It was extremely hot and when I talked to the host he said just open the windows and itll be fine  Also  he lied to me by saying you can adjust that and it took him two days to say that theres no way to completely to turn on the A C control since its building controlled Even if you open the window theres a lot of noise from the train and the cars outside  Theres no parking spot close to the apartment  The elevator smells like Marijuana everyday  I was uncomfortable the entire trip  Gives a wrong information
583440935,Zencity is awesome  Communication is great and the place is up to par with what it looks like on the website  Great stay    We had a great stay and really enjoy Zencity overall  The place was overall great and perfect for our type of trip  Only major issue was the smell and a repair man came to the door at  am  which was a little scary  But overall  honestly very good stay and we had a great time    The place had a weird smell throughout the stay
583373237,We enjoyed our stay here  Lots to do in STL  Plan ahead for parking  it was challenging to find a spot near the loft  There is a parking lot thats        per day to park  We tried to avoid  I recommend knowing aheadthe rules for parking and when its free  They will ticket you and its expensive copared to our city  Thankfullly we were not ticketed  But thats because the guy writing the tickets helped my husband  The loft was really neat  I would have liked more louging type furniture  The legs on the couch were moving slightly and it wasnt very comfortable for relaxing  I would stay here again  Beautiful loft and very open  I think adding more details about parking would help  That was very challenging for us and took us a day to get the idea of it down  free parking is only on the weekends and after  pm  Due the restaurants under the loft  it was nearly impossible to get bear our loft unless we paid        per day for the back lot 
582744556,I loved the modern decor of this unit  It looked like the entire unit had been recently renovated  Everything was very clean almost like it was new and the place was very comfortable for two  You could put a third on the living room couch if needed  The kitchen was clean and had a new  huge refrigerator  Utensils  glasses  silverware and other kitchen needs were provided  The bathroom was clean and the shower was new  and nice  The location of this place was great  We were only a couple minutes from downtown and several other attractions  You are pretty much close to everything and could walk or take a short Uber to local attractions  I cant say that anything was  bad   but a key fob was not provided for the parking lot and side door  It wasnt a big deal as the lot was open two of the three days we were there  and we could enter a code provided to us to enter the building   It did delay our ability to load up the car on the day we departed  Also  there were occupants in other units that you could hear when they were really loud  Not bad enough to not want to stay here again  but wanted others to be aware it wasnt total peace and quiet  Overall I was very satisfied with the unit provided and with the communication with Zencity  I would definitely rent a unit from them if we are in town again  Thank you for hosting us in St  Louis  We were very pleased with the cleanliness of the place and loved the modern decor  All of the furnishings were comfortable to sit sleep on  The only complaints I had was that it wasnt clear what the WiFi password was and had to ask  and we didnt have a key fob  Neither were a big issue aside from not being able to get to my car for     hour because of the gated parking lot  I was able to get a construction worker to let me in  but it delayed our departure and was unfortunate since everything else was wonderful  Thanks again 
582216754,This apartment is a great stay  At the moment  there is construction that starts at  am  But besides that  everything was perfectly clean   homey  Very comfortable bed  Would stay again  We loved staying at your place  and it was a great value  However  I think it would be worth mentioning to future guests that there is active construction in the building that starts promptly at  am  Other than that  our stay was flawless  Thanks again 
439245024,What can I say   nice spot  Accessible to restaurants of all kind  Quiet building  The studio was clean and offered several amenities  The bookshelf my favorite as I love to read  Only concern  someone entered the studio during the day to put air conditioner in window without proper consent which made us feel uncomfortable  I understand this is your rental property but to enter and not mention it to the guest is not the best way  Anyway everything else was worth the stay  Thanks for all your assistance and willingness to help with our need for extended stay 
438408831,The neighbor is great to tour   some great places to dine   The building is a little old but very quiet  Overall  we enjoyed the stay  Bed was pretty comfy with clean sheets  enough towels for a week  Price is great and cheaper than staying downtown   We ubered and took the red line downtown whenever we needed to  Cleaning fee  was a bit to much for the floors to not have been swept  There was cat hair all over the carpet and every time I got on to the bed we tried to clean our feet and there was fur and fuzz alI over them 
583332284,Overall  the host was very responsive in a timely manner  The location is not ideal  despite it being    minutes  by transit  from downtown  There is also the loud sound of the subway passing by every     minutes which gets really annoying at night time  The heat in the unit was wishy washy  sometimes it would get too hot and other times  it was freezing  its also locked to a range so you can only change it so much   The host entered the apartment  while we werent there  without informing us which wasnt appreciated either  The neighbourhood was quiet but it felt a little too quiet  In general  would suggest to look for a unit closer to downtown  Please communicate clearly to guests when you will be entering and leaving apartment for our safety and security  Please be prepared for guests  ie  laundry  as I did ask prior to the trip  No Location
582225780,Basic apartment with all necessities  Wonderful location for Museum of Science and Industry   Attendant friendly and always at lobby desk   Felt very safe   Did not use laundry which was a couple doors down on our floor  The sofa is very  very uncomfortable  Bedroom rug needed additional vacuuming   Some Refrigerator shelves needed cleaning 
582209519,Very neat and tidy  all essentials and more provided  Mattress was uncomfortable
428066867,Decent stay Other than paying for the batteries  the bed and the dirty tub  we had a nice stay  Host said they would respond and help me with issues  Host never responded to issues until after I checked out  When I arrived the bathtub had   or   inches of dirty water in it Host did not communicate to my concerns until after I checked out For so much money per night we were given a broken bed frame  a dirty tub  and had to go spend our own money on batteries for the TV
401057031,The best part about this unit is the location   You can easily walk to shopping  restaurants  and markets   The linens and towels were clean and the bed was comfortable   Unfortunately  this unit is more worn down that the pictures imply   Also  the unit is hot and stuffy even with valves closed and the window open   If we took longer than a   minute shower  there was standing water in the tub   The heater in the bathroom makes the space awkward and you have to be careful getting out of the tub so you dont burn yourself on the heater  if its on    One last issue is that the Netfix would start to load but get stuck  for several hours  at     
417545199,This was our first time staying at an Air BNB  We definitely loved having an entire apartment to ourselves with a laundry room on site   The skyline view from the  th floor of the Chicago high rise building was spectacular  The price was phenomenal when compared to using a traditional hotel  I will say that you have to be very specific about your needs and pick a unit that will be able to accommodate  I give our stay     Stars and look forward to our next visit  Thanks for sharing your space with us during our visit to Chicago  This was our first experience not staying in a traditional hotel   Well definitely use an Air BNB in the future  Next time well know exactly what questions to ask and what to look for on a listing that will better accommodate our specific needs   I knew this was an apartment building and most buildings have tenant parking  However  with this unit you needed a permit to use the two adjacent parking lots  leaving us to have to street park  In the summer months parking blocks away probably wouldn u    t be an issue but in winter  definitely a problem  If I was the owner  I would look into a way of offering guest a  u   cguaranteed u   d spot  Even if that meant increasing the price per day   This was our first time staying at an  Air B  N B  The first thing we noticed off the back was they arent as flexible as traditional hotels  Our flight arrived early and we werent able to do early check in  Our departure flight was leaving late and we werent able to do late check out  Check In instructions were clear and precise  There was an issue with the key that was used to enter the building  The key would get stuck and it we would have to play with it for about   min before it would turn  Very annoying  We looked suspect as other tenants were trying to enter the building as well  In the Fridge  there was an opened alcoholic beverage left  The bottom bins also needed some cleaning as they both were soiled  I took photos just in case these areas were an issue once we checked out  I didnt want to be blamed for the uncleanliness  The stove oven could also use some attention   When turned on to pre heat  it smelled as if something was burning  There wasnt any problems with communication from the host   Every request that was sent was quickly responded with a  NO   Location was perfect   We were in Chicago for a funeral and the location put us very close to where we needed to be 
622756826,Great space with an even better location  Perfect for a solo or couples getaway   I have stayed in this apartment twice now and lived it both times  Love the location and it is the perfect amount of space  The microwave was dirty on the inside and had fingerprint smudges in the outside  I personally dont care but thought you should know especially with the current covid situation and the fact that you charge a cleaning fee 
415797730,Great location  Great communication  Great deal  Would definitely stay here again  Your place was great  Loved the location and such a great deal  Seriously the only issue was the hair In the shower     There was hair in the bathtub and on the shower wall 
342288657,Nice clean apartment with lake view  Apartment was nice and very clean  Convenient location  visiting family in Hyde Park  Reported issues with WIFI on Friday evening  never resolved and no return message updating me on the issue  Typically short term rentals I stay in provide coffee and basic information on the neighborhood  These would be nice personal touches that would make a better guest experience 
341719918,Great place  Close to the University where I worked for the week  Super fun place  It was a very cool spot  The heater was a little loud at times but other than that  it was a perfect fun place to stay for work 
341369692,The view and location are absolutely terrific  I took pictures of the lake view almost every day  Fascinating to see how it varied over time   The location is perfect for access to public transportation into the city  walks in Hyde Park and runs along Lake Michigan   Otherwise  the apartment is as pictured and overall met our expectations  Thanks for a great stay  We especially enjoyed the locate and the lake view  Terrific    A few things to make sure you know about      The water pressure from the shower head is much less than from the tub faucet  Adequate for a shower  but not what it should be    The rug in the living room sheds  Cant sit on it without getting covered with little white fibers       We had trouble with the TV periodically losing connection to the internet  We werent always successful getting it re established   A few hours later  it was working again  At no time did we have internet connection trouble with any other device    Thanks 
407256089,The air conditioner was confusing to control  Extremely hot upstairs but cold downstairs  The ceiling had a leak  
565709605,The place was clean and the host was communicative  However  the apartment has a VERY strong scent and it caused me to get a headache  The apartment is also much smaller than it looks in photos  The toilet didnt work very well  Also theres no color anywhere in the apartment  its completely black and white  After the sun went down it sort of felt like a prison  Not a homey environment at all  The smell was very off putting  It smelled so strong that it caused a headache  We had to put the scent sticks outside the room during our stay  Also  a bit of color would have been nice  the entire place is black and white and it felt kind of like a prison   Much smaller than the photos made it seem  
429040485,The apartment building is beautiful and the rooms are cute  So close to many shops and eateries  Great if youre a foodie like we are  The architecture is so unique as well  the elevator especially very old fashioned with sliding gate to close   You do hear slamming doors people in halls and the light from the hall under your door all night but otherwise great for budget travelers     Our apartment wasnt cleaned properly and reaching out to Zencity was pointless because  they werent management     Maybe other rooms were better  ours wasnt  The whole time we were there the light didnt work for the main room  This building was beautiful but cleanness was that to be desired  Sending photos and saying how paying extra for the cleaning charge when it was not is not right  I just got automated responses from you as well as one that said you cant do anything because youre not management of the building     Not even trying to make things right for us  Our light in the apartment also didnt work and we didnt even bother mentioning it to you because you didnt care about our other concern  I really think its funny you ask for a   star rating when you definately  did not even give any courtesy of a   star treatment  Mostly door knobs and handles there was grime  Also caked on something in the kitchen sink and stucked toilet paper on the radiator  The ceiling light fan didnt work for light  even tried changing bulbs  They didnt help when inquiring about dirtiness of the room  Just sent an automated message ignoring the issue  The price is great for being in an area so close to many restaurants  parks and shops   Its a very unique old building  nice architecture 
624303619,It was an overall nice experience 
562999205,Great location  clean  comfortable   Wifi did not work properly even after attempting to reset  Was very frustrating to not have wifi for   days while staying there     Key pad to access the room key did not work properly  Had to wait an hour to get in contact with someone    who only called me after I reached out separately to Air BnB since the direct phone to Zencity did not work  Hard to get in contact via phone initially  Though did later respond to messages  
338153352,Great building and stylish modern decor  Hi  I liked your places decor  and location wise a lot   Also the bed was comfortable  Those aspects  were actually really great   And the building is wonderful   but    the WiFi did not work   I know you said call you but it was so late each night when I needed it that I didnt and just left early so I could get work done instead   my fault  and there was no phone reception in the apt at all  making it hard to call Uber  Also  it was freezing from   pm   am  Lastly  the bathroom had handprints on the mirror and someone elses hair in the tub and on the toilet seat    Im sure that the cleanliness issue was just a matter of a quick cleanup  but whomever is doing it should make sure to look at the rooms before they leave  The toilet hair was  long  brown and clearly visible   Otherwise thank you for the stay  it was a good deal 
338150619,The place is no frills but has everything you need  The location is fantastic close to everything  including the L  Plus theres a grocery store in the building   Check in was super straightforward  I would stay here again  The living room rug and floor were kind of dusty and dirty  but kitchen and bathroom were fine  Thank you  Cannot beat this location 
721091014,As a fair warning  just look elsewhere  My rental unit was not adequately prepared though my reservation was made well in advance  The bed sheets and pillow cases were lined with all sorts of hair   short and long  I literally bought sheets to change those with because it was very unhygienic  Additionally  the bathroom has hairs  of various contributors  posted all over the walls as if it hadnt been cleaned in weeks  My biggest issue is that the listing and check in clearly states access to a key fob for use of the multiple entrances of the building  Upon checking in  this wasnt available  When I asked when it would be I was told  maybe tomorrow    This was a very unprofessional response  I never got a key fob and had to resort to screaming the building access code outside the single intercom access door in the middle of Chicago when it was    degrees outside  When I brought these issues up to Zencity and asked for financial compensation  it was blatantly ignored by their support staff  Stay else where if you value amenities like cleanliness and a functioning key  I would suggest really focusing on cleanliness and accuracy of your check in instructions  Also  ZC support representatives could be better versed in dealing with these types of issues because the support was not beneficial at all  Also make sure youre providing whats listed in your listings   I e  a key fob  I booked a unit that was to be clean and provided a key fob   I did not have this in my experience   I was provided no key fob for getting into the building though clearly listed in the listing itself and check in instructions  Stray hairs left on towels and bed sheets  Bathroom walls have not been cleaned in who knows how long as various contributors of hair are plastered and line the wall  I wouldve much rather stayed else where  Zen city lacks the ability to effectively facilitate their own guests  Will make sure to not stay with Zen City in the future and warn other renters 
624084536,Not what I expected
626824110,Great HOST   Quick responses 
626817959,Great stay
645912743,I had no overall complaints  This was a nice place to stay 
620546676,Very cute and cozy  The bed was so so comfy  The only issue was there was a really bad smell coming from the kitchen  I think it was the disposal  and I had to message host three times about it with little response  Trying to find the dumpster for garbage was a little difficult as well  But theres a Whole Foods right outside the building which was super convenient  I think I would stay here again
539083431,We were in town for a quick trip   What you see in the pictures is what you get   If youre expecting a new high rise building with a view  this is not it   But this apartment met our expectations on budget  location and communication 
671620427,There was a dog barking a few doors down that kept me up  as well as the marijuana smell in the hallway  Furniture was not secured at all 
536001150,Close proximity to campus in a nice building   Restaurants within walking distance   Check in was easy  host was responsive and the place was just as described  Thank you for letting us stay at your place   Its was quite warm  the air conditioner didnt really keep it cool  but other than that it was great 
599597725,Overall experience was great  They are still undergoing construction  so its very loud during the day  Walls are thin  so you can hear other units clearly  However  for location and price its a great place and the modern industrial look is great  I would definitely stay again  Id give guests a heads up that youre still under construction until work is completed  From new Construction
342351539,Great location and value  Host was extremely responsive  Would consider booking a stay in the future  Thank you so much for opening your home to me   the location was great and with the exception of a few bathroom issues   shower cleanliness  tub sink shower lining would definitely consider staying there again  You may also want to consider having the carpets cleaned    Thanks again and wish you a great week   pm is a late check in as my flight arrived at     am The bathroom is really in need of work   the tub had stains  the shower curtain lining was dirty  I didnt use the shower  The sink is also in need of upgrading along with the carpet in the bedroom  The house is very nice but in need of a few renovations 
334963472,Room was very clean and well put together  There was no AC unit  room was very warm our whole stay  Even after asking how to control the AC we were told the unit was taken out because of the weather changing but it was    degrees outside  The room smelled like gas from the stove even when turned off  Checking in was quite confusing trying to navigate through the building  Parking was a bit stressful  Very nice room  but a very poorly ran establishment   Wasn u    t told there wouldn u    t be air conditioning  room was very warm  Keys labeled wrong  very confusing navigating around the building  did not mention parking at all and where to park over night
334674906,I dont think they would want to hear my critique This has burned me off to Airbnb  not sure if I would use this service again   Not my idea of a luxury apartment  for the price fresh toiletries should have been provided  fresh bar of soap   body wash at least  also extra towels would have been nice   sticky surfaces in kitchen  rotten food in refrigerator  stove top   counters smeary  drain in tub not working properly  floors not vacuumed properly Lots of noise from trains  kind of a transitional neighborhood  close to El which was convenient Could have stayed in a hotel for the price  also no welcome kit when we got there  just keys on the counter  Would have liked a more user friendly coffee pot  not familiar with a French press   no instructions provided  Also opened bag of coffee in fridge  who knows how long that was there as other food was obviously spoiled 
718070461,We really enjoyed our stay here    The apartment is super comfortable  The bed is big and comfortable  the shower is hot and we were surprised about how well equipped the kitchen is    The only downside for us was parking  Because its downtown  parking is a nightmare  We asked the Zencity for help and they were very responsive each time  They tried their best to locate parking spots for us but it never quite worked out  Know that during the day only metered parking is available and at night  every street has its own set of rules  An app allows you to pay remotely  but you still have to  renew it every   hours    That said  being downtown has its benefits  as we were close to literally everything  Overall  this place is a great value  A list of the parking options available would greatly help  Each street has different rules and its so complicated to find a spot  We spent a lot of time and money trying to figure it out   The description should mention the parking options  We never figured it out  
601553814,As advertised   Great little spot Bathroom smelled a bit moldy and Smokey  Otherwise it was great 
317737903,Service was excellent
467582627,Clean  good location  on trend  but very spartan   No welcome letter  no local info   No welcome touches at all  not even a bottle of water in fridge on arrival for a third floor walk up   We certainly could have used that   If youre renting this one bring your own coffee and salt and pepper  Too pricey for what you offered   Only the most basic kitchen items  you didnt even supply salt and pepper   I expected more and while we will be back to chicago we will not be staying with you  Had issue with locking system  communication was handled by a call center  not really any location based help   Luckily  we were able to adjust batteries and get it to work   Never did find out if any maintenance staff stopped to check it out 
464417067,nice place to be schon erledigt Schr nke etwas Kosteng nstiger
464415211,It was exactly as advertised   easy check in  Thank you for the stay  It was exactly as advertised   easy check in  The shower closet to the bedroom had hairs in it  It made me question how thoroughly it was cleaned 
464391781,Nice place nice area Thanks for allowing our stay at your place space was clean
641437996,First and foremost  the view  It really added a level of luxury that without it  would make the apartment just so so  The place really felt like a penthouse with a beautiful view of Lake Michigan   The amenities were pretty much as stated in the listing  however the dishwasher does not work and can actually be a bit hazardous if you do not open it a certain way   The appliances could stand an upgrade but pretty much anything you need was supplied as far as utensils and cooking   The bedroom was hip and cool yet plain in design  There are a few pictures hanging up that add to the space but other than that the minimal furniture does the job    One important thing to note is that you can see directly into the apartments across the way  That can be a bit awkward especially when it comes to showering and sharing space with a  plus one   Im not gonna lie though  the view is so nice that a few awkward eye contacts arent going to make you want to keep the curtains closed   I would say the bathroom is the least impressive part of the apartment  Not only is the ceiling shipping due to what I can only assume is moisture from the shower  when you run the shower there is a vent in the top left hand corner that leaks and collects water as well  As someone with asthma I was concerned about mold but other than being an eyesore  its functionality was everything it needed to be   Overall  I feel like the apartment is fun  The front desk staff were very helpful and ZenCity was extremely straightforward and intuitive with the check in process  The place was beautiful however  there could be a bit more attention put into cleaning details   The bathroom was my greatest concern  An an asthmatic  it was concerning to see paint and mold flaking on the ceiling  Theres also a vent to the left of the shower head where major water forms  There are also mold spots not too far from the vent  It was a little far from Downtown but the bus system made it super easy to get around
671121167,Amazing stay in a great location of the city  Very nice place  Would recommend and will stay again  Thank you for the great stay  Fob was not working 
442122365,Very cool building  Public parking available but scarce  About    minutes to downtown with your vehicle  Please clean the bathroom tile  The crevices in the tile are black  They need a deep cleaning  The only reason being how unclean the bathroom floor tile is 
428709068,Great apartment  Spotless clean and comfortable  Decorated very nicely   Newly remodeled I think   Bathroom is a bit small with no counter space  Could have used some shelving for toiletries  etc   There is free Netflix and roku and good size TV which was a nice surprise    No TV in bedrooms   Would have liked assigned parking  Difficult to find street parking at times  and can be long walk to apartment building entrance   Next to hospital  so will have some traffic noise and sirens  Great view from  th floor  Elevators work very well and are fast   Building has lobby attendant  Building is clean  attractive and safe   Location is great and in walking distance of restaurants  etc  Property is across the street from the famous forest park   Overall  the accomadations were terrific  and I would definately recommend it and stay here again  Host  zencity   were prompt to reply when needed   Lobby attendants are very helpful too if you have any questions  Overall  I was very satisfied with the accomadations   Apartment extremely clean and comfortable  Loved the Netflix   Frequent traffic noise and sirens   but strangely I like that      bathroom quite small  As there is no counter space  would suggest a shelf  Also   I would definately work on assigned parking or parking permits for Airbnb guests   Time consuming and difficult to find available street parking  Didnt like waisting precious vacay time searching for parking   I would also suggest a directory to locate amenities  such as laundry room  workout area  pool  etc   Had to ask lobby attendant  Arrived very late at nite  Did not realize that street parking availability was quite a distance from main entrance of property  Many spaces were already taken   Did not feel safe walking late at nite  alone   in an unfamiliar area  There should be designated parking for Airbnb guests 
456455146,The apartment is clean and stocked with amenities   Hopefully once they fix the fan in the bedroom and the taps on the rads  it will be a very pleasant place to stay    The bathroom is a little small but at least its clean   Its about a         Uber to downtown    It seems like a very safe and friendly neighbourhood     Do NOT go to cafe    down the street   They have mice running around    I did have a great time in Chicago and luckily was able to spend time outside of the apartment    There were just a lot of little things that caused me to not enjoy it        The place was a cute little apartment but for the price  I think it could use a few minor upgrades   Bathroom was very small  And the shower wasn u    t the most pleasant   Hard to find parking close by to in pack the car  L There is also a gated parking area beside the building   If the gate is open  DO NOT pull in  the gate will close and there is no way of getting out until the next person comes or goes  The from lobby and elevator areas did not smell good at all   The apartment itself was fine  Didnt give me straight direct answers on my questions and didnt seem to care about my complaints About a       dollar Uber to down town  There was issues with heating cooling the fan in the bedroom was to noisy and the rads would shut off   The bathroom is very very tight  And if the rad is on  be very careful  It is so close to the toilet and shower that I burned myself on it twice 
713131467,The entire place was filthy when we arrived  Dirty in every way  Honestly the worst Airbnb experience Ive had as far as cleanliness and attention to detail goes  Very disappointed in the lack of cleanliness especially since this listed indicated it was an  enhanced clean  unit  We did appreciate the proximity to SLCH and to groceries and restaurants  We rented the unit for the purpose of me taking our youngest to her appointments over multiple days at SLCH and for a change of scenery for our family of five  The unit was much too small  but we made the most of our togetherness  One of the highlights for us was enjoying the rooftop decks  Nice views  The entire place was filthy when we arrived  Dirty in every way  Honestly the worst Airbnb experience Ive had as far as cleanliness and attention to detail goes  Very disappointed in the lack of cleanliness especially since this listed indicated it was an  enhanced clean  unit   The unit appeared much  much larger in photos   Dirty laundry under the bed  Terribly dirty floors  Every high touch surface like light switches and faucet handles and such was filthy  I know because I could see smudges and then cleaned them all with anti bacterial wipes  I was expecting extremely clean  as this unit was certified on AirBnb as  enhanced clean   It wasnt even clean  much less  enhanced  clean     Too dirty to be a great value 
164307513,This unit is very much a corporate rental as opposed to staying in someones home and rather sparsely furnished but all in all it fit the bill for a nice long weekend  Chris and team were easy to communicate with and the building has a lot of amenities and is centrally located in North Loop   Thanks again for the stay Chris  I previously mentioned the coffeepot and construction noise issues  Beyond that    It would have been nice to have some outdoor furniture  a larger bed with more pillows and perhaps a few more home good items like art  rugs  chairs  etc   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  floors and carpet 
428684836,First time using a airbnb so my husband were very excited  The apartment was easy to locate and directions to get inside were very detailed and helpful  Unfortunately when we entered the apartment I could tell it was not newly cleaned  Dust balls on the floor in the hallway and in the living room  Our sheets in the bedroom had stains on them and hair  I tried to communicate this with the host but with no response to this problem  Our stay was not what we expected and hoped for at all  Thank you for opening up your home to us  It was our first airbnb experience and unfortunately it wasnt the best  My suggestion would be to make sure the apartment is truly cleaned before allowing new guest to stay  When entering into the apartment there was dust balls on the floor and on the walls  I could tell the apartment had not been recently cleaned  There were multiple stains on our white comforter When I emailed the host about the lack of cleanliness and not having the information to wifi code  they only responded to the later part of my email which was about the wifi code  So that lets me know you read the whole email but only choose to respond to what you wanted to Parking pass  Parking was very difficult
162644475,I have to say  Chris is a first class host  and his service level is second to none  he has this down to a science  Everything is set up for convenience to guests  from the wifi   printed guidebook in the place  tv media options  snacks  and amenities in the apartment  This particular apartment is in a fantastic neighborhood  very clean  and cozy  My only issue is that Chris communicated  after  booking that I was to not mention airbnb  and tell people I was his friend  not airbnb guest  Sure enough  I had unexpected knocks on the door around  pm by   agents showing the apartment  one them incredibly rude yelling  hes an airbnb  ignore him    before I could get the words out that  Chris is my friend    Other than that unfortunate event  the place is great  but it left for a very sour evening  Rent from Chris   hes truly a great host  I had a couple unscheduled visits from agents showing your apartment around  pm on Thursday night  One of them was incredibly rude  and repeatedly yelled  hes an airbnb  ignore him   This was pretty shocking  as you can imagine  You should probably divulge this information in your listing prior to booking  instead of in your notes after guests have booked   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  listing description  Additional comments   u   cApparently  airbnb is not allowed in building u   d    airbnb not being allowed was communicated  after  booking 
153308629,Great location and Chris was very helpful Hi Chris  here are some of the issues i encountered   smell in bathroom  no towel rack  leaky taps shower and toilet only flushing sometimes  lots of noises from all sides from neighbours  nothing to cover windows  very hot and aircon not able to cope   could not turn off very noisy old aircon   generic chicago guide provided   no local places guide
710283398,Its not super fancy  however it is a great price for the area   The photos werent of that Appartment but instead of a similar Appartment   You can tell by comparing the layout   The door was left wide open to the Appartment   It was odd and made us worried someone might be hiding inside  The floors were not clean and sticky in some areas   The mattress cover had a burn hole in it   The tv in the main room wasnt level   And it seemed like the leather chair in the main room was bent and hanging on for dear life  It seemed like it was going to be a nicer part of town however some of the neighbors were sketchy   The people in the room across the hall kept throwing parties and arguing late in too the night   The last two nights in particular we were woken up by a screaming match they were having at around    am   Both times it lasted until a little before noon which then lead to loud make up sex  It was a fair price for what we got   We knew going in it was way cheaper then what were planning on spending   So despite there being some issues  it should be expected with the low price tag 
137480814,The apartment was cute and the host was very nice  The only thing Id warn anybody about is how loud it is in there  Although I know Chicago is a city and there will always be noise  the draft and sounds that came through the windows was a little much and made it hard to sleep    Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  noise   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower  bathroom 
137461271,Space and just steps from metro station    Nothing more to say  this is the place to be in downtown Chicago    Thank you very much for the nice stay  Your place is a wonderful as described  Lots of space and confort 
620675807,The place was wonderful Ive stayed in a few of your places and I like them  I know things happen sometimes so not being able to checkin on time wasnt a deal breaker I dont know what the actual issue was but the key  to get into the stay wasnt with security it didnt get there until an hour later  Tub and inside the oven needed some extra attention
428231250,Very nice location and great communication throughout my stay  Whomever stayed previous was celebrating and had a party as party favors were still on the floor when I check in  They must have broken glass as well which was no cleaned up properly and I end up cutting my foot  There was a glass with something left in it in the shower and the towel rack fell off the wall slicing the top of my foot 
712686677,Love the location 
554117096,Great location   clean   very nice building and very well kept apartment   You are only allowed one set of keys and will not be able to leave your bags anywhere after you check out at   am   To offer just one set of keys to us was inconvenient   At least you should have two set of keys for the guests   Also to offer a place to leave baggage so as to make it possible for the guests to take advantage of free time until they have to leave for the airport would be very helpful and improve ratings    The couch could not be used as a bed 
563349164,My friends and I  total of    had a good time at this Airbnb  It was close to a few of good restaurants and bars  The home was clean and cute  All necessities were included such as plates  cups  towels  etc  we appreciate you guys hosting  Thanks  Hello  We had a good time staying at your home  However  the thermostat battery was low and we were unable to make changes the temperature due to the screen not working  We were freezing at night  Please check the battery before stays    Also  I felt as though the responses to us were a little slow    Thank you for the recommendation for the storage places around the city  That came in handy 
546363221,This place is excellent  Its clean and the bed is very comfortable  The building overlooks forest park which has great museums and trails to run walk  I would highly recommend  The only reason I did not give this place   stars is because of an unfortunate interaction with the host while I was checking out  My check out time was   pm  The host showed up at       am telling me I needed to leave because my check out time was   am I told him my check out time was  pm and he told me I was wrong without inquiring further  I then had minutes to scramble to rearrange my day  On my way out I showed the host the email that stated my check out time was   PM  The host gave an insincere apology and told me that if I wanted I could wait to see what he could do  At that point it was too late and I left  The email I received stated the check out was at  pm  At       am the host was knocking at my door telling me I had to leave  I told the host my check out was at   PM  Instead of inquiring further  the host told me I was wrong and needed to leave  I was left to scramble to rearrange my day  After re working my whole schedule I showed the host the email  He gave an insincere apology and told me I could wait if I wanted to see what he could do  At that point it was too late  Its a shame that interaction happened being that everything else about the place was excellent  Please make sure you give correct check out times  It was really inconvenient to have to change my whole day in a matter of minutes   The email I received stated the check out time was at  pm  At       am the host was knocking at my door telling me I had to leave  I told the host my check out was at   PM  Instead of inquiring further  the host told me I was wrong and needed to leave  I was left to scramble to rearrange my day  After re working my whole schedule I showed the host the email which showed my check out time to be   PM  He gave an insincere apology and told me I could wait if I wanted to see what he could do  At that point it was too late  It u    s a shame that interaction happened being that everything else about the place was excellent  
538434735,Not as great as other reviews or photos make it out to be  keep expectations low on this  Wasnt cleaned very carefully  which makes the cleaning fee applied a little shady  Dont try to park nearby either  its a headache  Photo made it seem like better quality than it was  Smelled like leftover cooking smell  main carpet area where bed is did not seem vacuumed Cleaning fee should guarantee the place is spotless
538414983,I have stayed at AirBnb locations across the globe and this is one of the worst experiences I have had  Terrible check in on an unlit street  extremely dirty  hair everywhere  All over the sheets pillows  towels  shower  sink   and loud  The walls are paper thin overlooking a train station and but the biggest issue is the other tenants   The instructions guide you up   flights of stairs  NEVER MIND there is an elevator  Accesible from the side entrance or if you walk to the  st floor from the entrance they instruct you to use   Worst check in experience Ive ever had  Dark unlit street a block away from the actual location of the airbnb  The code given for the lockbox did  not work  Had to get a code for a backup lockbox  DARK CURLY HAIR EVERYWHERE  On the sheets blankets  On the towels  All over the shower and sink  Code given for lock box did not work  called  phone number provided was answering machine  left a message no one called back  messaged on Airbnb app finally got a message back  Good neighborhood but literally on the train tracks  Very noisy 
615300925,Todo bien  Solo espero arreglen la calefacci n que estuvo fr o pero todo lo dem s excelente  Me gusto mucho el apartamento la ubicaci n solo que estaba muy fr o el departamento no servia la calefacci n
711333524,Great location and quick to respond 
613664290,I had a very good time here  it wasnt perfect  yet it was very good  Below are some of the pros and cons I found  Even amidst the cons  I would stay here again  without a question    Pros   Location  this is a great spot in Lafayette park  it is very close to nearby restaurants and a Coffee shop if you want to walk  I visited Bellwether  Polite Society  Planters House and Park Ave  Coffee all via walking  Likewise  close to downtown  a short uber ride away from stadiums and Washington Ave    Overall Value  the nightly rate I paid made this place totally worth it     Secure Parking    This is a rare find  parking in STL City is often precarious as you have to totally empty out your car  Not so here  was so nice to have the gated lot     Recently built out interior from an old factory  its nice and new on the inside    Cons   The Floors were simply not clean    Window shades are more like sun shades and wont keep light out at night     Walls are thin  can hear neighbors and can hear Televisions on from the Hallway    The listing implied the Roof Deck was open  it was under construction while I was there  it was not yet complete     One of the most concerning things I experienced was a leak in my unit during my stay  It rained on the last night and was leaking from the ceiling down to the floor  I chalk this up to the new construction  it wasnt the worst thing in the world  but kind of annoying  I was very thankful this was not in the bedroom   The listing indicated there was a roof deck available  the roof was under construction during my visit and was not accessible   The place appeared to be generally clean upon arrival  Once I was there for a bit  I noticed the floors were very dirty  as though they hadnt been properly swept and mopped  the coffee table was covered in a layer of dust and the bathroom showed dirt not he dark gray tile  I inquired about the roof deck before arriving  No response was given  The question was responded to only when I reached out to the hose about something else 
622912672,Nice and Neat    Tv was crooked on the wall on arrival  just mention it or just do a quick fix for next person   thanks for the stay 
586348934,Clean  stylish apartment  There was street parking available for us     mi walk away  so no need to pay for parking if you dont want  Upon first arrival  you can temporarily park outside the front door of the apt complex   Room was uncomfortably warm even in winter  but there is an air conditioning unit you can control or you can open the window if you dont mind the ambulances  hospital next door   Thanks for being a great host  We enjoyed our stay in St  Louis   Note  checkout process outdated in notes  Lock box provided way to leave key vs  leave key on table   Incorrect WiFi info on chalkboard   WiFi info was incorrect  but contacted Zencity and they responded with alternatives   Room temperature was uncomfortably warm  It was too noisy to open window overnight  Had air conditioning on constantly throughout the night 
585345392,Our Zencity apartment had obviously had recent construction inside and no one had cleaned up after or even bothered to put a plate over the light switch or the finish back up around the door   We also found crumbs under the couch cushion as well as a condom wrapper and small trash under the sofa and bed  They offered to clean up when we complained but I think the apartment should have been ready BEFORE we arrived  Make sure to have apartments fully ready before future guests come   We will not be staying with Zencity again  There had been some construction inside the apartment and no one cleaned up afterwards   Also crumbs and a condom wrapper under the sofa cushions   When I complained Zencity offered to come clean but I think this should have been done before we arrived    times my messages were not answered or answered late  Cleanliness and it was obvious they had rushed to open the place   Hallways a mess and unfinished 
638500601,Tbh it really could have been better  Im sorry about the sheets  My period came unexpectedly and I didnt know what to do  Otherwise cleaning walls needs done swept and mopped properly and the kitchen cabinets needed washed bad  We arrived early which was on us but even waiting   hours and we were told that it would be ready at   pm they still hadnt came in to clean anything  The walls in the bedroom were dirty  The bathroom looked clean but the tub was gross and was stopped up so when you shower your standing in water  The floors need scrubbed and the cabinets were absolutely nasty on the outside  There were no pot holders there werent any knives to properly cut things  I asked about early check in was ok we couldnt but the for it to not be ready at check in time was ridiculous 
598187099,This place did the job for our short stay  Decent  cute apartment with a good location  Parking would be the only downfall  in that you must find street parking or park in a nearby parking garage that is        day   however  this information from provided in the listing and we were aware of it when booking  Overall  the check in was very easy  even arriving late at night like we did  The door staff was helpful  The apartment was cutely decorated and was a quiet place to stay  The carpet was dirty throughout the apartment 
427401268,Clean apartment  free wifi   On  th floor  so make sure you can do the stairs   Parking is not available  but host will direct you to a good ap to make a parking reservation nearby  expect Chicago prices for parking though   Apartment is within walking distance of several restaurants and shops   Building seemed pretty quiet  respectful neighbors  I realize we gave you super short notice with our reservation   Thanks for responding quickly to accept our request   Please check the intercom issue though  felt kind of ridiculous yelling into the box   House was cute  Secured entrance had an intercom system to get admittance   We called about   times and the person answering was never able to hear us and ended up hanging up   We were told when reporting the issue that we needed to talk louder  but we were already pretty much yelling into the box   Luckily a resident of the building came in and let us in   In hosts defense  I did make the reservation just   hours before arrival  so really didnt give them much warning  Host answered questions pretty quickly and was able to direct us to a good ap for parking nearby   Communication directly in the building to get in was not good  Wicker Park  near shops and several restaurants   Parking is a bit of a challenge though   Found a place about   blocks away for     for    hours that we reserved on an ap 
623160915,Other than trying to get into the building it was fine  The instructions we were sent werent so clear  Exceptionally clean place and very modern 
623090173,Overall  I enjoyed my stay 
249088890,Good location and communication  nice and clean place  We would have loved to have a late check out  specially when the calendar was open for that day  we checked it in the app   The apartment  doesnt have tableware for   people  just for    and it is missing basic kitchen stuff like a wine opener 
202281471,Great place to stay  Please have garbage bags for your next guests  Other then that it was a great stay thanks Brian   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities

603655044,Floors were a bit dirty but other than that  great space  Great location and value  Safe parking  Bed was super comfy but pillows too high for my liking  props your neck up too much so I was misaligned and feeling it the next morning   Thank you for hosting us  Overall it was a really cool space  I did the dishes and loaded them in the washer to dry  And put our used towels in the washer  Didnt know what youd prefer  Would recommend adding  through the black door  and or maybe a little video  Looking through the black door  it just looks like the workout room  Not additional doors  Floors were dirty  Not just fuzz but crumbs and dirt And such 
338854492,Brians place was very stylish   clean  Truly a great value 
619147119,It was an amazing area to stay in  The host were also very responsive  It was a lot bigger then it looked in the pictures 
602699064,Great place   Clean and beautiful but paying for parking sucks daily Super nice    Thank you for a great stay  I would say paying for parking every day sucks Great location but parking sucks    You have to pay for parking every day and it sucks 
599977638,Cons        for cleanliness    Couch is extremely uncomfortable    Heaters make odd noises at all hours of the night  I know its an older building with older heaters     We experienced a fire alarm one night around      pm  Apparently this happens all the time  Be aware in case anyone from the hospital post op will be staying as well    Floating night stand and towel rack in bathroom were are either falling from the wall to completely missing  Maintenance entered our room even after we were told they would not    No TVs in the bedrooms     Key to apartment does not work well or sometimes at all   Pros   Great communication from Zencity   Great location to local shots and restaurants    Trendy design with updated look      minute walk to secure parking garage    Helpful Montclair  name of the building apartments  staff    Comfortable beds  Cons        for cleanliness    Couch is extremely uncomfortable    Heaters make odd noises at all hours of the night  I know its an older building with older heaters     We experienced a fire alarm one night around      pm  Apparently this happens all the time  Be aware in case anyone from the hospital post op will be staying as well    Floating night stand and towel rack in bathroom were are either falling from the wall to completely missing  Maintenance entered our room even after we were told they would not    No TVs in the bedrooms     Key to apartment does not work well or sometimes at all   Pros   Great communication from Zencity   Great location to local shots and restaurants    Trendy design with updated look      minute walk to secure parking garage    Helpful Montclair  name of the building apartments  staff    Comfortable beds 
626241743,This place is great for location and housing  They are very responsive and prompt with requests if any  This place is great  The cleaning is a tad bit unsanitary 
625986401,Whatever you guy think about renting this apartment DONT  You will regret it I promise you the pictures are misleading they have a washer dryer in the bedroom the room is small and it doesnt even work right   The kitchen is dirty as well   dishes   cups   dirty frying pans mouses running around the apartment  my son is   years old and he was scared to come out of the bedroom  spiders everywhere with spiderweb all around the place and the WiFi wasnt working   I wrote all of this to the host and he never got back to me   I was in   other apartments from Airbnb and never had a issue but lets put it like this I felt like was stuck in a hell hole for    days  Very bad experience    Very bad experience you could of at least got back to me about the mouse and WiFi my son was scared to come out of the bedroom  Washer and dryer was in the bedroom     cups   dishes   very dirty frying pans    The back bathroom no cold water only very hot burning water   The walls were very dirty I was very disappointed in the apartment   In my opinion Airbnb shouldn u    t not have this apartment on your website    There was spiders everywhere and most importantly there was mouses running around    the bathroom were filthy and lets just say with everything going on these days everything should of been much cleaner   I rented the places for    days and  I felt like I was stuck in a hell hole worst experience in my life  I texted   times about the mouses and there was no WiFi in the house and he never got back to me The place had to be cleaner and if hes doesnt have Certain stuff like in the kitchen dont say you have them   Say that the WASHER  DRYER ARE IN THE BEDROOM      
588417879,Great place Thanks so much  We really enjoyed our stay  We will book again  Have a great     
626654821,Nice place to stay  walking distance to many fun places  The place wasnt sparkly clean  The key fob I had to retrieve from the parking garage didnt let me back into the building  I had to wait for someone to let me in  Generally the cleaning could have been better   very strong smoking odor  I had to have the door open  hair in the shower drain  vacuuming hadnt been done well 
413978739,This is a great location and a very nice unit    We stayed there in Feb      and were very pleased   In February      we were disappointed on two counts     the unit was not cleaned when we arrived    once we reached the host  they responded promptly and had the unit cleaned within    minutes   However the prior guests  or someone  had smoked a lot of pot in the unit and the usual cleaning did not get rid of the very strong smell   The smell faded slowly  but not completely  over our three night stay  and certainly robbed some of the pleasure of staying in the otherwise very nice unit   Also  the hot water pressure is bit on the weak side    adequate  but not great if you really like your shower   Towels are very nice however   Other pluses are excellent internet and TV options   lots of closet space  and generally well equipped and clean    Because of the location and overall quality  we would definitely stay in this unit again    Zen City did a good ob responding to the problems we reported    though prevention is always preferred over cure  Only one set of keys provided   Would have been nice to have   sets  More hangers for clothes   Better hot water pressure   New shower head     Spare light bulbs so we could change when burned out    Dish drying rack for when we washed dishes  We corresponded about this   The unit had not been cleaned and reeked of marijuana   You did arrange for a prompt cleaning  but the smell persisted for days  it faded over the course of our stay  but each time we entered the unit we had a fresh  hit    Initially it took a bit of doing to get the unit cleaned  Cleaned upon arrival   No marijuana smell   Better hot water pressure   Spare light bulbs to replace the one burned out in the bathroom   More clothing hangers 
623442055,Stylish space  Quick responses from host  Would stay here again  The code to enter the building was not working 
623176654,Small space but everything you need and close to everything in Westport  Would not recommend if you like to sleep in  it is very bright in the morning  There should be a higher standard of cleanliness  Dishes in the dishwasher  trash in the corner by the bed  and stain on the comforter  Higher standard of cleanliness 
266733455,We truly needed a place to sleep and beds the beds were large and comfortable  Hey Brian  Thanks for letting us stay the single night  Your kitchen chairs really need replacing      they are completely unusable 
631245606,Pretty place  Only thing was the amount of hair hanging from the side of the shower in bedroom A  so just take a look in the showers  Other than that the place was great 
623543599,They are always great  We love zencity You guys are always great thanks for having us
627710445,Its a cool place The key pad to get in the front door didnt work  When i called to ask the front desk to buzz me in the lady gave me an attitude  I didnt like that  It took me almost    minutes just to check in  I was told that i broke something that was already broke when i got there and i was told that i threw a party which i didnt 
614525793,Accommodations were exactly what our group of six needed  one couple and four singles   Location is great  lots of great bars  restaurants  coffee shops  etc within walking distance  Water pressure in the shower is lacking    that aside  clean place and communicative host  Hey  We really enjoyed our stay  Its a great location  and the accommodations in general were exactly what our group needed  Two minor complaints     the unit  particularly towards the back kitchen area  smelled strongly of natural gas  and    the water pressure in the shower is really lacking  I realize there probably isnt much you can do about the latter  but it might be an item to warn your guests about  Regardless  thanks much for hosting us 
669634973,Nice place  but could use some touch up paint  Kitchen cabinets are somewhat sticky  Could use some degreasing  Thanks for the stay  Place could use paint touch up and cabinets some degreasing  Could use a paint job throughout  Kitchen cabinets are sticky and could use a good degreasing  Touch ups mentioned above
669617523,Beautiful view  The neighbors were a  pain in the butt   The host was responsive and polite  Thank you for being a great host 
622475550,For the price this place is a steal  The location was absolutely perfect  Inside and outside is beautiful  Only  complaint  was a smell in the kitchen from a plumbing issue with dishwasher and garbage disposal  Everything else was perfect  Dishwasher old water sitting for a week or longer was nasty  Garbage disposal smelled  Think its just a plumbing issue  We loved everything else 
607799263,Pretty good place  Key fob was missing  The shower floor was a bit dirty 
607360383,Nice apartment in a good location with a helpful front desk  Thanks for your thorough check in instructions  responsiveness during our stay  and for allowing us to checkout a bit later than   am  it was much appreciated    You may want to replace the lighter in your apartment because it no longer works  Also  providing a candle may be useful for future guests as well  Thanks again   The apartment was listed as non smoking   The apartment smelled a bit smokey for the duration of our stay but was otherwise very clean 
649127735,Great apt  Nicely updated  Great location  Nice bed  Not great view from this unit  but across street from Forst Park  Staff very professional  prompt and helpful      stars only because tub did not drain properly   something Im sure ZenCity will fix  Highly recommend  Thanks  We had a great stay  Your WiFi seems to be not working  just FYI Tub drain backed up during shower  Sink also backed up immediately 
616021376,Good location  Within walking distance to some local restaurants  Street parking was challenging in the evening  We used Lyft Uber to get downtown  The location was great and space as good   I sent some suggestions in a previous message  The shower off the kitchen needs some attention   No space to put your luggage   clothes  One bedroom without a bar in the closet so unable to hang clothes 
606674999,Clean  nice area and host responsive Our stay was great despite the parking situation  I looked at the signs and they were still not clear  Another guest mentioned finding free parking in their review so maybe providing that info to future guests might be helpful  Details about parking were not fully clear and vehicle was towed and another ticketed 
630785335,Nice space
492806194,Slawiks house is a very nice house  It is an older house  but the floors and kitchen look to have been updated  We didnt end up using the kitchen  but it looked nice  The beds were comfortable  I tried sleeping in the loft the first night  It was okay comfort wise  but I ended up electing to sleep on the couch as the entryway to the loft is a bit small for my body structure   I have broader shoulders and have to crawl in   The bathrooms looked very nice  The only thing that wasnt the greatest thing was the shower curtains  The downstairs bathroom did not have shower curtains and the upstairs bathroom shower curtains could use some love  Other then the shower curtains  the house is clean and lovely  Everything you see in the photos is exactly what you get  Thank you for letting us into your home   The down stairs bathroom did not have any curtains to take a shower  The upstairs bathroom shower curtains could have been in better shape  
666448604,The place is beautiful  spacious  and well located  We had some issues connecting to the WiFi but Zencity was very responsive  please do get the WiFi checked out   it was working on the Tv but impossible for us to get any of our devices connected 
666357015,Had some issues with the door code for check in but it was resolved in a timely manner and the rest of the stay was pleasant
610964685,First poor review Ive ever written  The place was accurately described in regards to location and how to get to the apartment  but I cannot help but be disgusted by the fact that the shower had miniature soaps that had already been opened up  the toilet was full of somebody elses pubic hair  and there is no working WiFi in this apartment as advertised   No WIFI  OPENED soap 
417907935,Its a decent spot
623834577,Loved our stay and the location  We even extended our reservation  beautifully styled and awesome amenities  Definitely would book again  I would double check on the cleaning a bit more but otherwise the place was fairly clean and nicely styled There was potatoes left in the oven and some kind of sauce splattered on the wall
711318534,Nice location  clean place  some minor damages in the unit not included in the pictures  Door kept breaking and repair man had to come   times to fix  Water pressure went away half way through  Besides these minor issues  good stay with a nice apartment set up
601481898,The apartment was not clean  The bed sheets had multiple long strands everywhere and the sheets were wrinkled as if somebody had just slept in it  Somebody pooped and left it there so the bathroom smelled  There were multiple stains on the couch and the sink was not clean either  The host still has not responded for my request for a refund a week later  We had to find another hotel room at      am  This will be my last time using Air bnb as when you do request a refund  they dont allow you to request the full amount  I would like a complete refund please  The bed sheets were not clean  They had multiple strands of long hair and were all wrinkled as if somebody had just slept in them  Somebody pooped in the toilet and didnt flush it so the bathroom smelled  The couch had multiple white stains and the kitchen sink was not clean either  I called the host when we arrived to let them know and I sent a message to her my money back and have not received a response 
718071116,The place is great  However  there are some cracks by the  AC  thats inserted inside the window and its NOT properly insulated caulked    if you have a tag along sleeping on the couch   and do decide to come to Chicago when its    F THEY WILL FREEEEEZE at night  Also  and Im assuming through that same opening  thats where the  inch cockroach that we had to chase came in through  Otherwise  the place is really clean  well decorated  and the host responds to any concerns almost immediately   would do it again 
721568611,We enjoyed the unit  building and location   However  the unit listing stated the amenities that were with the unit  and those were not provided  Even after the Zen City host said they would be provided  they were not and basic amenities were not provided until late on the third and last day we were there  As such  the description listing cannot be relied upon  What any of us want from a short getaway is to be able to spend time with our family  not needing to go to the drug store to get basic items the unit was described to have and needing to look at our phone repeatedly through the weekend to message and respond to the host  Very troubling that your last host told me the tiny refund he gave expired after a few hours because he didnt want to babysit me  What in the world does that mean   The listing stated the basic amenities are provided including the bathroom amenities  However  there were none  No bath soap even  no shampoo   n nI messaged the Zen City host who said she will send it over so we didn u    t go to a drug store to buy   However  no amenities were provided even the next day  not even bath soap  The new Zen City the next day told me he didn u    t want to babysit us  What in the world does that mean   A condescending and passive aggressive young man  he on the one hand would say rude things then thank us for our patience  Bath soap arrived late afternoon on the third and last day   There are so many beautiful options in Chicago  go for another host   Zen City responded to our messages but did not resolve what should have been a basic issue  with one of the hosts being condescending  While it was during the holidays  this should be expected as a time of increased use of airbnb units  The listing stated the amenities that would be provided and they were not provided  nor were they provided until late our last day   This wasted time and took time away from the respite we needed   Key FOB to common areas did not work so we couldnt access   it was the last night so it wasnt worth the time to try to address given the time already expended with Zen City just to get bath soap 
624041185,The place was amazing   It is very close to downtown and other tourist spots  The key pad to made it a little difficult for us to check in but great communication with the host saved the day  Other than that the place was neat  clean  and very stylist would recommend       The place was amazing   Only think I would tweak is the key pad to make it a little easier for guest to check in and also have working WiFi   Other than that the place was neat  clean  and very stylist   Great communication as well   The key pad was a little bit tedious to use 
619900827,Last minute booking and quick response
610511208,This is a great place to stay in the Lincoln Park area  The location is near so many things to do  I was able to walk to restaurants  stores and the movie theater    The place was really clean  The light that comes in is outstanding  I really enjoyed that there was a washer and dryer in the unit   There is a Greek restaurant under the place that has great food  I ate there twice   The only thing to note is that it gets a bit noisy with the footsteps from above and the restaurant underneath  It didnt really affect my stay in any way though  Thank you for letting me stay in your space  It is a great location  I enjoyed how open and bright the place was  It was a bit noisier than I expected but it didnt really affect my stay much   Thanks again  
631699976,Great stay  Great stay  
614249615,The actual apartment itself is great   very well designed  clean  and had all of the amenities  In terms of location  it is situated in a cute area with some restaurants and a coffee shop just up the street  Attractions were definitely a drive away but only     mins  The only bad thing is that there was very loud construction going on  am  pm in the room above us  and Zencity was unwilling to refund any of our stay  It may be something you inquire about before booking  Hi   there was incredibly loud construction  am  pm during our stay  I know you may not have been able to control it  but you can control compensating your guests who were essentially unable to be in the apartment during the day  Thankfully sightseeing took us out of the apartment a lot  But when we came back to rest or were woken up by power saws and hammering  it was unpleasant  Had to message multiple times about an issue 
618084014,If you dont mind hearing every single passing car and loud fire trucks w sirens on keeping you up all night then perhaps this is the place for you  I didnt get any sleep staying at this place   Additionally  it seems that there are two people working at zencity that didnt communicate  so between that and slow responding in general  it wasnt a great stay  My girlfriend and I were confined to a full sized bed      However  the     grand apartments are otherwise extremely luxurious and very clean  Right next to a fire station  THE FIRE TRUCKS KEPT US UP ALL NIGHT    Extremely high cleaning fee of    
580386393,Great location  Good for the price 
592213464,Location was convenient  apartment was furnished well for a weekend stay  however   if you are staying here during the winter either the heat doesnt work or was broken during my stay   uncomfortably cold in the apartment the whole time at      My only issues were the excessive crumbs etc in living room   kitchen and then no response on the heat  Either the heat was broken or doesnt work   if it doesnt work it would be nice to know that before staying there in the winter   it was snowing during my stay and very cold  Making the inside temperature of the apartment very uncomfortable at      There were a lot of crumbs on the rug in the living room  as well as the kitchen floor   the rest of the air b b was clean Host was quick to respond at the beginning  but when I asked about how to use the thermostat I never got a response  It was     in the apartment 
579793080,The room was set in a high rise apartment building  Amenities were the best perk of this place  Sauna  steam room  and great gym  The room itself however felt somewhat soulless and felt like I was staying in a vacant model unit  Some nice to haves would have been toothpaste  laundry detergent  and filtered water   Overall  I was satisfied with my stay though 
606670582,Upon arrival there was a pile of dirty sheets on the living room floor and the TV and all lights were on  After a   hour flight with a toddler  this was the last think we expected  Zencity simply forgot to clean the place  When we called  no apology was given and we had to grab sheets from another unit and do laundry of some of the existing sheets  Nobody came for an exceptional cleaning  the cleaner came the next day for a mediocre cleaning job  and we had to shower in dirty bathrooms  hairs on the floors  in bathtubs and toilets   Quite unfortunate as the place is nicely located with a great view  Also  no reply was received regarding our request on reimbursement of the cleaning aand service fees  As a result  I do not recommend Zencitys services  Unfortunately we cannot say we enjoyed our stay and will not be able to recommend your services to friends   In the kitchen many utensils were missing and not enough for   adults   Nobody available to come and clean on the evening of our arrival  Upon arrival we quickly notices the whole place had not been cleaned  Partial apologies or reimbursement of cleaning fees  Being sensitive to our reimbursement request on the cleaning fee and service fee 
609248273,This is a nice unit   Zencity staff were quick to respond  polite  cheerful and helpful     However  I had two issues   The pictures arent pictures of the actual unit   There was a disclaimer in the photos  but the disclaimer says the actual unit is close to the one pictured   The photos show an end unit with five windows   The actual apartment is an interior unit and has a door to a balcony and one window   The pictures show a sweeping view from at least one window   The actual unit has a view of the building across the street   I have urged Zencity to take and post actual photos and trust they will     I had no difficulty getting into the unit the first time  but when I returned ten minutes later with the rest of my stuff I could not get in   It took    minutes  several phone calls  and required downloading an app   After that  entry was easy   It wasnt a good first impression   Despite the two significant issues  the unit is nice   Zencity staff work hard to make the experience  a good one   I would definitely rent from Zencity again   I would  however  insist in seeing photos of the actual unit  Having photos of a much nicer unit made the actual unit fall well short of my expectations   Its a nice unit  but not as nice as the one in the photos     I notice on your website that you have    units in Kansas City   Eight of them have pictures of a different unit and a disclaimer   Six others had the same pictures without a disclaimer and two others had the same pictures without a disclaimer   I dont think thats a good business practice   Take photos of the actual units   The difficulty getting back into the unit with the rest of my stuff was a bad way to make a first impression   Several small things    there were no filters for the coffee maker   There were four small tubes of soap  shampoo  conditioner and body lotion   All four were in the shower   Three had been opened and one   the soap   was empty   Photos were of a different apartment with many more windows and better views   They had a disclaimer  but I assumed the photos were of an identical unit just furnished differently   The photos were of an end unit with five windows   The actual unit had two   Instead of a light filled space  the apartment was a bit of a cave   That said  its a nice unit   It just pales in comparison to the one in the photos and was not what I expected   First entry went well   Second entry took    minutes  several phone calls and required downloading an app  Its a nice unit  but the unit in the pictures is a whole lot nicer 
706971909,I love the apartment  the floor plan is great  it is spacious and confortable  the location is fantastic  All linens were perfectly clean and the bed is very confortable  you also have a lot of closet space to unpack  However  the place needs maintenance  you can tell it has been used a lot  Nothing to prevent you from a great stay   so I will be back  I love the apartment  the floor plan is great  it is spacious and confortable  the location is fantastic so I will be back  Just to help  not in a negative way  the place needs maintenance  new stove pans  blinds  fix closet door and fuse box door  tighten hook  replace vanity in bathroom and shower bar  Thank you   All blinds are broken  hallway closet door comes off the wall and so does the fuse box door  A hallway hook needs tightening   Stove needs new pans  the are so dirty they cannot be cleaned anymore  Bathroom vanity is rusted and dirty inside  I would not put anything in it and shower curtain bar is rusted  Bedroom closet was dusty 
517639619,The place is good  Check in and out is easy  It would be nice if there is a dining table for this   beds apt 
722383215,Overall this was not somewhere that I would rent again  I did see that this property management company has other properties that Im sure are nice but this one is not one of them  The master bedroom bathroom toilet did not work and maintenance never came to fix it  Even though it was a very low cost an easy repair  The couch in the living room was not the one pictured and the couch in the apartment was unstable and did not feel comfortable at all   And the temperature in the apartment was very hard to keep consistent  I asked for a small refund because of the issue in the master bedroom bathroom  The repair to the toilet was an extremely easy one and it didnt happen  The fact that I ended up having to use the bathroom in the other room was an inconvenience and a disappointment to me as a new visitor to St  Louis  And the couch in the living room was unstable and not the one pictured  I had issues with the keypad on the apt front door  It was a timely process to enter the apt  The bathroom in the master bedroom had a toilet that did not work and maintenance did not come to fix it  Even though it was an extremely easy and low cost to repair 
721600895,My girlfriend and I booked this space for NYE and our   year anniversary  We loved the location and amour of space we had  Although  for the price we payed we felt that the place should be spotless   As for the noise  its not bad and is expected when youre a block away from Washington Avenue  If you arent used to that I say get some ear plugs   Overall  it was nice but I expected more for the price we payed  Thank you for the stay  you were a great host  The location was great and very spacious  Although  I think you might want to inspect the space after it is cleaned by what Im guessing is a  rd party service  The countertop  bath shower  bathroom kitchen sink were all dirty  As well as the floor itself  If you walked around without socks your feet would be covered in black dirt  This was our only issue and we wanted to let you know about it  Thank you
620941313,Check in code was incorrect but got a very quick response from management to fix the issue  I always stay here when I come to STL and will continue  My check in code was incorrect  Check in code was incorrect There were a lot of hairs in the bathroom that werent mine
415862335,Very neat   clean space with great amenities like Netflix  The location is also great  with some restaurants and a Walgreens within walking distance  Overall  was a pleasant stay  Just one thing I would point out is that the door was a little difficult to lock and unlock 
669104292,Super cute and comfortable space  Also in a great location  in walking distance to a lot of restaurants and shops  The space was super cute and comfortable  The only suggestion I have is that the bathroom could have been cleaned a bit better 
618808466,Good for large group of people  Beds were comfy  Tha is for the stay  Was the perfect spot for our event  Never responded about wifi problems  Little pricey for not having a stocked kitchen with utensils and all 
610612690,Great place to stay  super close to the down town action  The only thing is that the first bedroom when you walk in has a large window that looks into the apartment  the only source of natural light for that room  and there are no blinds or curtains  So everyone in the kitchen can see into your room haha The place was great  But I would for sure add some curtains or something for the bedroom you can see into from the kitchen  Thanks   The second bedroom had no curtains or blinds so if you are in the kitchen you can see right into the bedroom   A towel hook had fallen off and was lying on the floor with paint and drywall  before we got there  there were large scuffs on the walls 
717425038,The apartment was ok  but not my favorite  There was no soap or shampoo and when I reached out  they promised to send someone with some but never did    There were some visible spots that had been missed in cleaning  in the shower  a carpet that wasnt vacuumed  that werent a big deal  but made me wonder what things I couldnt see considering were in a pandemic   The neighborhood is nice and very safe  but the apartment is at the corner of the floor  right next to the stair doors  which slam  Neighbors  and their dogs  can get pretty loud   No soap or shampoo  Directions to get to the elevator were incorrect  need to go down the stairs  not up them in order to get to the elevator
615812141,First impression is great  Great location  description is accurate  We had to buy earplugs to sleep  Hope you get the master bedroom light figured out   Might add another chair or couch in the living room  It appears responses only happen during the week  not weekends  Getting a nights rest  We had to purchase earplugs for all of us 
623925371,Was a great experience  Is worth the stay  The roof access wasnt available which was unfortunate  It did smell like we discussed but overall good 
620554058,Great location nice building Thank you for hosting us in this time of unknown  Apartment was mostly clean except oven was smoking  I believe there is caked on grease that causes the oven to smoke when its turned on  Bath tub also was coming apartment 
709646175,Zencity runs many places in the Central West area   unfortunately  this ends up meaning the level of care doesnt always match the expectation the photos give off    Some Basics were missing  sink catcher missing  no garbage disposal   Trashcan was broken  also the radiator woke me up every morning at  am with very loud noises it made  The level of comfort of this AirBnB is low  ZenCity needs to step it up and stop skimping on small touches that make the difference in stay  you need to add more Basics to the place  sink catcher  Trashcan is broken  also the radiator woke me up every morning at  am with very loud noises it made 
619426862,Excellent space Just had a musty smell
619169087,Great location in Lincoln Park  Would stay here again with friends for a fun going out weekend in Chicago   Be aware its over a bar so can be loud at night but it wasnt a problem for our group  It was great  Thanks 
619665311,Overall great place and great location  The soap dispenser in restroom and kitchen did not work  The toilet in restroom is so close to the door  lol   Some dishes in kitchen were dirty when we tried to use them  The common space is big and accommodates all home guests  Its private and easy to access  Overall a great place  Only feedback is make sure dishes are clean and soap dispensers work  Definitely more expensive than what you get 
721937215,The place itself was nice except it was not clean  The rug and floor was not vacuumed  The check in was horrible  The key fob to get into the building did not work multiple times and when they tried to get us other keys from lock boxes  there were no keys there  The problem was never resolved  The key fob to get into the building didnt work and was never fixed during the stay  They tried to have us access   different keys and non were actually there  Completely ridiculous and we were told they were going to call security and they never did Rug was not vacuumed and had hair clumps all over it 
619127761,Great Location  Walking distance to almost anything you need in the city 
720122761,Check in instructions werent clear  Cant even get in the side door they say to go into where the lock boxes are  Theres a man and a woman at the main door that youre forced to enter without choice  whom dont wear masks  and harass everyone that passes through the front door to access their units  Unit was missing key amenities and the host became Unresponsive and ghosted us when we reached out to them  Bring your own TV of you wanna watch TV at all   There isnt a remote for the TV and its human proofed without any buttons  as they expect you to watch a blue screen in Spanish language your entire stay  They pay the service fee which is  To help Airbnb run smoothly and to cover the costs of the products and services we provide  like      customer support  we charge a service fee when a booking is confirmed     Yet because they pay the service fee  you dont get the support you need for the issues that you are faced with when renting from them  Also  if you do choose to take the risk of renting from them     TAKE PICTURES OF EVERYTHING WHEN YOU ENTER THE UNIT and WHEN YOU LEAVE  My final thoughts       Everything Zen   I dont think so      Key amenities werent available upon checking or for the entire remainder of my stay  Host was Unresponsiveness and ghosted me after receiving payment   The instructions werent clear and it took a good while to figure it out  also there is a man and woman who stand at a desk to the entry way of the main door   they question every person on where their staying why their there  where they parked and just basically anything and everything THAT ISNT THEIR BUSINESS  This place wasnt immaculately clean or upto the airbnb essential cleaning standards which is why we bring our own cleaning supplies everywhere  Host was Unresponsive which has lead to unresolved trip issues  location is sub par and for the price I think parking should be included  Not worth a dime
718073042,Although the place was nice and had a great view and location  everything else just seemed to be a little off  Parking wasnt as available as they made it seem as only   hr street parking or paid     a day garage parking is available but only before  pm  Also not sure if the apartment we got had been cleaned between guests as we found it pretty messy with hair and trash from previous guests  The door and the heating and air system were also very difficult to use and we had a hard time getting help with these things which caused us to cut our stay short  Please keep these things in mind while booking here     No off street parking was really available all spots were two hour parking only and then the garage parking provided was closed after  pm and charges     per day and if you leave and come back there are additional charges  Door and heating were very difficult to use and it was hard reaching host and when we did get them they were not helpful Not sure if the apartment had a chance to get cleaned between guests as we had to clean the bathroom and bedroom before we used it  Any issues I had they didnt take seriously to help me resolve them to the point that I stopped trying and ended my stay early
617071277,Its a grey location
720076330,This was one of the most difficult experiences that I have ever had while using Airbnb services  The check in process was a bit difficult due to me being provided a code that didnt give me access to the building  It took me   min to contact them multiple times and to finally get a physical key fob to get inside   The description states that it offers free parking space and thats one of the reasons why I chose this location  but once I arrived to check in  I was told that the previous guest lost the parking pass and I would have to pay for my own parking during my   day stay  I asked for a reimbursement  which they agreed to but I have still have received nothing and it has been WEEKS  I have reached out and have no gotten a response   The apartment that I stayed in had a messed up door   I ended up being locked out of the apartment for   hours while I waited for someone to come out and fix it  once he let me into the apartment I was told that I would need a whole new lock for the door since it was so messed up  Another guy was sent out and it took him   hours of banging  drilling  and cursing at the door to get it fixed  Chipping away at my peace and privacy during my stay  I explained this to the host and I have not heard anything back   I will never stay here again   thats for sure  In the description  it listed that there was a free parking space that would be available  After I arrive for me   day trip  I was told that there wasn u    t a parking pass due to the previous guest losing it  I was told that I would have to pay for my own parking for   days and that they would reimburse me  They have not been returning any of my messages and have yet to reimburse me  I spent    minutes trying to get into the building  The code that I was given  was not working and I had to call multiple times to get assistance Hair and stains on the sheets During my stay communication was fine  Since my stay  there has been little to no communication in regards to reimbursing me and resolving the issues that I was having while I stayed at the location
708314317,Good stay
617000250,Unit was as described  Only issue was that the building was pretty loud and creaky but location and price are hard to beat  Zen city is a great host  Lockbox was pretty finicky and took a bit to get open

711636635,Nice apartment  Minimal supplies in kitchen and bathroom   No on site parking we had to park across the street   Nice place to stay for a weekend  Thanks for allowing us to stay in the apartment   Here are a few issues we had    Apartment       I opened the  kitchen cabinet door and the door hit the light fixture and the plastic covering fell      Dirty sock under bed      Bathroom door wont stay closed   The rail bracket is uneven       No extra towels available      Toilet paper is  like sand paper     Small dresser in bathroom or closet would have been nice      Needs a full length mirror      Only one coffee mug available     Dirty dishes in the dishwasher      Kitchen has very minimal supplies       No kitchen towels       Small roll of paper towels on counter but no extra rolls       Pillows are flat and very misshaped   They seem to be very old or extremely cheap       No assigned parking  Very disappointing      Hair in the shower when we arrived        No personal touch to the room at all        The shower needs a ledge to put my shower gel shampoo on it         No replacement trash bags       Comforter in closet is dirty   Covered in lint and hair       No laundry soap       There is an iron but no ironing board       Dental floss hanging from the bathroom door       Bathroom trash can had existing trash        Couch has visible stains on it   Rooftop   Never saw it   The fob wouldnt work on the door we were instructed to use   Couldnt get in until someone opened the door  I also emailed my suggestions to the inbox and in a private message  Length of response too long  No parking on site   We had to go across the street and use bank parking 
417556223,Place is very good for the value  Location is extremely convenient if visiting U  of Chicago  Would recommend bringing ear plugs if you are a light sleeper  the heaters can get a bit noisy while they are on  The heater in the bedroom has a leaky valve that gets pretty loud when trying to sleep at night  Would be great if this issue was fixed 
614859656,This place is perfectly adequate  though if you tend not to be a sound sleeper  be aware that the noise from upstairs can be intense       even when theyre not partying loud  the sound of people walking above is surprisingly loud   I dont generally live in an apartment  so perhaps its common  but it was striking   The location is good  On street parking is great  Decent stay  Id probably look for something with a bit more personality and maybe a more interesting location next time  but if what I need is just a reliably good value  Id come back again 
605569439,This air bnb was a great spot  the building was cool and above a coffee shop  We struggled with getting the key out of the key cafe and almost had to find a different place to stay as there was no one to contact besides an automated message system  Luckily  someone called back    minutes later while we were sitting in the lobby looking for somewhere else to stay  Once we got to the room things were flawless  Key cafe wouldnt release key  Took    minutes to get a response  almost had to cancel the reservation
640229639,You can expect that one of your guests wont be able to shut their bedroom door because the door is laying on the closet because it was knocked off of the hinges  You can also expect there will only be one bar chair to sit at the island and two chairs are so low that your chin will probably touch the top of the table  Wifi didnt work  You can also expect any concerns or issues you may run across you have to deal with yourself because the host is unresponsive   I had   guests for this   bedroom air bnb   guests traveling from Minnesota  I checked in before my guests arrived and one of the bedroom doors were completely off the hinges laying on the closet  So now one of my traveling guests don u    t have privacy to shut their paid for bedroom door  I expect to see what was advertised in this listing and that wasn u    t the case  The pool table was filthy the sticks were broken  One bar chair for island the rest of the chairs are short so don u    t expect to sit there with your guests  Mediocre for the price  Update photos for this listing   The host or Air Bnb never responded to the place smelling like cigarettes or the broken bedroom door laying on the closet  Horrible experience overall 
657061020,Pros   nice apartment staff and facilities    great furniture   Cons   no in unit wifi router  its likely you have to share the same wifi with your neighbor  the wireless connection can be very unstable sometimes     AC unit is a bit loud while open  and the drop down curtain blocks it so you cant have the AC on while closing the curtain 
619658528,Great place to live
222406570,The place is big and nice and has a good potential  We did have some problems though  to start with a problem getting into the apartment  The caretaker  not owner  was unwilling to come and assist when the key box was not working  After     hours we got in as the owner picked us up  Sheets were dirty and floors needed vacuuming  This was fixed though rather fast after we pointed it out  The kitchen was nice and modern but missed many amenities and cooking equipment  broken glassware   one wine glass  no wine opener etc  The apartment is missing chars so not all can sit around the dining table and eat  Bed covers and towels were too few  Although it cannot be expected we could not get   hour extension on checkout   All in all we did have a good time at the place but a lot of time and trouble went with the issues that needed to be solved  Again the apartment is nice  newly renovated etc but currently not worth the high price  The place could become really nice with smoother checkin  fixing the lack of amenities  kitchen items  chairs  towels  bed covers to mention some   In the current condition though we didnt feel it was worth the money   Your guest mentioned some issues that weren u    t accurately reflected in your listing description  amenities  Additional comments   u   cMissing kitchen items  chairs  towels  bed covers to mention some  u   d   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   Could not get into home  Keybox was broken and the caretaker was hesitant to come and let us in  We were stuck in the cold for a good half hour and continued to a another place waiting another hour before we could get in    Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens  Additional comments   Bed linens were dirty and the floors had visible dust and other items lying around    Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable  check in arrangements   Location ok  Not fantastic    The place was generally nice and big but expensive considering the missing amenities and trouble with checkin  cleanines  missing bed covers and towels    
656748254,I had a few concerns I called on and they handled them in a timely manner 
617769803,Update pictures this pictures is nothing like the apartments Update pictures
617726465,I loved this place  I recommend this location  It is definitely close to everything downtown Thank you for allowing us to stay here  I overall enjoyed my time here  I would recommend Zencity  My only suggestion would be to put a mattress topper on the bed or something  it was rather uncomfortable  Homeless man kept trying to get me to let him in the building when I was outside having a cigarette
617326152,This place was great  Felt like a home away from home  The staff was very responsive  Like a previous guest mentioned the fob for the parking and side entrance was not inside the apartment when we arrived  Street parking was readily available so this wasnt much of an inconvenience  This apartment made our stay in St  Louis comfortable and very memorable  Thank you again for hosting us  The apartment was great and felt like a home away from home   Fob for parking lot wasn u    t available for use  
621059323,The apartment was beautiful and the location great  Parking wasnt too great 
578724338,The bathroom was not cleaned properly  but i overlooked since it was a good price and a nice location  You cant have it all  can u  Had to clean the bathroom myself before using it  The bathmat  was broken and when i stepped on it   it came apart  Definently shouldve taken a picture of that  One doorknob was fixed with tape   again  not that big of a deal so i overlooked it  The problems and bad experience started  however   when i received a message from the host to rate him as a  star host and if i had any complaints i should tell them in private   A little wierd but ok  maybe thats how he runs his business   After leaving i was asked for money from the host in order to fix what suposingly i broke  Im sorry if someone broke them before me and the host didnt notice but i will not pay for something i didnt broke  It was a good location and i dont think the host had bad intentions  but again  the request for   stars and the whole experience was not a good one for me  The bathroom was not cleaned properly  but i overlooked since it was a good price and a nice location  You cant have it all  can u  Had to clean the bathroom myself before using it  The bathmat  was broken and when i stepped on it   it came apart  Definently shouldve taken a picture of that  One doorknob was fixed with tape   again  not that big of a deal so i overlooked it  The problems and bad experience started  however   when i received a message from the host to rate him as a  star host and if i had any complaints i should tell them in private   A little wierd but ok  maybe thats how he runs his business   After leaving i was asked for money from the host in order to fix what suposingly i broke  Im sorry if someone broke them before me and the host didnt notice but i will not pay for something i didnt broke  It was a good location and i dont think the host had bad intentions  but again  the request for   stars and the whole experience was not a good one for me 
711266095,Really enjoyed my stay here  Amazing lakeside property with a good view and a park across the street thats awesome for walks  The furniture was a little uncomfortable and the wifi was pretty slow  Also many of the dishes were dirty when I got there  so make sure to check that when you arrive and you might want to throw them in the wash  but aside from that this place was great  Overall I really enjoyed staying here  but I want to note a couple things for you   The WiFi is really spotty The furniture is pretty uncomfortable and one of the kitchen stools is extremely squeaky  WiFi was pretty spotty and often problematic   Dishes not clean  as discussed in pms
707918831,This is a very nice apartment in a great neighborhood   The beds were wonderful and the comforters were great   There was plenty of room for   people   Parking is a bit of a challenge  but one has to expect that in an urban residential neighborhood   There is a Hispanic grocery within easy walk  as are some very good restaurants   It would have been nice to have a larger dining table  it only accommodates      The only downside to the apartment was that we booked for   people and the kitchen supplies only accommodated    and there were no oven sheets or crocks   The pots and pans were great   We would go back to this apartment anytime   Because of the size and cleanliness of the space  we loved the neighborhood  the bedrooms were extremely comfortable  nice bathrooms showers  You really need to upgrade the kitchen    enough plates  bowls  cups  glasses  etc for more than   people   You also need oven ware that can stand being heated   The pots and pans you have do not allow them to be put in the oven   We really enjoyed the space  location  and the beds were great    warm  comfortable   We loved the space and would come back again  but you need to accommodate   people if you have a space for   people   We had booked the apartment for   people   With three bedrooms  large beds and two bathrooms  it was clear the space would be just right for our party of     Unfortunately  the kitchen was under stocked   There were four plates  wine glasses  coffee cups  bowls    they knew we had six people   We ended up buying paper plates to cover our usage   The utensils were also for four and we purchased plastic ware to compensate   There were plenty of stovetop cooking pots and pans  but nothing that was oven safe   There was no foil  salt and paper  etc   In addition  there was not can opener or spatula   There are now  because we purchased these items and left them   If you are willing to accept   people for a rental  it should be stocked to accommodate   people  
623667787,Wasnt able to get into place  So didnt even get to stay there  Communication wasnt good  Once I wasnt able to get in I didnt hear back from them until  am next day  I have stayed with this company before and had fine stays  This one did not work out  Im so bummed what had happened   Couldnt get in  Slept in car for a bit then drove elsewhere  I hope I get the refunded I requested  Next time I would like to hear back from you guys more Did not know
721988090,From my experience I would say Zencity is a terrible property manager and I would not use them again  I was notified   minutes before my check in that the housekeeper took the keys out of town and they didnt know when she would be back  It was extremely disappointing and I was left scrambling to find a place last minute  To top it off they offered me a stay somewhere of half the value or a refund for half of what I paid for the air bnb  All in all I felt like I got scammed and I will be fighting for a full refund In my opinion there needs to be some major restructuring of how zen city manages properties  it was unacceptable to be notified   minutes before check in that I wouldnt be able to stay there and was left scrambling to find somewhere to say  The air bnb I was offered was significantly less than the one i booked meaning I would lose money then they tried to offer me half of a refund when I never even stepped foot on the property  I refused to cancel my reservation because this was in no way my fault nor did I have anything to do with why I couldnt stay there  Whoever is in charge of making sure check in will go smoothly needs to be notifying guests at least    hours in advance so they can make other arrangements  This whole situation was just absolutely unacceptable and I felt like I got scammed   Again I wouldn u    t know because I was informed   minutes before check in I wouldn u    t be able to stay there  I was told   minutes before check in that there was a  lock issue  and was offered a place to stay that was less than what I paid for the original place I booked when I asked what the lock issue was they said the housekeeper took the keys out of town I wouldnt know I was informed   minutes before check in that I wouldnt be able to stay there  They waited until   minutes before I was supposed to check in to tell me they didnt have the keys to the room because the housekeeper took them out of town  Then took even longer to try and come up with a half assed solution All I know is what the parking lot looks like Not good if I paid over      and couldnt even stay there 
719773589,Upon arriving at the location in Stl  my host did not send me check in instructions  After calling them it took another    minutes for them to find my information  As I enter the room the Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone would come to help with the alarm  They Completely failed to take care of it   so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in          would not recommend  this location or host  Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in   This is absolutely ridiculous that I have to go through so much to get a refund for such an awful stay  I will continue to reach out and request my money back   Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in   Host did not send me check in  instructions  Took    minutes in the cold outdoors foe them to figure it out Microwave didnt work  water barely came out of the faucets and showers  Smoke alarm that was    foot in the air started beeping loudly for over    hours  I called the host multiple times  Spent over   hours of my second day trying to get someone to fix it and no one ever came  After being told repeatedly someone Completely failed to take care of something so annoying and out of my hands  And are now arguing grounds for a refund  The alarm itself is reason enough for a refund  Not to mention the broken chair my elderly father almost fell to the ground in 
352634586,Very clean  Tv upstairs doesnt work and theres barely any utensils in the kitchen making it close to impossible to cook due to the lack of dishes and pots and pans
713892047,Well priced  and a great central location  we didnt have to drive more than    minutes to get anywhere  Thought parking was going to be worse because of other reviews  but we didnt have a problem parking on the street in front  Kitchen was a problem though  few kitchen supplies including no sponge to wash dishes  which was a bit difficult  If i were to go back to St  Louis  and was planning to eat out most all meals  i would book again  but if i were to want to cook more like this trip  i would book somewhere else  Overall the value matched the price and we enjoyed our stay  but i would double check your bedding  We found stains when we got there  They were minor  and didnt bother us much  but i would try to get it out or invest in new bedding   It is a very stylish studio  but its not as nice as the pictures depict  There are cracks all over the walls and floor boards with dirty brown water marks on some  Not sure where the smoke detector was  but it wasnt on the wall where it was supposed to be  Shower looks like it could use either a deep clean  or its just older and needs to be regrouted  nTo be fair the entire apartment complex has similar problems  the walls are scuffed  the community room furniture has some issues  just overall looks like its been lived in  and could use some updates   Stains on furniture  bedding  and rug
711265552,This place is very clean and has an unbeatable location   However  it is in the basement so you can smell food cooking in other apartments  You can also hear a lot of doors slam and people waking because it is on the ground floor    I was not able to adjust the temperature in the apartment without contacting the host  which was a major inconvenience to me    In the bathroom the basic amenities are provided but there is not enough shampoo  or conditioner and you will need to bring or buy your own  The hand soap was not useful because it had been watered down  The toilet also wobbles when you sit on it  It would have made the experience better to be able to adjust the temperature in the place  Some clearer instructions on how to locate G  would be helpful  too 
595700452,Great place to stay  Beautiful house  Great place to stay  Brian was a great host would definitely like to come back 
589118215,The unit was spacious and looked like the pictures  The beds were really comfortable and I had a great time playing pool 
710303834,Overall  a good cozy place to stay  Felt nice to be in a place that felt more like a home rather then a hotel  Some issues with cleanliness  There seemed to be a some remodeling going on but wasnt an issue  No bugs  Seemed like a nice and quiet neighborhood  When arrived I was able to push open the door which made me feel uneasy  however  I reached out to Zencity and heard back in    minutes that it was an accident so no issue there  The issues with cleanliness was stain on couch couch pillow bathroom towel bathroom floor dirty dishes  Other then that we were able to put the kitchen to use as well as washer dryer  small   Could not go past    degrees but we were comfortable  Unfortunately  shower water turned cold fairly quickly which is a big no no for me  Minutes from the arch and other activities  Would definitely stay here again if these issues were taken into consideration  Overall  we enjoyed our stay  It felt nice to be somewhere homey rather then a hotel room   Shower water turned cold very quickly after not even    min   Was able to push door open which made me a little uneasy  however  issue was a mistake and was cleared up with host  Living room  Couch pillow had stains  Bathroom  Towel for shower was stained  hair dryer had grime  floor was dirty  Kitchen  Dishes were dirty 
623651061,Great location and young crowd  Friendly for walking around in the neighborhood   Only Street parking in this area as the listing states and the elevator is a little narrow  Overall would stay again for next STL trip  Smoke smell in one of the bedrooms from previous guest
425187857,Overall attention to detail as far as cleanliness was not there  with stains on the bed  towel linens  rug  and food left in the sink  I would recommend bringing your own blankets towels  pillows  But  street parking was easy to find  parking was easy to find Sheets  comforter  towels were  stained  had hair in them  had crumbs  lint  The bathroom floor and bathtub still had hair on them  The rug in the living room was stained and overall just looked dirty  The kitchen sink had leftover food in it  Cleanliness
722837985,For the price it is a good option  You get what you pay for  In my honest opinion dont expect more than the bare minimum  The unit had great layout and decor and was in a great location  The parking and entry were inconvenience  The overall cleanliness was to be desired as well  It wasnt bad but it wasnt good  Just okay  It is understandable that they might be closed due to restrictions but dont advertise amenities that are not available pool gym  The unit was not  obsessively clean   As well as the key fob situation being a major inconvenience  Parking was fine during the week but I image it would be hard to find during the weekends  I would suggest buying a spot in the garage if possible because people like the safety aspect as well as just convince   All the amenities are advertised gym  pool  However all of those amenities are closed  guessing due to COVID    restrictions  Which is fine  Advertising something that isn u    t available is a little misleading   Check in went through smoothly  All the information provided was accurate  That biggest problem was that the keep fob provided for entry was not the right key fob at all  confirmed by apartment manager   As I said we were still able to come and go  But having a fob promised and then to not have one was very inconvenient as entry to the unit or the elevator requires a voice activated code every time  The bedding themselves werent necessarily dirty  However  we found several strands of hair on the bedding  And in the bathroom shower floors  The common area was mostly clean  We did notice a few stains and  crust   most likely from food  On a few pillows and towels and in one of the recipe books that were left  The kitchen was cleaned to expectation  Communication was fast  The lady I talked to apologized for the inconvenience for the key fob and  put in a request  for another  However  comparing our situation with previous reviews  this has been a reoccurring issue  And a fob was never provided by the end of our stay  The location was in a good spot in the Power and Light district  Plenty of restaurants and attractions not far  The biggest problem was parking was not provided  Metered parking is available but I would think the company would just pay a little extra for a spot in the apartment garage  I think for the price of what we paid      a night   We got what we paid for  A nice layout and location with cleanliness  parking  amenities and convenience to be desired 
631539043,A THIS IS A SCAM     DONT STAY HERE   It was VERY dirty  there was HAIR in the bathroom all over  Dirt  dust  and crumbs in the kitchen   on the floor   in kitchen chairs and more  The pillows were dirty  The microwave door was broken  The futon was broken  held up by pieces not meant for the futon and it was also very dirty  I sent a message and they offered to clean the space  but instead I asked for my some of my money back as this was not what I was not an accurate representation of what I was paying for  I took videos  which they asked for when they offered to clean  which should have been done according to a signed note on the wall  They never responded until check out asking me for a good review  Maybe   hrs later they sent me a message requesting      for damage for microwave  stained table that was stained when I arrived  and a broken drawer tv set  which was destroyed in the picture they sent to me but it was not destroyed when I left   This is a SCAM A THIS IS A SCAM     DONT STAY HERE   It was VERY dirty  there was HAIR in the bathroom all over  Dirt  dust  and crumbs in the kitchen   on the floor   in kitchen chairs and more  The pillows were dirty  The microwave door was broken  The futon was broken  held up by pieces not meant for the futon and it was also very dirty  I sent a message and they offered to clean the space  but instead I asked for my some of my money back as this was not what I was not an accurate representation of what I was paying for  I took videos  which they asked for when they offered to clean  which should have been done according to a signed note on the wall  They never responded until check out asking me for a good review  Maybe   hrs later they sent me a message requesting      for damage for microwave  stained table that was stained when I arrived  and a broken drawer tv set  which was destroyed in the picture they sent to me but it was not destroyed when I left 
494125006,Great location  Cleanliness needs a lot of work  Im extremely disappointed by lack of cleaning  The amount of dirt   debris is unacceptable  At first glance everything was fine there needs to be more attention to detail  Floors were not swept or vacuumed adequately  there were Plastic beads all over the common space from a previous guest  We swept the space ourselves it was so gross feeling       cleaning fee is a joke 
719191471,Overall  this space was fun and modern and really makes you feel like a local  However  some amenities listed were not available and the place smelled like marijuana when we first walked in the door  which was extremely disappointing as the place is listed as non smoking and those who do will get charged a fine  Hopefully Zencity fixed this after I gave the recommendation   The view of downtown from the studio is really spectacular and was one of my favorite features about the space  If the other issues were fixed  I would give an almost perfect score  As soon as we walked in the door  we smelled an overwhelming smell of marijuana  The previous guests or the last party in the apartment smoked marijuana and did not bother to make sure the space was rid of the smell  The green velvet couch had the marijuana smell seeped in and was very uncomfortable  Since the space was listed as a non smoking residence  this was very disappointing that this was not checked before allowing a new guest to occupy the space  Please make sure the space is adequately cleaned and stocked with the right amenities before making this listing available   A hairdryer was listed as an amenity but was not actually in the apartment  I had to go out and buy one  as I did not bring it because the listing said there would be one provided  which was very aggravating  Please make sure all amenities listed are in the space before this listing is published  
479961531,Great location  Amazing communication  There was an issue with the parking spot  so Brian paid for us to park across the street  We would stay again   perfect for a larger group 
437525055,Place was great  Just wish they had more parking  Bedroom doors wouldnt lock close and all the fan controllers didnt work 
515904174,The unit was very clean when we arrived and the mattress was super comfortable  The elevator is a huge plus and the building felt secure  The host was not super responsive but to be fair my lone message to them during the stay was informational  Im sure had I actually needed anything they would have replied  I was a little disappointed that the only response to my message about the unlocked front door and the broken ac unit was a request for a   star review  On the plus side the unit was very clean and the mattress was very comfortable  The front door was unlocked when we arrived  it was near midnight so we where a little concerned  a thorough check of the apartment verified that it was empty  Next I verified the lock was working  it was  We didnt have any other issues with the lock or security just found it a bid odd  The host did not respond when I messaged about the door and an AC unit that wasnt working  To be fair I didnt need anything from the host but I did expect a reply at least acknowledging my message 
515855539,The place is very nice  although perhaps a little pricy with the fees and taxes added  There is a tendency for small insects such as flies and centipedes to get in the rooms  but these wont bother you unless you have a fear of bugs  The place has air conditioning  and lots of amenities such as tissue  soap shampoo  and clean dishes  One bit of advice  the shower works fine  but the temperature valve does the opposite of what it says   set it to cold to make the water hot  and set it to hot to make the water cold   Thank you for the hospitality  It was very nice that the place was mostly clean  provided amenities such as tissues  clean dishes  and shampoo  and that the bed was made when I got there  One issue with the shower  it works just fine  but the temperature valve does the opposite of what it says it does   you turn it to cold to make the water hot  and turn it to hot to make the water cold   There were a lot of insects  flies  centipedes  tiny creatures   and the floor between the front hall and the living room was slightly sticky  it left residue on my socks and feet  A little pricy with the fees and taxes added  but overall good given the limited other options 
514654604,Its ok  I appreciate you guys letting me use the place but the price point was really high for a uncomfortable stay  I liked the place and wished the amenities worked  The tub jets didnt work and the faucet handles are messed up  The door to the back patio was jammed and someone had to come fix it  The ac was the biggest problem and made my stay very uncomfortable  It was    degrees in the house and opening the windows only helped so much  Again I like the place and would give it another shot if everything was working 
339430036,The place was in a great location  Very trendy and nice inside  Brian was quick to respond and very helpful 
711933791,We like nice places and this place is very special   It has good light  its open and spacious and somewhat stylish   There is some deferred maintenance likely the old carpet and the furniture is scarce    You better like Roku or you wont have much access to TV and definitely not the Chiefs game    It was a surprise to find unfinished  unpainted wall patches  many missing lightbulbs which were never correctly replaced during our   day stay  Almost tragically  the coffee pot was missing upon arrival and although promised  right away  it wasnt delivered until our third day    In summary it was a great space with views but youll want to relax your expectations if you appreciate attention to details and nice appointments  You have a really special place and we liked it a lot    We like nice places and was a little surprise to find the place with unfinished wall patches and so many missing lightbulbs  Sending over multiple people  with wrong and oversized lightbulbs and leaving all the bathroom lamp covers off made it look like an unfinished project  Carpets are grungy and shredding at the seams   The bathroom and kitchen were clean   The walls in one of the bedrooms had five large unpainted Sheetrock patches  When I asked to have the   missing lightbulbs fixed it took them two trips  two different  individuals  and   days to replace them   Then  they were the wrong size and they had to leave the covers off the lamps leaving us blasted with hot white lights   Not pretty and very little attention to detail 
711314212,The place was wonderful  The location was prime and was walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants  The modern amenities and the balcony were great  My only concern was the actual maintenance of the building  The carpet in the hallway was really dirty in addition to there being trash in it upon arrival AND departure  The elevators were dirty in the same way  I dont think this reflects upon the actual AirBnB   moreso of the buildings maintenance  but I do think its worth noting if youre planning to stay here  Overall it was a     stay  The stay was wonderful  The location was prime and we enjoyed ourselves  If theres a way you can contact the buildings maintenance owner to deep clean the carpeted areas  I think that would assist with the overall experience   The actual place was great  The check in and communication were above par  My only concern was the actual maintenance and cleanliness of the building itself  The hallway carpet was horribly stained in addition to there being trash in the hallway  I moreso thinks this reflects of the overall buildings maintenance system versus the actual AirBnBs maintenance  but it is something worth noting   The simple fixes needed to be done by the buildings owner  The elevators were scratched and the carpet in the hallways were very unclean 
350124842,Location was awesome  Place was very nice  quaint and intimate  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Chicago  Host was very responsive and helpful 
617280915,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival  This is an automated posting 
330573054,This space has a good location that is close to downtown Chicago  The check in process at the front desk was straightforward  There is free street parking  Only issue was the cleanliness of the bathroom and the floors  Multiple hairs found on bathroom floor from people that stayed before us  Floors had dirt and dust throughout the space 
330437261,spacious place in hyde park with washer and dryer in unit  There were several attempts of maintenance people trying to come in by knocking on my door  There was no prior notice and at least   times people knocked in the morning trying to come in and fix something  It might have not been Zencitys fault  since the maintenance came from the building management apparently  But it certainly interrupted my stay and felt like an invasion of privacy given that the main door is glass  and the person knocking was able to immediately see me  I would have expected Zencity to be in top if their maintenance schedule and let guests know   Other than that friendly and quick responses 
330436843,Good place for exploring Hyde Park   ideal for students or parents  In a bit  old building that has been somewhat oddly renovated   the room itself feels like a strange oasis once you leave a big  long corridor  It had a funny smell but I believe it came from the building  There arent to many Airbnb places in Hyde Park so this is a good bet for a short stay 
717452288,Good location  nice apartment  Its time to deep clean the rugs and the whole apartment 
604284390,Nice place 
551956934,This place was not very clean when we arrived and there were other guests in our airbnb when we arrived  The host was nice  but the space was not as expected and had barely any supplies such as plates  silver ware  cups  cooking necessities  etc   The description said there were all the essentials and then some  There were not enough dishes  only   frying pans to cook with  nothing to clean up at all  not enough pillows  blankets  sheets   The listing said Apt A  but the building said Apt     There were also people in our airbnb when we arrived  They were renting another listing of his and the code worked for both  The space was not cleaned well before our arrival at all  There were crumbs on the floor  dirt in the shower and our feet were black after walking on the floor for a few minutes  Eventually he responded  but he was very slow at responding to any questions  Having a cleaner place with more amenities such as plates  cups  baking dishes  silver ware  serving bowls  etc  etc 
217984273,Overall nice area and nice apartment condo  Few  extra  amenities for the price and when compared to other Air BnBs although  basic  essentials were provided  soap  towels  linen   although the soap was not refilled prior to stay  No cable but WiFi was provided  I did not use the WiFi but other guests did and stated the WiFi was slow  My first Airbnb was experience  for the money I would stay in a hotel  just my opinion   Did not respond on day of check in when called on both phone numbers  Better instructions on how to unlock and lock main door    Your guest had some issues with the check in process  unclear instructions  host didnt respond  Additional comments   Requested early check in because flight landed   hours early  never got a response and was stuck in the Chicago cold until after  pm  Called host   times with no response    Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  Additional comments   Dishes were left in the sink   Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host didnt respond  Additional comments   Did not respond to calls on day of check in     Few amenities compared to other places  Nice area 
606741532,Excelente
621054129,Great place overall very modern lovely layout Thank you for providing such a great place to stay overall aside from this Covid    stuff it was a great time look forward to booking from you again in the near future  The pool and hot tub were closed understandably from the pictures it looked like it was a indoor area 
459672454,Great location and good value overall   Well stocked kitchen  cool front porch    We encountered some minor issues getting settled but Slawik is an extremely responsive host   He addressed our concerns immediately   Location in relation to downtown and country club plaza   parks is awesome   So many charming homes in this neighborhood  Thanks for your hospitality   We appreciate you addressing our concerns in a very timely fashion   I am sorry to be so  high maintenance     One other thought to consider would be to hose off the front porch from time to time   I have a front porch at my home and I have to do this several times a summer to keep it clean    Oh  and the front door seems like it should be replaced or refinished at some point   Just a suggestion    not a big issue for us that affected our stay     Thanks for sharing the walking   running route with us   very helpful   My wife and I enjoyed our walks together and I enjoyed my run   Maybe consider sharing a map in your unit for others in the future    I can see why you are a top rated host   Keep up the good work   We had a lot of difficulty with WiFi   still have trouble streaming channels even after you adjusted it   I think you should mention that air conditioning is two window units in upstairs   I do not think downstairs is air conditioned   I think you mentioned as well that you might need to replace downstairs sleeper sofa which makes sense   I think the house is best suited to two couples who can share bedrooms upstairs as currently configured   Unfortunately convincing my kids to sleep together in one bed was a non starter    As reported  kitchen faucet was a bit flimsy   Rating it a bit less than   due to ant issue   Thanks for addressing in timely fashion  See comments above about amenities 
630619389,Very nice place  Great value and location  I loved the place but I did do some cleaning and disinfecting of my own because the cleaning staff did not do a great job  The floor was not vacuumed and there was a used bandaid at the top of the shower door  No paper towel 
600352799,Great place to stay for play or medical appointments at KU  We did both  and the location was great    Only two negatives  parking can be difficult and Im a huge coffee drinker  and no regular coffee pot in the room  but a coffee shop attached to the building open       There is a French press in the room so learn how to use one    Overall  very safe and comfortable  we will definitely stay again  Thank you for taking us on last minute  We enjoyed our stay  The only thing we had really found lacking was a regular coffee pot or Keurig    I had never used a French press before and I figured it out  but at   am I just wanted to push a button    Parking ended up ok  could have been worse  could have been better  Thank you for the warning  Overall  we enjoyed the place and will look there again for my next medical trip    I hoe we were good tenants  we met some nice people and  I felt very comfortable by myself going next door to get a cup of coffee with my walker  It was nice to feel safe    Btw  GO CHIEFS    
592724122,Great location and a good price  Perfect for a weekend in KC  Thanks for the stay  You made it very easy   but you definitely should look into your cleaning crew    I think they partly forgot our unit  Thanks  The first bathroom was completely disgusting  The quantity of dry pee on the toilet and boots stains on the floor would suggest that it hadnt been washed in a while    We had to do what we can to clean most of it ourselves with the limited products in the unit before using it 
713103476,Everything was dirty and I didnt feel very safe  I cancelled the reservation and got a refund  I even found chewed gum in the bedroom  The host wanted to charge me and rent the space out the very next night  which is against zencitys claimed policy of having a gap between guests to clean the place  They have awful business practices  I wont be booking with them again  This place was disgusting  have better business practices   pictures looked the same  it wasnt advertised as a garden unit   easy enough to check in  the number combination was generic enough that I wasnt sure it had been changed and I didnt feel comfortable  It was clear the place hadnt been cleaned before I go there  The sheets were stained  the floor was dirty  and I even found chewed  dried gum on a chair in the bedroom  After contacting the host to say I was cancelling my reservation because the whole place was a mess  air bnb got back to me way before the host did  and the host only offered to change the sheets so Id keep my reservation  He also wanted to charge me for an extra night so that he could rent the place out again that night  even though zencity says they have a gap between stays to professionally clean their places  Close to work  where I needed to go  was not told it was a garden unit  The location was creepy and not  well lit  This place was so gross I cancelled my week long reservation the next day  If I knew to call air bnb that night to complain  I wouldnt have spent any time there 
712403188,It expect the unexpected  The furniture was torn apart and there were plenty of stains and burned spots on the couches and carpet  The neighborhood is very nice and the house was clean but the furniture was all in bad shape  The bed frames are missing pieces which cause the bed to be uncomfortable and not leveled  The dining room chairs legs are all weak there for you cant sit down and eat at the dinning table  Also the couches were dirty  I couldnt have a sit  Last but not least the weather had dropped to below    and I wasnt able to adjust the temperature of the house  It was very cold   The dining room chairs are broken  the legs on the chairs are very weak  It caused my sister to hurt herself  The master bedroom bedroom frame is also broken  The bed isnt leveled  Last but not least the couches were dirty and plenty stains and the coffee table was broken aswell   The coffee table was extremely weak   It was very cold in each night inside the house and the host has a lock on the thermostat  The host took hours to respond back to me when I mentioned the fact Almost every piece of furniture has dirt and burn stains   The most important funter
708707490,This is a comfortable  stylish apartment with a fantastic location on Lake Michigan  We enjoyed going for walks along the lake at The Point  We walked to coffee and many restaurants for take out  As mentioned in previous reviews  the couch needs to be either fixed or replaced as it is difficult to sit on  Also  as we were there working  it would be helpful if a table and   chairs could be purchased and placed along the wall  While we were there the Broadband and wifi stopped working  however this was the fault of the carrier and not Zencity  Overall  we recommend this apartment  We loved the apartment and its location  The two small changes that should be made are to get a new couch  or one you could sit on   or fix the one there   Also invest in a small table with   chairs as there is plenty of room to put it against the wall  Then there would be a place to work  Also  it was unfortunate that the Broadband and wifi stopped working for the last   days we were there  We would suggest buying some utensils as there was only one fork  Thank you   There was no table or desk to work on  There is a space for a table and it would make sense to have one  Also  eating utensils need to be purchased as there was only one fork  The couch is not usable and should be fixed or replaced  
708176193,Perfect location and was in the middle of a lot of great shops  The look of the apartment was beautiful the open windows allowed a lot of natural light in and the space was very nice  as well as the kitchen  Unfortunately there was a lot of little problems that were very unpleasant  The worst was the four flights of steps you have to climb back and forth to get to the place itself  The walk up to the stairs was awful and the hallways smelled and were really dirty  The shower had barely any water pressure and the head fell off the second I tried to turn it  and it wouldnt stop running  The thermostat is not controllable so we were either freezing or hot  The majority of the windows did not stay open and they almost slammed down on our hands a couples times  only two actually stay open  Theres a very loud train right across from the apartment so thats all youll here every    minutes  The floors creaked everywhere you walked and the walls are thin so you have to be quiet the whole time  The room without the window is literally suffocating  trying to sleep in there was extremely difficult there was no ventilation and was very hard to breathe in  even with the door open  Fix the shower head and do something with the second room theres no ventilation it was very suffocating sleeping inside there  and fix the windows because it almost slammed twice or didnt even pull up at all   The view was misleading   The place was really dusty  the mirror was dirty and so were the windows 
595606212,This was a really great place  We would definitely stay here again  The beds and bedding were super comfortable  We were close to many attractions too  We really enjoyed this space and it was right down the hall from the friend we were visiting   I dont have any complaints but if you want to improve the space  There was not a lot of hot water  Perhaps you could turn up the temp on the hot water heater  Also  the kitchen sink sprayer needs replaced  At least   times it automatically came on when we turned on the faucet and water sprayed all over soaking us  the counter and floor   Luckily we werent on our way out when it happened but for another guest it might be a different story   Thought Id pass that along  I could not figure out how to use the intercom   I ended up walking in behind someone  which I felt bad for doing 
715748715,It is spacious  has a nice tv and living room setup  and the kitchen has a lot of gadgets  However  I had a few sleepless nights  The radiator is not working correctly  About every     hours it starts a clanking noise that is indescribably loud  It certainly woke me up every few hours   The maintenance person had a look and confirmed that it needs to be repaired  Im sure he will repair it but it was not done so while I was there   Moving on to the bathroom  I lived in a similar building down the street a few years back  Both were old hotels which still contain the same bathtub  doors  door knobs and bathroom tile when it was first opened  A previous owner painted over the subway tiles on the wall in this place  as well as the porcelain bathtub  It looks awful and feels grimy  Also the doorknob fell off on the inside  trapping my wife in the bathroom for a bit before I was awoken and able to let her out  The maintenance man fixed that  The last thing to mention is that you can hear the pulley system of the elevator from the bedroom very clearly  The elevator shaft is next to the interior bedroom wall  so whenever it is in use  it causes a loud noise to occur   Ive stayed with zen city before and the places are usually much higher quality   The listing says there is a washer and dryer  There is not  The listing said the bathroom was new   It is at least    years old with the original tub and knobs from when it was first opened as a hotel 
713123626,Upon arrival there was a strong smoke odor  which I requested one of the other guests staying to bring a febreeze bottle with her  While scanning the loft I went to the bedroom which there was only one light in on the nightstand and the giant beautiful mirror had a huge crack in it  When going into the bathroom I noticed a huge hole next to the toilet that looked like it had been busted open and attempted to be  semi repaired  and the hand soap dispenser was broken  There was also no tv remote in the living room  Overall it was a beautiful and convenient place if it would have been kept up with because there was dust everywhere and it was very spacious  The real kicker is that today I revived a fee for  smoke smell  and I am now being charged for a problem they displayed  none of our guests even smoke   There was a huge hole next to the bathroom in the hall next to the toilet that had looked like it had been broken from a previous person that stayed there  There also was a huge crack in the mirror in the far bedroom  Lighting was very terrible  and there was no remote for the tv   The entire place was covered in dust  the appliances in the drawers had crusted food still all over them  Upon entering the establishment there was a strong smoke odor that filled the entire loft  Got a message after staying saying we had a smoker with us when I arrived the entire place smelled of smoke and we had no smokers with us  The description was not accurate at all  and for      I could have rented a loft that didnt cause my allergies to flair up due to the smoke smell 
700260978,Beautiful view in the perfect spot in the city but it was very dirty which made it harder to enjoy  Otherwise it would Have been the place to stay  We were pretty disappointed with the cleanliness  when you walk in and right away feel the need to clean it doesnt make your stay as enjoyable  We wanted to stay in the whole time we were there but had a hard time really being comfortable  Everything in the whole place was dirty in one way or Another  Sheets had hair on them  bedding didnt smell clean  all of the tables were dusty  the floors were so dirty we swept and mopped the second we got it  The dishes had a bad smell to them so Before we could even use them we had to wash them  It was just very hard to enjoy with all of that  It is a gorgeous place and the view is amazing to wake up to  it was just really disappointing that it was so dirty  Especially during a pandemic  It wasnt cleaned well at all  we had to Go through and sweep  mop  dust and lint roller everything to feel comfortable  When we got there I sent just a few pictures of the many problems and didnt get any response  During a pandemic we expected a lot more for cleanliness  We even had to rewatch all the dishes we used because it was all dirty 
637442768,I liked the location and the gym  The unit itself was nice  Id recommend staying in one of the other units in the building though  I like the building and the unit itself but we did not have a great experience due to various reasons      The code to use the door is unnecessarily long    digits is too long for anyone to remember  Make the code shorter so I dont have to pull my phone out and look it up everyone I want to go in the door      There was mouse in our unit  We stayed for a week and we saw the mouse multiple times      Due to the location of the unit in the building  essentially you cant use the windows unless you want to look at dogs pooping  mounds of dog poop  or cigarette butts     The unit smelled like smoke  Not sure where it was coming from  either the person who lives above the unit or the people who use the dog park   It wasnt pleasant      The fire alarm went off in the middle of the nights due to someone having a party      Someone from  maintenance  knocked and was about to enter our unit without us opening the door  We didnt know this was going to happen and it was very uncomfortable  I understand maintenance needs to happen but it could have waited until we were gone or we could have been notified      There werent enough toiletries for our entire stay  We had to go out and buy toilet paper      There was something in the freezer left behind that wasnt ours  It was gross  The code didnt work at first  Support was helpful though  Its a bit ridiculous that we arrived at      but couldnt actually use the code until   pm  We had to sit a wait for   min 
626686714,Excellent location  it wasnt clean at all  other then that  it was pretty decent     Cleanliness was off  everything else was alright  The showers had footprints in them  there was throw up in the master bathroom sink  the floors were dirty  the water alarm went off  there was food in the kitchen sink  urine on the toilets  ash on the master bedroom bathroom floor   
645893377,Zencitys place is BEAUTIFUL  And we couldnt have picked a more perfect location if we tried  We did however find a lot of crumbs on the counter top and hair in the bathroom left over which normally isnt a big deal to us    year olds  but with COVID we expected it to be fully cleaned 
594393498,Again  Zencity has not disappointed  Youll love their units  Great properties  Great prices  Book today  Great safe property  but this unit may need more care and upkeep with the age of the building  Better heating  and possibly cooling  units would probably help the overall stay    In addition  I would have maintenance for Zencity check the door lock  The door was very hard to open and close on this unit  The door appeared more older and worn  The central west end is a beautiful area in St  Louis  but units and property can be older and in need of updating    Overall good stay besides these things  Apartment dusty and needed to be cleaned a little better  Probably due to hardwood floors throughout  My allergies started acting up due to the amount of dust  This was an older building so that may have contributed to the difference between the newer unit in Soulard that wasnt as dusty 
579458516,The apartment is located in an area central to Kansas City which made it very easily to go to destinations in River Market and Westport  The building and apartment are both very stylish  not really much you could ask for on that end  Definitely worth the value  Id recommend this apartment if you want a chance to experience what KC has to offer Other than the slight tidiness and and thermostat mishap I think this could be a great rental unit  Maybe keep it set at    or something a little more reasonable than     Fantastic location  stylish apartment and building  I did definitely notice the neighbors above walking around came through the ceiling so I understand the concern for noise in the listing  I also noticed there were ice trays in the fridge too late into my trip to fill any  maybe you could leave one of those filled for the guests  Either way I enjoyed my stay and it gave me a good chance to explore the city  Id definitely like to return  Happy holidays Only got check in instructions    minutes before checkin Crumbs of trail mix on couch  out of hand soap in bathroom Had a problem with thermostat  every   hours it would reset itself to    degrees  and host suggested I mess around with the breakers in order to reset it  As a customer I dont think it should be my responsibility to have to reset the thermostat because the host had it set at a ridiculously cold preset considering the weather
617285750,First  I must say the decor  layout and lighting are all fab  It was a pleasant surprise to see the choice of art books provided to read  as we were in town for an upcoming art exhibition  Private entry and free gated parking made our late arrival most convenient   This was a quick trip for us and we only had enough time to eat dinner and sleep  With that being said  I must note the kitchen had everything we needed and the bed is incredibly comfortable  Unlike some other reviews we found the neighborhood to be one of the quietest weve experienced in a city and slept great  Our stay was relaxing  convenient and enjoyable  We hope to stay again in the future  This was a quick trip for us and we are so appreciative for your swift replies  and the thoroughness of communication  We especially appreciate the detailed information for accessing entry and parking  etc  It made the process of check in so much smoother  Thank you  From the front entrance it can be hard to find the room  We went in circles a few times  only because the building signs guided us in circles  The room we stayed in required walking through a second door that only reads  gym  and we could see the gym  If you note to go through the door towards the gym  it would be easy to find the room  Bathroom  The toilet was not clean and had evidence of remnants  Also  a bathmat towel was left in the floor  Unsure if it was clean or used    Kitchen  The sink had food scraps tucked in the corners of the sink and stuck on the sides 
584729941,There was an issue with the water heater and it damaged the floor  I contacted the managing company and they responded quickly  The place is quaint but fit our needs for my family of four  It was in a great location and the bed bedding was super comfortable  Overall I am an easy going person but there were some major issues that need to be address before you should rent out this space again  I can tell that the place is overall a great place and I am not going to write a negative review but I thought you might want to know these issues so that you can work on it in the future    I know I notified you about the flooring but since the rug was removed from the picture  I know that you knew about the flooring problem  I would have preferred to stay in a place that did not have water damage as it did make the place smell  Also the water seeping through the flooring and the glue coming up got on my jacket and the bedding    Also  I would have also liked to have been notified that someone was coming to the apartment to fix a water heater while we were out   The next day it appeared someone had been in the place again looking at the other heater because it was not put back properly    As previously stated by another renter  the tub backs up water as you shower  It is not pleasant to shower in dirty water    Lastly  the wifi box was not hooked up  We looked for the username on the list on the kitchen wall  but it never showed up  So I found the router box and there were cords missing  so it was not even on    But the rest of the place suited our needs and the beds were super comfortable  Since we needed a cheap location as we looked for housing  this suited our needs and overall was not a bad place 
709497713,I was satisfied with my stay They were prompt to respond for the most part but a few times I had a bit of a wait I just thought it should have been a bit cheaper
709470047,Everything was good within  but felt a bit unsafe at night due to the neighbors Felt a bit unsafe at night
671163717,Unit is a bit old and needs a refresh but the location is great  Fix up the unit a bit  It is pretty tired  Cookware was dirty and there was not hand soap at each faucet  Bathroom tub had rust stains and the finish was missing in areas  The unit did not have hand soap read at each sink  the kitchen faucet leaked and is very difficult to use  the cookware was not clean  carpet was worn and dingy  Overall the apartment was tired 
619896284,The place is an old apartment complex but remodeled  The hallway smelled like a nursing home but the place itself was really nice  The bed was extremely comfortable  Ended up paying for parking at the hospital which was about     but for being close to everything walking distance  it was a great idea  I recommend this place 
625513330,Conveniently located and a nice little space for a short stay 
411212925,a Dejaron las llaves equivocadas  no tenia la llave de la puerta del edificio
411210291,Overall this was a good place to stay except the fact that there werent any clear instructions on parking and we kept having to renew the meter every   hours  We called the host and they didnt get back to us right away  I then messaged them and they told me spot hero could help  We ended up getting a parking spot with spot here and ended up coming out of    dollars just for parking  Host was responsive and available besides the few mishaps  very pleasant and gave good directions on how to check in and check out  Place was clean and everything was neat and tidy  We enjoyed our stay  There wasnt any information on parking beforehand and after i called  nobody had gotten back to me  we ended up paying almost    dollars for parking because the meter had a maximum of   hours and then a host finally responded and said something about SpotHero
598994260,Great location  cute space  good water pressure  Theres a mini mart with amazing breakfast sandwiches thats like a    minute walk away  The space is beautiful  conveniently located  and youre almost out of coffee  May I suggest a pour over situation  French press sucks when you only need   cup of coffee  Also  the bright white light bulbs in the place arent great  A warmer tone would make the space more comfortable and seem less like a fake apartment  Apartment was clean with the exception of the inexplicable amount of long  thick black hair scattered around the apartment  As someone with very long hair I understand how it can be left behind seemingly everywhere without noticing but the amount in this apartment was almost disturbing  In every room there was a clump of hair  on the couch  on the bed  wrapped in the bamboo mat on the floor in the bathroom   everywhere  It didnt bother me much it was just disturbing and Im slightly concerned for the health of the person to which it belonged  Other than that  the duvet smelled like sex  I know its a weird thing to say  but you know it when you smell it and especially when its not yours  lol  
598652125,This place has good value for your money  Nice area  Close walking distance to subway system Turntable does not work  What are records there for   Bathroom on main floor does not flush  Base molding on floor missing on left side of fridge  Wifi signal weak  Movies on netflix on tv were blotchy because of this and would interrupt now and then  Toilet seat in main bath is very worn out and flaking  Bedroom area rug has an oil stain towards balcony  Bathroom has many grout areas with mold  jacuzzi had filthy stained water in the jets  Kitchen cabinet doors were very greasy  Remotes for tv very greasy 
598225829,Zencity was responsive      with all our  concerns  The apartment had a peculiar bad smell when you enter but otherwise everything was as shown in pictures and per description  Heads up   couch in the living room isnt comfortable  A peculiar bad smell from the carpet as soon as you enter the apartment
597463707,The pictures of the place are incredibly flattering  The reality is that while ample in space  the unit requires updating as well as touch ups from numerous other guests who have obviously dinged the walls  There are markings on the walls which need to be repainted  multiple light bulbs that must be replaced  and above all else  a toilet in the powder room that needs to be swapped out repaired  To boot  the wifi connection to the TV isnt strong enough  so streaming quality is subpar  The location is ideal  but the price for this unit is overly inflated  The bathroom toilet in the powder room on the main level needs to be fixed  The water keeps running if you dont manually adjust the plumbing in the tank 
572951991,First off I felt like I was catfished lol Even though the pictures were NOT of the apartment I walked into  it was gorgeous  however I was settled for leather furniture  because I was traveling with a baby  and the brick wall  However it was again  gorgeous and clean and OMG  The bed was to die for  super comfy  The first day my door wouldnt lock but they came out the next morning and fixed it  Whoever was responding  I think Marty  HE WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC Downfalls however is that we were downtown and the windows did not close properly nor did they lock so literally anyone on the street walking by couldve opened it and slipped right in  St Louis is dangerous so that was very uncomfortable  especially when I had to yell at people walking past because they kept peeking through the window due to there being   windows but only one was covered with a blind  I knew they were doing maintenance on the building so I was very patient  This am a mouse ran into the bathroom of the apartment  Im sure it didnt live there because it immediately ran back out and I didnt see it again  Also  construction Im sure played a role in that  Even though I had some issues  whoever Marty is  he literally answered EVERY VOICE CALL   made me believe he was on top of EVERYTHING  His customer service freakin rocks  The only reason I would come back to ZenCity is because he made me feel like he actually cared and fixed everything right away  Thanks for the stay ZenCity   Thank you for being super attentive to my needs while I stayed in the apartment

402501532,Large space with   bedrooms and comfy beds  One of the bedrooms is open to the living room area which was fine because there were   of us  All the basics needed for a comfortable stay  Lovely kitchen  Great location being able to walk next door to eat dinner and  a short Uber ride to Union Station  The instructions for getting in were clear and the communication super helpful  Simple solutions can be taken care of like turning up the water heater so a hot shower is possible  That also made the Jacuzzi tub unusable  The HVAC makes a banging sound when it goes on and off as the metal contracts  That may be seasonal and fixable  We enjoyed our stay and its a great location  The linens were great  The hot water was turned down so low that a hot shower was not possible   This made the Jacuzzi tub impossible to use because the water was so cold  that was disappointing  I saw in another review that someone mentioned the HVAC would expand and contract between each heating cycle making a horrible banging noise that sounded like someone pounding on the door  It was unnerving after a long day of travel  Gratefully  we were able to sleep through it  Unsure how that could be fixed  The hot water was turned down so low that a hot shower was not possible   This made the Jacuzzi tub impossible to use because the water was so cold  that was disappointing  The HVAC would expand and contract between each heating cycle making a horrible banging noise that sounded like someone pounding on the door  Unsure how that could be fixed 
624306619,Great place to stay and great location  Other than the lack of paper towels and condiments  the place was perfect 
400594828,I  was scammed out of my money and a great experience  I would NEVER suggest anyone to utilize an Air Bnb if this will The result  I was NEVER acknowledged or apologized too in regards to this inconvenience  Im NOT sure if this company  or the host is racist  Im very upset and disappointed  Ive NEVER beeen treated like this before in my entire life   I am not refunded my money In a situation in which I contacted the host during the stay to Report a problem that was was never resolved during the stay   He never apologize or acknowledged the misrepresentation and lack of concern of Zencity end  This unacceptable   Proper preparation prevents poor performance  Never again Before you all scam others Out of a great experience  the lesser you can do is provide dish washing soap and heating in unit  When a guest contacts you in regards to this  atleast respond  Proper preparation prevents poor performance  Zencity performed and represented poorly  Never again will I book with Air Bnb or through Zencity again
315796198,Place was great until the  nd day of a   night stay  when the shower leaked into the kitchen  We informed the host  no maintenance people came  we simply didnt use that shower after that  Luckily there is another shower in the place   From the stains on the kitchen roof it looks like this was not the first time this has happened    Ensure this issue has been fully resolved before you book   Otherwise apart from the shower issue  the place was a great location 
400282083,Was messaged the day of our check in day maybe an hour before the actual check in time  I was messaged that our room wont be ready at the check in time because of the cleaning person was behind and asked what time do we expect to arrive  I responded back with we should be arriving by  pm  An hour after check in time  Finally after getting our keys we find some quick parking and grab all of our bags and things we needed for the week and brought it up to the room  Now a little after      pm the cleaning person was still in the room cleaning  We decided to wait in the hall for about    minutes before we decided that was enough waiting and went back down with all of our bags to go move the car in a more permanent place for the week  Also a few days into our stay someone from Zencity Im assuming came and knocked on our door to see our cable to see if we were buying movies  I feel that could have been sent in a message asking if it was alright to come during our stay  But I really felt that should have been handled after our stay  A lot of small inconveniences that threw off our relaxing getaway  Would still rent from you  Door man was rude  I follow the instructions that was given to me  The first thing was to pick up the keys at a different location that was around the corner from where we were staying  First the door man was not there and waited about    minutes for him to return  Second once I told him I was there to pick up the keys he asked if we had a hard copy of our reservation  I told him no because it didnt specify needing a hard paper copy  He then continued as if he wasnt going to give us the keys unless we came back with a printed hard copy  As we turned away he stopped us and said well if you have it on your phone we can take that    it is a small issue but for my first time renting from Air B B it through us off  Was messaged the day of our check in day maybe an hour before the actual check in time  I was messaged that our room wont be ready at the check in time because of the cleaning person was behind and asked what time do we expect to arrive  I responded back with we should be arriving by  pm  An hour after check in time  Finally after getting our keys we find some quick parking and grab all of our bags and things we needed for the week and brought it up to the room  Now a little after      pm the cleaning person was still in the room cleaning  We decided to wait in the hall for about    minutes before we decided that was enough waiting and went back down with all of our bags to go move the car in a more permanent place for the week  Also a few days into our stay someone from Zencity Im assuming came and knocked on our door to see our cable to see if we were buying movies  I feel that could have been sent in a message asking if it was alright to come during our stay  But I really felt that should have been handled after our stay  A lot of small inconveniences that threw off our relaxing getaway 
400280112,Well appointed and the apartment was exactly as described  Pictures were very helpful and the apartment was exactly as pictured  Would stay there again  Location was perfect for my needs since I was attending a Convention at McCormick Place  Thom M  Had written my suggestion re this booking previously   suggest the availability of a regular coffee maker sted the French Press that was available but unknown to me and     Suggest having step by step directions for TV since was unsure how to operate and stopped after my first night since I didnt want to mess anything up   otherwise very very appointed apartment  Would stay here again  GREAT and speedy communications from Zencity re my questions pre arrival  Thank you  
590762586,I was going to over look how dirty this place was just because the bed was so amazingly comfortable and the tv in the living room had Netflix  After getting locked out for an hour on our second day  and not having the WiFi work for almost the entire time we were there I realized this place is crap  There were short curly black hairs in the dirty bathtub  The dishes put away in the cupboards were dirty  The kitchen counters were sticky  I will never stay here again It was really disappointing to pay a     cleaning fee and find the place so dirty  The dishes in the cupboards werent clean  The kitchen counters were sticky  The bathtub had hairs in it  short  curly hairs  and a ring around it  The internet also did not work after our first day there  Getting locked out for an hour was really unfortunate too  I could not be more unhappy with the service you provided and I will tell my friends and family never to book anything with you The bathtub had a ring around it and short curly black hairs in it  The dishes that were put away in the cupboards were not clean  The counters were sticky in the kitchen  Having to pay a     cleaning fee and finding the place in such an awful state was extremely upsetting
589592718,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
588448936,Blood on the sheets and bathroom was filthy it was never cleaned before me and my   yr old got there  Just nasty I paid a cleaning fee just to have to clean up soon as I got in the door and buy blankets  I feel I should have been refunded my cleaning fee Blood on the sheets and bathroom was filthy it was never cleaned before me and my   yr old got there  Just nasty I paid a cleaning fee just to have to clean up soon as I got in the door and buy blankets  No parking at all If it was clean
576874464,If Im honest  you really get what you pay for  I guess I cant complain much because it was a cheap stay  but still  If I were to ever stay here again it would be like super last minute  It was too cold to figure out the transportation via bus or train  but the stores were convenient in walking distance  Disappointing enough  it wasnt close to a lot of things within the city  Lyft was expensive  so I tried to save by requesting the shared rides  Anyway  when I arrived to pickup my key my name wasnt on the reservation  The front desk attendant had to call around for help  The hallway smelled like an old folks home and cigarettes the whole time  The kitchen  including the dishes were not clean which is odd since they charge a cleaning fee  The side of the stove came off while I was cooking  The bathroom was not cleaned as well  the tub and toilet was dirty  The water pressure when using hot water was low in the kitchen and bathroom  The shower made a squeaking noice while the shower ran  The bed was extremely uncomfortable to sleep in  It was so hot in the apartment at night  go figure with the weather that I had to sleep with a window open  Unfortunately  the window wouldnt stay open in the bedroom so I had to prop it open  I thought there would be an actual guide book like most Airbnbs but that wasnt the case  But again  you get what you pay for  My name wasnt on the reservation  More like automated responses than an actual live person 
575879622,The location is wonderful  Close to grocery  downtown and the freeway  There is no assigned parking for the building but there is ample street parking around the building  We had no issue parking right in front of the door every time we got there  The apartment is comfy enough for   people and has everything you need  The building is quiet and safe  I would stay here again  Hey  We really enjoyed staying at your place and the location was absolutely amazing  The apartment was not clean  There was dried urine on the master toilet seat  the bathroom floors were dirty  The shower had hair throughout the whole tub  The bed sheets were soiled and had a weird smell to them  The entire place just didnt seem clean 
575867541,Zencity provided us with an AMAZING place to stay during our short trip to Chicago  The check in out went very smooth and we liked how easy the process was  We booked in a short notice  but Zencity responded back instantly  The view was incredible  The balcony faces the West which makes it perfect for watching the sunset  One thing we werent prepared for  most likely due to our inexperience with big cities  was the parking expenses  I will say that if I had one reason to stay elsewhere  that would have been it  Although  we were able to download the  SpotHero   app on our phone and received a discount reservation very close to our apartment  Thanks again for a trip to remember  Thank you so much for responding so quickly on such a short notice   providing us with such a great place to stay  We LOVED your check in out process  very smooth 
573233435,Incredible value in a great location  Easy access to Hyde Parks busy shopping district and the lakefront 
571860734,First things first  the pictures of the apartment on the post is not the one you will get  We arrived at      PM  had a very long flight  however this is no hot water  no hot shower  Contact the host at      PM  and got reply the next morning at     AM  I dont blame the late reply because it was late in the night when I found out there is completely no hot water   The next morning my colleague told me her bed is very dirty l  lots of black and brown particles   Also I noticed there are hairs on the towel  After   hours waiting  The host sent a building manager to check hot water   and confirm there is completely no hot water in the shower  In the kitchen he was letting the water running about half an hour and start to feeling some temperature  The most ridiculous thing is  the host charge us     cleaning fee  He was doing nothing but wasting our time  There is no compensation for our time  the miss led pictures of hosts post  the awful experience of our stay    I have notice this is a so called professional management company  under its name of Zencity there are several airbnb properties    I will defiantly be caution and  wake away 
571840387,The accommodation had the most comfortable bed and pillows I have slept in for a very long time   amazing   Nice shower with lots of hot water   Toiletries provided  Great location close to blue L which goes to OHare airport but the entrance really let it down   it looks very shabby and dirty  Although the pictures of the apartment are very accurate the place does need a freshen up and the sofa needs replaced  Even though there were a lot of amenities I would have appreciated some basics in the cupboard such as coffee  On the whole I would definitely stay again  While we managed to get the key out of the the key box we did try to get into the wrong street door so maybe directions could be clearer as to which was the entrance door  The accommodation had the most comfortable bed and pillows I have slept in for a very long time   amazing    Great location but the entrance really let it down   it looks very shabby and dirty  Although the pictures of the apartment are very accurate the place does need a freshen up and the sofa needs replaced  Even though there were a lot of amenities I would have appreciated some basics in the cupboard such as coffee  On the whole I would definitely stay again  While we managed to get the key out of the the key box we did try to get into the wrong street door so maybe directions could be clearer as to which was the entrance door  Few hairs found in bathroom
571080702,Conveniently located walking distance to many great eating and drinking spots and a short ride to downtown Chicago and all it has to offer  The bedding was fantastic  Thank you for providing a convenient place for us to stay   One suggestion I have to enhance the arrangement is to provide hooks or bars to hang wet towels after showering  either on the back of the bedroom doors or the bathroom door  I would also really have appreciated a manual that outlined things like check out procedures  and how to control the thermostat  or how to trouble shoot wi fi issues   Some things were included in the e mails exchanged  however I only had my phone to access e mail and i twas cumbersome to ferret out the information   An in house manual would have made things so much easier for me    Thank you  Best regards  Laura
563346369,The apartment is as expected by looking at the photos   The decoration could be a bit warmer but its a great location  I had a car and got lucky with parking except several times but its ok you can find free park but be careful on resident park restriction  Its just      min away from downtown  you have a supermarket just  min away walking or Petes market  min driving  bigger and lot of fresh option   Enjoy a breakfast or lunch at Spinning J my favorite place around  The checking was easy and could have a second key as we were    The team at Zencity is welcoming  responsive and will make what is possible to make your stay easy  Hello  I would like to say thank you for your hospitality and reactivity  I would suggest to add some more decoration  so the appartement be warmer  You can add pillows on the sofas because the sides are a bit rough and it will be more confortable and maybe plants which dont need lot of attention  The doors of the rooms closet were broken  the oven was dirty  Some recommandation could be given also on where to buy food  restaurants we can reach walking  Unfortunately no washing machine which motivate people to stay longer  Otherwise I had a good experience   the oven wasnt clean
559108536,With all the   star reviews  I was expecting something a little nicer  but it was the place was fine  There were little things that on their own wouldnt have bothered me much  but as a whole didnt add up to all the rave reviews I saw from other visitors  I thought maybe it was just me  but the two friends that stayed with me agreed    The place is worn a bit  which is fine  but some things could be fixed     clogged soap dispensers in the bathroom kitchen    toilet not fully bolted down    found a Starbucks lid on the floor by the couch    a  wookie  of hair on the rug   lumpy pillows in the front bedroom   Also  I left something of value  my fault  I know  on the couch and have been reaching out to management continuously to try to get an answer     My first message wasnt responded to  and when I wrote a second they said the housekeeper didnt report finding anything     I asked them if they could please reach out and ask the housekeeper  which they said they would  but its been two days and still no response   This is the longest review Ive ever left for an Airbnb  so I guess to summarize I would not stay here again 
557291874,Nice neighborhood and decent unit  but building had issues with heat and plumbing during the stay  Communication with owner was prompt  but issues were not addressed quickly   Will consider other units with them again  as it could have been the building itself  Per my emails during my stay  the unit had issues with the heating system that made the first two nights unbearable to sleep  Also  the bathroom sink continued to be clogged during the entire stay  requiring me to brush my teeth in the kitchen sink 
556480833,The bathtub was severely clogged and the issue was not addressed during our   day stay  The water was taking hours to drain and we did not have a proper shower  The communication from the hosts side was some generic messages apologizing for the inconvenience  The first time the issue was raised in our text conversation  the person who replied didnt even spend time to read my whole text  failed to acknowledge the issue and wished us a pleasant stay  I realize that we arrived on a Saturday and the maintenance of the building was not going to address the issue until Monday  but this is clearly a concern for the host   If the issue with the bathtub had not happened  the experience would have been great  Nevertheless  the professionalism of a host shows when mishaps happen  From our interactions with Zencity we experienced automated generic responses  inability to address our issue in time and failure to provide a satisfactory compensation for the inconvenience  I have had maintenance issues during a stay in the past and have always tried to solve it in private with the host when the host is responsive and sincerely concerned  This time  Zencitys responses showed that they dont care enough for the experience of their clients  If the issue with the bathtub had not happened  the experience would have been great  I believe that the professionalism of a host is seen when mishaps happen  From our interactions with your company we experienced automated and generic responses  inability to address our issue on time and lack of resolution to properly compensate our inconvenience  In matter of fact  I have not yet received any response to the last messages I sent  Too late to respond to an issue we faced  Have not responded at all after we left the apartment  On the expensive side
554566999,Its a fine place but I wouldnt recommend it  Ended up letting them change me over to another spot they had in Pilsen and that was better but having to deal with everything made it more of a headache than the work trip needed to be  They allowed maintenance men into the apartment who then locked me out of the Airbnb  They didnt have a key on site for that specific lock and it took over   hours for them to get someone to let me in  Laundry needs to be in the apartment  the back stairs shouldnt have anyone going up and down them  Communication could have been better  I allowed them to change my Airbnb and they were kind about that but in the future I wouldnt go with them 
551859665,Location and Value are fantastic  Great neighborhood that has some really nice museums  walking paths  and great eats  The fact it is only about a    min drive to downtown is also amazing  All the other places I looked at was a minimum    minute drive  The apartment itself is very minimalist  which was fine as I had no intention to spend time in their with how the weather was  Kitchen and bathroom appeared to be recently remodeled and were fantastic   My one complaint is the bedroom could be a little cleaner  Sheets were covered in body hair from whoever stayed last and the comforter was covered in stains  Thankfully there were spares in the closest but having to find that out right before bed was disgusting  The comforter was covered in stains  one was about     of the whole comforter  Some of the stains looked like marker  while others appeared to be soiled marks  After removing the comforter we found the overall sheets were covered in body hair  not all of which appeared to be from the head    Overall the apartment was clean  The fridge had a few items that apparently were not cleaned by the cleaning service  But mostly the bed was disgusting  Thankful the spare sheets were clean and we could sleep  The rest of the apartment was great 
551689521,The place was great  The location was nice and convenient with food  bars  and shopping within walking distance  I did not bring a car but rode the transit or took Uber and Lyfts everywhere  The only thing that I did not like was that it did get pretty warm in the apartment  especially at night and I could not adjust the air too well  Other than that  the host communicated well the entire time  Will stay again there  Thanks for being a great host  The place was great  The only suggestion is that it did get pretty warm  especially at night  in the room so being able to adjust the air would be nice but with restrictions of course  Thanks again though 
550909088,This has a really comfortable bed and if you like your room warm to go to bed then this is the place for you  You cannot control the heat and it was very warm  There wasnt coffee maker but a coffee press  They did have a blow dryer which I appreciated  They had shampoo and conditioner as well and that was nice  The neighborhood location is super close to a lot of places to eat and shop  Can I just say first off that the bed was super comfortable  The down comforter and the all cotton sheets were amazing  The sleep would have been better if it wasnt so dang hot in there  It felt like in the   s  The radiators were in the off position and the heat just kept coming  We had windows open but it only cooled off so much  Tried to turn on the a c  But it was fighting with the heat that was coming out  Finally just put extra sheets over the radiators to kind of trap the heat  Dont know if that was safe but it did help  Very frustrating  An actual coffee maker would have helped make the morning better  They are not that expensive  A Mr  Coffee is like    dollars  I dont think the rug in bedroom was vacuumed  Seemed pretty dirty  Wrote to host about an issue with the heat offering suggestions that were not possible An actual coffee maker instead of a coffee press  Not that expensive to get       mr coffee in there 
548019043,Great location  Wonderful communication from the host  Easy check in  Super clean apartment with fantastic amenities  However its worth noting that the combination of paper thin walls mixed with strange and ambient noises from apartment neighbors made for difficulty sleeping  If youre out on the town late at night or are a heavy sleeper than this is the spot for you  Great location and a super clean apartment  Easy check in  Everything about this place was perfect on paper   My husband and I were so excited to stay here but unfortunately ended up leaving just before midnight due to incredibly loud neighbors and very thin walls  We could hear the entire movie tv show that then turned into some sort of automated machine gun sound  maybe playing COD   that never stopped  The usual sound of busy city street is expected in a location like this but the sounds coming from this apartment were next level awful  I realize that loud neighbors are somewhat out of your control as a Airbnb host but it did ruin the whole experience for us 
540531301,The space itself had a very modern feel  but its definitely an old efficiency apartment thats been somewhat updated  The finishes were updated and nice  The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was sufficient  small   The entry door didnt feel overly secure  but we had no problems  The room has a little view of the park across the street  so that was nice  Air conditioners rocked and kept the room plenty cool  Kitchen was nice too  Overall Im happy with the stay  There were only a couple of low points  The place has no parking available  There are garages close  but be prepared to pay quite a bit  We found on street parking around the unit and download the citys parking app and that made paying super simple  Its free parking from      PM until     AM  so with the app  ParkLouie   I just logon and payed from my room during metered times  Its in a very convenient location  and close to the park  zoo  and art museum  We had a nice stay  Really have very little criticism to give  Parking would have helped  but other than that  it was nice  Might want to double check the shower thoroughly before guests arrive  could have been better  Tub Some kind of parking  and the cleaning rate was a bit high IMO
538491085,This space was clean and relatively quiet for being next door to a hospitable  The stay is very akin to a hotel but without some basic amenities at a hotel   THERE IS NO PARKING we had to park on the street halfway around the block  unless you wanted to pay     every time at the building garage  So we paid for street parking all weekend  not very nice  The bed was super comfy  Theres a window ac unit that has to run and that was loud and  drippy  sound  Bathroom is pretty tight   Clean  basic  stylish space but for the cost we would have been better off in a hotel  Thank you for our stay  While it is mentioned there is no on site parking it would have been helpful to have had some instructions as to how and where to park  We arrived late Friday night and had to drive around for an extra    minutes just to figure out where to park   Your space is very stylish and the facility clean  quiet and nice but I think one reason why people choose Airbnb is because of the extra hospitable touches that make it special  a snack basket  bottles of water  etc  in comparison to hotels  For the cost of our stay we would have been at a decent hotel  with parking  at least a vending machine close at hand  We enjoyed the area but it felt like a bit of a let down compared to our other stays with Airbnb  Because of this  we will not be back as it is not the kind of stay we look for when traveling  Hospitable amenities  snacks  bottled water  etc 
538218641,Great location  very easy train commute from the airport  walking distance to everything  Lovely balcony where you can drink your morning coffee and your evening cocktail  Hosts were great communicators and got back to me fast  I appreciated the quick responses to my inquiries  I would definitely get a coffee maker  there was only a french press that requires ground coffee and I got in too late to go out and buy coffee 
532884461,The location and decor are perfect  but that is it  When I arrived for the first time  the door had been left open and unsecured  and the host was indifferent  I ended up going to a hotel for the night for safety concerns  and they assured me it would be check and locked by the next day  Unfortunately when I came back the next evening  it was still unlocked  What is more  they had changed the code and it took hours to get a response so that I could leave and gain re entry  As if this wasnt enough  the shower is disgusting and does not drain  There was hair left in the in from a previous guest upon my arrival  and I quickly saw why  It literally took over    hours for the water to drain from a   minute shower  and all five minutes of that were spent in standing  dirty water  If you can see past these things  its great  but safety and cleanliness are literally my top two priorities  When I arrived late in the evening on my check in day  the door was opened to the condo  I was traveling by myself  and did not feel comfortable going in  It turned into an hours long hassle with Airbnb and the host  and ended in me going to a hotel as I did not feel safe in staying in a location that had been left unsecured  What it more  the host told Airbnb they had spoken with me and resolved the issue to try to get out of losing payment for the night and to force me to stay there  and it was totally fabricated  I was assured the condo would be checked before I came back the next day  but the door was left unlocked  again  They had changed the code in the meantime  and it took me hours to get a response for the new code so that I could access  The whole experience made me never want to use Airbnb again  especially on a work trip where the added headache was so inconvenient  The condo was clean for the most part  but there was hair in the shower from a previous guests  As soon as I turned the shower on  it was clear why  the water in the tub did not drain  More specifically  the tub would be completely full with standing water by the time I finished my fastest shower possible  and still would not have drained completely by the next day  It was disgusting  A functional shower and safe entry 
532389391,Spacious apartment in convenient location but could have been cleaner  Also rather noisy  background noise from the  L  train to be expected but disruptively loud A C unit  hallway noise  and very creaky floors were not expected  The apartment was spacious but definitely would have felt more homey if it had been a tad cleaner  The dishes not being clean and the bed having hair on it were off putting for sure  Most frustrating was the amount of time necessary to fix the beeping smoke alarm in the hallway  This combined with the  very  loud A C that knocks loudly when turning both on and off made it difficult to get a good nights rest  I would also recommend different rugs as the ones in the bedroom   living room leave fibers everywhere and get all over socks  etc  Instructions sent ahead of time were great  Just wish we could have confirmed that the physical keys are not really needed and that the intercom door key code option would continue to work beyond check in before arriving at the apt  Comforter in the bedroom appeared to have hair and fuzz on it  pet hair   but the sheets were nice and clean  Almost all of the dishes in the cupboards were not clean and had to be rewashed before using  Responses were fine  but perhaps ineffective to have multiple people answering within the same thread  I think some things got lost because of this 
620108028,Good stay
522186403,Had a great time staying here  all the little things you would need for a weekend getaway are provided  Street parking is available and there is a parking garage less than a mile away  Be aware that to check in the front desk is in a different building  Other than that the place was great  Please explain the check in instructions more thoroughly and make sure there are at least   keys available for a   bedroom stay  Other than that the place was great to stay in  thank you  Check in instructions said to  see front desk  but the front desk was in an entirely different building and somewhat hard to find  Also only one key was available initially because the other key was lost previously  so   people staying with only one key available made plans difficult until a  nd key was created  The emergency number should let you speak to a person  instead of being fully automated  Had a hard time checking in and calling the phone number given didnt help  AC units in both rooms and a possible parking spot provided in the lot 
519993626,I wouldnt stay here again  First  I arrived around   pm  As I was settling in  I realized that there were no bath towels in the unit  Two washcloths and a hand towel   thats it  I usually shower at night because I have to wake up quite early  so this was a huge inconvenience off the bat  I contacted the host immediately  and they said they had someone in the building who could do a load of laundry and drop towels off later in the evening  which would have been around    pm   past the time I needed to be in bed  I waited until    pm  but no towels arrived  Frustrating beyond belief  What kind of Airbnb doesnt have towels waiting for you    To make matters worse  as I resigned myself to the fact that I wasnt going to be getting the towels before morning  I found a dead cockroach on the bathroom floor  At this point  I considered gathering my things and finding another place to stay  but I was too tired  so I just went to bed  The next morning  I went to the kitchen to make tea and noticed that the cabinets were covered in grease  There were also dishes in the dishwasher that I couldnt tell were clean or dirty  On top of that  the floors of the unit hadnt been thoroughly swept or vacuumed  and I found little pieces of hair in the bed linens as I was making the bed  Overall  the lack of cleanliness in this unit made me feel uneasy both nights of my stay  On a positive note  the door staff were super friendly  and the location was great  Just be mindful of parking as others have noted 
516718831,This is a cute Southside spot in Chicago  Easy access to the city and points north  Lots in the area to do and see  restaurants  shopping   gyms  Public transportation is super close  too  The beds were noticeably comfortable for some great sleep at night  The natural light is plentiful  which makes for lovely sunshine through the windows throughout the day  The unit wasnt as clean as I like  and I mentioned a few touches that could be made to improve to the team  The communication from the host was exceptional and building access and the front desk team make this a great option for business travelers who keep late and early hours and or may need to receive deliveries  Really appreciated the thoughtful communication  ease of access and the front desk teams willingness to help throughout my stay  I received two packages and that can be challenging in an AirBnB  Thank you  I mentioned in my checkout note that the cleanliness left a lot to be desired  For professionally managed AirBnBs I anticipate hotel level cleanliness and I found several stray hairs in the bathroom  shower and floor  and on one of my towels  There was also a stain of some kind at the bottom of my comforter  which I just removed from the bed   I also left the condo with two bites  one of which  on my foot  definitely appeared overnight  Unit looks great  but the small cleanliness issues were quite noticeable 
505069811,Great big and stylish apartment  We stayed   nights with our two teenage sons  Everybody had his own room and we could eat all together at the table  The location at Wicker Park is perfect  nice neighborhood  a lot of restaurants and a bakery for bread and coffee in the morning  There is free parking in some of the streets behind the hospital across the street  As I already let you know  the blinds at the front window were very dirty  it was good you let them cleaned the next day  But overall the apartment was not very clean  There was a lot of dust under the beds and on the bedside tables  There were toothpaste stains behind the sink in the bathroom  I cleaned them myself  And in the sheets of our bed were a lot of long black hairs  we all are blonde  We were very happy with the apartment  the size  the style  the big kitchen and the location  But you really need to do something about the cleaning 
504411328,My first stay at a Zencity unit was fantastic  Extremely clean  exactly as shown on the AirBnB photos  in a great location  Had a few questions upon arrival  and the Zencity team answered immediately  Would highly recommend  Thanks to the Zencity team on my first stay  Only main issue was that the WiFi was down the entire stay  despite several attempts working with Comcast to try to get it fixed  Wasnt a major issue for me since I was mostly out and about  but if someone had been trying to really work there  wouldve been quite frustrating 
492840446,This is a gorgeous place  true to the pictures   It was very comfortable and well located   Its just a couple of minutes walk from the main part of Central West End  and a    minute walk to the metro station   We had four people staying  and while we only had one key fob to get up the elevator  the people at the front desk were usually there until midnight to let us up   The amenities were nice   We did try to watch Netflix and werent able to because there were too many users  but they had other options that we watched instead  Amazon Prime  etc     There is no place to drop your luggage if you get there before check in  so be aware of that   We looked at a bunch of options  but in the end  the only available option was getting a hotel to store our luggage for us   It was    apiece at The Westin uptown  though you could probably find a hotel closer to do it for you    Overall  this was a nice place to stay   They were very communicative and gave solutions when they could   It was a good place to come back to to relax after a long day touring St  Louis  The place was beautiful   If someone wants to drop their luggage somewhere  I would recommend they ask nearby hotels to hold their luggage  though there will likely be a fee    Alternatively  letting them drop their stuff in the corner of the Airbnb space  though it didnt seem like this was an option you wanted to offer  No place to store luggage before check in  and this wasnt well communicated  However  the instructions were clear about how to get in once I could check in 
492771678,The apartment  host    front desk were awesome  We stayed for a weekend and definitely enjoyed the location  Everything we did was within      minutes from the apartment  The construction wasnt a problem to us  as i saw someone comment on it  Checking in and out was easy  The young lady at the front desk was great  The communication between Zencity and I was great from when we booked and throughout the stay  Wed stay again for sure  I would definitely contact the maintenance people in building about the odor in the hallway  Other than that and the window unit in the bedroom  the apartment was great  Thank you for allowing us to stay  It was a great birthday weekend for us  The window unit in the bedroom needs to be replaced  We had the temperature down to    degrees and it felt as if it was blowing maybe    degrees which resulted in us being hot at night and in the mornings when the sun came out 
492714123,Nice place  Zencity is a good name for this hosts listings   I like the minimal furnishings and lack of clutter  It felt a little like a hotel  but I dont mind that  There was room for me to make it my own place for a few days  Its not a good place to stay on a hot weekend  though  The one window air conditioner is under powered and located in the living room   not in the bedroom  Before you choose the date  Airbnb shows that this place costs     night  We paid      night   taxes   cleaning fee   service fee   for a total of      night  Thats a very big difference   taking advantage of an event weekend  I will think twice next time 
490217002,Im not really sure what to say but this was probably my worst Airbnb experience  When I arrived  I was surprised to discover that there wasnt any central air conditioning  I know that Chicago is the Windy City and that high temperatures arent the norm  but given that there was a heat advisory the week of my trip  it made for some miserable and sweaty nights  Though the host did his best to accommodate my needs by providing fans  it just wasnt enough  If there was an a c unit in the bedroom that wouldve been helpful  but unfortunately  there is only one in the living room  I also thought that this property is overpriced and that the pictures are a bit deceiving  I was underwhelmed upon arrival  I also was really disappointed in the couch  It was pretty uncomfortable  Overall  I was disappointed  However  I do think this would be a cool place to stay in the cooler months  Its a really fun area  Thank you so much for trying to accommodate my needs by providing two fans upon request  However  given how hot it was in Chicago during my visit  it made for a pretty unpleasant stay  I honestly was surprised that there wasnt any central air or at least an air conditioning unit in the bedroom  I slept in the living room the last night of my stay  which might of been a good solution if the couch cushion were so worn  Also  I felt as though your listing was a bit deceitful  You dont disclose the lack of central air and even cover up the a c unit with a curtain  If I had none this in the beginning  especially since I have asthma  I would not have made this reservation  Overall  I was pretty disappointed  Furniture and Central Air Conditioning
489416305,A nice and clean place with all the equipments to stay longer  Very safe place to live  Parking is horrible btw   Sometimes had to go in circles for ages to find a spot   Can not use the laundry in the facility  if you are coming to stay longer you will have to find it outside   Overall a very good experience   Please check the kitchen equipments inside when going through all the items  The water heater inside was not cleaned for a long time and I cleaned it up several times and was not satisfied   Other thing is the extra linens for the bed was not clean  I saw yellow patches on it and they smelled  Had to stay in the same linens the entire time   All in all your please is an excellent place  Very clean and all  But please pay attention to the length of the visit  I had to stay in for a half a month  lad to use the same bed linens for that period  I asked the management about it and told me there is a extra linens in the wardrobe  There was but they were used and had a bad odor 
489376697,Its not a real airbnb apartment  Its run by a company which is renting many flats in Chicago  Studio is ok   worth for that price  Good for couples who wants to spend few days in Chicago not in the city center  You can hire a bike not far away from the house and make a ride along the lake to the city or back  Uber prices to town are affordable   around   USD  Wifi is fine  Kitchen should be more equipped  In the neighborhood are shops where you can buy grocery or other stuff  At night there is a gas station open   hrs a day   In general I would give      The apartment was ok  Clean was ok only bathroom should be more taken care off  Shower curtain was a bit used and had mold 
489343789,The place was acceptable the views were great  The A C was ok but not great  The bathroom had peeling paint on the ceiling and the light fixtures were rusted  My wife slipped and fell in the Bathtub that had no mat or anti slip coating or grab bars  Once we reported this and that she broke a rib  the host abandoned us  For those who follow us  we bought a mat for the tub so no one else would experience the same humiliation  We had no help once we reported the problem  We will not reccomend or rent from this group again  When we had a problem you abandoned us  Peeling paint on ceiling rusty light fixtures in bathroom  Floors not fully clean  oily substance on floor  We had a problem and once we let them know all communication stopped 
483503910,Where to start  I will preface this long honest review with the fact that we travel and use Airbnb a few times a year  so Im very aware of a good stay  When we arrived our space had not been fully cleaned  There was trash and scum on the night stands  brown gross spots on the comforter  black marks on the sheets  hair EVERYWHERE on the sheets and pillows  the floor had clearly not been vacuumed or picked up  there was a stretchy band from a new item in plain sight and crumbs all over the rug   I have photos  but will spare you  We called Zencity and they sent the cleaners back to clean again  However  it took the cleaners an hour to arrive  Everyone was very nice and courteous from Zencity  so   star on communication  but just an annoying experience as the entire ordeal took our afternoon of a very short stay   Aside from that  parking is absolutely ridiculous  Other reviews said it was no big deal  It was a very big deal to us  All that is available is street parking  metered  and a few free spaces  Most of which are always full as this street is lined with other apartments  so everyone is looking for a space to park  We were frustrated EVERY time we tried to park  There is a parking lot for this building  but permit only  Im confused as to why zencity doesnt have a permit for their guests to park  One car per room  It was just beyond annoying to try to find parking and then when you did  walk from wherever you managed to get a spot and then all the way around the building to the entrance  If youre looking for convenience  run away  There IS a cute street of a few restaurants a few blocks away  but thats the only convenient factor this place has going for it    The place itself is well decorated with modern touches  Just wish it had been clean  The AC units are in the windows  so you have to maneuver the curtains just right to try and block light for sleep  Theres also not a TV in the bedroom  not a big deal  just not noted anywhere incase its important to you  I really wanted to love this space  but we just didnt  Decor is awesome  but it wasnt clean and I cant give stars for that  The parking is also awful  A suggestion would be get a permit space so your guests can park in the lot  Id even pay more for that  There was trash and scum on the night stands  brown gross spots on the comforter  black marks on the sheets  hair EVERYWHERE on the sheets and pillows  the floor had clearly not been vacuumed or picked up  there was a stretchy band from a new item in plain sight and crumbs all over the rug   I gave   stars for communication  though  because the host was very apologetic and sent cleaners to clean  Parking is absolutely ridiculous  Other reviews said it was no big deal  It was a very big deal to us  All that is available is street parking  metered  and a few free spaces  Most of which are always full as this street is lined with other apartments  so everyone is looking for a space to park  We were frustrated EVERY time we tried to park  There is a parking lot for this building  but permit only  Im confused as to why zencity doesnt have a permit for their guests to park  Lack of parking and convenience devalued this space for us 
482633216,Check in was seamless  the apartment was spacious and comfortable  Any issues were addressed quickly  shower and bath floor   The living and sleeping areas were spotless  cozy and comfy   The kitchen had a surprisingly diverse mix of utensils  gadgets and was spic and span as well  Thank you  the apartment suited our needs perfectly for our visit to family  So vastly superior to an air bed on the office floor  Everything was very clean except the bathroom floor and shower 
481975249,Upon arrival  we were greeted with two persistent alarms beeping  It turned out to be the carbon monoxide detectors  I immediately alerted the host and they said they would contact maintenance to check it out  In the meantime  we unplugged and reset them  That seemed to do the trick and the beeping stopped    at least for a while    Later that night     we plugged them back in and went to bed  No beeping until  am when we were startled out of sleep   We could not get the carbon monoxide alarms to stop  It wasnt until we opened up all the windows and turned on all the fans that the alarms would finally stop  unplugging and resetting didnt do anything   Needless to say  we had a pretty fit full night of sleep   I messaged the host again  explaining that the carbon monoxide detectors went off again  They said they were sorry for the inconvenience and that maybe the maintenance crew couldnt make it out because on the holiday  I then went on to explain in detail what happened that night and added   Also  alarming   it appears that all of the smoke detectors are dead  and missing in some rooms    No response from the host  other than asking me to give them a   star review    Wow  Unresponsive when I mentioned that there was a more serious issue with the carbon monoxide detectors and dead and missing smoke detectors  More comfortable living room furniture  dressers  full set of dishes and glassware  ie only one wine glass   one ceiling fan in living room is broken  nonworking smoke detectors  an obvious carbon monoxide issue   
481844922,Great location directly across the street from Forest Park     block from Euclid Avenue and the excellent food choices   Do check out the rooftop for views of the cwe Great location directly across  from Forest Park   one block from  Euclid Avenue   Do not forget to check out rooftop for views of cwe
480832069,The place is fine  decorated well and in a nice area  But it smells very bad  check in was very difficult and you may be accused of taking random things from the room that the cleaning person decides have gone missing and charged for them later  We called Zencity customer service to help us with check in to get into the building and they couldnt even help  We just had to wait    minutes until someone came by willing to open the door for us  The check in gave us a keypad code for the door to the apartment  but the whole apartment building was locked and we were supposed to have a FOB available to unlock the building  The door is not manned at all times to let people in  Complete sewage smell going through the apartment that wasnt in the hallway outside in the place  Wouldve been great  until the host told us the cleaning person reported iPhone docks missing that were not in the apartment at all to our knowledge and tried to charge us nearly      There are way too many factors to accuse guests of taking some random object from a place  especially when they werent there in the first place 
480448175,Nice place  There is a great grocery store next door with pretty much anything you need  There arent many restaurants super close but if you go down division there is a lot to do 
479196514,I will start off saying its a great location in Hyde Park  Easy check in with a lock box  The building is old and has a lot of charm  with older buildings they run hot  Something to keep in mind for summer travelers  The small AC unit was not left on but did eventually cool the studio apartment  The location was perfect for us and overall it satisfied our needs for a short weekend but we liked staying at the other Zencity locations in Hyde Park  We love that Zencity has so many locations in Hyde Park  Unfortunately  this wasnt our favorite spot  We arrived on a hot day  It would have been nice had the AC been left on for our arrival  When we checked in the room was very very hot and took several hours too cool  Something to keep in mind for summer visitors  It made a bad first impression  The cleanliness of the bathroom  hair in sink and tub  and also the bedding didnt seem that clean  small hairs and stains   We tried the TV this morning and it didnt work  Had internet connection issues   Overall a great location  old charm but a few things could have been better 
479093692,Not over the wall with a fancy setup or anything but clean  have people that respond quickly and parking right across the street so convenient for a short trip Thanks for hosting me this was my first Airbnb experience  My feedback it to have more detailed instructions on how to use the lockbox and door code and maybe not all white sheets as they look kinda dirty  Maybe a couple pictures on the wall and some drinks in the fridge would make someone feel more at home Getting into the lockbox and using the door code took me a second to figure out and when I called for help the people asked like they didnt know what I was talking about so I just figured it out myself Thankfully brought my own sheets They answered the phone but both times the person that answered couldnt answer any of my questions and they got someone to call me like    minutes later  Place cost over      a night after everything and it doesnt feel very homey  All White sheets and walls no pictures or anything anywhere just kinda bland  But location is clutch and it was clean and quiet
476678832,The apartment was as listed   It is in a lovely neighborhood that we felt safe to walk to a nearby park and grocery store    We however had a few small issues   The unit only has one small window air conditioner in the living room area so we were a bit too hot in the bedroom   the water pressure was very low and seemed to not get very hot and the coffee pot was broken   I reported the broken pot and did get an apology a couple hours later and was told they would be sure and get a new one for the next guests   I feel the cleanliness of the kitchen could have been better  We were disappointed in the broken coffee maker and felt like maybe the kitchen wasnt properly cleaned or that would have been noticed   Also  I would suggest a measuring cup  hot pads and a smaller size pot with a lid as somethings that would be helpful in the kitchen   As far as the air conditioner  that could be an oversight of mine   as I dont recall whether or not the listing described it as a window unit or not  We really loved the neighbor hood and had positive interactions with the locals as we walked to  the  nearby park and stores  There was a bag of open coffee in the cupboard and sugar spilled in there as well   There was also a dirty pizza cutter in the drawer   The soap dispenser didnt work either and the water pressure was so low in the kitchen it was very difficult to clean anything  If there was air conditioning throughout and the water pressure was better
476591037,It was okay   Not very clean  bed sheets were clearly not clean  there was dirt   hair all over  bed sheets in the closet were also not clean so i had to go to Target and buy my own bedding because i didnt trust they would bring clean sheets    overall  the apartment is in desperate need for a deep clean  its obvious its been quickly cleaned over and over again but with zero effort    when running the water in the bathroom  it came out brown at first   the garbage was full in the bathroom with toilet paper and paper towels   view was really nice Clean sheets and clean place
472437618,Great location  a bit janky  Smells weird like cheap cleaning products Glasses are dirty Surfaces stained   chipped Fridge is on a weird slant so everything rolls forward Secret Airbnb is sketchy Blinds are janky need to be replaced No recycling Temperature doesnt work for heat Scent sensitive people should not stay Toilet is runny clogs every other use No pot holders Everything is scented Needs Scissors Floor is sticky Toilet always runs No heat Toilet rim dirty from diarreah  Water went out in kitchen for an hour no water Shower bar broken falls off Light bulb out in bathroom Bright due to bad blinds Weird alarm woke and kept me up last night Nicer products instead of the cheapest shampoo  hand soap  toilet paper
470900221,Great location   check in and out was effortless   nice outdoor space  Only issues  the back door lock was confounding to say the least    adults could not figure out how to lock unlock consistently until day    The space was a bit dated and needed some cosmetic maintenance  Wed stay there again  but not for the price 
470767218,I made it clear that there were three of us  all adults  arriving  yet it turned out that only one queen sized bed was available and there was no couch  This meant that we had to go all the way to the city center to purchase a sleeping bag the day of our arrival  after the fatigue of a    hour flight   This was not the service I had expected after paying such a high price   I made it clear that there were three adults arriving  yet it turned out that only one queen sized bed was available and there was no couch  This meant that we had to go all the way to the city center to purchase a sleeping bag the day of our arrival  after a    hour flight   This was not the service I had expected after paying such a high price  
469452250,Location South of the city loop  but public transportation options are abundant and Uber cost about     Comfortable with amazing outdoor space  Thanks for the stay 
468067264,Overall  our stay was really nice  The location is fantastic for exploring Wicker Park  as well as other Chicago attractions  Super walkable neighborhood with lots of great restaurants and coffee shops  The space was a really comfortable size for four people and nicely decorated   However  the check in process did not go smoothly  Upon arrival  we were instructed to use the intercom to access the building  Unfortunately  the intercom was broken and the receptionist was unable to hear us on the other line  After multiple attempts  I called Zencity  and after the second phone call  I was told I would receive the access code  While we were waiting for a response  we ended up getting inside through other people going in and out of the building  The check in process ended up taking almost an hour total  After reading another review  I realized others have had issues with the intercom not working and an all together bad check in experience  Upon arrival  the kitchen sink had a really strong  foul smell  My brother in law  who is a general contractor  checked out the sink and there seemed to be some type of clog that was causing the smell    Also  please fix the intercom  The receptionist on the other line could not here us when we were trying to check in  which cause a long and annoying check in process  When we first arrived to the Airbnb  we followed the instructions provided to enter the building apartment  However  the intercom outside the building was broken  and the receptionist on the other end could hear us  and therefore we couldnt get in via the intercom  There was a strong  foul smell coming from the kitchen sink upon arrival  Smoother check in would be fantastic 
467582162,WiFi router is in another apartment  I can barely get WiFi signal in bedroom for my laptop and my cell phone just cant receive signal at all  Please fix WiFi and just get a router for every apartment  I can barely get WiFi signal in bedroom for my laptop and my cell phone just cant receive signal at all 
467580755,Were not really sure what happened with the door when we were trying to check in  It seemed as if it was locked and when we called for help  the host didnt have any sense of urgency for our problem  We ended up waiting outside for about    to    minutes until a resident of the apartment opened it for us  The place looks exactly the way it does in the pictures  We found that the linens and pillows had stains and little hairs on them  Im guessing they came from the previous guests  which may suggest the sheets hadnt been washed before our arrival  The shower liner in the bath tub is a little moldy and so is the window in the shower  the knob is also a bit messed up  If you want your water to be hot you have to turn it to the cold side and if you want it to be cold you have to turn it to the hot side  Overall  even with the minor problems we had  our stay was great  It was a beautiful little neighborhood and we were able to walk to most places we wanted to go to  Overall  even with the minor problems we had  our stay was great  It was a beautiful little neighborhood and we were able to walk to most places we wanted to go to  Were not really sure what happened with the door when we were trying to check in  but we dont blame that on you  we just wouldve liked better communication and more urgency to help us with the problem  A big thing Id suggest is to keep those linens and pillows clean  stain free and hair free  Also  I apologize if we didnt leave the place in great shape  I did my best to clean it up  My boyfriend didnt believe that it was our duty to do that and waited to the last second to get up and get his things together  and then dragged me out the door around        I hope I did alright and please consider my suggestions  Take care  For some reason  the front door was locked  which according to the host was unusual  We stood outside for a good    to    minutes until a resident opened the door for us and we called the host about   times to help us  but they didnt give much instruction on what to do  We found hair and stains on the bed and the shower liner in the bath tub was a little moldy  The knob on the shower was also kind of messed  Better communication when we were locked out and clean sheets would have made our stay perfect 
465420290,Beautiful  stylish  modern space in very walkable Hyde Park area  close to restaurants and shops  Quiet neighborhood  I felt very safe  and the bed was fabulous  I appreciated your quick responses to my text messages  The place looks great and would have been perfect if not for the shower clog     Bathroom was clean but tub shower was clogged  I was standing in inches of water while I took a shower   Ick 
463559632,the condo is near the convention center and provided a nice respite from busy days of meetings  The back patio with swing chair was a delightful way to recoup  However  the check in process left me feeling very unsafe  I arrived  and had communicated what time I would be arriving  and called through the building intercom  No one answered while it rang and rang and rang  No one responded to messages through airBnb  There was no other contact information  Fortunately  a building resident happened along and let me into the building  When someone finally messaged me the next morning I never received an explanation  an apology  nor a plan to remedy the situation in the future  You need to address arrivals  I felt very unsafe and I do not appreciate never receiving an answer as to what happened when I brought the matter to your attention  when I arrived I called art the door to the apartment building as instructed and NO ONE ANSWERED to let me in  I was left alone  late at night  standing on the street with no way to reach anyone or get into the apartment  Fortunately  a resident of the building came by and let me in to the complex  No one responded to my messages through AirBnB  When someone finally messaged me the next morning I never received an explication as to why no one answered  Very unsafe check in      No one answered when I arrived to let me into the apartment building  leaving me alone  with no way to reach anyone late at night  No one responded to messages through AirBnB  When someone finally responded the next morning they did not provide an explanation nor an apology  near the convention center but neighborhood is rather deserted in evening
462972393,Great location in beautiful Hyde Park  close to the Metra station  convenient for getting to the McCormick Convention Center in under    minutes   The unit is a quiet top floor apartment  with a comfortable bed  large desk for working  air conditioning for hot days  and easy check in out   Amenities are basic  but cover the necessities    Definitely recommend checking out the Seminary Cafe for delicious breakfast lunch options  lovely patio seating  and the Seminary Co Op bookstore right next door to the Robie House when exploring the neighborhood   Thanks  Zencity  Hi there   We had a very nice stay at Blackstone Villas   Appreciated the easy check in out  the cleanliness  the great location  the quiet night time hours  the air conditioner  the desk in the kitchen  and the comfortable bed     A few thoughts  just FYI    The smell of cleaning products was overwhelming and unpleasant when we came in  and took several hours to dissipate  you might consider switching to a lower scent product   We needed more clothes hangers in the closet  there were only two hangers    Aesthetics would be improved if you hung a curtain to hide the storage shelves with extra supplies    Many thanks    Tamara
635193863,Had a great stay  The rooftop was a wonderful place to watch fireworks  Lots of great stops nearby and easy access to the interstate  A very charming neighborhood  Only thing Id add is paper towels 
452018963,Nice location with a safe and secure building  Overall unit was very nice and clean  We had a lot of trouble getting the bathroom fixed so we could use it  When it is the only bathroom and your stay is quick it is very important for it to be useable  Your call message  center was very prompt but it seemed like they didnt have much control or power to fix the situation  When I asked to speak with a supervisor I was told there wasnt one  It would have been nice to be able to speak to someone who can make something happen  We spent a portion of our morning and early afternoon trying to find somewhere we could shower before a wedding and also had to go downstairs to the lobby to use the bathroom  Not very convenient and not what we paid for  Had a issue with the plumbing in the bathroom which made the shower and toilet unusable  We reached out and were able to talk to someone immediately to report the issue however  we were told we would receive a call back and it was marked urgent but we didnt receive a call back  They did fix the bathroom just before we needed to shower and get ready for a wedding  Overall it took about    hours from the time we first reported and about      business hours to have the bathroom useable 
367835287,This is a   floor    bedroom   and a half bath unit with a large outdoor patio area  This is NOT a fully furnished unit being occupied by current tenants like you would expect from an air bnb  instead  this is a bare bone unit furnished only to the extent of a hotel that is being rented out by some sort of rental company solely for profit  For starters  the unit smelled strongly of cleaning products upon entering  and somehow smelled strongly of cigarette odour upstairs  we messaged right away asking them why this unit smells of smoke despite it being a non smoking unit  and they responded saying that it is a non smoking unit  That was their only response  Obviously the last renters smoked in it and Zencity tried to cover it up with Fabuloso  which was obvious thats all they did  What good is the      cleaning fee if you smoke if the owners dont even use it to make the extra effort   Any way  this place is up on air bnb purely for the profit of ZenCity  The only amenities are towels pillows cups  bowls  and plates  and some Pert shampoo and  Mountain Fresh  body wash  Its very obvious they invested the least they could in this place  Good luck drying your hair because there is no hair dryer  and good luck making coffee because there is no coffee maker  just a French press in the kitchen with all the stickers and tags still in it  clearly not used or cleaned  I couldnt even wash it because there wasnt even a sponge to clean it lol  I asked my boyfriend  how am I supposed to clean this   And he responded  with the      cleaning fee  which was pretty funny  The place isnt finished with patches in the ceiling and exposed wires in the closets  Would only be perfect for parties  which are not allowed without incurring an extra      fee  Wouldnt recommend this place for a couples night or even a family travelling unless you want to bring your whole house with you  Take your      a night and get a nice hotel or a real air bnb  The idea of renting an air bnb is to rent a fully furnished apartment that is currently occupied by people that leave you access to all amenities that anyone living in a nice apartment would actually have to share  not a bare bone unit furnished only to the extent of a hotel that strongly smells of cleaning product and  somehow  cigarettes  Entire second floor smelled of cigarettes  Seriously  Not ok  Great for a party  which is not allowed  not great for sleeping   people  upstairs bedrooms heard lots of strange noises including what sounded like people entering the front door multiple times  unsure why that was 
563016441,The building was under construction which was made clear prior to booking which was fine  The room itself was easy to get to  the building was centrally located and close to downtown  I was surprised at how nice everything was for the price   However  a mouse did run in from under the door and I put a hand towel down to keep it out  Again there was construction so that  didnt bother me too much because the doors are left open a lot for them to work  On my last morning there  I thought I heard someone using the keypad on the door but wasnt sure if it wasnt just the apartment next door  Upon getting out of bed it became apparent someone had in fact gotten into the apartment  stepped in and left  I didnt hear them walk in  but did hear the door open  It may have been a construction worker  but someone else had the access code to the apartment and could have easily come in while I was gone from the apartment or whilst sleeping which is what happened  So that should be addressed for future stays 
310639960,I really like Zencity as a host they have a great modern style to their homes  Everything was great the TV even had Netflix and this home is very cozy for a nice night of Netflix and Chill  Neighborhood is beautiful and really easy commute to any where in Chicago   Chris was great at hearing out my concerns and we talked about the minor cleanliness issues I had  I can  be obssesive compulsive over cleaning   It was nice to have someone listen and understand  Thank You Chris  I had a nice time   Thank you  Had a good time will stay again if the minor issues are fixed   Floor could have been swept properly 
367321332,I would recommend this unit to any and all of my friends  It is just as beautiful as the pictures make it look  The location is very central and walkable  There are nearby affordable garages for parking using Park Whiz  The host is responsive and available  And the unit offers many small details that other places do not  For example in the bedroom there were small shelves on both sides of the bed  along with outlets for charging our phones at night  If wed had iPhones it would have been even more convenient as there chargers provided  The kitchen is great and includes a dishwasher and full size stove  oven and fridge  as well as cabinet space and everything needed to prepare a full meal  The larger bedroom has a walk in closet and large private bathroom with both a stand alone shower and a tub  And the couch folds down to provide a third sleeping option  It was January when we visited so we didnt make use of it  but there is also a balcony with chairs that would be lovely in warmer weather  It was a    Uber ride  only    if you choose the carpool option  to the Magnificent Mile and all of the shopping  restaurants  the Art Institute  and Millennium Park  The El and buses were also available  This place is great and was perfect for our needs  We would definitely stay here again  Thank you for a great stay  I will leave a glowing public report because this is definitely a place we would rent again  The doorknob issue will be resolved Im sure  But it would be helpful if there were at least two key fobs  especially since the place is able to be rented up to five people  For our own personal taste too we would have preferred a coffeemaker instead of a French press  but thats our own preference  not an issue with the unit  Thanks again for getting us back into the unit and for providing such a lovely place for a very affordable price  We look forward to staying with Zencity again  The bathroom could have been more thoroughly cleaned  It wasnt really dirty  just a few spots on the tub and toilet that could have been a little cleaner  Definitely not a deal breaker and on the whole the unit was very clean  We had an issue getting locked out of our unit and it took a little while to get open communication  It seemed as if the people we were communicating with just could not understand that we were locked out of the unit and not the building  Once that was made clear things moved much faster 
561513050,Its a decent space thats close to everything  Its missing small things that become inconvenient    the host is accessible and responds quickly  Thanks for the accommodations  I really recommend that you have someone live in the space to complete it  Its missing so many small things like a place to hang your towel in the shower  directions for the television  a coffee pot with coffee available  trash cans in the room  better lighting in the bedroom  the bulb needs to be replaced and many other small things    the odor is a serious issue to live with   
555490823,Were frequent visitors to St  Louis and our usual spot was booked for this particular week so we took a chance here  The space is fine and ideal for those flying in with no car  Parking is a little tricky in this area with your choices being metered street parking or hourly rates in parking garages  The actual space is clean  tidy  and small  ideal if youre not spending too much time in the actual apartment    The downfall of this place is the ever changing receptionists  On our second night staying a receptionist abruptly stopped us as we walked in asking in an accusatory tone  do you live here   We told her we were with the Airbnb and she looked us up and down before clicking away silently at her computer  We awkwardly waited for the elevator before she said a few more unwelcoming things to us regarding the elevator and the  rules   It was completely bizarre and unwelcoming 
364483903,Overall my stay was good  The location can not be beat  You are close to everything  However  the one major issue I had was the cleanliness of the apartment  You are charged a cleaning fee in addition to the room charge which is totally fine except that I expected to walk into a clean apartment  Instead I walked in to find the floors in the kitchen had clearly not been cleaned and there had clearly been something spilled  The bathroom floors were covered with hair  The bed linens and blanket were covered with all different hairs and when I brought this to the hosts attention I was assured that they were clean but that there were extras in the closet if I wished to use them  I pulled them out only to find there were a bunch of big yellow stains on them and again  more hair  Overall I enjoyed my stay  I just wish that it would have been thoroughly cleaned before my arrival especially since there is specifically a cleaning fee  The floors in the kitchen had clearly not been cleaned and there had clearly been something spilled  The bathroom floors were covered with hair  The bed linens were covered with hair and when I was told they were definitely clean but that there were extras in the closet in case I pulled them out only to find there were a bunch of big yellow stains on them and again  more hair  You are charged a cleaning fee when you book which is totally understandable but if Im paying for a cleaning fee I expect the place to Actually have been thoroughly cleaned when I arrive 
553274603,Jazzy  clean and affordable  Right by the park  the hospital and the zoo  Very up scaled neighborhood with fine dining and adventures near by  Will stay in another Zencity property in the near future   A    This suite was very nice and extremely close to BJCs campus where I am a travel nurse  from out of state  beginning a    wk assignment in said facility  Looking forward to many more stay with the Zencity brand if possible  This establishment has a sister building just  down the street with the same address  Friendly waitstaff at both places nonetheless  Consistency in prices when adding an extra day or two during the same week 
551698970,Located in a    story apartment complex across the street from Forest Park  Easy check in and great location  Space is unspectacular but nice  No central heat and air  but window units    Unfortunately  Zencity  the managing firm  failed to respond when I contacted them about an issue with Netflix and HBO not working due to too many users  likely spread same account over multiple properties   This was an amenity they really promoted    It was not clearly discussed in the AirBnB ad or the check in instructions  but there is no on site parking provided  The garage is for apartment residents only  You either have to park in the designated lot   blocks away for     night or get lucky with metered street parking in a busy area  This came as quite a surprise when we checked in  Overall  the place was an okay value  Would definitely stay in this area again but would stay away from a Zencity property 
547259243,Beautiful  stylish place  great location  great amenities  thoughtful touches throughout  Once youre there  you absolutely wont regret the place    very clean  cool decor  everything you need in the kitchen  pretty good WiFi  not perfect  reliability  etc  Just be aware that this is a business renting out the place  which is of course happening more and more  not the friendly old model of people renting out their own place  so communication  flexibility  and the human touch can be a bit more  corporate  than other AirBNBs  Nevertheless  the apartment and the building itself are great and the location is fantastic in the heart of CWE  very close to WUSM   BJH SLCH and public transportation  Please let your cleaning staff know that check out time is   am  not     am  No need to wake someone up early  Changed check in procedure at the last second that led to a lot of wasted time  Very corporate  Disparate response times    fast when it suits them but slow when it doesnt  Lower price    St Louis is not an expensive city 
446915099,This place was nice but the couch was worn out   The furniture needs to be updated a bit  I hate to say anything bad since it was only    dollars a night 
362593580,Had a great time here   The place was clean  the bed was comfy  and the location actually is pretty good  The bus stops around the corner and will take you to the center of the city within    minutes  The neighborhood is safe and not far from a university campus  and the apartment has a lake view that is very pretty at sunrise  There is even a garage for those who are driving   There were some drawbacks  though please note they were very minor   I am a person that really does badly with moisturizing soaps and hair care products since they make me break out  If you are like me  bring your own toiletries  If you want this place  try flying into Midway and not OHare  since the latter is a schlep of huge proportions  Had a great time here   The place was clean  the bed was comfy  and the location actually is pretty good  The bus stops around the corner and will take you to the center of the city within    minutes  The neighborhood is safe and not far from a university campus  and the apartment has a lake view that is very pretty at sunrise  There is even a garage for those who are driving   There were some drawbacks  though please note they were very minor   I am a person that really does badly with moisturizing soaps and hair care products since they make me break out  If you are like me  bring your own toiletries  If you want this place  try flying into Midway and not OHare  since the latter is a schlep of huge proportions 
362546015,Not recommend  The host would be so unresponsive and  irresponsible when you encounter some problem even though it is not your fault  In my case  he just told me to call the building technician  which was not free  when I was locked out  because I got no key on check in and  the two locks on the door both work  Now the host still ignores my request for the reimbursement of the stupid money I paid   Last issue   the Wifi is not so stable and fast even after being restarted  We did not get the fob to the main entrance when we checked and no one sent it to us after we notified the host The bedsheet looks quite old and a little bit wore out The host is so irresponsible  Firstly  he did not inform us that there were two locks for the door which both worked well  When we were locked out because of the door knob lock  he just told us to call the building maintenance and did not send us the key  In the end  we had to pay eighty dollars to the technician for sending us the key  Ironically  he sent two of his men to disable the door knob lock the next day and finally gave me the fob but still did not admit that it was totally his faut 
361859848,This apartment is beautiful  comfortable and in an amazing location  This was the first time I went with a more luxurious Airbnb option and spent quite a bit over my budget  It would have been a dream and totally worth it if our car didnt get towed        when parked on the street immediately in front of the apt  we have photos of the street signs making no suggestion that we couldnt park there and the parking machines were not accepting payment because it was a Sunday evening   I almost missed my flight because my partners car was at the tow yard on Christmas Day  Zencity should absolutely give warnings and advice or guidance for parking  It was a huge blow financially  Otherwise everything would have been amazing  Amazing place  Beautifully kept  HUGE disappointment that our car got towed the morning we were checking out  I suggest zencity warn guests about that and give some guidance beforehand  Our car got towed from what seemed to be an open street spot directly in front of the apt building  We took photos of the parking signs that gave no hint that we couldnt park there overnight  There were no instructions  suggestions  warnings or tips for parking by the owners of the apartment unit  We had to pay      the next morning and I almost missed my flight home  It was Christmas Eve  Huge bummer  I dont blame Airbnb or zencity but I absolutely think zencity should offer tips and support for parking  A parking option or suggestion 
360200802,My experience at Zen City was far less than Ive come to expect from my dozens of similar stays  The process felt efficient but rather cold and not human   My biggest complaint is when arriving on time  not being able to access the apartment and having to stand outside with my luggage for a half hour until the cleaning person came out to hand me the keys for access  I was able to quickly reach Zen City on the telephone  and I was told theyd take care of the issue ASAP however    minutes later when I asked the cleaning staff if they had been notified of my inability to access the apartment I was told flatly  No   This was a very disappointing way to start my stay   On a positive note about the space was as advertised and clean but with chintzy furnishings that speak to the not personal feeling I experienced during my stay  Call centers and automated responses that feel productive but cold and with a lack of any human touch  My experience at Zen City was far less than Ive come to expect from my dozens of similar stays  The process felt efficient but rather cold and not human   My biggest complaint is when arriving on time  not being able to access the apartment and having to stand outside with my luggage for a half hour until the cleaning person came out to hand me the keys for access  I was able to quickly reach Zen City on the telephone  and I was told theyd take care of the issue ASAP however    minutes later when I asked the cleaning staff if they had been notified of my inability to access the apartment I was told flatly  No   This was a very dissapointing way to start my stay   On a positive note about the space was as advertised and clean but with chintzy furnishings that speak to the not personal feeling I experienced during my stay  Call centers and automated responses that feel productive but cold and with a lack of any human touch  Upon timely arrival  I had to wait thirty minutes to access the apartment  Standing in the freezing cold while waiting for the cleaning crew to finish up  not being asked in from the out of doors in the meantime  I was able to contact host  but the host did not contact the cleaning staff to alert them i was outside 
310513895,the absolute best feature is the location  Great neighborhood lots of cool eating  drinking  shopping options nearby    minute walk to the Blue Line makes the entire city accessible  felt very safe     the place is clean  the beds were very comfortable and clean  and communication with the host was awesome  great linens  comfy towels   well stocked   Even has an Alexa that was fun to tool around with     some things to just be aware of case youre not paying attention to the description    one of the bedrooms has a cutaway in the top half of the wall that opens to the living room  the room is still private  however you can hear all the sounds from the rest of the apartment  the apartment itself is quiet  Did not hear Neighbors  you do not hear the train either  not the hosts fault but the common area hallways had two different smoke detectors chirping a low battery beep every few minutes the entire first night and part of the second night  until maintenance was able to replace the batteries     as of this writing the entrance stairwell to the building  some of the common area and other apartments in the building are undergoing renovations  it should not bother you but note that the common area is not prestine  there is unfinished drywall and construction remnants about   until that is done   the stairwell area is in a transitive state    the only other complaint is that as well stocked as the apartment is   feel it should have a coffee maker in the kitchen   but there are several coffee places nearby   Kinelas was an awesome breakfast spot     all in all   good value  comfortable and clean   I would recommend this to you and friends        thanks for the quick responses and attending to things that came up while carrying luggage and dealing with an unfamiliar place it just seems superfluous to have to locate a scooter across the street and fumble through several lock boxes  its just an added inconvenience and comes across as amateur the space is obviously intended to and is clean  Perhaps a bit nitpicky but the place has not apparently been subject to a deep clean with dust bunnies abundantly  observed in corners  on window sills  under the curtains  to be clear the place is clean just not perfect   stars
535544411,The location cannot be beat and the apartment is nice  Its very sparse with few of the necessary items including eating utensils and a coffee pot  There is no onsite parking  no instructions about how to use anything  Ive stayed in many places that were not corporately owned and received better  how to  manuals and guidance to the area  There is only   spoon in the apartment  No extra light bulbs or towels  We were very disappointed with the cleanliness and the lack of concern for actually helping us have a good experience while we were there  The floor wasnt swept or mopped  There was food stuck to the floor in the kitchen  There was dried fresh blood on a pillow case  The countertop in the kitchen wasnt wiped either  There were no instructions on how to make coffee with the coffee press or the hot water pot  There were no instructions about the television  We struggled just to find local news  There were no instructions on where to park off site  or where to shop 
668105669,This is fine for the price  but definitely not the level of hospitality I am used to with Airbnb  When we checked in  no bath towels had been provided  The host sent some over eventually but we were out and they were left on the hallway floor   kind of unsanitary  The kitchen was only partially stocked  only   spoon    bowls  etc    definitely not what I would consider a fully stocked kitchen  The location was ok  no one in the building wore masks in the hallways or elevators and one night someone was running through the hall and stairs screaming late in the night  It could have been worse  but I wouldnt stay with this host again  No welcome page with instructions  missing towels in the apartment  Chunks of Hair in bedroom on the floor and stuck to the nightstand  Dishes left in dishwasher  only sponge provided in kitchen had been used  had hair on it 
358813156,We loved this space and this location    Walking distance from so many goodies  Thanks again  We really enjoyed our stay  The code being incorrect kind of started things off poorly because we were stuck in the cold for about    minutes just trying the code over and over again while we waited on a solution  Other than that  the stay was great and we really enjoyed the space and location  The code to get in was incorrect so we were not able to get into the apartment at first  Within    minutes  someone came and gave us the correct code and we were able to get in 
358224193,Dont expect communication other than an answering service that goes unanswered  They just disappear behind cancellation charges and no compassion for legitimate excuse for cancellation and rebooking  Then raise the rates the next week for same nights  Cold and opportunistic  Never will rebook with them  No response to many communications you said I could cancel and then charge  night stay I know that was your policy but you didnt have to enforce it and could have rebooked me for same days the next week that I asked for  Instead you charge      more for the list day and increased rates the next week  Bad busines  Never responded to my communication other than saying I could cancel before I arrived but still charged  night stay  I booked the wrong week 
355319648,My stay at your apartment was ok but the there was hair on top of the bedroom sheets   under the bedroom sheets  There was also the same hair that was on the bed on the bathroom floor under the mat   ALOT OF IT     Never found the tv remote but used the app on my cell phone host suggested  My stay at your apartment was ok but the there was hair on top of the bedroom sheets   under the bedroom sheets  There was also the same hair that was on the bed on the bathroom floor under the mat   ALOT OF IT     Never found the tv remote but used the app on my cell phone host suggested 
354421849,The apartment was decorated beautifully  it was available last minute  and was a short car ride away from where I was visiting  Its a great value for a spacious studio all to yourself  Chris responded very quickly to my concerns  Any issues I had were resolved in a timely manner  I would definitely recommend this place  Thank you for a speedy response time  Some feedback Id like to offer is that you gave me incorrect information about the keys  It was a little stressful to have been given the wrong keys once  then once I did get the correct keys  the numbers did not match up with the directions  In the apartment  it was WAY too hot  and the radiator in the bathroom was making this loud whistling noise all night which woke me up a few times  Im offering this feedback privately because these are minor issues and I dont want to deter people from staying in your property  It was beautiful otherwise  and a great value for having the whole place to myself  Not as close as advertised  but still in a great spot 
353775179,Good location  Should let guest know not to turn on bedroom radiator  I it gives up toxic chemicals  I think many guest would also appreciate not using febreeze    or any cleaner with fragrance  makes air too smelly and unhealthy to breathe in  Thanks for quick responds  Bathtub Bad smell in the building
350156382,A great location to downtown and easy walking distance to many shops and restaurants  Apartment was the perfect size for my husband and I to get away for the weekend and the tv with Netflix was a nice touch  A little difficult to find at first and may have to pay for parking but we were able to find street parking for free  I would recommend this location for anyone wanting to find a cheap way to go to Chicago for the weekend  Thank you for the stay  we enjoyed the shops and restaurants so close  Loved being so close to downtown as well  I think a fan would a good idea in the bedroom  it gets very hot with the comforter you have  Maybe another sheet for the bed as well  But bed very comfortable and a very stylish apt  Thanks again for the stay we had a nice time   The tub was clogged after one use  Something was dripping in the fridge on the ground  not sure what it was because we didnt use the fridge   Not your fault but the hallway and stairs were so dirty and it smelled  Great location near many stores but parking sucks  Cheaper then hotel with more space 
349497523,Location  ease of check in  and space were great  However the apartment heating system was quite warm and not adjustable  please adjust heat or leave instructions as to how to do it  I tried to turn the knob on a couple of the heaters but they were stuck and very hot  Also the black light fixture did not work  and a small power strip in the bedroom would help as I could not have the light on and charge devices  Other than that the location  space and ease of check in was great  but was so uncomfortable with the heat I would hesitate to book again  the second blanket that my daughter would have used for the couch bed was wadded up  dirty and on the floor in the closet  The rest of the apt was very clean  The apartment was very very hot  Probably at least    degrees  we got in at about    pm and could not figure out how to adjust the steam heat  even with a slightly open window it was uncomfortably hot in both rooms and skin parching dry 
709442996,Super nice place to stay  It was difficult to check in because we couldnt get up to the room without the key in the room  so we had to have other lets us in the elevator and take us to our floor 
349172710,Very clean  spacious  easy check in  responsive communication  would rent from Zencity again Hello  everything about my stay was great with the exception of one thing that ended up being a perfect storm  I left for coffee one morning and couldnt get back into my room even though I had my key to the deadbolt  Thats because apparently I had locked the door handle from the inside the night before and I guess I just assumed it would auto unlock once I opened the door on my way out  Thus I was locked out  and unfortunately my phone was in my room charging so I had difficulty communicating for help  Again  this was a perfect storm and I should take extra precaution to unlock the door handle  but to avoid these circumstances in the future I would suggest either providing a key to the handle lock or just removing the handle lock altogether and sticking with the deadbolt code key 
348905542,Check in was easy  the location is a short walk to the CTA rapid transit and the kitchen was very well equipped and stocked  The large bathroom is like going to a spa     Bed was very comfortable  The neighborhood is great and location near the CTA rapid transit is convenient  Parking is a bit of a hassle  since you cant park on the street without a permit  I rented a space through SpotHero at     night  about two short blocks away  The apartment is nothing short of delightful except for one thing  The climate control is challenging  It was at least    degrees warmer on the upper level  bedrooms  than the lower level  It would be nice if Zencity would look into that and better balance it  It might be good for air conditioning in the summer  but the heating in the winter was lacking   Still  I would stay there again  because of all the plusses  I hope Zencity will address the heating issue  The HVAC system does not appropriately control climate in the apartment  The upstairs is cooking hot and the downstairs level is cold  It seemed to be at least    degrees different  I believe with a little attention to this  this could be much better regulated  I asked twice if I would be able to check in early and did not receive a response  As it turns out  when I entered the apartment it was very cold  so it was clear it was vacant and I could have checked in early  had you been willing  Regardless  it would have been very helpful to at least have gotten a response to the question 
348860887,There were very responsive to my inquiries  Place as pictured  front desk staff was great  Hello   Thank you for being responsive during my stay for the most part  I did have comments about the shower that were never addressed  The temperature in the shower was either extremely hot or ice cold   A few constructive feedback  notes   There were dirty towels from the previous stay hanging on the bathroom  There was a skillet with shrimp and some kind of stir fry in the fridge  from a previous stay  and there was trash in the bedroom under the bed 
347005473,Overall the place is very nice  and the location is close to wicker park  The apartment is spacious and tastefully done  If you are looking for a homey place with character  this isnt really the place though  You can tell no one has ever lived here before  no hooks to hang your coats  the bed covers arent warm enough for a Chicago winter etc   There are no personal touches around the house  Dealing with zencity feels very corporate   they dont respond directly to your questions  but send canned messages  I made the above suggestions to them in a private email  but never got a response  I provided all of this information to you in a private message  One of the reasons I like Airbnb is for the personal touch  I felt zero personal touch in this whole interaction  Overall the house was very clean  However we kept finding little things that hadnt been checked  Extra duvet had food crusted on it  Microwave hadnt been cleaned  You can tell that this is one of those corporate air bnb situations  Canned answers  They would send a response that didnt actually respond to my questions comments  I sent all of these comments in a private message to the host and got a  thank you   please rate me   stars  which is why I am making ya comments public now 
345234767,This is truly a wonderful gem in the Wicker Park neighborhood   Great walk ability to restaurants and coffee just down the street      min Uber drive to Milwaukee street for shopping and what not    Not being from the Chicago area I relied heavily on this hoast to make recommendations and he did not disappoint   My girlfriend and I were very impressed with everything in the unit and all the recommendations we had time to check out     Two things stopped me from giving you a five star review   Most of the windows were quite dirty and full of dead bugs    Also there was what I imagine was dirty linens in a garbage bag in one of the closets  Not a big deal over all and honestly everything else was perfect   My lady and I had a fantastic time  hopefully we will have a chance to stay with you again    We left a beer donation in the fridge     I paid      or something for the night after all the taxes and fees   But when the place is listed for like      it seems like quite a jump in price    Also this place rents for     on almost any other night   Should be worth      maximum with all fees included 
343766949,The unit itself is very nice  Some things to note     HVAC noise   when the HVAC turned on off it sounded like someone taking a hammer to a filing cabinet      Upstairs Noise   the neighbor upstairs was an extremely heavy walker  And this occurred from      AM to well past   AM  Bring ear plugs     Bathroom Faucet   this was so loose that I had to hold it at the base in order to turn the water on off      Construction   there was extensive construction going on in the common building space  hallways  and units on my floor during my stay  The construction crew turned off the electricity for several hours in the middle of the day one day      WiFi   excellent connectivity     Roku   great value add service First lockbox didnt work  Contacted the host using up  went to Zencity and was told they couldnt help and that I needed to call Airbnb  Sent message using Airbnb and responded immediately with an alternative which worked without issue  Given construction was still underway in the building  it should be a bit less  Also electricity was out for several hours during the day as a result of the construction  When the HVAC kicked on off it sounded like someone taking a hammer to a metal filing cabinet  The bathroom faucet was hanging by a thread  had to hold it at the base to turn it on off 
343184354,Great host  very convenient location  Walking distance to CTA train  bus station and highways  Nice and safe neighborhood  I like the taste of the living room    Thanks for the host but please make sure the bed frame is stable enough  Everything was good expect for communication  I didnt get the key for the front gate till the last day  I had to call Zencity every time I was trying to get into the building     it caused lots of inconvenience 
339654566,Just as promised  this is a clean simple place to stay in Hyde Park  close to trains  the lake  and the university  I really do enjoy this location and I appreciate the simplicity of it  I have not cited how the elevator was not working on the opening night because I realize that could just have been bad luck  but the key issue was extremely distressing and I believe some money should have been taken off the fee because of that  After travelling and dealing with many obstacles to get there  not being able to get in and having to walk up with luggage was very frustrating  Nonetheless the location was just as promised once inside  I would prefer regular TV to all the bells and whistles of the television set up  by the way  because I cant watch something simple like the news or the Stephen Colbert show  But that is my only other concern  I did not receive a key for the outside door  Because I arrived late at night  this was very frustrating and I had to wait for someone to show up at the door  When I called  I had to ask multiple times before a solution was offered  I was not told until later the next day what to do about the problem  The problem around the key was a substantial concern 
334252131,If youre looking for a large  clean   BR   BA apartment   stop looking  This is it  Its only a      minute walk to the Blue Line where there are some amazing breakfast and coffee places  It was a great way to start each morning    As for the space itself  we found it extremely clean and open  After hectic  busy days in Chicago  the minimalistic style was just what we needed  Thank you for hosting us  The only suggestion Id make is to put a little more personality in the space  In one sense  it was great that it was so clean  In another sense  the space didnt look like it had much thought put into the decor  Not a huge deal at all  Still a great experience  The door alarm went off when we first came in and it kept going off sporadically each time we went in and out  Thought it was user error at first  but by the end of our stay  it really seemed like something was wrong with it  When checking out  the door wouldnt lock  it would try and fail  and then the alarm would go off again  After    or so failed attempts  it finally worked  Not a huge deal  and we still had a great experience  Just thought you should know 
334248391,Location in Hyde Park is great  If your trip is mostly downtown you might not like being so far by public transit since the buses are a bit unreliable  But Hyde Park is beautiful and the block is quiet and comfortable  The apt is very clean and was a great fit for us two  The couch is not comfortable for lounging for too long but does the job  The bed is super comfortable and the apt clean  We recommended they invest in some more kitchen items if youre inclined to cook  We loved the location  And comfortable bed  The kitchen supplies were a little sparse  We had to go out and buy olive oil and salt  We left for the next guests  Also there was tray for the dishes to place the dish rack on  There is also no counter space to cut anything bc toaster and hot water heater takes up space  There were no mixing bowls or pans  Last comment is that we found the couch quite uncomfortable when watching a movie  The hallway also smells  Black mold  Otherwise great  City of Chicago levies an airbnb tax as of August      and it was marathon wknd  We paid more than we would have expected
333694054,This was my first Airbnb experience and I was definitely not happy with the management  Arriving after waiting all day to check in only to find that the unit had not been cleaned was quite disappointing and highly inconvenient  The dishes were not clean despite being in the cabinet so we were unable to cook  There was also a problem with the entertainment WiFi so we were unable to watch TV until we purchased our own HDMI cable  I am hesitant to use Airbnb again due to this extremely poor experience  This was my first Airbnb experience and I was definitely not happy with the management  Arriving after waiting all day to check in only to find that the unit had not been cleaned was quite disappointing and highly inconvenient  The dishes were not clean despite being in the cabinet so we were unable to cook  There was also a problem with the entertainment WiFi so we were unable to watch TV until we purchased our own HDMI cable  I am hesitant to use Airbnb again due to this extremely poor experience 
332606737,Great Host  Always quick and available when I had questions  Great location 
332574093,The hot water was out one morning  cold shower before work  and the host response time was very poor  Six hours to respond the message     hours to get someone out there  All the responses started with  Sorry for the delayed response      I cant stay here again because if something goes wrong  like basic necessities fail or the front door lock fails  Im afraid it will take   hours for the host to check his messages and two days to get anyone out to the property  As a business traveler this is a risk I can not tolerate  The slow to no response time when the hot water was out only made us wonder what would happen if the electronic front door lock failed  How long we would be on the street   Great location and a great place  but we are business travelers and wont be able to stay here again  One morning we woke to no hot water   I messaged and texted the host at      AM  and again later in the morning  I didnt here back until about      PM    he had  put in a request with maintenance    Follow up text was not answered until after we came back from a day of work to no hot water  SO that meant cold showers  again  All the hosts replies started with  Sorry for the delayed response       We found the poorly labeled fuse box and threw fuses until the hot water heater reset  I messaged the host  he responded late  again and still sent a guy out the following evening       hour response time for a hot water outage  which would have been two days of cold showers if we didnt take matters into our own hands  The uncertainty that if anything went wrong there would be no to slow response ruined the stay  I imagine if the electronic lock failed we would be on the street for the night 
330594952,Nice place  kitchen smelt like gas and the oven wasnt working properly  The hallway to get to the room smelt like fish and the hallway was always dirty  The room itself was small but cute  Just had issues with the kitchen and the smell and there was hair all over the bathroom door from a previous stay im guessing  The keys were in the wrong order as to which one we were directed on using for specific doors  There was hair all over the door that was there as soon as we walked in  The kitchen had a foul odor  The hallway to our room smelt like fish  It took us    minutes to find a parking spot  We were under the impression there was going to be a parking lot 
330575315,Very good lake view  albeit with a significant obstruction  The apartment was quite clean  though the bathroom mirror was spattered  Shower head initially not working well  though was fixed very fast upon my complaint  Furniture ok  in good condition  Generally pleasant in the apartment  The building is bustling    what was a notorious disaster in the     s has become lively and cheerful  reasonably clean and stylish though inevitably a bit beat up  The elevators are really preposterous  though    filthy  badly adjusted  with weird  scary doors  HVAC quite bad  uncontrollable temperature  lung  and nose irritating bad air  Thanks for getting the shower leak fixed  But really        a month in Regents Park   smh   as the kids say  Mirror was spattered  also the building is on the beat up side  particularly in the elevators  which are filthy and erratic Good lake view  with significant obstructions   somewhat out of the way  but convenient to Lake Shore Drive  without any discernable breakfast or coffee opportunities    the plunger coffee in the apartment was not useful because there is no milk to be had within blocks Just exorbitant  Assuming full occupancy  ZenCity is collecting nearly       a month on what is  to be perfectly frank  a small apartment in a legendary dump of a building  with HVAC that led both of us to respiratory irritation and no discernable temperature control  The furniture is OK but nothing special  and they slapped a coat of chalk white paint over everything  Ultimately  though          a month  The reasonable rent on this apartment would be  generously         There are of course management costs  and the furniture  which eat away some of this difference  but so what  the cost is preposterous  If that is what  the market will bear   then the market is preposterous  and society should do something to hem it in 
328581629,We appreciated our two nights at the apartment  It was easy to get downtown  Be aware that parking on the street isnt easy  Everything was provided to be able to cook and there is a supermarket close  The only thing we didnt like is that we were expecting to relax at the apartment after a big day in the city but the couch wasnt comfortable  We had a good time in the apartment  It would be nice to have a comfortable coach to sit on and relax after a big day discovering the city  In addition  the apartment is really warm and humid  The air conditioning is nice but really loud during the night  Dust under the bed
328262079,Beautiful space  Good location  only a    minute uber ride to downtown  Would definitely stay again  Only issue was the check in directions were incorrect which led to making numerous phone calls to figure out where the key was located 
325721274,the bathroom flooded   times  Water overflowed  Notified the owner said he would send maintenance and when we came back from dinner water was still there and bathroom was not clean  went and got maintenance from the front desk and stayed up till   am cleaning everything  Next morning used it again over flowed and just decided it was time to leave  Told the owner we used the clean towels to make a barricade so water would not flow into the living room asked to send towels in the morning  sent them at   pm next day  Ruined our first night in Chicago  Nice place  just never renovated the bathroom  Asked the maintenance if it was our fault even tho we only used it for number    he replied no the building has this issue 
321912890,First of all  The location was great   metra station and bus stops were really close and Wholefoods as well  The studio was definitely spacious for two  However  it looked like it was cleaned a while ago or the cleaner took very little time to clean the place  When we lifted up the comforter  there were little strands of hair everywhere on the sheet and some pillows smelled like somebody had just slept on it  I asked for extra sheets and Chris was kind enough to tell me that there were extra in the closet but majority of them were stained and not clean  Before you actually lie on the bed  check your beddings guys  The bathroom was clean but there were some used toiletries left behind  The check in and check out process was super easy and great  All the beddings including the extra one in the closet had either stains or hair on them  We had to sleep on top of the comforter with the towels covered  I really think you should tell the cleaners to pay attention to those  Also  I caught small roaches three days in a row  two coming from the stove and one coming from the bathroom   Food particles in the sink were there and we definitely didnt want to see that  Unwashed  beddings and uncleaned sink
626334904,This unit was not as clean as i expected it to be and it seems like the AC was broken the unit never dropped below     The location was great and the beds were comfy but i would think twice before staying here again  The unit was not clean once we got there  The dishwasher was full of dishes that we didnt realize until the last day at the unit  We cleaned the kitchen counter that was covered in dirt and dust  The carpet in the living room looks like it hasnt been vacuumed in a while its full of hair and lent  The unit was also hot the ac never dropped below    the entire time we were here  I did appreciate beds which were comfy and the bedrooms seemed nice but the rest was a bit unexpected 
319171871,Had a great stay at Chriss place   The location is ideal if you are wanting to spend a weekend in Hyde Park   We were about a half mile from Lake Michigan with rental bikes around the corner   just a few minutes drive or a bike ride from The University of Chicago  and walking distance to restaurants and conveniences like Target and CVS   The drive into town takes less than    minutes on Lake Shore Drive or you can take an Express bus if you dont want to deal with parking   The apartment was very clean and check in was easy   I would give the place   stars instead of    but we had very low water pressure  like a small trickle at times in the shower  the whole weekend which could have been a fluke because of storms or some other issue  But  this may bother some guests more than others  Frank and I enjoyed our stay very much   The lack of water pressure was a bit disappointing and our internet was in and out a lot  but we were able to manage both just fine    A future guest may be more grumpy about this than we were   Just heads up  not a serious complaint   The location was perfect for us since my daughter was moving in just up the street 
317712697,Our stay at Zencity was great  the location was a   min walk to a grocery store and the train station which was good  The host was able to assist with our inquiries on a timely manner and was very friendly  Thank you for allowing us to stay at your lovely place during our stay in Chicago  Thank you so much for allowing us to stay at your place  We had a great time during our stay  We just werent sure what to do with the garbage afterwards  we wanted to dispose it as it may have been a bit smelly but wasnt sure where we could have thrown it  lol but aside from that  we had a lovely time  Thank you again
316123877,Comfy modern   Bdrm flat   On  rd floor  stairs only   Full kitchen  washer and dryer ensuite   Big screen w  all online streaming services  good WiFi   Couple blocks from public transportation  market  restaurants   Free street parking if you can find it  Beyond the WiFi issues   which you managed well  a comfy place   With more rain after my first communication  it appears you have a couple roof leaks   Id fix before more damage     Front door privacy issue   Anyone can look right in  absolutely needs privacy measure   Wife said light over stove n g  maybe just a bulb    We entered from the stairwell right by the door  and it is both filthy and dangerous   I slipped on paper trash  not hurt but very bad first impression for guests entering from that direction   Beyond these  a comfy space    Thanks  Hair around bathroom    floor and tub   Mold around tub water knob and jets   Lots of spiders   Though not unit specific  the stairwell and street entrances very dirty  Area has a rough feel  in da hood   Not real comfy on street after dark  Large variance in daily cost between  st    nd bookings   Averaged out ok  but a bit ahead of our budget  and the cummulative fees push that even a bit higher   Given the cleaning fee  it should have been cleaner 
314476668,Place is ok for the value  No central Air so it got a but warm at night  Overall a good stay 
310497284,Great location with views of Lake Michigan and easy access to the Lake Michigan shorefront trail to downtown  We parked our car  found a free spot right in front   and left it there for the weekend   took our bikes everywhere  Building was nicely refurbished  with a sense of history  Would love to have more info on the history of the building  Perhaps a flyer about the area the history of the building  etc  would be helpful   Great location and wonderful views of the lake  Bed was comfortable   Good and prompt responses to our questions from our host  We wished there as a little more comfortable place to sit in the living area  Couch wasnt very comfortable and cushions were coming a part a bit  some trash under the bed  one of the towels in the bathroom had brown spots on it   wasnt sure if they were stains or if it was used
307070936,The good  an extraordinary location  Clean  good quality linens  Good number of towels  Super easy check in and arrival instruction  and quick response to questions  The bad  both the buildings common areas and the apartment itself where lacking a thorough cleaning  dusting   sweeping  vacuuming   At times there is even a perceptible tobacco smell within the apartment  The couch was super dusty  These are easily corrected faults that would have improved our perception enormously   Hi  The apartment is in an outstanding location  However our overall experience was affected by the overwhelming amount of dust on the floors  the couch  and the either old or very dirty carpet  Also  you are missing basic amenities like coffee filters  Definitely would improve the experience with a grater focus on the guest and its user experience  El edificio est  descuidado y se ve que no lo limpian habitualmente  La alfombra del pasillo est  muy sucia e incluso dentro del departamento llega olor a Tabaco  El departamento no estaba bien barrido  con montones de polvo alrededor de los muebles  La percepci n de calidad baj  enormemente por el polvo que encontramos en todo el departamento 
307034269,The host communicated quickly and attentively and we were able to check in easily  Street parking was easy to find  Decor is fine  The location is good if you need to be at the University of Chicago  in fact  it used to be U of C student housing  which the administration recently sold off   I feel that the accommodations are slightly overpriced  as a result  given that the building is basically still student housing  My one issue was that the bed sheet was clearly a little too small for the bed  It kept coming off the mattress  
303132949,It was overall decent but not worth the price we paid for this during the weekend   While the stay was nice  it wasnt worth spending      a night here  I felt ripped off 
300652200,A day before check in  Chris sent me a note which said he would tell me how to check into the unit after I       respond with a quick confirmation that you understand not to mention youre an Airbnb guest      FYI in case that bothers you   Not sure if you care  but this really isnt up to the standard I expect for airbnb  For example  the linens shouldnt have any stains  Also  about half of the drawers in the unit werent attached to rails and the bathroom  
299236094,My husband grew up in Hyde Park and his parents lived a block from this AirBnB for    years  so we are very familiar with the neighborhood  On the positive side  this is a small building located in the middle of a quiet tree lined street  The apartment faces the rear   a quiet  private open yard  This apartment is an easy walk to the University of Chicago  its two fantastic bookstores  and to two of our favorite restaurants   the Nile  with superb Middle East food is a block a away  Corea Cafe has homemade Korean food on   th and is always popular  There is also a large grocery store and many other cafes and coffee spots to stock the refrigerator very close by  The unit itself was very clean  airy  and appealing studio with a dining alcove facing the rear garden area  a full kitchen  plus a very large walk in closet  On the negative side  besides difficulties getting checked into the property  due to the prior guests late departure  we discovered two major quirks  We arrived on a hot day and found the window unit was running  keeping the place cool  The apartment has a large flat screen TV on a wall near the bed  After much confusion  we eventually discovered that the outlets used to plug in the air conditioner  the television and bedside lamp were only live when you turned on a wall switch in the kitchen alcove that also turned on the overhead lights in the kitchen  If we wanted the kitchen lights off  we basically were shutting off the power to the the air conditioner  the TV and the ability to light the bedside lamp or charge our phones  Another wall switch by the door worked in a similar way  There was no welcome materials provided to help guests navigate these peculiarities and we finally gave up and opened the windows  We soon realized there is a fire station a block a way with sirens blaring for much of Saturday night  The tenant above could be heard moving about and getting and out of bed  Airplanes also seemed to be flying by frequently  We realize all of this is out of the control of the host  and others may not be as bothered as we  In the bathroom  the shower pressure was adequate but the sink had two thin streams of water that ran from hot to tepid  We stayed two nights and check out is    am  At   am  loud banging and drilling began in a nearby apartment and the water to the entire building was shut off   a tenant with whom we spoke that any units are being renovated and water shut offs are not infrequent  Luckily we had showered and packed  but were not able to flush the toilet before leaving at   am  The only written info to welcome guests to the unit was a chalkboard in the kitchen with the WIFI and password written in chalk  Someone had rubbed off the    Improved communication would have helped overcome a variety of issues with our stay going and coming that would have at least prepared us for inconveniences  some of which were out of the hosts control  and some of which should be part of orienting the guest to what to expect   Flew to Chicago and waited for an hour and a half with our luggage in a public park until our room was available for check in   Arrived at the property at      pm and found no key in the lock box   After contacting Zen City  they called  back to inform us that the prior guests had misunderstood and thought they had booked for two nights  not one   At       the cleaning person came to the entryway with the room key and told us the guests had left shortly before   We ultimately got up to the room at     pm  Numerous issues were not described to the guest in advance   Lovely quiet tree lined street  near to many amenities  but also a block and a half from a busy firehouse   
298777247,Quiet neighborhood  I checked in for my weekend stay around   pm so after a long day at work we are ready to shower and chill  The water didnt drain that night or throughout my stay  I notified my host he responded right away but nothing was ever done about this huge inconvenience  Not being able to use the shower or tub from Friday till Sunday  On the day of my check in I was notified that the washer and dryer would be unavailable  I responded with thats ok  Still waiting for the host to rectify this inconvenience   Never returned my call about the tub 
297881275,Overall   the place was nice    Previous reviews mentioned noisy neighbors  which was the case  but thats not on the owner by any means  The neighbors were also smoking weed all through the night with the smell creeping into the bedroom  Again  thats not on the owner   There was quite a bit of hair on the bathroom and kitchen floors which made it seem as if there was zero vacuuming before our arrival   Bring a sleep mask  Theres a bright light outside of the bedroom window and the window curtain is piece of paper thin and white as a ghost  Some blackout curtains need to be installed if you want a quality night of sleep   The above issues arent a huge deal at the end of the day  The big issue was when my girlfriend came back in the middle of the day and found phone chargers on the kitchen table which were not there when we arrived the previous night  Im assuming the owner came to drop them off while we were not there  Im not sure what Air B Bs rule is for owners coming to the place during a customers stay  but thats screwed up  in my opinion  For one  I had my laptop and a few hundred dollars in cash in my bag  Two  my girlfriend had been in the shower at one point  so they could of knocked and just came in when she was in there    And no  I was not previously informed that he she would be stopping by   There was A LOT of hair on the floor which I had to vacuum  myself 
297860072,We had a great stay  The place was super clean   the check in process seamless  Very thoughtful gestures by Chris  with tea  eggs and sufficient toiletries kept there  He was very helpful suggesting local eateries and places   Nice neighborhood too Hi Chris thanks for having us  We had a great stay  Everything was perfect   You can check the flush though  It has a small problem  Regards  Shiv     
295535102,The location is very nice  Beautiful street with lots of trees  When we got there was impossible to park so we used a paid parking garage around the corner  I wish we had waited for a bit because spaces on the street do open up  just have to be patient  To go back and forth to downtown Chicago we used Uber pool which was about    on average each way for two people  On   rd street theres everything you might need  Target  Starbucks  CVS  restaurants  etc Chris sent us precise and clear instructions on how to get in  The building is old but has lots of character  the front lobby was being renovated which was badly needed  The apartment is beautiful if you like old style  It has lots of character and tons of storage space  Chris keeps it stored with all the basic amenities and more  The kitchen is very well equipped and clean  It has two bathrooms which is a bonus  The TV worked very well and the bed was very comfortable  Overall it was a great experience and would definitely stay again   Thanks for a very nice place  I suggest purchasing a bbq lighter for the stove  A Keurig coffee maker would be nice  We wish the TV had been in the bedroom as the couch wasnt very comfortable to watch TV   I would remove the area rug and bath mat Very nice area and beautiful street  If guest decide to Uber everywhere is perfect  otherwise public transportation doesnt seem to be handy  If it is it would be great if host left some direction on how to get to Chicago 
293661305,The place is beautiful  If you get hot at night or cant sleep in the heat like me not the place to stay during the hot parts of the year  There is a fan in the bedroom but the bed is not under it  There is a window a c  unit in the living room  The water pressure in the shower sucked but is not a big issue  Place was clean  Like really clean  As   girls we felt safe  Besides the heat at night I would have given   stars  But to be forced to sleep on the couch so I can sleep made the place a let down  Couch is nice tho  I think staying here in the winter would have been best for me   Places was pretty nice  But the a c  in the living room only was a big turn off  The bedroom was hot  The placement of the bed should be under the fan  I had to sleep on the couch due to the hotness in the room  The water pressure in the shower was crap  But the place did look nice  I can deal with the shower but the hotness at night was a killer   Place was hot  For the price  Plus the water pressure was really bad in the shower 
292714214,Lovely  as advertised  Perfect space for a weekend getaway for two or a work trip  Great location  around the corner from cute downtown Hyde Park and within walking distance to the   th street beach  University of Chicago and the Museum of Science and Industry   Hey Chris thank you so much for use of your space  We really enjoyed our experience  The only comment I would have  and may be a totally personal thing  is that it was pretty warm in the room and the air conditioner didnt really cool the room  We ended up sleeping with the AC on  the ceiling fan and the plug in fan all running  Also  the keys were not labeled exactly as mentioned in the confirmation email  Otherwise we had a lovely experience and would recommend to others  
292702382,Suite was nicely equipped with all the stuff youd need for a short stay  Cookware the landlord provided is of surprisingly good quality  However  we found the bathtub was clogged when we arrived  Landlord wasnt able to provide us with any help on a timely manner except for saying no one in his team was available to take a look  I had to walk to Target in the middle of the night to buy Drano  After a couple hours of trying different things we managed to fix it ourselves   and that left me not much time to sleep before my poster presentation  God  such a nightmare  Landlord refunded me for the Drano  But at one point we felt like we were there to be his cleaning staff and he didnt even pay for our labour and time  Didnt argue further  I am just trying to forget the sewage back flow and the ball of hair and filth we pulled out from the sewer  Oh god   
635163909,Nice view during  th of July
286135844,Great room   very comfortable and ample for one or a couple  fully functional galley kitchen  and nice walk in closet and bathroom  Terrific location near University Chicago  great destinations in the Hyde Park neighborhood  and just a short walk or bike ride from the lake  There is a Divvy  Chicagos bike share system  station  just three blocks away  and you can easily ride a bike right into downtown along the lake front trail  We know Chris did not have control over this  but it appears that a previous guest  or cleaner  we cant imagine  smoked in the room  leaving a strong enough cigarette smell that we were struck by it every time we entered  To be clear  the room was immaculate  kitchen and bathroom perfectly clean  and sheets   curtains did not appear to have a smokey smell  So its hard to imagine where the odor is residing  But it is there and strong   ALSO an easy thing to fix   with the current arrangement we could find no way to leave the air conditioning turned on without the kitchen lights also being on  In other words  the AC is plugged into a socket that is controlled by the same switch as the kitchen lines  and we could not connect it to another plug    To be clear   we loved the place  great size and location  and absolutely comfortable 
272988302,Good location for those seeking to be by the university and longer term stays  Although we were attending for a conference at McCormick  we liked to be downtown everyday  Over the weekend  public transit was not the easiest  Rideshare taxis became expensive especially coming back at night due to distance and passing by McCormick place which gets crazy with events  The actual unit is clean and modern  Theres coffee press and grinder as well  My main issue was the lack of blackout curtains in the bedroom  it was super bright and so sleeping in anytime past sunrise  around  am around the time we went  was an issue which was unfortunate as we were there over the weekend   Hi Chris  please for the bedroom  consider blackout curtains  this was the main reason why I couldnt give   stars  sleeping past  am was an issue   One of the kitchen sinks looked  really rusty  A little far those wanting to be downtown everyday  I would mention in your listing how long it would take for public transport to get downtown  Unfortunately Metra was every   hours on the weekends  
255195247,Great location in Wicker park  the train into the centre only takes about    mins  Pretty clean and comfortable and a really quiet neighborhood  Communication was fast and simple and its a good place to stay for business or holiday  Thanks for letting us stay in your place  If you could sort out the ants and maybe make the place look a little homely it would go a long way  Im probably just used to staying in places that people actually live in  because the flat is a bit barren and cold looking  Best Liz Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs  shower  Additional comments   There are ants everywhere  You really need to put something in the drains to kill the ants as every morning there would be loads crawling in all the sinks and showers  We didnt leave any food lying around and found them when we arrived     
243950769,My wife and I stayed for   months in this fabulously located one bedroom   There was plenty of space for   people  the building was great and Chris was excellent at responding quickly  The queen bed was a firm Tempurpedic type mattress  Good for some people  not good for others  And now  for the breakdown   PROS    Good living space and sweeping views of northwestern Chicago with lots of light from the large windows  especially at sunset  Dark fabric blinds are in the bedroom to block out early morning sunlight   Great gym and lounge areas in the building   Location was excellent for walking access to downtown and West Loop attractions   restaurants   Good kitchen space with all the necessary tools for making meals   A rare bonus  plenty of toilet paper and paper towel provided for the entire stay   Lots of closet space and storage space in the bathroom   CONS    There was quite a lot of train noise from early morning into the evening    The quality of the cleanings provided by Chriss staff was a problem  with dirt remaining on the floors and carpets after the cleaning  but Chris was willing to make it right   Bed frame was squeaky and couch was rather uncomfortable   There is no proper office desk for study or working on a laptop  except by sitting at the bar stools on the back side of the kitchen island  Chris  thanks for being such a great host and paying attention to our needs during our extended time in the apartment  We appreciate how you brought the extra set of keys  coat hooks  kitchen towels  knives and pillows during the first week of our stay and how you were willing to grant the complimentary cleanings to make it right   Suggestions for making it a top notch property   providing a table or stand for belongings at the front door   providing a more comfortable couch  and repairing the right side arm of the current one   providing a different bed frame that doesnt squeak every time the occupant moves an inch  Thanks  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  Additional comments   As you know  cleanliness was a problem from the beginning  with dirty bathroom floors and drawers when we arrived   The subsequent cleaning was actually worse  with no attempt to clean the floors or vacuum the carpet   The  rd cleaning was much improved a  
623563734,Rooftop was closed  Fireplace didnt function  Oven smelled really weird when cooking  no screens on windows  no TV in bedroom  Hot water was so low couldnt fill the tub  Two bathrooms was cool especially the larger shower  Really roomy  nice washer and dryer  cool view  air mattress was convenient Rooftop was closed  Fireplace didnt function  Oven smelled really weird when cooking  no screens on windows  no TV in bedroom  Hot water was so low couldnt fill the tub  Two bathrooms was cool especially the larger shower  Really roomy  nice washer and dryer 
241065866,Great place  Modern and clean with all the amenities   Gym  Coffee shops nearby  grocery store downstairs  laundry IN UNIT  Full kitchen with basically everything you need   Wonderful view of the sunset every evening   In the heart of it all  downtown   Only improvement could be the bed  I think its probably from IKEA and not that great  Chris  everything was superb except the bed   We didnt sleep that well on the mattress you have 
237338525,Pros  This apartment is extremely clean and well equipped  It has everything you might need  including small touches like ketchup in the fridge and shampoo conditioner in the shower  which really make a difference  The bed is also extremely comfortable   Cons  Chris required some work to be done on an issue which involved a maintenance team coming round during my stay  In my opinion  this type of work should NOT be done when guests are staying at the apartment  Who will guarantee the safety of my belongings in my absence  Furthermore  he was not particularly forthcoming on what the issue was  and I felt left in the dark  I did though eventually find out through experiencing it myself  unfortunately  I trust though  considering his other good reviews  that this will be fixed for future guests   Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay 
642940934,Great stay  Awesome location 
642252246,Great place and location  had a hard time getting host to reply back
708685706,Awesome location  pictures are very accurate to the room 
229281229,Great location and apt  Thanks for having me  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens 
221442178,Chriss place was great  my girlfriend and I had a nice time and it was just the cozy spot we were looking for on Christmas day   Close to the metra and a quick Uber ride from most of the best places in Chicago     The apartment has a small kitchen with stove  a stylish futon  large TV  Netflix pre signed in  and WiFi provided   Bed was comfortable and overall was a good spot for a city getaway   Only qualms were small   Hot water or heat made a lot of noise in the older pipes in the unit building  making it a little tougher to sleep but not unbearable   We also struggled with the lockbox for the house key but it was cold that day and may have just been tougher because of that   Everything was clean otherwise and agreeable   Would recommend  Hi Chris  our stay went well  we really liked the charm of the place and appreciated it being clean and welcoming  thank you   The water or heat pipes were very noisy and while I realize its an old building made it tough to sleep   Also we struggled getting the lockbox open  maybe using different ones or a new one for that one in particular would be good   It was fun though thanks again Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home 
176252921,Chris was a good host except for the fact that he made us feel uncomfortable by not letting us mention air bnb  During our stay there was a pretty serious incident  The occupant of the condo right next to us died the night before we checked in  I have reason to believe it was a suicide  murder due to the fact that there were several detectives and police walking around the scene for days afterward  The whole hallway turned into a crime scene  The detectives waned to know the owners name and thats when I had to text Chris to find his information  He was slow to respond which wasnt great especially when we were talking to a detective  He eventually gave us his information but he was still very adamant about us not Mentioning that it was air bnb  That made me nervous because it really seemed like he was trying to hide something  Other than that the whole trip was pretty good  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable 
154247305,Grrrreat location and clean  unique space  The walls are thin and the space is noisy  so if youre a light sleeper  this probably isnt for you  Hi  Chris   I know your place is brand new  so I thought I would offer you some more feedback privately    I was okay with    night  but personally dont think the apartment is worth much more  I think     a night is unattainable  Heres why    The space is noisy   There is a dog upstairs who does dog things  and you can hear all of it all of the time  along with any music  even at reasonable levels  that neighbors might be playing   The thermostat is crazy  We were hot the entire time  and its a huge drawback not to have windows that open   The bathroom kind of smells and the toilet runs frequently  We already went over the door issues     That said  the space is still very beautiful and has a lot of appeal  You can tell that youve invested a lot of time and energy in details  which is why i even considered sending you my two cents   Thanks very much  Good luck with everything 
147391589,Our stay at Chris was very confortable  The place is in a very central area  with good connection to all parts of the city  The check in was very smooth and Chris offers a number of confies in the apartment  Thanks  Hi Chris was all good  thanks  Maybe you might consider to fix the toilet because this thing that you use to flush follows pretty often in the water  Kind regards  Emanuela
138617646,The location is fantastic   just a minutes walk to the red line  It is rather loud outside  so earplugs are a must for light sleepers  The space is clean and very minimal  It was quite cold while I was there  and a space heater was provided to assist the radiator heat  Did I mention the fabulous location  Lyft was never more than   minutes away  Chris had put together some great information about food nightlife etc that was extremely interesting and helpful  and it included discount codes for a lot of the available services  Bed was comfortable  but not so much that you dont want to get out in the morning     For a budget option in Chicago  this place was top notch  If youre looking for more than the basics  you might want something a little more expensive  I think a couple things would be ideal for this location   maybe some light blocking curtains  or shades to pull down  as the sunlight that enters the room is quite bright  A cover for the window in the bathroom  Perhaps an explanation of the heating situation  I couldnt seem to get the place warm enough  Earplugs would probably be a good addition as well  And the blanket in the living room sheds SO much over everything  I would replace it  although the lint rollers were a good touch   The kitchen could use some staples  and the sponge needs replacing  One or two of the drawers were broken  cant remember  and probably should be fixed if only for aesthetic purposes   I happened to stay there on a more expensive weekend  It was pretty much the same price as some of the hotels in the area at that time  I thought with my own kitchen thered be an opportunity to cook at home  but there were too many missing staples  salt  
579369605,Great place to stay  Halfway through my stay  I came back to the apartment and someone had been in the apartment and installed lights under the kitchen cabinets  They left the lights on and all of the dust  glue used to secure the lights  and screws on the counter tops and floor 
116564456,Super clean  well appointed apartment that is just perfect for a stay in Chicago  Chris is a responsive and helpful host   No issues with getting in  he has a super easy system  so arrival times can be much more flexible and worry free    The location is near public transportation  but we found most of the loop area within walkable distance  There is a nice Wholefoods market conveniently located adjacent for those items to make your stay all the more homey   Be advised  the apartment is very warm in the evening  with the heating system uncontrollable  this is for winter renters    I suggest bringing summer pjs  even in the dead of winter   Also  if you are prone to like a dark bedroom  bring a sleeping mask   This is a city environment  and the curtains help but dont block the bright streetlight coming in   The bed was super comfy  IMHO  and the apartment was clean clean clean   Overall  an excellent value that I would recommend to visitors    Hi Chris  thank you for your advise and aid  You were a super nice host     The place was spotless and overall terrific     There are a few things  and I hope you take these in the context to which I present them to you  that is  as a guest who spent almost a week in the apt  and thoroughly enjoyed my stay  but thinks these suggestions might be helpful to the next guests       Heat   I know you cant control it  but the  lower bedroom windows dont open  one seems broken and the other has a  blessed  air conditioner    I was able to open the broken  window  by lowering the upper window  but it had no screen   Fortunately   no pigeons figured this out          The front room was fine in this regard  FYI  opening the windows makes the apt MUCH noisier   a   The pipes have a series of frightening noises that I understand are part of the charm of that type of heating system   However   country girl again  Imagine how terrified I was the first night when it sounded like someone was breaking into the apartment through the bathroom window and I was not at all familiar with what was going down heat wise     I was all by myself   I came this close to dialing        not really but  I gotta admit  my heart was racing    Maybe make a note about it so we know what to expect          Being a NH country girl  I think that it would be nice to have shades in the bedroom that block the light better than the  albeit lovely  curtains   If I would stay again  I would have to bring a sleeping mask    If you can read by the amount of light coming in from the street  and one isnt used to that           Regular  not wine  glasses would be nice    but wine glasses were delightful    BTW  the kitchen otherwise was quite nice   a toaster        The oven doesnt come on unless it does  and I just didnt know how to work it   Being gas  I was leery of fiddling around with it  and getting it wrong   BOOM    If it is disengaged  it makes it hard to reheat things on top of the stove   microwave   OK  I hope this helps you as an interface between renter and guest   Thanks again for being a super good host      
112609748,Excellent Gold Coast  location  Chris was great and took great care of us  Convenient to State Division  restaurants  bars  Easy Uber Lyft anywhere in the city   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   The key not being in the lock box issue  and the slight delay  but well taken care of once I got in touch    There are a few small things that would make the property better      All power in the main room lights  outlets  phone charger  is off of a set of plugs that is controlled by the main light switch  This switch has the main overhead hall light on it  There is no way to run lights power charge phone by the bedside without the main hall light on   At least not that we could figure out  The bedside lamps therefor cannot be run with the main hall light off  Not a big deal  but there is probably an easy work around      The TV sits a little low to watch from the bed  Especially since there isnt a headboard on the bed  Either a headbord or a foot higher for the TV would make hungover TV in the morning easier      Upstairs neighbors walk pretty heavily and make a bit of noise  and pretty late    am   Didnt really bother us  but it might bother others more  so be aware  Nothing you can do about it really  
625136906,Apartment is in a good area  some issues with cleanliness  but other than that it was a nice weekend away just clean better especially during a pandemic  nobody wants to walk in to a place that is supposed to be covid free and see hand prints and stains from previous guest  had hand prints all on the walls  stains on every sheet they had and so of the curtains  Wouldve been a nice stay if it wasnt so dirty It being clean 
647044136,Poor management and planning  will not be rebooking  Thank you for accommodating last minute but this trip was not what was planned  I dont understand why you would have booked another person in our listing when the one we ended up in was available    suuuuper disappointing  the loft was literally the only reason we booked 
673480983,Apartment was in a wonderful location with lots do to  sight see and eatieries   The check in process was seamless   The host was slow to respond to messages   Initially there were not enough towels for   guests however eventually they did have someone bring extra towels   The apartment was dirty   It was not cleaned well  there was socks left behind the bed  the kitchen floor had a spillage of some sort and was not cleaned well   The bathroom door had a huge hole on siding and wouldnt allow the bathroom door to close for privacy   Someone spilled a soda in the living room on ceiling mantle and was not cleaned but left there   We cleaned it because we were tired of looking at it   The kitchen has a bad leak underneath the sink that left a lingering odor   The paper towels that were left were soaking wet from the leak and could not be used   Washing machine has mold growing in the traps   Dust  old empty water bottles left under the beds   The bedroom towards back of apt leg stands to bed were broken when we arrived and shoved under the bed frame   The details of the cleaning were missed and you could tell   The apartment is lovely and has a beautiful layout however paying       for a few nights stay definitely should have been cleaned with adequate supplies   I sent in pictures as soon as we entered   The host was slow to respond   I was told someone would call me to discuss concerns but no one ever called or contacted me  Floors in kitchen and in common areas were dirty not mopped good as you could see grime and spilled liquids all on kitchen floors   Ceiling appeared to have spilled soda splattered and wasnt cleaned   There was old No one ever called me when I requested someone call to discuss extra towels linen and dirtiness of apartment A clean apartment
640207128,The home was a nice stay  Great for traveling on the weekends  Thank you for hosting us  We enjoyed our time  The code was easy to insert  however the key fob didnt work so we had to type in the almost    digit code every time  The spout for the shower was hanging out if the wall  and the sink was gritty  The sheets had small orange stains on them  and the carpet wasnt cleaned  The location was alright but lots of people were congregating outside  people ride close on sidewalk and look in your car windows  It was more urban than I expected which is probably just my fault for not asking more questions  I feel for future guests I believe the price should be lower considering the location  crime rates break in rates  and the spacing 
671611254,N
636189752,If youre looking to save money on going to a downtown hotel  this loft apartment with massive window views and great amenities has it beat  Usually an airbnb listing like this would go for over      a night  Perfect for a longer term stay given the laundry and kitchen  Do bring your own cookware like we did as there were few  but enough provisions towels sheets to get by   Just realize its a complex looking to make some    in between leasing tenants so dont expect perfect cleanliness      presentable experience  It felt like someone just moved out of the place  If you go with that expectation of being the in between  youll enjoy the perks of having an experience in a place youd probably never have the   to lease yourself  Thank you for your timely responses and acceptance of our last minute reservation  Great price for the amenities  high quality living space and furniture  Thanks for being accommodating with the bikes  Good value for the price  but now i know why the price is dropped  It seemed like someone had just moved out and the listing was prematurely listed  Dissapointed with the filthy hard floor  drink splatters  carpet debris and counter surfaces that were clearly quick wiped  Especially during this time of covid  we were a bit uncomfortable and spent the first night cleaning  Granted  it could be due to our last minute reservation and a super sloppy guest that may have stayed right before us  So  not bashing the cleaning person here  It seems like there was much more that came before him her  It would be nice to have pictures of what it actually is  not the marketing material used to win tenants 
710079210,Nice place 
709644960,I really like zancity and highly recommend them  Thanks for hosting  over all I was very satisfied  Around beds there was trash
627999096,Great area to explore Chiraq   I loved the location and view  Bring your own towels and toiletries  And also some lycol to be sure that its properly disinfected  Should air out before each visit   Placed smelled of cigar 
655595813,The space was really cute and perfect for   people 
672976905,This isnt a bad review  just a warning  You arent going to get the apt  that the pictures show  but pretty close  Parking is a pain  I spent     on a parking ticket and     parking a block away  The Place was clean and hip inside  Great walking distance to bars and restaurants  I feel that in    yrs it will be one of the best places to stay in KC  Thank you for letting us stay at your place  We had a good time and ate some good food  You should figure out some sort of a deal with the city for parking  because I got a     ticket  and had to pay     for parking a block away  I know other people have complained about it  But it was clean and quiet inside  Thanks again  The fob we received got us through the building door  onto the elevator  but not into the apartment  so we had to put in  like a    digit code every time  They are clearly renovating this building  and it will be great in time  but   of the elevators wasnt working  the hallway carpets werent very clean 
613725066,Its a cute little place  But just read all the reviews and take their instructions with a grain of salt  Dont wait until the day of to try and figure stuff out  because they will not call you unless you beg them  The place is in a great location and is mostly clean  Hopefully you take my review and make improvements  Its a great little place and most of the issues I had were with the service I received  Their check in process was really bad  They told me that parking wasnt good and to use an app to find a lot  They said it would be a lot less expensive than paying at the lot  So  I did what they said  The closes lot I could find was a half mile from the apartment  I paid     for    hours  When I got to the lot  I found out that I could have paid     if I had just pain when I got there  While walking over a half a mile to the Bnb  I saw about   different places closer by that I could have parked at for free or low cost  So they lost me money there  See more check in issues I had under  communication   A lot of the pots and pans had oil and were dirty  And also  little things like the bathroom not having soap in the soap dispenser or a trash can made this an inconvenient stay  Also  another little but irritating thing  Why would you have a coffee machine  creamer  and sugar for your guest but no filters  I ran to the store to buy coffee and got back to realize there was no filters  This is just my opinion  but if you have literally everything else I need to make coffee  why would you not have filters  When I got there  they told me to enter the room number on the call box to get let in  Small thing  but theres a  ring  button your supposed to press after you do that  Someone was nice enough to let me in  and I found out I needed a key FAB to access the elevator  And the key FAB was in the BnB  Now  what the host didnt tell me in their instructions was that if I had pressed the  ring  button on the call box  it would have given me a minute window for the elevator to work  But since they didnt tell me that  I tried messaging and calling them  I was sitting in the lobby with groceries getting warm and waiting on them to call back  About    minutes later they returned my message asking for more info  even though I had asked for them to call me  I asked again for them to call me  and they continued trying to communicate with me via messages  Even though I told them I was waiting in the lobby after walking a half of a mile with groceries gettting warm  Finally  the building manager helped me out and let me up the elevator  The rep from the BnB finally called me over a half hour later  Terrible communication on their end 
618669605,Great place in the city for an overall good value  Easy access  but make sure to consider parking arrangements in advance for your stay  Perfect place for being out all day and privacy when you get back for your stay  Roomy and cosy  soft beds  Thanks  The place worked out just right for us  Only constructive criticism would be to maybe get a bigger  better constructed  softer couch and arm chair and possibly add some other cosy elements  Great place though  D Overall clean  but looked like the bedroom carpeting needed vacuum  Couch had some light stains on it too  more noticeable because of lighter color   Cabinets and furniture starting to show signs of wear  Overall great value  but not not quite what I expected for living room furniture  I thought the leg on the couch was going to give out  Beds were really comfortable and sheets were clean and soft   
644618515,the washer and dryer are located in public area with       each time no free carpark guest need to use locker to receive mails and package

709918411,Great Space for the price and spacious bedrooms  Didnt understand why I had to explain why I needed the Air Bnb for you to except my stay   But thank you for accepting  I only stayed in it   night vs   nights  only because it wasnt in walking distance of anything
640216765,Quaint  simple  clean place  Wifi worked strongly my entire stay  Location was perfect for walks in Forest Park and getting around Saint Louis  Parking is a bit of a drag  I had a rental car and ended up spending hundreds of dollars on parking because I rented this for   weeks  I live out of the country and left due to Covid  Its good to know that there is no central air  they have two box window units  So  in the middle of Saint Louis summer  reaching     degrees by       am  its quite necessary  The units cooled the place  but it does come with a musty wetness that you just cant avoid  For a short stay I dont see this being a hinderance  I would recommend this place to others  Thank you  It was a very easy check in and check out and I had no problems  Id suggest including a little more information regarding the parking and pricing  I spends hundreds parking in the garage  which I didnt budget for  Its not about value  it was just very pricey for the size and quality  Most airbnbs were also giving a massive discount during the times  I am a school admin and had to repatriate from Peru  I was hoping there would be some more grace in the price 
603234505,When my family and I arrived  the thermostat in the apartment read    degrees    it was only    outside in Chicago  I tried contacting via message and     hour  support  The apartment hadnt been recently cleaned and it seemed as if no one had stepped foot in it for a while  I left   voice messages with no reply  I chatted with one person back and forth about that and issues with the cleanliness of the apartment and after about    minutes  she stopped responding to my messages after telling me theyd try to find building maintenance but couldnt guarantee because it was a Friday   I finally had to contact Airbnb directly who actually talked to the host  as he ignored my messages and calls  and was told that he couldnt handle it as it was a Friday night  At this point  it was almost midnight and no other property could be booked   Due to the frigid temperatures  there was no way we could stay and were forced to find a hotel    which most were booked for the evening  Communication is key  The lack of responsiveness via message and phone was frustrating  Also  checking location before guests arrive would have solve the problems experienced 
586366342,Please make better efforts when it comes to cleaning the room  We had a dirty towel  bed sheets had stains  bar stools were beyond filthy  both bathroom showers were dirty and had smashed gnats on the ceiling  The bed in back bedroom is just about broke  blinds didnt work at all  None of us were able to successfully connect to the WiFi  The entry way when first walking in was a disaster  Looked like it hasnt been swept in months  Mail and newspaper laid in the walkway  Stains all on the walls and bathroom doors  We went to cook and utensils hadnt been washed  The picture are a bit misleading when it come to the cleanliness of the the place  Please make better efforts when it comes to cleaning the room  We had a dirty towel  bed sheets had stains  bar stools were beyond filthy  both bathroom showers were dirty and had smashed gnats on the ceiling  The bed in back bedroom is just about broke  blinds didnt work at all  None of us were able to successfully connect to the WiFi  The entry way when first walking in was a disaster  Looked like it hasnt been swept in months  Mail and newspaper laid in the walkway  Stains all on the walls and bathroom doors  We went to cook and utensils hadnt been washed  The picture are a bit misleading when it come to the cleanliness of the the place  No place to park  Better efforts on cleaning and designated parking spot 
708311449,We booked this place the day before and it was better than we could have imagined for the price    Cons   There were a couple of things that were close to being totally broken  If we hadnt been careful  we definitely would have broken something  The main things I noticed were the slippery glass in sheet on top of the coffee table  the back leg of the couch  the hook by the entryway  and the toilet paper holder in the single bath  We definitely could have used more towels  they provided   and I had to wash them twice while we were there  When we arrived there was a soaked wash cloth hanging from the shower and a strong marijuana scent    Pros   I cannot emphasize how amazing the bathroom was  The tub was deep and wide and the shower has a great rainforest shower head  That alone was enough to overlook everything I mentioned in the cons above  The entire apartment is truly luxurious and so spacious  We bought coffee  creamer  eggs  and bacon and everything else we needed to make breakfast was provided  We could have cooked all our meals there if we needed to  The view from the apartment is great  and the rooftop is beautiful at sunset  We were closed to all the activities we wanted   food  drinks  thrifting  and the aquarium  The furthest we drove was    minutes to the outlet mall  My husband and I joked the apartment felt like being in a movie  you cannot beat the price 
628675162,beautiful apartment  we had a great stay  thank you    beautiful apartment very difficult to get inside because keypad on door was not functioning  however customer service was very helpful bugs on wall but other than that very enjoyable
621459158,Photos looked a little nicer but it was still a decent stay for us 
621358457,Great place to stay 
627334983,Terrible stay 
627093580,Great space 
619437211,A great spot in Wicker Park if youre wanting to be in that specific area of Chicago  Youre right in the area if you need to run into a Walgreens quick or need any food  plenty of food options that you can get to in one minute  If you have anyone whos elderly or has physical restrictions in your group  maybe not the best spot since you have to lug up   flights of steep stairs in order to reach the apartment 
626137343,Cute place  Quiet  Safe feeling  Upon arriving we walked in to sticky floors  super greasy  counters and kitchen sink  a water logged French press   spilling into the kitchen cabinet and down on the counters  There was also make up in the sheets  and poop in the toilet     We mopped the floors  cleaned the counter changed the sheets  cleaned the toilet   As we were getting ready to leave  we went to load the dishwasher and when we opened  it there was a piece of watermelon and a blob of soggy bread  We have pictures of everything  We wont write this  in the public section  We dont want to trash your rep and want your business to succeed  Hopefully there is motivation to get it right for the next client  Oh and spatulas and wine opener in the drawer had some kind of tomato sauce on it   The place is real cute  quiet  safe feeling and has great value  if clean 
644719115,Very wonderful location and a truly amazing apartment  Great price that really cannot be beat  The master bathroom tub floods very badly when taking a shower or anything  Lockbox to enter the unit is tricky to use and takes a few attempts to activate 
644310046,X Terrible check in  No doorman       Had to call maintenance  person in Chicago  didnt respond for more than one hour   Had to wait for pseudo doorman to unlock main door  Also  when I requested an extra day no one communicated the code  had changed   Seems like amateurs in action   No apologies or refunds from anyone 
644018750,If youre looking for a simple  straightforward place to stay in downtown St  Louis  youve found the perfect place  Close to the highway and all main attractions  this property is in the mix of everything  Thank you for being so accommodating  Ava  Bamboo bathroom mat had a urine smell 
709479759,Nice place and comfortable  Easy check in  Parking can be a challenge in the area  Traffic noise can disturb light sleepers  I use earplugs  Parking can be a challenge  Traffic noise 
628506469,Cute apartment  well located  Host was very accommodating of my last min booking  Although  upon entering the room was extremely hot as it was very warm in Chicago  The windows in the room does not work so i was unable to get air  However  someone came to fix the air conditioning but you dont have control of how high or low so some days the room becomes very warm  Worst if you take warm showers    The kitchen could have had more essential items  Paper towel  and etc and the building could be a little more cleaner   Overall  it was a good stay  Very safe area  And cozy apartment  Perfect apartment for someone who is coming to Chicago last min and need a very comfortable place to stay or for a couple or solo traveler  Glasses in cabinet wasnt clean
618786773,The apartment is clean and as advertised however several of the towels had stains and were not clean  We requested new towels and received them later in the day  Also the WiFi did not work as advertised  The network wasnt showing up at all  Other than that it was a nice place to stay and the neighbors werent loud or anything 
673519055,The apartment is really nice  very spacious and with great location  The internet was very unstable and didnt work for the majority of my stay  But aside of that  everything else was perfect  The internet at the apartment needs to be checked  its very unstable and did not work for the majority of my stay  I had to log in to Xfinity public network  Internet wasnt working
643368208,For a last minute stay in town near just about everything  it was great  Thank you for being willing to let us stay with such short notice  However the kitchen sink needed cleaning and there was decomposing bits of food left  There was also a cup in the cabinet that had evidently not been washed as there was lipstick on it  Otherwise are stay was mostly what we had expected for a quick stay in city  Thank you  There was lipstick left on the cup  and there was thick pieces of food left in the sink  which had obviously not been cleaned out 
673436115,This place was a great find at a perfect price and location  With three bedrooms  it was perfectly accommodating for six of us  Though one bathroom can be a bit of a challenge  Thank you for having us  we had a great time and the space was very comfortable  Two things to note  one of the kitchen cabinets was a bit off the hinge when we arrived  and only     keys to the main door were working for us 
626829198,I was really excited to go to this place  considering they boasted  meticulous cleaning standards   especially with current events such as COVID     However  I was really upset that many areas had cleanliness issues  The rug in the living room had what appeared to be hair balls  dusty curtains  and an overall surface level grime  It was particularly egregious in the bedrooms  where the A C units were covered in dust  and when we turned them on it triggered our allergies  I was not okay with the host coming in during the middle of our stay without telling us  regardless of the reason  Although the apartment has a great location  it is not soundproofed at all  especially given the location  and its an old building  You can expect to hear ambulance sirens all day  as its next to multiple hospitals  and you can clearly hear cars driving by despite being   floors above the street  Overall  it would have been five stars  if it werent for the entering without permission  and the cleanliness issues  I was really excited to go to this place  considering they boasted meticulous cleaning standards  especially with current events such as COVID     However  I was really upset that many areas had cleanliness issues  The rug in the living room had what appeared to be hair balls  dusty curtains  and an overall surface level grime  It was particularly egregious in the bedrooms  where the A C units were covered in dust  and when we turned them on it triggered our allergies  I was not okay with the host coming in during the middle of our stay without telling us  regardless of the reason  they dropped off some sheets which we didnt ask for   Although the apartment has a great location  it is not soundproofed at all  especially given the location and the fact that its an old building  Ambulance sirens all day  as its next to multiple hospitals  and you can clearly hear cars driving by despite being   floors above the street  It would be five stars if it werent for the entering without permission  and cleanliness issues 
716062093,This place was sooooo nice  Gorgeous shower  really minimalist clean vibes  I had a great time here and it was really quiet and peaceful 
333775867,Average place  No response to one of my questions  All other communications were fine but seemed like an intentional avoidance 
668716248,Stylish little apartment  Its an older building and the AC kept my sleep sensitive boyfriend up all night  It would also turn off in the middle of the night dramatically changing the temperature in the room    The parking garage is a   min walk which is very convenient and was free during our stay  So thats a huge plus  I would recommend Investing in a wine opener  And spot checking cleanliness is some areas  The curtain and the back wall of the tub    None the less Good Stay  Stain on curtains and in the bathtub
640083008,Do NOT stay here  Do not support Zencity  Absolutely the worst experience  Dirty furniture  dirty pillows  reeked of smoke and alcohol  there was cigerette burns  carpet stains  worse yet extremely dirty hand prints and gross muck over all the handles and doorknobs  Dirty mop water left in toliet  Worst yet  there was a red fluid smeared all over the place  on furniture and the drapes   absoluely disgusting  This all started with them giving me a   hour delay on my checkin  then when i finally get the room  it was a horror show  I called and asked for a different room and asked them to come to room to see the issues  They said they were all booked and couldnt help me  i said i would stay at friends and they would send a really good cleaning crew and would fix the room in the morning  I came back to the room the next day at  pm and they didnt send anyone  Room was the exact same  So i called to get a refund and they would not answer my calls or texts  They do not care about their guests health  If you are at all worried about Covid do not stay here  They are taking no measures for guests  You treated me completely terrible and with total disregard  i am literally traumatized by my experience   Literally zero compassion or care for your guests health or well being   From the two hour late checkin  to the completely disgusting room  and then you promised me to clean room and lied and never sent anyone to fix  Then act like you doing me a favor by giving me    dollars  The absolute worst host ive ever seen  Im not done with this    Showed up and place was not ready  Had to wait in lobby as they  cleaned  the place   Finally got my room at    So a two hour late check in  and then the room was disgusting Dirty furniture  dirty pillows  smelled of smoke and alcohol  cigerette burns  carpet stains  dirty hand prints and gross muck over all the handles and doorknobs  Dirty mop water left in toliet  All this topped by  a red fluid smeared all over the place  on furniture and drapes   absoluely disgusting  They did not care when i called  asked for a different room  they said they were booked but would send out a cleaning crew to fix the room  They never sent anyone and would answer my calls  They do not care about their guests health You like your health  Dont stay here  They are not a responsible host   Btw Airbnb was completely unhelpful    hour wait times on phone  Keep moving me to different responders  Supposed to be contacted and moved to another place as part of their guarantee and they never responded back 
617058106,So  the place is great  It is at a great location and the apartment itself is gorgeous  Unfortunately we ran into the AC  Heater unit not working  During our whole stay  we were told that someone was going to fix it and it never happened  It was not until we were literally walking out that someone was there to fix the problem  KC was cold      F cold  so the heater was definitely needed   I cant say the experience was horrible  but definitely expected better for the price that we paid  When facing issues  they would take a long time to reply 
664352130,Loved the space and the amenities  From a management standpoint  I wish there was just one POC for help with this Air BnB  rather than a group of POCs  The maintenance side of things could have been handled better if there was ownership from one individual  Easy door access and parking garage is safe  Pool is great and billiards as well  Loved the space and the amenities  From a management standpoint  I wish there was just one POC for help with this Air BnB  rather than a group of POCs  The maintenance side of things could have been handled better if there was ownership from one individual  I submitted roughly   maintenance requests  of which   were completed over the length of   weeks  Microwave handle is still broken 
661158798,DO NOT STAY HERE  UNSAFE   The door to my Airbnb automatically locked when the door closed  The door code was on my Airbnb app  I walked out the side of my room and the door closed behind me  My cell phone was inside  Luckily I had my wallet with my ID  So I thought Id be fine  I was wrong  I went to the lobby of the apartment building and used the phone in there  I didnt have any numbers so I called the number listed on the door of the building  I was basically told that they could not help me  They wouldnt look up the number to a locksmith for me  I called them a total of four times begging for help  I told them I have my ID and everything  They refused again and again  They told a single woman at      in the morning to walk the street and figure it out basically    It was appalling to me to hear someone tell a young woman to do that  This is totally unacceptable  If youre going to have an automatic locking device you should know that theres a chance someone can get locked out of that without the code  You should have a procedure in place  Im contacting my attorney  I suffer from PTSD and Im so shaken up  I was put in a dangerous situation due to negligence and I am very upset  Dishes were dirty in cabinets  Drawers in bathroom were dirty  Fridge was dirty  Appliances had film  We were locked out of our Airbnb at around   PM  with no cell phones because of keypad entry and auto locking device    We could not log into airbnb due to security features    I used the phone in the apartment buildings lobby  We had no numbers because our phones were locked in the room    I called the buildings number listed on the door  I was told that they could not get in touch with the Airbnb host  They could not help me get into my Airbnb  They could not log in to any electronic devices on my behalf  They refused to look up the number to a locksmith  They told me that I would need to find a phone to use  So I was basically told to wander around Kansas City Missouri at night as a single woman  I was terrified  My safety was totally put at risk  I was downtown  I was lost    I suffer from ptsd and I was so shaken up  I didnt know who to ask to use a cell phone    I couldnt get into my Airbnb for five hours  I was on the street until close to   or   AM  I was unsafe 
653226917,I like staying at Zencity locations  Hello Zencity  I often stay at your places and enjoy them  However this experience was not very pleasant  Had a maintenance person bang on the door to fix the AC and after washing cloths the dryer did not work had to travel with wet cloths as we were relying on that amenity  Was also disappointed that we were not offered any compensation for the bad experience  I still plan t stay at Zencity places note this location needs some improvement  All the best  Vernon Lockhart
643949008,BEWARE     the apartment I was in had DAMAGE already in several areas   Closet doorknob broken off and lying on the floor  golf ball size hole in the bottom of the bedroom door  hole scratch in closet door  etc etc    I luckily had the forethought to take pictures of all of the scratches and holes in doors when I arrived  They tried to charge me      for a broken doorknob and a scratch on the front door  that one I hadnt seen  In total there was about   things damaged in the apartment  So they completely picked and chose which damages to charge me for amd which to ignore completely    I have a feeling they charge people for damage that they never end up fixing    and thats how they make money  Its disgusting  I will be fighting this issue  I rejected the request for money and had heard nothing from them since after I yelled at whoever was on the phone  So we will see  Its sad because the apartment and the view was gorgeous  But I WILL NOT be renting from them ever again  They have several apartments they rent out  BEWARE OF ZENCITY 
628006291,There were a lot of ants that started to show up and I had to get my own mop to clean it  There was no broom even  No cleaning supplies that was only thing I had an issue with but it was a very cool place  Wouldnt answer when I needed WiFi code 
616434995,This property was great  Super clean  well decorated  and included some great amenities  It was a SUPER quick walk to the Plaza and all its amazing shops and restaurants  Once we were able to access the apartment it was amazing  The location was perfect  the space was amazing  comfortable  spacious  all the amenities you could want   My suggestion would be to make a      call person available  Even if you have to leave a message and they call you back  It was aggravating to use the messaging system when a simple phone call would have alleviated all the issues  We were given a code to access the property  The keypad did not light up to be able to type in the code  It took over an hour and a half and having to download another app  get a link  and then still had difficulty getting initially getting into the property  The inability to speak to someone on the phone created issues when we had difficulty checking in  Instead of being able to call and speak to someone it was a back and forth of messaging that took longer than necessary and because of the delay caused us to go across the street to get a hotel  It was almost two hours of messaging back and forth and we still were not able to access the property initially 
715773558,You want to relax in peace while still have an amazing view and centrally located   This most definitely is the place  The communication is top notch  And please dont let me get started about the gym  My goodness  After having bad traveling experience  and I am a photographer videographer so I travel alot    this trip was everything  Aparment so beautiful and spacious  Definitely a win Thank you so much  After having my rental canceled on me I didnt know what else could happen but your place gave me a sense of peace while I worked  And it was so beautiful I was able to shoot one of my photoshoots in the apartment  Great space   I would definitely rent whenever I come back to Stl  Bathroom was still dirty  stains all over  But still great experience
648999479,A dirty ass place Get a new cleaning crew It was so mine fly in there the beds was broken the border was dirty Im    the stairs almost killed me the stove was dirty the towel rack broken  No I would not stay there again  Didnt call Get a new cleaning crew
629277989,Great place and clean  Only downside was next to construction site Next to a construction site
620677498,When we arrived we were initially thrilled with the place and the location  Then we discovered that all of the dishes were dirty and worse  the kitchen sink was irreparably clogged  While Zencity did promptly send someone out  when they could not fix the sink Zencity did not immediately offer to move us to another of their many properties  When  we asked to move we were told there would be an additional charge which we refused  finally they offered to move us without an additional charge  We would like to note that Ava and Marty  Zencitys customer service  were very responsive and helpful but seemed hampered by whatever policies were in place  This would have been an ideal place if the sink had worked  Ava   Marty were terrific  Zencitys policies or procedures were really problematic   we were very disappointed that the sink situation had not been noticed  before we checked in and was not quickly fixed  Or another solution would have been to immediately offer us an equivalent place to move to with no additional fee  Instead we had to spend   nights in a very problematic situation and do a lot of negotiating  We did finally get moved to another place at no extra charge but only after a lot of back and forth  And really Zencity should have refunded us some of our overall charge   Thanks again to Marty   Ava  Dishes were dirty and sink was clogged When we identified the problems Zencity
639077331,Great place  Very secure  Definitely figure out your parking situation because that cost can rack up  but otherwise the location is great  the space was very relaxing and just what you need in a social distance world  Travel safely  all  The space was lovely and my favorite aspect was the security guard but I guess they have been let go  The guests in      were quite loud    seems like it was just children  I called security when a fight broke out  At   a m  when I still could not get to sleep for the noise level I politely asked them to calm it down  Thankfully they did   My one real complaint which I wont do publicly was the slow to no response and the lack of checkout details   Im used to a bit more interaction  In one way it was fine but also I was a little lost on if I needed to strip the bed or wash dishes  I leave a tidy place anyway  so not an issue    just something to note     Overall I was pleased  Disappointed a little by the ick I reported and the slow response but I would recommend the location to others happily  Just a few places but the host offered to send someone to spruce it up if needed 
621347504,Id stay again Door code system malfunctioned
626665733,Amazing place and very respectful host  The walls  are very thin and i didnt understand why i was told to turn the music down then i learned it was a group down the hall  I loved the place and area  Thank you for the amazing stay The floors were dirty and sticky
623662914,Good value Unfortunately disappointed with the way the place was cleaned  If Im honest with you I dont think anyone had cleaned it prior to us coming  It looked like no one had stayed for a while and dust had built up on the covers and furniture  Then to top it off your covers have blood stains on them as well  There were no paper towels either in the kitchen  The dryer and washer never turned on 
646694542,Very unresponsive  definitely would book elsewhere if your not wanting to stress over your room on vacation at all 
702373691,Check in was extremely difficult and frustrating and you have to pay for a parking space so be sure to bring an extra      just for parking through the night during your stay  Other than these things it was a nice space  very clean  and quiet most of the time  We would stay again if the parking policies were to change  The instructions to check into the building are very unclear and its extremely difficult  We waited outside    minutes in the cold just trying to get into the building  Other than that the stay was nice and we would stay again  Parking was extremely difficult to find  We had to pay for expensive parking for every night we were there  We found it very difficult to get inside of the building  We were given a code that didnt work  The bath tub leaked a bunch of water  Other residents of the building were very loud at some times  Other than that our stay was very pleasant and relaxing 
627028611,The location itself is not bad but I felt that the responses and the services in the apartment such as wifi were subpar  I had many days where I would lose wifi connection for hours at a time  I even had water issues in the kitchen and had to resolve that myself  Otherwise the location itself is not that bad I appreciated the stay at this place  however There were times where I would not receive call backs when there were issues with WiFi on many instances which interfered with the purpose of my visit work  Secondly I believe there should be a maintenance check before any of the guests arrive because for one full day I did not have running water in the kitchen and I had to coordinate myself with the building to get it fixed when I had asked for assistance from zencity  Thank you and take care 
706471786,Great apartment if you dont mind getting whatever they give you  Did not get the original apartment I booked and didnt learn about it until the night before my stay  Was told that rest assured  the new pictures and description were accurate and what I would get  That wasnt true either  I wasnt given the apartment I had originally booked  The night before my stay  the pictures updated to a completely different apartment  It was explained that it was a new listing and the new photos hadnt updated  but rest assured the new photos and description were accurate  That wasnt true either  The apartment I booked  with the updated pictures  had two bathrooms  The apartment I got had one  The apartment was very nice  It was not was I was expecting or told I was getting  even after the first mishap  That was certainly frustrating 
701165421,The space offers a comfortable stay for     guests  The bedrooms and bathrooms are decently sized and the beds pretty comfortable  Architectural elements are really nice   VERY tall ceilings  exposed wood and brick  Room walls were very thin  so you are able to hear neighbors and people in the halls  However  no one was up very late  so sleep was not impacted  thankfully  Space was pretty clean except for the dark  matte wall paint allowing for a lot of hand prints to show up all over which decreased the cleanliness feel  Great location with a private  gated parking lot is super helpful  Check in was pretty easy  The part of the instructions related to the first interior door was wrong because you need a key fob  I was unsure of how to get to the elevator since that interior door was locked  However  when I left a voicemail  I received a response quickly  The dark wall color choices allow for a lot of hand prints and water spots to show  The bathroom walls has old water spots all over from the shower condensation  as well as hand prints from people touching the walls  These prints were through due to the paint choices  Definitely made the space feel a lot less clean  There were also old towels left in the towel hampers from previous guests  I wish cleaning took the extra step to remove the prints all over the walls  and remove all the old towels  Also  the second bathroom toilet moved when sitting down  There was no hand soap nor dispenser in the master bathroom 
626438353,Not worth money at all  Flies were everywhere and internet didnt work so we were unable to use TV and game systems we brought  Flies were everywhere  Internet didnt work so we were unable to use tv  The kitchen sink had a smell to it  Other than that a decent place 
652442240,The property was pretty nice and easy check in  Gave   stars because there were a couple cleanliness issues and the bathroom sink and shower didnt drain  Was there for a short stay so it wasnt worth having fixed at the time  Otherwise a nice place to stay and great location 
620105114,The whole process was very simple and the space was lovely and in a great location  There was somebody in the unit fixing something a half hour after check in time  Which is fine  I just wasnt expecting it because it says self check in  Id give folks a heads up if thats going to happen  There were a couple of strange stains on the bedspread
629921787,Super clean and comfortable  We had a fast and easy communication with our host  We didnt have any issues with parking during our stay  over a weekend   One suggestion is providing regular bath towels  We forgot to bring our own  but realized there wasnt any provided in the room  which would have helped  Overall  everything else was great   Thanks again 
621604336,This apartment is sufficient for two guest the most  as there is not a comfortable place to sit for more than two people in the living room  The chair in the living room was extremely uncomfortable  and the couch only sat two uncomfortably  Also  the amount of dinnerware and utensils is was insufficient for the amount of bedrooms  There were three plates available for use and only   forks  We constantly needed to wash the forks to re use them  Thank you so much for an accommodating spot for us to stay  However  we would like to request our cleaning fee be refunded  as the apartment was far from clean when we arrived  During this coronavirus climate  this was very unsettling for us  Cleanliness description is in review  Broken glass on the living room rug  stains on the ceiling above bed  etc  Also  the bathroom door was falling off its hinge  making it nearly impossible to close  The French press coffee maker also fell apart in my hands  I am not usually one to leave a bad review  but the conditions of this apartment were unacceptable  especially when such a high cleaning fee is charged  Rug had remnants of crumbs of some sort  as well as a piece of broken glass we discovered  Very glad we didnt cut our feet  Spots on floor  as well as mysterious spot above my bed on ceiling that looked like a sticky white clear substance  Very repulsive to sleep under  We would have liked to have cleaner surroundings  as we pay a hefty cleaning fee along with this rental 
722199816,WORST Airbnb experience EVER  Awful instructions and NO PARKING  We were locked out for HOURS because our key fob did not allow us access  We made it in with help of apartment tenants  The individuals working this scheme dump were fairly quick at responding but not at all helpful  The place itself was NOT cleaned and smelled like CIGARETTE smoke  The sinks in the bathroom as well as the shower had HAIR in it  Plus the couches and lounge chairs also had a horrible smell and significant amount of hair in it  The worst part was the BED  There is no way ANY person on earth would find this mattress comfortable  We felt as though we were sleeping on a wood plank  We were both afraid to make any quick movements in fear we would break a bone or paralyze ourselves  VERY LOUD ambulances all evening long  We were supposed to stay   nights and ended up leaving in the middle of the night to get a hotel nearby  Locked out of building for HOURS Hair all over couches living room chairs  hair in sinks and showers  bed comforter stained  sheets and pillows also did not look washed  Somewhat quick responses Awful parking options
708734265,The apartment was fantastic   The host company was  ok   a bit slow to respond   
722017187,Maybe it was an off weekend for them but there was no towels in the apartment  The bathroom still had hair in the shower from last tenant and hair in the corners of the bathroom  It was unclean  Difficult to check in  More difficult than most Ive dealt with 
617040426,Nice location  Easy bag storage through bagbnb at the Bru Cafe   Nice apartment with easy access instructions  Nice walkable area with shops   cafes  This is a loud neighborhood  I did not sleep once through the night the three stay   A lot of noise from the alley below  Not the owners fault but it was repeated night after night like it was a regular business packing up  cleaning  welding from          am nightly  My stay was Sunday thru Wednesday  Definitely not zen like  Note the email sent about very loud activity in the alley between    a    am   It looked like a food truck   They proceeded to take apart pieces of the truck   weld them in the middle of the night   It looked like they regularly parked there  Not ok to not disclose a business lile this  Black hair in tub  floor   sink 
665497134,This property is gorgeous    just dont look too close   The  clean  dishes were dirty  the bathrooms were dirty  the carpets were not vacuumed  The door lock bolt was somewhat suspicious and hard to maneuver  I didnt feel safe that someone couldnt possibly get into the door  Unfortunately  anything you want to watch on the tv has a child lock  so good luck   This is decorated well  has beautiful views and is in a great location  You will get what you pay for and the price is on point  Tolerable  but definitely could be improved  especially after reading the previous reviews which state the same things that I encountered  The dishes and silverware were dirty  With concerns of Covid  this really bothers me 
703028640,We loved the space and the location right downtown  Great value for the price as well   A slight hiccup on getting checked in but was eventually solved  We loved the space and location  just a little hang up getting in  We also werent able to log into Netflix once because the account was being accessed by too many people  Otherwise everything was great   We loved KC and want to come back soon  Intercom was not working to let us into the building and took awhile to be called back  Luckily  another guest let us in  See details from Check In
630386519,good
627988415,  Smelled foul very foul Had injury due to broken furniture in properties
626322680,Great space for guests who do not have a vehicle  Parking is difficult but access to public transportation is optimal so you dont need a car  Unit was nicely designed and just enough space for a single traveler or couple  The windows provided great light and a refreshing breeze off the lake  yes they open     The air conditioning unit works extremely well  My only disappointment was the lack of complimentary bottle water  coffeemaker and paper towels  Otherwise the unit was optimal and safe  Overall I enjoyed the unit  Not having the fob wasnt so much of an inconvenience  however during the Covid issues  it was bothersome to have to keep using the touch keypad to enter the building  Melissa is who I believed cleaned the unit before my stay but it was subpar for the fee that is  being charged to the guest  I can suggest a better cleaning person who cleaned my rental units in the Chicagoland area  But for the extremely discounted nightly rate it was tolerable  The cabinets need to be wiped out to remove caked up substance in bathroom and debris in kitchen  Also the shower curtain needs to be washed or changed  cloth was dirty at base and is tucked inside the tub to prevent water leaking out  so it posed a sanitary issue   Wipe down light switches to remove dirt thats very visible  Shower caddy needs to be wiped off to remove soap scum  For it to be a     cleaning fee  I expected a cleaner space  Please note that I wasnt uncomfortable in the unit but I would have appreciated paper towel on the installed paper towel holder  And the stove should be wiped down without leaving water marks and grease streaks 
619055091,I am extremely disappointed in your unwillingness to refund        for Sunday nights stay  There is enough stress traveling during these uncertain times and your uncompassionate decision not to refund us made things ever more difficult  Our pre existing conditions  asthma and COPD  make us vulnerable to Covis     our decision to leave and get home as soon as possible was mandatory  Id never consider staying at your place again  nor will I recommend you as hosts to others  An entire disappointment  We had to wait an hour after check in as the apartment was not yet cleaned by      I am extremely disappointed in your unwillingness to refund        for Sunday nights stay  There is enough stress traveling during these uncertain times and your uncompassionate decision not to refund us makes things ever more difficult  Our pre existing conditions  asthma and COPD  make us vulnerable to Covis     our decision to leave and get home as soon as possible was mandatory  Id never consider staying at your place again  nor will I recommend you as hosts to others 
620874085,I have enjoyed this apartment very much  This trip had a couple hiccups  but fixed as fast as they could  I would stay every time Im in town  Highly recommended  Access code didnt work at first  but was fixed very easily 
618832092,Fun location in the city with fun bars and great restaurants  Only concern that we came across was the pictures of the unit not matching the unit itself  Was extremely disappointing as we expected one thing to only receive another  Nonetheless  we had a good time  Fun location in downtown that lead to a good time  The only concern was expecting one thing as we looked off of the only thing we could  which was the pictures of the unit  and then to get there to receive something totally different was disappointing  As I stated though  fun location and instructions on access to unit was clear  The unit was much smaller than expected  while the biggest concern and frustration was the unit not matching any of the pictures present on the Airbnb site 
408165651,Great spot  Close to bars and Target  Draining issues with the water tub
628642493,Great Hyde park location Very nice place  great location  Too bad about the setbacks Key wasnt there and we were given a runaround trying to get in before given a different code to get in Shower didnt work  and no drain stop for the tub   We were told it would be addressed  but no one showed up until check out time  Tried to call repeatedly and got through sometimes and were told someone would come and fix it  Didnt happen Key where it was supposed to be   And working shower 
617685480,This unit is located in one of the coolest neighborhoods in the country  Me and my children were very comfortable in this spacious   bedroom duplex  Hands down a great experience in a perfect location for any of the festivals in Pilsen  A must stay  I loved the location and cleanliness of the unit  My children and I were very comfortable there  The difficulty getting a response and the incorrect codes for the digital lock were extremely inconvenient and embarrassing  Your location is ideal  especially for the spring and summer festivals in Pilsen  My best wishes   Thanks for hosting us   Maria Lockbox was difficult opening  digital lock was the wrong passcode and host took a long time to respond with correct code
616428552,This is a wonderful location  Right in the heart of KC  You are with in walking distance to the art museum  tons of restaurants  and shopping  Covered  and secure parking  Take advantage of the massage therapist  you wont be sorry    There is a heavy walker who stays above  I do mean HEAVY   If you are an early riser  it isnt to disturbing  In the evening it sometimes it is very annoying  but turn the your speaker up  and you can drown it out   I will be booking again for my next work trip  Thank you for the quick accommodations     Legacy Sharpening With the exception of the iron not working  I really enjoyed my stay  There is a heavy walker that lives above  I do mean HEAVY  The  concierge  Ian is amazing  Very friendly and eager to help in any way   The place was tidy  but there was alot of hair left on the white tile  You could tell it was whiped down  just not dried  The dishes could afford a good washing  due to dust   Perhaps some packets of  condiments for the fridge  A nice little bistro table would do wonderful for the balcony  A more complete kitchen would do wonders as it is the heart if the flat  Perhaps some expanded outlets for the bedroom  You can tell is had been cleaned  just alot of hair left from the wet rag 
706262267,Overall  On a positive note  the house was a historic house with cool and modern touches  I love the interior decorations and mods done    Two things that werent transparent about      stairs being so narrow and also creaking with every step even though each of us weighed     or less lbs     Washer dryer in an unfinished basement   we didnt end up using because of how it looked after opening the door    I heard random sounds at night  possibly from attic   that woke me up while sleeping  The lights on stairs flickering and not dimming down properly was a bit creepy to add to the sounds  Overall  there was no issues if We just ignored these things  Maybe we are just not into older historic homes and that could be our personal issue   Another thing that bothered us is the tub  but again I believe it was in the pictures so we knew what we were getting into  Not a big fan of using the wide claw tub though the look is super stylish   getting in and out is difficult and not comfortable to use with all the curtains sticking onto us while showering   Not trying to defame the place by any means but I want others to know what they are getting into  Surprised there were not many comments mentioning any of these  See comments in Value criteria feedback Noted that this place is huge and thus it didnt bother me too much  Most areas are clean Two things that werent transparent about      stairs being so narrow and also creaking with every step even though each of us weighed     or less lbs     Washer dryer in an unfinished basement   we didnt end up using because of how it looked after opening the door    I heard random sounds at night  possibly from attic   that woke me up while sleeping  The lights on stairs flickering and not dimming down properly was a bit creepy to add to the sounds  Overall  there was no issues if We just ignored these things  Maybe we are just not into older historic homes and that could be our personal issue   Another thing that bothered us is the tub  but again I believe it was in the pictures so we knew what we were getting into  Not a big fan of using the wide claw tub   getting in and out is difficult and not comfortable to use with all the curtains sticking onto us
287858017,Meh
627088226,Overall I enjoyed my stay  I saw some reviews that said the internet wasnt working  however during my stay the internet worked just fine    This location is perfect for walking  There are grocery stores and restaurants within a   min walking distance   However  the location isnt great for a car  I suggest that people use ride share or take the metrolink which is close to the hospital thats a couple of blocks over    The building is older   the interior is not  so be mindful to your neighbors and keep your volume down after a certain time  I didnt have any issues with neighbors being loud  however I did want to mention that to future guests    My only complaint is that the tub is painted and is peeling and the walls could use a fresh coat of paint    The customer service was great and I would consider staying at another one of their properties    Overall  my experience was positive  The people who work in the building are friendly  I give it a      Customer service was great and I would book with your company again  Please paint the walls and fix the tub  The bathtub is painted and is peeling and ended up on my foot  There are other areas in the apartment where paint is peeling as well   Also  there were spots on some of the walls  I think the apartment needs a fresh coat of paint 
622143655,Police calls and lying neighbors Neighbors didnt call police on no one outside none of my stay while they sat out smoking whatever they had that was horrible for what I paid for  Neighbors call the police  I stepped outside for my little brother to smoke a cigarette hes a military vet and his wife  However I stepped outside sat on the hood of my car did not make any noise some neighbor called police  no one walked past us no one came up to us to ask questions  however the police parked on the wrong side of the street with his high beams on us  We sat till he was done smoking his cigarette  went back in ate dinner he left  I received a call from the host stating a neighbor called police and him saying we were loud and smoking pot in the neighborhood garden   But police passed right by us  The temperature in the house is locked at       degrees    There is no smoking allowed however thee apartment building its self smelt like pot everyday  The walls are paper then I heard the neighbors entire conversation upstairs  I wanted to extend but my God after the first day incident I was afraid to even go outside for fresh air         but get this I told my little brother we could smoke outside because this is non smoking thinking it was ok because I seen other people from the time I checked in  pm  stayed inside   min to the time I actually came back in to sit and cook  about   maybe  pm  people were outside just puffing away no problem  I drive for Instacart just moved back from ATL Ga  If neighbors will do horrible things like call police on guest for no reason there should b smoking allowed inside 
653529196,Very accessible location  The floors were not clean
714539387,It was a nice place to stay  especially for the price  While I wish there was more parking available  I never felt unsafe and the      doorman added to my sense of security 
622907554,Very nice and quiet neighborhood with nice shops and restaurants
671568654,Great value and excellent location  So clean  it feels like a hotel  We stayed here to be close to a wedding happening at the Savoy Hotel  which is a quick ten minute walk away  Would definitely stay here again      Thank you so much for hosting us  This was the perfect location for downtown access and was so clean it practically felt like a hotel  I will say there was quite a bit of noise from the service elevator in the morning and a few more towels would be nice in the bathroom  but again we had a lovely time staying here    Cheers  Specifically the first night  after using the code to gain entry  the elevator took so long to get to the bottom floor that it timed out and we were only able to get up from someone coming in behind and swiping us up  Other than that it was smooth sailing  
622515880,Make sure you take pictures of the place before you stay they will blame you for existing damage Burn marks on table that they accused me of
622477348,Great place smells nice  Very chill and peaceful neighborhood  Nice amenities stylish and homey  I needed better communication but the place is modern  spacious  and affordable  Awesome stay     Have cable TV available and working remotes for visitors to enjoy   Have better doors  I got locked in the bedroom twice and my   year old and friend had to get me out on different occasions Nobody ever responded to any of my messages
648948425,Good location  slow response time 
622312330,This place had some maintenance issues and did not appear to have been thoroughly cleaned prior to my stay  I rated it   stars for that reason  Otherwise  the location is good and it is neatly decorated and a good alternative to a hotel room if youd like a full kitchen  Code for exterior door did not work  I had to wait for someone to let me in  Once I had the key fob from the apartment  I was able to get in and out ok  Kitchen counter top was sticky   Toilet was not clean  visible urine stains    Drain disposal was clogged  causing foul smelling dirty water to drain into dishwasher   Carpet has clearly not been vacuumed recently  crumbs etc   Shower had opened  partially used individual sized shampoo container sitting in it from previous user    If this place were clean  it would have been a   to   star experience  Sent message about clogged disposal and received no response 
646745749,Expect lots of people coming and going in the common areas  Many were not taking precautions concerning covid  Once I was in the room I felt comfortable and safe  The best way to exit the building is through the nearest stairwell that leads to the back building  Virtually zero contact with people that way and its quicker to get to the street  Loved all of the windows in the space    An overall great value   
623014459,Cozy space
623078717,Very well decorated living spaces  parking spots are always available  Lots of nearby food ordering options  you wont hear neighbors at all  You can feel secure knowing that strangers cant easily access the building or bother your car on their lot  The building has lots of opportunity I had a mouse in my room and a large bug that I killed  I let them know however no one came to do anything about it No response regarding my pest issue after I messaged them twice regarding the issue
623077733,Great space   I was a very disappointed at the wifi speeds   When I arrived it was only   mbps which is already very slow and fell to  mbps    I understand that part of this was due to quarantine and everyone was using Netflix etc but nothing was done to ameliorate the situation   There are still weeks left of quarantine  upgrading internet bandwidth to meet demand seems like a reasonable thing to do  Great apartment but the wifi did not work and that is extremely important as we all have to work from home
652849606,Great place with a nice view
622741752,Never again Horrible  Worst experience ever  My car and purse was stolen and I tried having a different card billed and they just couldnt get it correct for the life of them
622530701,Great location 
631206426,The loft was beautiful but I did have trouble controlling the A C and also with the front door lock that wouldnt work  The loft was beautiful but I did have trouble controlling the A C and also with the front door lock that wouldnt work 
622376002,The building is beautiful and very conveniently located  It was clear that the apartment was not clean as soon as we arrived  My husband pulled out the vacuum to start cleaning only to find it clogged with dog hair  The couch had hair on it as well  The shower curtains were filled with mildew 
622218637,Chic space  Great location
622143905,The place is nice and cozy  It was perfect for my friend and I as we stayed for a week to work during the COVID    pandemic  The only issue was us trying to get inside of the apartment due to the extra locks on the door  but Zencity helped out over the phone  We stayed a extra day because we were so comfortable  There are quite a few stairs which was perfect for us because we used it to do mini workouts  Enjoyed our stay  Thank you for having us  the apartment was very nice  cute and cozy  the door was the only problem trying to get in otherwise it was a nice stay  My friend and I felt safe as well  Trying to get inside the apartment was a hassle  sue to the door locks 
623550072,The area is really nice  Loved the Air BNB itself  Parking is a little crappy  it was     day at the parking garage and street parking is few and far in between  I loved the stylish space and the mounted tv and everything was provided as far as paper towels  Kleenex  soap  things like that  The only real issue I had was the internet and communication  I went a full day with no WiFi and I could not get in contact with the host  I was working from home and was really upset that I couldnt get the internet to work and I couldnt watch tv so I laid there staring at the wall most of the night  I sent probably   messages and the host never responded until I mentioned extending my stay  Other than that  I enjoyed Central West End 
622090740,Had a emergency I had to attend too   the first night so didnt get to stay  went to the Airbnb the secound night and followed the instructions   which werent hard  Only problem tho is when I entered the code for the door it didnt work   not sure why   so was never able to get into the apartment and it was late so when I messaged   wasnt seen till the morning   wierd situation I have nothing to say about the actual apartment because I didnt see it but acutal building is nice and in a good location  Only thing I would say is maybe about the code on the door  But like I said it was also late and couldnt get in touch  Looks like a very nice place  Might try and stay again
646022414,I enjoyed my stay     the apartment was nice great for a quick trip  I was obsessed with the amount of natural light the room gets   its walking distance from Whole Foods which was perfect    My only dislikes were the check in process could have been more detailed and I didnt find the wifi information until my last night there because it was poorly written on a chalkboard in the room  Also there were ants in the bathroom and bedroom  better directions for the check in process regarding parking  provide the actual name of the apartment building would make locating the building easier especially at night    other than that I really enjoyed staying and would book with Zencity again there was no one to explain how to use the key fob to get in and out of the building and my key fob never worked to unlock the door I always had to use the code provided to me in my check in email Ants were in the bathroom and bedroom  I did not want to sit anything  on the floor because of the ants and with the bed essentially being on the floor I was worried the ants would get in the bed as well  some of the blankets sheets smelled
667095123,Great location   Easy check in  Walls and doors are thin so your conversations will be heard in the hallway   Loved having access to the gym  Unit had what I needed  Space was just enough for my stay  The unit really needs a deep cleaning   Especially with the current COVID standard  The water spot in the bedroom ceiling should be taken care of  The unit needs a deep cleaning   There were strands of hair every where  on the shower walls  I walked on the carpet several times and ended up with hair between my toes  The shower door railing is very dirty  There is a water spot in the bedroom ceiling above the bed that has mold in it 
631306411,Pretty standard loft  Little to no personality  but also no complaints 
631305704,The internet speed was below     Mbps and I wasnt able to work from this location or even stream Netflix  The rug in the main living room needed to be vacuumed pretty badly and the comforter in the bedroom had a pretty big brown stain on it  The white comforter had a huge stain on it and it looked like the rugs hadnt been vacuumed in awhile  I was stretching on the ground and could just see filth in the rugs  There was dust and hair all along the baseboards as well  No parking  I just think with what I paid  I would have expected it to be cleaner 
624154378,We have stayed with this host in the past and had minor issues  This time around we were placed in an entirely different unit than pictured  Our headboard was missing  furniture was missing  no table and chairs  etc  The foyer was of the space was gorgeous  however  once we got to our floor it smelled like cat litter and the floor was dirty  There is tons of construction that kept us up into the wee hours  This was not a pleasant experience  The unit assigned was not the one pictured  It was mid update  no headboard  no accent furniture pictured  entirely different 
624032213,Good stay   just slow to respond  Make sure if people are extending they are still equipped with adequate supplies I have extended a few times and each time its not a smooth transition 
673678395,We arrived at the unit about    mins before  pm so I messaged the host to see if we could check in early  We didnt get a response so we waited in the car until the  pm check in time  We went up to the unit  through a very dirty building and elevator   we arrived to the unit and followed the checkin instructions for the keypad  It didnt work  We tried multiple times and the door alarm started going off  because of too many failed attempts Im assuming   I messaged zencity to see what was going on and we waited again  No response  so I called to see how we get in    while on hold we tried the door a couple more times and it finally allowed us in  We finally got a callback from a zencity representative    mins after my initial message about the entry issues    The first thing we noticed on entry is that there are no locks on the doors other than the keypad lock  There werent even handle locks on the main or patio door  That didnt make us feel very safe  When zencity finally contacted me about the entry issues I asked them about the sofa bed  we were under the impression the sofa was a bed as well  as there were two of us traveling and a need for two sleeping accommodations   The rep said to remove the cushions from the couch and the area creates enough room for someone to sleep  I told him a small child could not even fit on the couch comfortably as it was maybe only   feet long  Then I was informed that the unit we booked was the smaller couch unit and wouldnt work  So that was disappointing   Of course one thing piles on top of another at this point and we started noticing the cleanliness issues in the unit  We expected more cleaning practices since COVID   has created higher cleaning standards  The floorboards had dust build up  which meant they hadnt been touched in some time  There were fingerprint smudges on the mirror and glass door to the patio  The bathroom sink had soap residue as if the the dispenser was recently used  the toilet had stains and residue on the outside of the toilet and the inside rim  and there was dirt buildup in the corners  The walkthrough closet between the main area and bathroom had a broken table chair  which means our table only had one chair  and several other items stacked up in the space  Upon our discovery of the cleanliness issues on top of the lack of locks and sofa bed issue  we decided the place was not fit for us to stay as health and safety standards were not appeasing  Upon speaking with the host  and escalating it to Airbnb for support because the host refused issues  about the issues  cancellation  and possible refunds because we even had picture evidence of our issues    the host only agreed to refund half of   night of a   night stay and Airbnb was able to get them to agree to refund the cleaning fee   The building itself is    blocks from downtown  so it is not  close  to the touristy areas of the arch  Busch stadium  or the river and the neighborhoods between are not the best to walk  especially at night  We had asked prior to our arrival about dining places around the area as we are avid foodies and so we could get a better feel for the area  but there was never a response to that message  Im assuming because the host is not actually onsite or possibly not even located in St Louis  they are an offsite property management company  If you do stay here  Id recommend you drive or use a rideshare to get downtown safely as there were no dining options in the direct vicinity of the building  Which had we known prior to arriving  by means of getting a response about the dining options  which we never got  we wouldve cancelled well before arrival and zencity wouldve been required by their own cancellation policy to refund us more than     for   nights   Overall  I would not recommend this or any Zencity unit to anyone  as the cleanliness and safety standards were less than needed to be and the lack of communication  guest service  and resolve were unacceptable  We arrived at the unit    minutes early so we waited in the car until  pm  We went to the unit at     pm and the code did not work  We tried it multiple times and it still did not worked  and locked out the system to where an alarm started going off  I messaged zencity to let them know the issues  they called    mins later   While we were waiting for a response from Zencity I also decided to call them and see if that was faster than the emails  Was on hold and we kept trying the door  It finally allowed us entry after a couple more tries and I hung up from being on hold  The mirror in the room had hand smudges on it  which means it wasnt cleaned   The baseboards in the unit had dust build up on them  which means they havent been cleaned in quite some time   The bathroom had soapy residue on the sink  dirt in the corners  and the toilet had residue and stains on the outside of the bowl as well as around the inside rim 
653543711,A nice convenient place  super close to downtown  The check in process was easy  but when I opened the door the cleaners were still cleaning so I couldnt go into the place until a hour later  The pictures that are posted is how the place really looks 
625681617,Construction worker attempted to enter my Airbnb  Im a small woman and while staying here a construction worker tried to enter the Unit  I called hello and he ignored me and tried the lock again  I had to get up and run to lock it   He continues to ignore me while I scream hello and tries again  Finally he walks away talking to a colleague   Simply terrifying   I also had no WiFi for the majority of my stay  Wrong password was given to me  then once it was found  it was shut off   I had to pay for hotspot on my phone because I had to work still  CONSTRUCTION at  AM TILL  PM DIRECTLY ABOVE MY UNIT    The space itself was beautiful  Couldve been cleaned a bit more  Such a shame  Was looking forward to escaping for a relaxing few days  Instead was meet with more terror and frustration  The WiFi password was wrong for the first days  Then I got the right one only to have it shut off    The construction worker not only attempting to enter but IGNORING when I called out hello only to have him try to come in again after HEARING ME INSIDE AND NOT RESPONDING is unacceptable and likely to be a criminal offense    Im a victim of sexual assault and mugging  This was extremely distressing and caused ptsd   ADD A DEADBOLT    No guest SHOULD EVER feel this way  There was no WiFi nearly the entire time  Construction all day in the unit directly above me  Im a small woman alone and a construction worker attempted to enter the air Bnb while I was there   I screamed hello and he imputes the access code to the door  I heard it unlock and I ran to relock it  Terrifying experience  Management provided a     discount for the  brief interruption   it wouldve been perfect if I had internet  wasnt scared to death  or construction    
628497897,The place had not been cleaned since the previous guests   You could tell someone picked up but the carpets were not vacuumed and had god knows what in them  The floors were half swept  the bedding smelled like it had been slept in  The instructions to get in were not clear  You have to hold your hand up to the lock and use the code they send  The AC unit has no physical control unit so it was FREEZING and there was nothing I could do about it  The windows had no screens  Sticky cabinets  I wish it had been cleaned because if so it was honestly a cute place in a quiet neighborhood  During the pandemic  One would think improper cleaning should result in an internal investigation  I honestly do not understand how this place was so dirty  I had no idea how to use the lock I had to google it Hair left everywhere  crumbs  dirty smelling bedding nobody vacuumed the carpets  You cannot control AC Unit    Corona Virus Central Cleanliness
700954007,Great location and beautiful space  however  very hard to get in touch with management once stay is done  Never responded when asked about left item  emailed twice and was left on hold for    minutes  Would still my curling iron back 
642886216,The check in instructions were not completely clear so make sure to touch base with the host before arriving  The location is excellent and the apartment is very nice and updated  We are sorry about the noise complaint  Did not know that the tv sound would carry so far  The apartment is only accessible via two elevators out of the six or seven and you have to scan the fob in order to access it  But this was not communicated prior  When we got to our apartment the door was open  We were not sure whether or not someone else was inside the place upon our arrival  It left us feeling a little vulnerable the whole stay  The living rooms and one bedroom had duct bunnies hair clumps and seemed to not have been thoroughly vacuumed  See the issues listed above 
624760562,The spaces Zen city runs are amazing  They are well designed  in nice buildings  and very clean   I have found the employees of Zen city to get a little passively disrespectful in their customer service approach  but overall a great experience  
622740153,Staying here was an alright experience  The first night was rough because it was a domestic violence issue that occurred  Very sad to see  Next was the amount of dust in the place  So dusty that it got into my boyfriends and I  throat  Very disturbing  On top of that  the water was disgustingly filthy  Communication was iffy  Relayed some of the issues and it took  what it seemed  forever for the hosts to respond  Also  the pillows were yellow underneath the pillow covers  If we disregard all those major factors  it was a decent enough stay  Make sure whomever is cleaning does dusting as well  Get clean pillows  Staying here was an alright experience  The first night was rough because it was a domestic violence issue that occurred  Very sad to see  Next was the amount of dust in the place  So dusty that it got into my boyfriends and I  throat  Very disturbing  On top of that  the water was disgustingly filthy  Communication was iffy  Relayed some of the issues and it took  what it seemed  forever for the hosts to respond  Also  the pillows were yellow underneath the pillow covers  If we disregard all those major factors  it was a decent enough stay 
642833657,I found hair left from the last tenet in the shower all over the walls  dishes still dirty in the dishwasher  Everything else was good  Those things were off  The dishes hadnt been washed  in the dishwasher  The shower had long hair all over the walls  Pretty gross  Everything else was good  There was long hair all over the shower wall
624676216,Its a clean  bright  and open space perfectly located across the street from the BJH and Forest Park  We had a family member in the hospital and it was a perfect place to hang out for the week or so we were there  Just a heads up that there are quite a few sirens throughout the day and night due to the proximity to the hospital   Just bring a set of ear plugs and youll sleep like a baby  Great place  close to the hospital   just what we needed   To make it a bit better  I would suggest some sort of work area   maybe a small desk with a chair   Also  there were a decent amount of cooking utensils  but very few plates  bowls  cups  mixing bowls  etc 
624668545,Great Location  Great Price  really high cleaning fee   Overall good value  Great location and immaculately clean  The cleaning fee shouldnt be higher than the room stay  The cleaning fee was Outrageous 
624738337,Nice area  a nice stylish place  Short drives to parks and the Arch   Enjoyed my stay 
624467086,Cozy place to stay Other than the smell of marijuana and the homeless man the place was cozy  Thank you 
623453929,check in was a little difficult but worth it  beautiful home check in was a little difficult but worth it
623441204,Stylish space 
623350433,Absolutely amazing  We really enjoyed our stay   I just wish you guys would have had more than just one towel in the apartment  The kitchen could use a spatula though  it was tricky cooking eggs with tongs lol  Also  I think it would be amazing if you invested in a television to put in the bedroom  it would put something on that big open wall  Overall it was great and next time we go to St  Louis we will stay in it again  
627139573,It was ok but fridge and tub was kind of dirty Tub was a little dirty
654351635,We had some issues with cell service inside the unit  other than that we had a pretty good stay the area was kinda iffy after dark but we had gated parking which was great we also had no issues checking in and for the price we couldnt beat it the hosts responded quickly with any questions we had wed definitely stay again  Most of the issues we had were out of your control overall it wasnt a bad stay we were grateful for the gated parking and the quick response to any needs we had thank you for being a great host  The dishes left in the cabinets were dirty we had to rewash them  The area of town was ok until it got dark and then it gives you a very uneasy feeling  We had terrible service I couldnt use my phone in the room 
711480839,Worked for what I needed  It showed an extended stay discount that I did not receive  
711451017,Pretty spot  The walls are thin and the pipes gurgle  but for the price  this is an excellent Airbnb  I enjoyed my stay and would go again  Very clean  light  and well arranged 
626225659,A beautiful apartment with lots of potential once all the kinks are ironed out   Sadly this trip didnt quite hit the mark of what it should and could be     But that said  location is great  response time by host is great  parking was fine during my stay with shopping still being closed   However  unless you can score a spot in the same building for a steal  forget car or park offsite cause its crazy expensive almost everywhere close      Dont hesitate to book and stay   Id stay here again tonight   Just needs some buttoning up on the final details   The balcony makes up a lot     Thanks Zencity   I look forward to returning to seeing it to the level Ive come to expect due to my experience with your other units  Hey   I have to say thanks for letting me stay at your new unit   Unfortunately its been my worst Airbnb experiences   That being said nothing was awful  but i will be very detailed on my critiques     For one  Im an Interior Designer  so usability  form vs function arguments  are things Ill focus on   However there are some more serious issues  i suspect  that could become issues if y suspicions are correct     The unit was just finished correct   It showed as it was a rushed finish   Let me be specific     First off  my info was never transmitted to the building   So here I am with all my stuff standing in the lobby  hot  trying to get upstairs with groceries that are literally melting and I cant get anywhere   The door person had to call after hours to your on call staff   I was confirmed by    pm and didnt check in until after   pm  so plenty of time for this to have been done before my arrival     After I get approval to go up  I arrive at the units door and the keypad doesnt seem to functioning   I could not get it to light up at all   Im standing there  arms full  ice cream literally is soup  dialing yours office number  looking stupid  sweating my butt off   Im not lucky enough to get anyone  Im put to voicemail   While leaving vm  I get keypad to illuminate  I hang up relieved  but before i get to ket the code in  it goes black   Once again I cant get it to light up   until somehow it lights up again and i get the code pressed and Im in     This consumesw at least    minutes of unnecessary time   I find an email explaining the need to place three fingers on pad to illuminate it   That would be very helpful info in checkin instructions   No where in the instructions did it say that   It needs to  thats not intuitive it common everyday knowledge   Because i came in late with groceries  i had parked in the building structure temporarily on a spothero reservation that was good until  am   I go to leave around  am and get to the elevator and find it isnt working  I go inside to find the main desk number to downstairs   Its no where in your infornation   Mind you  nor is there anything useful  like instructions in checkout issues  or wash machine instructions   Gbis needs to be addressed and supplied with each space     Anyway i find the main building number myself  call and am told that indeed the elevators are down  in fire safety mode and could not be serviced until   AM due to the Covid   crisis  Im on your   th floor unit  My car reservation expires at six   I cant extend it   So i tried to stay up to deal with it    Well  I couldnt Seay awake and wake up aroubd   am    hours past my reservation   It was a     in fees I had to pay now  even though I had tried to leave    I get its not your fault or problem  but it wasnt mine  it was the building  but the parking is run by a drop larking  company   I know that it wasnt your fault  but it wasnt  nor the parking structures  nor Spothero ls   But i was getting stuck tripling my parking cost   Nit see so i refused ifpay    Mmmmm   is Dhs unfortunate and I was stuck with the bill for the parking structure that I didnt feel I was responsible for  youre not really responsible for  the parking structure wasnt responsible for  so i it sucked    I refused to pay it  the parking structure took my name and they were going to investigate   Id appreciate your office confirming i was unable to use the elevators so they see Im truthful     It seems to me that your design aesthetic is very less is more  nothing beyond necessity but not utilitarian either  Its a great look but the problem is everything has to be perfec  Urs a difficult look ti comma he does in an an inexpensive flip if I urs efyxgcy  were going to do you look like that  Because if its not  the thing that is not to the nines will clearly be blatant and stand out  This one had many things   That same first night i decided to relax  for the night and take a shower all while waiting for the elevators to fix si I could move my car    I sit down first iti use the bathroom   I go to look at the space for extra toilet paper as they were only a few squares left and one there  and there is none  Theres none under the sink  none in the closet I could find  Luckily I was able to find it in your locked cabinets that someone had not locked Buckley  This is late night  in the city on lockdown  where stores are not open  and where your renters may not want to go out into the public for something that should be readily and conveniently available     Once i solve that i go to turn in the shower handle and it geeks know it wont budge   Finally get the handle to turn Camer and after turn slightly in the light comes on I find the handle is now in my hand no longer connected to the Fossett  We installed without the setscrew so of course its going to fall off  I almost left at this point   Obvi fix this    The lights in the master bedroom are utterly ridiculous choices  First of all there are too large and are clumsy projecting over the nightstand   Then  if you try to swing the lamp toward the wall  the whole light turns because they are not attached properly   This is dangerous   Live wires are behind that should it come off somehow   Even it it didnt  the shades could break   At the very least  youre going to ya e scraped  scratched or gouged walls from then being improperly installed   Trust me  fine one that is chalk  and adjustable   There might even be one that just has a stationary s once with a little reading might that is adjustable   This light is just a really bad choice   lots lacking s as by function and very little form   Ditch it     Now heres the most concerninG part   If you are in that unit when the sun is beating down in the late afternoon youll hear the sounds of loud popping and cracking   Is the floor laminate   If so  i think the floor was installed without the proper gaps left m between it and the walls   Well the floor is going to expand regardless of whether the proper gaps were left  The issue is with damage is going to credit the floor is it does it  If it buckles becomes a hazard for your people using it    The floor cracked and snapped for about an hour or two in the afternoon and again after the sun was down when it shrunk back   If my suspicion is correct  this is a failed installation that needs to be corrected by the installer of the flooring   Usually there is the flooring  the base trim and then quarter round  trim to cover the gap you can see between the flooring and  under the base trim   I see no quarter round nor any gap   That is why Im concerned   If should be checked ASAP and fixed if Im correct   I could be mistaken but Id be remiss if I didnt say something      The kitchen was nice  however you dont need those two trays in there   The one on the counter is too large and clumsy for anyone trying to meal prep   Barely leaves space   This should be made smaller   Also that faucet when its put into spray mode creates such a fine mist everything gets soaked so Id not buy that faucet again   But you need two things        A winekey  bottle opener    I know these get taken all the time but buy some crazy color and buy in bulk and offer guest to take with your logo on it as a gift   I hate when its missing and i need to go find one      Cutting boards  If you do not supply what people should cut on  theyll use things they shouldnt   Get some cheap hard white plastic ones   When no longer white toss them     I ran my used towels through the wash machine   At the very least a set of instructions need to be there   I was unsure where to put detergent  what kind  which slot  etc   I dont claim to be an electronics expert but compared to some  Im a wizard   Those who think that would have been totally lost     no information of importance or value was left   What are the buildings amenities   Wgere are they   how do we make use of them   Who do we call in emergency   Not even an area guide or suggestion   Please put instructions  guide book together   As a guest i find it incredibly handy to have this information readily  available     I mean no offense   Im brutally honest because you deserve that from me so you can maje the necessary do better and make more money   In this climate of travel  or perhaps now  lack thereof  the details will matter   In wresting great concern about a other zencity rental    If this is the actual level of quality  Ill pass   If you want help consulting on interior to get the best out of your budget  Or to find the details missing  lmk   Id be happy to do that   Someone needs to see it from the clients perspective   Thats my job   Its what I do    Im happy to discuss how I could do that     Thanks   Ill be nicer in the public review   Lol
649036929,We have stayed in St  Louis many times  but this was our first time staying at an airbnb  We sought an alternative due to COVID and a bedbug experience at a hotel during a previous stay  We are happy with our choice  It was very easy to check in  and the room was spacious and comfortable  I was glad that I read a previous review regarding the lack of a drip coffee maker  we brought our own  The location is awesome  directly across from Forest Park  One morning  we took our breakfast up to the rooftop and enjoyed a beautiful view  I highly recommend staying with Zencity at this location  I know that we will stay there again  Thank you for all of he communication  My only complaint about my stay was that there were some hairs in various places  bathtub  floor  sheet   On site parking
709040481,Very nice and clean  The area is pretty quiet  I absolutely love the tub   The only thing I didnt like was the fact that we had to pay to park and then walk about     minutes  But the walk wasnt bad  Other than that  its a great place to stay 
625340826,Good space  good location  Great The apartment is beautiful  but there was dust on the floor when I arrived  then I realized that the living room carpet throws a lot of hair and the vacuum cleaner doesn t quite pick it up properly  There was also a water leak in the window  but the building team fixed it after   days
646382823,  stars  Star     location is great  Lafayette Square is beautiful and convenient  Star     unit itself is also beautiful and bed is very comfy  Star     communication about entry issues were very responsive  No star     previous guest smoked excessively in a non smoking unit  This itself is not ZenCitys fault  but it was an awful smell and Id wish they had been up front about that and offered solutions ahead of time rather than waiting for my complaint and told  maybe open the windows   No star     I paid for non smoking room as an expectation for my own health and comfort  with my prompting for a compensation for this missed expectation and inconvenience  they eventually gave      off   of my   night stays  but a full   star review would be reserved for proactivley addressing rather than a  sorry the last person broke the rules  but nothing we can do about it  approach   The room still smelled awful at my departure  So just a little miss with me  Carpet in living and bedroom hadnt been vacuumed  Quick to give me access when the keypad was down  slow to respond to my issues once inside
624942436,Very easy check in  Comfortable place in a nice location  Easy access to the freeway and was really nice being next to the park  overall I really enjoyed it and would recommend  Would definitely stay here again 
650234526,It was an okay stay  The location was alright  but when we first checked in we could get up the elevator without the key  so we had to wait    minutes for someone to come with their key  It was nice on the inside but there was a lot of hair in the shower and trash under the bed  Im not sure if I would stay here again just because I dont know how clean the room is  I think there should be a more thorough cleaning of the apartment  There was hair in the shower and trash under the bed  We couldnt get up the elevator the first time without the key There was a lot of hair in the shower and trash under the bed  If the place would have been cleaned prior to us staying  I would have given a better review
628936807,This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with booking  Upon arrival which was after  PM the entire apartment was filthy  not dirty but filthy  When I reached out to the host  there was no response until  pm regarding the nature of the apartment  By this time a woman arrived at the apartment without knocking  entered the apartment and did not state who she was  It was revealed upon me asking she was the cleaning person for the apartment   arriving   hours later  This is unacceptable with COVID being popular  I even sent pictures to the host showing how dirty the apartment was  I had to wipe down the entire apartment with disinfect wipes and change the sheets myself  The only thing the cleaning lady did was sweep and take the trash out as I had already did her job  Which is something I should have not been compelled to do  The host was not accommodating as I expressed how upset I was  for what I experienced  The response was   well she cleaned it now  No I cleaned it  She just took the trash out  I will NEVER rent here again  Rent at your own risk  If you like piss smell and a filthy environment  this is the place for you  Sometimes reasonable cheap is not worth your comfort 
623300084,  The floor had stuff on the floor when you walk in    Then the bathroom still had hair in the tub
623262240,Would recommend or book Zencity again  Minus the series of unfortunate events  I would recommend  Carpet and hardwood was gritty with a layer of pet hair 
625778068,Es un lugar con confortable con una linda vista to forest park  Como sugerencia la puerta del ba o hace un ruido cada que la abres  Excepto por lo del sof  y las cobijas lo dem s estuvo genial  Gracias de igual manera si lo recomiendo Las cobijas no ol an a limpio  lo mismo con el sofa
627087741,I rated this Airbnb a      Although the apartment was beautiful it was NOT the apartment in photos  The Airbnb I stayed in looked NOTHING like these photos  The directions for check in were not correct to enter the building and very vague  I had to wait for someone to leave the building to get inside  The building is also located right next to a fire station which kept my mother up  and no curtains so the street lights shined in all night  If youre used to softer beds this may also not be the place for you since it was very firm  There is also no parking other than street parking  I was told there was an app that I could use to book garage parking  but that app says there is   paid parking anywhere in the area  So unless you go on the weekend your only option is paid street parking    I messaged Zencity for help entering the building and didnt get a response for about an hour  It was very confusing and not convenient  The apartment and area was very beautiful  but the apartment was not what was listed in the photos  It was also located right next to a fire station and the street lights shined very well through the blinds  The directions for parking was incorrect  and check in was VERY complicated  Suggestions I have      Blinds for the bedrooms  Not only does the sun shine in super easy  but so does the street lights  We were not able to sleep due to the fact that even with the lights off it was bright  We definitely couldnt sleep in either      Notice of the fire department  The highway sounds isnt that much of a bother but the sirens definitely was      Trash bags  We found none and had to put stuff in the trash without one      Not the right apartment shown in the photos  That was not the Airbnb I booked      Better directions for check in  The instructions you gave me was no where close to correct  I had to wait for someone else to enter the build so I could get in  I messaged for help but no one responded so we had to wait outside the building  You told me to input  zen  into the pad but it asked for numbers  Even the instructions you gave me to help was vague and didnt work    This is the first time I didnt have a   star experience with an Airbnb    Otherwise we did enjoy our stay  It was the correct location  but was located next to the highway and a fire station  It woke my mother up constantly  Curtains to block out the street lights  trash bags for the trash cans  letting us know that its right next to a fire station  accurate parking notice 
625626459,Place was beautiful but cleanliness was not up to code  also slow responses from the company  But the area was a great spot lots of close restaurants and also a lot of things to do in the area  Just wish the place was cleaner 
625620368,Good spot
625529740,The space is nice  The space was amazing  Hot showers were the only problem 
701823077,Cozy and pretty place   Instructions on how to get in are pretty clear   Thank you for being a great host   The bath tub  upstairs   was clogged from day   
624833743,This is an ideal place to lay your head and enjoy the city  There was renovation going on each morning as early as      am which would not have been bad if they were not drilling with some type concrete jack or something   To have worked late nights and not be able to sleep during the day made it hard to call it relaxing   The apartment was AMAZING but I would rather have stayed where there was no early morning construction going on to break my limited sleep 
624616469,The place was infested with bugs  I reached out to Zencity three times and I was told that a maintenance man would be out  They never sent anyone  Imagine bugs being all over the walls   floors  night stand  and bed  They suggested I use some spray that was there  I did  It did not work  I even asked if they had another Airbnb available  They did not  They offered no compensation    Also the walls are thin  You can hear everything outside your door  I asked for a refund and have not got a response  The bedroom was infested with bugs  The place was infested with bugs  I reached out to the company three times  They finally responded and said someone would be out but they never came out  Imagine bugs all over the bedroom night stand and bed  It was horrific  It seemed like the more we killed the more they came 
654833389,This is such an amazing apartment and a great location  It is above the train station but highly insulated  I wasnt bothered by the train for a second  Absolutely love the outdoor balcony  Amazing restaurants and shopping right outside the door  highly recommend this place  Thank you  Please ensure the bedding is thoroughly cleaned  There were many hairs from other guests in the bed Lots of hairs in the bed
701190548,Nice place  good location  Close to great neighborhoods  but much easier to find a Parking place  Great place to stay  but it was cold and it took a while to figure out how to get it to warm up  No paper towels  either  although there was a holder for it  Looked like mold by the bathtub and some cobwebs Took a couple of days to hear from them
624601311,Great little Space
625638229,Absolutely stunning top floor loft  Wrap around windows with great views in all directions  The space was HUGE and super clean  The space is gorgeous and location is perfect  Great job on cleanliness  Only suggestion is to have better coffee supplies  The glass part of french press was missing and the coffee bag was nearly empty  Other than that great stay 
625415833,Photos didnt match the exact unit we were in  although similar  Door code wouldnt work  elevator required key to access our floor  got routed through automated call center  had to have security escort me up after proving Id rented it
673605450,Positive  Good space  quiet neighborhood  the apartment is nice  modern  updated kitchen and had clean sheets  The bedrooms were a good size and comfortable beds  Sheets and towels appeared clean and there was extra of these which was really helpful  Bathrooms offered complementary toiletries  There were cleaning products available in kitchen  Walking distance from places to eat and shop for basics   It was in a good area not too far from downtown   Negative  The locks on some of their windows were broken  the entry is infested with spiders  the floors and restrooms were not very clean  There was hair on the shower walls and there was dust on the floors  If we wore just socks we could immediately see the dust anr hair on them  Surfaces appeared to be dusty  It was hard to get the key from key box  Tv didnt work  we attempted multiple times to make it work  You can hear any small noises from any neighbors  Positive  Good space  quiet neighborhood  the apartment is nice  modern  updated kitchen and had clean sheets  The bedrooms were a good size and comfortable beds  Sheets and towels appeared clean and there was extra of these which was really helpful  Bathrooms offered complementary toiletries  There were cleaning products available in kitchen  Walking distance from places to eat and shop for basics   It was in a good area not too far from downtown   Negative  The locks on some of their windows were broken  the entry is infested with spiders  the floors and restrooms were not very clean  There was hair on the shower walls and there was dust on the floors  If we wore just socks we could immediately see the dust anr hair on them  Surfaces appeared to be dusty  It was hard to get the key from key box  Tv didnt work  we attempted multiple times to make it work  You can hear any small noises from any neighbors 
630081885,Great host but did not act instantly when we reported an AC problem One of our acs was not working which made the stay in one room very uncomfortable  Otherwise the location and cleanliness was good 
630420846,You can park at metered parking on the street  The whole building smelled slightly like marijuana  but the apartment was clean and a great place to stay  Thank you 
721524594,I want to preface by saying the room was very comfortable and served the purpose I need it for  However  upon entering the building there was a man smoking crystal meth in the entryway  I cant put this on the property owner but I dont think its a  family friendly  place  I was also yelled at by some random  drunken pedestrians who offered me and my friend cocaine  The room overall was comfortable though but not entirely clean imo  I used some dishes and cleaned them to find a full loaded dishwasher even though the room said it had been cleaned and inspected  The bathroom was pretty clean but the toilet paper holder had an empty roll on it  It was an affordable stay  The room was nice  The area is practical but I wouldnt stay here again given the experience  I want to preface by saying the room was very comfortable and served the purpose I need it for  However  upon entering the building there was a man smoking crystal meth in the entryway  I cant put this on the property owner but I dont think its a  family friendly  place  I was also yelled at by some random  drunken pedestrians who offered me and my friend cocaine  The room overall was comfortable though but not entirely clean imo  I used some dishes and cleaned them to find a full loaded dishwasher even though the room said it had been cleaned and inspected  The bathroom was pretty clean but the toilet paper holder had an empty roll on it  It was an affordable stay  The room was nice  The area is practical but I wouldnt stay here again given the experience 
627858649,Honestly I could see Zencity having really great airbnbs  but I got unlucky  No working lock for three days  massive leaks from dishwasher  maintenance coming in and out  construction going on   asked for towels and got them on the third day  I have nothing but complaints and asked for my money back or help and got no response  Awful  They sent me the wrong key code  AFTER I had to call and ask for it   Then when the lock didnt work the rest of the time it was suggested that I was not typing in the right code  On my third day  or not having a working lock and relying on the doorman to let us in and out of the flat  they said the electric lock is broke  Guess it wasnt my fault after all  Dismal  Response rate slow  closed after  pm  not very professional
624240884,Place was good 
671899314,Ive stayed with the host several times different units but this one wasnt like the others its ok for one two day stay but anything more not so much their units are usual very nice I must say Ive stayed at many of ur properties and this one wasnt wat I thought it would be and the area u walk into the building needs cleaning
632038398,The place is very clean   Its safe   Its close to things   For the money  its almost perfect    Two things to be aware of   The internet is super spotty   That means the TV isnt going to work   That means you cant work   I complained the whole time about it  and was provide an alternative that worked for about   hours     Bring a fan   There is a window AC unit in the main space  but no air moves into the bedroom and it gets very stuffy     The bed was comfy  The room was nice   Other than those two things  I would recommend it to anyone  You REALLY have to get   things fixed   First  internet   If the TV relies on it  it has to work   Also  if someone is trying to work while there  it has to work   Also  the window AC unit blows no air into the bedroom and it gets hot in there   A fan or some way to move air is important  For the WiFi to actually work and for the AC to cover the bedroom 
671899189,The place wasnt cleaned when I got there  I had to stay in a hotel instead  The host has not refunded me    weeks later  My place wasnt cleaned out at all when I got there  I had to find a hotel at    at night   You promised a refund   weeks ago and I havent gotten one  Please refund me immediately 
632614370,Great stay  Small issues with the TV but great location  Thanks again
656056836,Clean place and cozy
632325945,Decent space There was a hole in the master bedroom door which was weird 
642854170,All around a good space with good location  The only issues I found was the lack of  updated  information  The pool was closed  was specifically looking for a place with a pool   The street of the location was cover in construction  hard to park when the main parking isnt available   as well as the door on the addressee street was closed  I feel like a fair warning would have made this stay perfect  The place is really nice and affordable for a weekend get away  The bed was comfy  Netflix was provided  as well as a smart Tv to log into your own accounts if needed  WiFi was great  The code to get into the room was rather long  making it a little hard to get in and out quickly  Instructions were very clear though  Location was good  Parking is not  the road the pick wick plaza sits on was closed  no fair warning ahead of time  as well as the door on McGee was also closed  could have used a heads up because we were carrying our bags 
624937094,Great location in a beautiful area of St  Louis  A bit noisy in the building at times  but overall  a good place to stay in St  Louis  Thanks for quick replies  When we walked into the apartment  it was a bit dirtier than expected and the trash can was broken  but overall a wonderful place that was great to stay as a healthcare professional working in the hospitals during Covid to quarantine from family  There was dirt  hair  and areas that looked dirty throughout the kitchen  bathroom and common area 
624864826,Its a good place to stay
624037737,Unit was clean but not sparkling clean and in an area with several homeless wandering and didnt feel safe   While it was cheap and a good value close to downtown I would give this a     out of   overall and we didnt stay our  nd night to just move on      The apartment was not as pictured  different furniture  different layout  it is probably another unit in the building but I was confused why they wouldnt put up exact pictures of the unit   There was also a strong marijuana odor likely coming from other units and both elevators were not working the  nd half of our stay   The stairwell was completely disgusting  as we had to hold our breath to go up from floor   to   as floors     smelled of strong human urine   We left at   oclock on our  nd day there and did not stay the night of       Overall a     stay     It was clean  not sparkling clean  however  as there was old hair on the baseboards and in the corners of bathroom and shower 
630386305,Nice spot right across the street from the park  Great walk ability and front desk had all the helpful information you need 
655654047,This place was not as clean as I expected  I had to get clean sheets for the bed and clean the kitchen as countertop was sticky when arrived  The bed was actually unstable uncomfortable and looks as if it will break any moment  Kitchen was not clean  counter top was sticky when I got there  Sheets in the bedroom had spots on them and the bed felt unstable at night  Front room couch has stains and looks like it needs to be clean 
629096902,This location is awesome  and even better helps if you are      friendly  Because there is a lingering aroma some would like  and some may not  Washer was broken and I had to go to purchase an air freshener to get rid of the marijuana smell  Not sure if it is from a previous guest  cleaner  or nearby apartment but it was a very strong smell  Access to building was broken and apartment reeked of marijuana 
649486569,Im a firm believer in leaving great reviews but I also want to share my candidacy about my experience  Great location and minutes from all the popular spots  Parking was tough but after circling around for       minutes I was able to find a spot  The space is beautiful but it is in need of a facelift   The pictures are a little misleading  The place looks extremely clean in the pictures but once I arrived I immediately noticed things in the home that was dirty such as the floors  dirt spots on the walls and ceiling leaks  The entire place needs to be repainted  The couch has some severe stains which needs to be addressed as well  It was also a bit of an inconvenience because an iron was not available and we had to purchase one in order to attend our pre planned events  The climate control is also a challenge because it required an access code to adjust the thermostat  The host mentioned that he could adjust it remotely but that wasnt a good enough fix at that time  If you want to be close to the city life and downtown Chicago this is the perfect spot  If you are looking for extreme comfort and coziness this wouldnt be the best choice  Im a firm believer in leaving great reviews but I also want to share my candidacy about my experience  Great location and minutes from all the popular spots  Parking was tough but after circling around for       minutes I was able to find a spot  The space is beautiful but it is in need of a facelift  The entire place needs to be repainted  The couch has some severe stains which needs to be addressed as well  It was also a bit of a inconvenience because an iron was not available and we had to purchase one in order to attend our pre planned events  The climate control is also a challenge because it required an access code to adjust the thermostat  The host mentioned that he could adjust it remotely but thats too much back and forth  If you want to be close to the city life and downtown Chicago this is the perfect spot  If you are looking for extreme comfort and coziness this wouldnt be the best choice 
705951268,The bones of this apartment were nice  It has comfortable furniture  was clean  had nice amenities in the kitchen and bathroom and had an awesome location  Unfortunately  I am quite disappointed in the management during my stay  After the first night  I reported an issue with the heater making excessive noise  The responded that they would send someone to check it out  Later in the week  nobody had come to check it yet and it stopped heating all together  I informed the manager again via message and phone call and he said that he would send someone that day to check it but again nobody came  so I had to spend two nights without heat  I will definitely avoid renting from Zencity again  It took the host several hours to respond to questions  Also  I communicated an issue with the heater and was told twice that they would send someone to come check it out but never received follow up  I spent two nights without heat 
672951111,Great location near the lake and public transport  Easy access to restaurants and stores  Parking is definitely manageable  Seamless check in and out  A bit noisy looks out on a back alley  Two lights in BR do not work  Rugs need cleaning  Response to emails a bit slow  I had to call twice about a person who tried to enter the apt who had a key at   PM  It turned out to be someone from Zen City  Noisy back alley busy with garbage collection early in the AM 
626219966,nice for   person or a couple for some alone time Very quiet and nice building Due to size and location  the price could have been cheaper
627045700,It was ok
623563772,   stairs but its beautiful  The place looked beautiful but it really need some changes  Thank you for allowing me to stay  When I arrived the unit smelled like the cleaning staff took a poop and left  It was a long lingering stench  There was no tub stop to take a bath  I had to run out and buy one and when I returned and turned the water on the knob fell off in my hand  Thee was huge wet stain on the couch like someone had sex and left  I tried to negotiate another couple days because I accumulated a lot of things and the unit was on the fourth floor   They never responded and then said the unit was booked  It forced me to leave pre maturely and I wasnt prepared  It is a few feet from a train that ran all day and all night  I couldnt sleep much because it was very noisey   It was    stairs to get to the unit  If you are not able to do steps you will lose your money  I was exhausted  It needed repairs and new furniture 
702154519,We were told to be quit and respectful to the other units and they had an all night and day party with tons of people and made tons of noise  It was really bad  On top of that not having warm water was a struggle for showers   The key was put in the wrong lock box  so there was a delay in check in  Great location  but I wouldnt recommend this place  We were told to be quit and respectful to the other units and they had an all night and day party with tons of people and made tons of noise  It was really bad  On top of that not having warm water was a struggle for showers  Keys were put into the wrong lock box Water was cold for    hours  and a     hour loud party going on upstairs Location was the only thing good about this place  We wouldnt recommend it or use it again 
626128798,The place was okay overall  it could be cleaner 
626152441,Great location downtown  And lovely views from windows  Common areas could  have been cleaned better  but altogether it was beautifully renovated place  Thanks for being a great host  Couches had lots of crumbs and food inside them  And the whole place smelled of weed upon my arrival 
626143437,  I honestly am very offended that we were accused of stains on sheets when we didnt even sleep under them  We never even spotted a stain in the beds because we slept with blankets on top   but the fact that we were told there was a stain we didnt cause definitely shows that the place was unclean  We dont appreciate being blamed for such a thing at all  We got accused for stains on sheets that we never slept under 
625150417,Very nice view  The whole place has plenty of space  Would stay there again 
632333889,Great location and gated parking was a huge plus  We had a nice stay  The location was great  just had a few suggestions and or complaints    The couch in the living room was not very comfortable to relax on    We heard gunshots several nights  but last night it was pretty constant for a good   hours around      pm    Update check in information for future guests so that they know the exterior keypad is broken    Make sure that maintenance alerts guests before they come into the apartment  We returned and knew someone had been in our room but did not know who until we called the host to try to figure it out  The keypad we were supposed to use to enter the building was broken and had to call for assistance 
632297354,Loved it I think it would better for paper towels and maybe a broom other than that I loved it 
709613318,The house was nice  Huge bedrooms
631855805,We road tripped from ATL and had a REALLY hard time checking into the property   The instructions sent did not allow access to the property  We contacted the host  albeit after hours  who didnt respond until LATE morning the next day  It was very frustrating after an eight hour drive  we were exhausted and had to stalk the building praying for someone to leave and give us access to the lobby  Mishaps happen but I was not okay with the late response we received from their team  an entire night of our stay down the drain    On a positive note  the place was clean and had a nice view of the arch 
625346391,Everything was nice  I think the people who stayed before me broke the bed cuz as soon as my wife and I layed down the bed collapsed   They were helpful and communicative very well  It was clean and smelled good  My wife loved that they had cleaning supplies too  They even offered a mid stay clean  Just make sure the bed isnt broke  
625330838,Nice place  Bathroom was a bit dirty but the entire place was nice  Stylish 
630612352,Perfect location  LOVELY LOFT  Comfortable BED and clean bedding  Common areas and bedrooms could have been a little bit cleaner I saw dust around the living room and bedroom walls  Which lead me to think it wasnt COVID cleaned  The washer also did not work my entire stay which was a major inconvenience   the elevator broke down one day as well  It was fun walking up five flights of stairs     Lastly  the vent above the toilet also started leaking as well so the other guests in the other bedroom had to use my restroom  DUST which lead me to believe there wasnt any covid safe cleaning  Washer and Dryer did not work the entire stay which is one of the many reasons why I booked the place  The vent was leaking water over the toilet  So the other guests had to keep coming into my room to use the restaurant  None of the issues were resolved  Elevator also broke down during my visit and we had to walk up five flights of stairs with a child  FUN TIMES 
633013473,It was an effortless stay   The unit was clean  quiet and the host was responsive to my emails  There was no key fob for building access  however  a quick email later and one was provided the next day 
624605906,Great stay  More than we were expecting  Very nice and quick communication  I definitely recommend it  Hello Zencity   Thanks so much for your hospitality   I am a host in the city and sometimes I have guests looking for places to stay and I help them with accommodations  Your place will be in my top list 
631840710, 
649589497,Place was beautiful  Good location to everything around town  Secure parking inside gates and also felt safe inside since you need a code key fob to enter building  The only bummer was the shower head pressure was really low  but still did the job so wasnt make or break   PS  if you decide to rent  take a scooter to Clementines naughty and nice creamery  Its down the street and was amazing  Was hard to find an unlocked door elevator once entering building because all were locked and needed key fob
672399959,Good price for the location  You get what you pay for  The place was okay  The floors looked like they hadnt been swept very well and we found a pair of childrens underwear behind one of the beds  The washer dryer was broken too  Glasses werent clean  floors hadnt been swept  and found a pair of underwear behind a bed 
625239904,Second time staying  the place is gorgeous  that much is true  but the apartment was barely clean  After my check in i messaged several times about things that werent cleaned properly and got no response  Same as last time  Why charge a cleaning fee if you wont clean    Anyway maybe youll have better luck than me  I wont be back  This is my second time staying with Zencity  it seemed like things might be better  and I must say I am equally as displeased as the first time  The apartment was just barely clean  There were no supplies such as paper towels or extra rags to do dishes  There was hair all over the carpeted area and a giant bug in the bed our second night  I dont understand why were paying a cleaning fee if the space wont actually be clean upon out arrival  I am disappointed at the lack of response to any of my messages during my stay and wont be staying wjth Zencity again  There was hair all over the carpet as well as a dirty rag in the couch  The description says it is stocked up with extra supplies   but there was nothing there  Messaged about unclean conditions and still havent received a response 
633365085,Great place 
632989724,Nice modern apartment  Perfect place for one or two to have a nice stay 
624759391,Clean  modern and chic with secured parking and just a few minutes walk away from Lafayette Square park and great places that are open for curbside pickup  The space was great and I was glad to have been able to book in the morning and check in later that day  The folx in the unit next to me were a little rowdy that Saturday night  but the rest of the stay was just fine  A great space  It was a little confusing to find the room because I didnt realize there was another hallway behind the gym  Once I found that  though  things were mostly straight forward  A little maze like inside 
631523342,The space was great and close to so many great areas   Lots of stuff in the kitchen made it easy to cook  and the view from the rooftop terrace was amazing   The bed was very comfortable  and the apartment was spotless when we arrived   The only big drawback was parking  and paying to park on the street   We had to pay through an app and could only pay   hours at a time  The water in the apartment gets dangerously hot very quickly   All faucets  kitchen and bathroom sink  and shower     Also  the oven doesnt seem to work very well   Every time we cooked something  frozen meals that weve done before countless times  came out cold in the middle  but the oven was hot   I dont know if it is turning off partway or if there is a timer or something  but it was very frustrating   The shower was also clogged  so the tub would begin to fill up   We ended up buying a bathmat because the floor would get so wet from the partially filled tub   Like I mentioned on the previous page  the place could benefit from having on premises parking   A visitor sticker received from the front desk or letting them know what license plate info will be parking   The surface lot was never more than half full  so it seems more than possible   Other than that the place was spotless and everything else worked great   The person who cleaned before we got there did an amazing job  and the place looked like a show home  Booked a stay the night before and I had to remind them to accept it  It would be understandable if it was a family  but this is a company  Parking on premises   Talk with the owners and report what license plate will be parking and what days  get a visitor sticker or something  but having to pay to park every two hours is excessive 
716971561,Good location  easy check in as well  tons of parking on the weekend 
645261912,The place is fine  The location is fine  Just note  I went to the CVS on Sunday night      pm for water and I was locked out of this apartment on July    through  July    at      am because their  electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  All of my things were already inside the apartment  I called their number and they said they could not help me until tommorow  They also did not have another spare key to get into the apartment  I went back to the apartment at      am and finally someone came to open up the apartment  They removed the broken electronic keypad and gave me a key  They do not know what went wrong  I also noticed this place is charging me for all the days in the apartment even though I could not stay there on Sunday night  Very shady practice    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience I was locked out of your apartment on july    through  July         am because your electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  Then at      am someone came to open up the apartment    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience I was locked out of your apartment on july    through  July         am because your electronic keypad did not work  I had to find alternative means of housing for that night  Then at      am someone came to open up the apartment    I had to take time off of work and it cost me money to spend the night in another place    Terrible experience
647349275,As far as a place to rest my head and sleep  no complaints  Floorboards were creaky to high hell though and there was some mold in the bathroom  Great location in Lakeview though  felt very safe  Please make sure to clean between the bath tub and the sink  its infested with mold  Black mold between bath tub and sink
627364237,Great place   Love the balcony   The entry way was a bit dirty   Many papers around  Its a great place but needs a bit of TLC   Other than that its a nice place   Love the balcony 
656741221,This was a very fun place to stay with a top notch courtyard area and fitness room  And the room was very clean and suited our needs exceptionally  We were a little disappointed that the pool itself was a little dirty  Otherwise it was an enjoyable stay  The fitness room has the best equipment and there is a free coffee machine in the lobby  Not sure if you know but looks like a smoke detector may be missing   The pool
716082991,Great location in a secure building   Nice apartment  Comfy bed   Id highly recommend Great place   Good location   There were no forks  coffee mugs  or wine glasses in the kitchen   While not a big deal for my stay it would have been nice to have and I may suggest adding for future visitors   There was also mold in the coffee carafe so I placed that in the sink to alert your cleaning crew   Otherwise it was a great stay
652910643,I was refused entry after notifying the hosts and Airbnb that I tested positive for COVID  I wasnt offered a refund  yet instead was promoted to cancel on my own  while paying over half for the stay   Then when I communicated that I wasnt able to where masks  short supply at the hospital  and my disposables were destroyed  after being hospitalized and having no support  canceling my flight  and driving   hours to St  Louis to stay in the listing  I was told  the check in was in fact accessible through a door man  and was threatened if I show I wont be able to enter and that my code to do was indeed revoked   I was stranded  no place to sleep and slept in my rental car  I also had to find abandoned areas to use the restroom due to COVID and me not wanting to enter any stores or restaurants and infect other ppl   This all could have been avoided had Airbnb either intervened or if the host would have canceled  seeing as I wasnt allowed in the listing and also a health threat to everyone in the building    Also  I was allowed to still stay even though I was positive I was refused entry because I didnt have any face coverings  I didnt bother to  check in  anyways for fear of my safety  or the police being called  With all that I experienced from having COVID  this wasnt worth it   Beware of positive COVID guests  however this hosts posses proper professionalism until I refused to gave cancelation penalties    I cant rate what I didnt see  so my rating reflects just that   Wishing you well  Ryann
625645869,The location is in a sketchy area right next to the El train   The description made it sound like it was further up Belmont  The train is loud   always   The cable tv was disconnected when we arrived  and it took   text messages and a phone call to get someone to fix it   Unimpressed and wouldnt stay at a Zencity property again 
623545079,My wife have to clean entire appt  To get rid of dust and and other trash doors walls paint is awful appliances  ok mattresses are ok   No body told that appt on  rd floor pictures from different unit door lock sticky and more  I moved and paid extra money assuming area are totally trouble free but my car had  key job  on one day and both front tire cut on another 
652319254,The unit was pretty much as pictured   There is a spot on the wall that has been plastered  but not yet repainted   Other than that  the space is lovely    We enjoyed the neighborhood and felt very safe   Youre close to everything you might want to do downtown  We enjoyed our stay  Great stay over all   Please consider making additional sets of towels available   at least   full sets per person  along with an addition floor mat in front of the sink   The floor can be quite slippery  Finding the unit was a little bit confusing  We finally figured out that the door that appears to lead to the workout room actually leads to the workout room AND several of the ground floor units 
627325111,nice apartment but was extremely hot and was difficult to contact someone for assistance check in was broken and had no one to contact
653928700,I didnt have a great experience when I got there  No water pressure  no hot water  WiFi stopped working when I was on a conference call  no hair dryer and it smelled like cigarettes   The location however is perfect and the host moved me to another apartment which made up for all my negative experiences It started kind of like a disaster but glad you moved me to the other apartment which made up for all the bad experiences  You should however try to respond quicker Smell not good
633639598,Great area the place was clean    I would just add air conditioners in the bedrooms also  Other than that I would recommend staying here  The place was great   I would just add air conditioners in the bedrooms also   Other than that  it was a good place to stay and I love the area  I figured it out  The refrigerator could of been cleaner 
633584383,Place was pretty clean  The shower curtain needed replaced  It was old and had some mold on it  Besides that  it was pretty spotless  Very nice amenities and centrally located  Beds were comfortable  Had a pretty nice view  too  Had no problems with parking  Would definitely come back  The place was nice  but the shower curtain needs to be replaced and the chair in the living room was bent broken when we arrived  Besides these small things  the place was wonderful  Very comfortable and great location  Would come back  Place was relatively clean  There were some spider webs in the kitchen and the shower curtain in the bathroom needs to be replaced  It had mold on it  Otherwise it was very clean 
657908005,It was nice and clean
630225779,Amazing place
622643185,great  stylish spot with nice  quiet neighbors  Felt safe  Amazing customer service  Needs greater attention in the cleaning department  I recommend it  Great customer service  Love the style  Needs attention in the cleaning department  Floor was not mopped  socks under the couch  opened water bottles in the bedroom closet  crumbs on countertop  dirty kitchen trash can  bottom of toilet bowl dirty  stain on couch  dirty ceiling in bedroom  carpet not vacuumed  stainless steel not clean
672666876,Close to everything but furniture needs to be replace Bed rails are broken and sofa leg was broken 
523426233,Great place and location  The host is very responsive  but could definitely use some help in cleaning the place before their guest arrives 
657069965,A very good choice
667800819,The apartment was a great location and really great space HOWEVER the apartment was not properly cleaned there was hair and crumbs everywhere  It was pretty gross cleanliness wise  Hair everywhere like it was never swept  Random crumbs found on the carpet and throughout the apartment  It was never properly cleaned 
653207618,I enjoy Zencities place  I had some plumbing issues of a major sort  which took  too long to get corrected  Your representative was a bit slow in getting back with me the next day to see if it had been corrected  which it was not  However  I moved into another apartment and I would be happy to rent from you again  My suggestion would be  If someone is having a problem  make contact with him or her in a more timely manner 
652305052,If you are looking for a nice set up based on pictures  this is your spot  But once you arrive  you may think feel otherwise  The kitchen common area is nice  And the location is ideal   However  once you get to the rooms   thats another story  Theres a visible leak outside of the apartment that seems to have been a problem for months  You can see the ceiling in the hallway of the apartment starting to buckle  Once you get to the master bedroom  youre met with a TERRIBLE smell thats deeply embedded in the carpet and it just needs to come up  The carpet is definitely wet from the leak as you can see the wording on the bottom of your shoes on the bathroom tile  Hand grease prints on the wall and the ceiling fan is packed with dust and spiderwebs forming   you can tell its been months since that was cleaned  The cleaning is simply just not up to par for the price of the stay  Luckily we only stayed   nights   You can take your chances on this one   the issue may or may not be resolved by the time you stay  Dont waste your money on a  pretty set up  based on the kitchen common area  You should definitely have the issue with the leak bedroom carpet smell checked out before allowing other guests to spend money for possible hazardous conditions   That carpet simply needs to come up  Period  The smell was worse every night   another night spent and it would have been quite unbearable  And also hire someone who is going to thoroughly clean ALLLLL areas of your apartment   not just the kitchen common area   Whoever cleans  simply does the bare minimum  And thats unfortunate and unacceptable   Ive stayed in much better AirBnB residences over the course of time   and this has been the absolute worst stay  Master bedroom had a terrible smell which is believed to come from a leak  Theres a noticeable leak outside of the apartment  to the point it looks like it may buckle any time soon  Once you walked in the master bedroom  the carpet was damp as you can see the wording under the bottom of your shoes on the tile in the bathroom  Theres another review that indicated a possible leak  and we thought it would have been taken care of by our stay  Not the case  The leak is settling into the carpet which is causing the smell to get worse  Whoever cleans the apartment should be able to tell   but it doesnt seem to be a priority  Also  top sheet of the bed was dirty and crumbs from the previous visit in the bedroom were not cleaned up  The bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned  and the ceiling fan in the master bedroom was quite dusty  hard not to see the mounds of dust  and you could see spiderwebs forming on the ceiling fan as if it hadnt been dusted in months  Hand grease prints were also on the wall     Could have been cleaned better    The focus of cleanliness is obviously in the kitchen common areas  That was somehow spotless as compared to the rest of the place  This listing looked really nice  However  the resting areas were definitely not up to par as it should have been for the price of the stay  Would have done better staying at a hotel 
650228396,We loved our stay  The apartment was well furnished decorated and the location was perfect  We did miss a few amenities that would have made our stay more convenient  but overall  we had a great experience  Zencity provided timely communication before and during our stay  Definitely would stay here again  Thank you for your communication this week  We had a great stay  The only comments I have are that it would have been nice to have a few extra hand towels and a bath mat in the bathroom  The kitchen had plenty of dishes  but I could have used an oven mit  aluminum foil and salt pepper   I also noticed the carpet in the bedroom seemed unswept  with a large clump of hair trapped under the closet door     We loved the location of the apartment  And the access to the gym was an absolute plus    Thanks again  I would definitely stay with ZenCity in the future     Lauren
710637254,This place was exactly what I thought  It was a safe location surrounded by a ton of great places  I wish the apartment was a bit cleaner and the keypad was easier to use  Other than that  it was a good time  The keypad code was hard to use and took a day to actually check in the airbnb
629615135,Overall this loft is really nice  The decorations   art was lovely  It was clean   had what we needed  I would for sure stay again  Just a heads up  getting into the building was a tad bit difficult  Having clearer instructions to get in wouldve been helpful but the host was responsive  Once you get into the building getting to the mail box for the keys was easy  It was a great place for the weekend nonetheless   pricing was good  Thank you  Thank you for allowing us to stay at your place  It was really nice  My only suggestion would be clearer instructions to get in the building  For example   stating to go through the back entrance close to the gas station  Maybe having more pictures  Getting to the mail box was easy but getting into the building was a bit more difficult 
626825334,I do not like to write negative reviews so I will focus on the positive attributes first   The location is great   The provided parking spot is a very nice perk   The apartment complex seems clean and appears to be well managed   The host did respond to my issues in a timely manner   The cleanliness of the apartment was not up to my standards  especially during a pandemic where you would expect extra care to be taken   The host did send a cleaning crew back for a second cleaning   It was better but I still decided to clean the apartment myself   I do treat rentals as my own and kept the apartment clean and even did a load of laundry before I left   Upon checkout the host said that I broke two chairs and wanted to charge me        I noticed two chairs were not assembled properly and were a safety hazard so I did not use them   This is the first time I have been accused of destroying property   If I did do anything inappropriate  I would have notified the host as I am an honest person   Between the cleanliness issues and being accused of destroying property  I will sadly not be staying with this host again on my many trips to Kansas City  You need to focus on providing a clean apartment and not accussing people of breaking items they are not responsible for 
654876413,It was a useful last minute booking for a week  Wasnt my best experience but I had a responsive set of hosts through the company that manages the property  FYI  Lots of dirt under the rug  Bathroom floor was dirty  Bathtub didnt look clean  Shower was a bit difficult to use at first  Other areas were not clean in general 
716960319,Really cute space in a really nice building  The building was beautiful  Overall I enjoyed my stay there were just small things that could have been better  I would refer this and would stay here again  Oh and it was kinda boring since I couldnt really watch TV  But I just watch it on my ipad  There were used wash clothes hanging in the shower  My pillows were incredibly sweating and musty smelling 
628548596,This place was BEAUTIFUL  The view from the patio was amazing and the location is prime  We had a great stay overall  The only reason I didnt give   stars was because there were some slight plumbing issues in the bathroom for our first night  but the host resolved it right away  Would recommend and definitely will be staying here again  Hello    This place was beautiful and we really enjoyed it  It would have been   stars if it werent for the bathroom issues  The toilet made a super loud sound after every flush and the shower had issues  The host did get maintenance up there right away to fix everything which I really appreciated  I just wish we didnt have to deal with it the first night  Besides those minor issues   it was an amazing stay and I would love to stay again in the future   Thanks   DZhari Doorman didnt have my name Dust If the plumbing issues in the restroom were resolved before we came
630473008,The host sent us the wrong access code and so we were unable to check in  When we had trouble accessing the property  there was no response from the host  We ended up having to contact AirBnB to handle the issue  We were unable to stay in the apartment  and had to find a hotel that could accommodate us at the last minute  We were really disappointed with our experience  Absolutely unacceptable  We were sent the wrong check in information  and we were unable to contact the host for assistance  n a Host did not contact me until I first messaged them on the morning of our arrival 
658586253,Good price  Wi Fi would not work for us  The TV speakers didnt work at all  Easy access to downtown  Door code didnt work  but got resolved after talking on the phone for a minute  Working TV and working Wi Fi
715925593,There was hair EVERYWHERE  on the rug  in the blankets   in the bathroom  everywhere  The ground was very sticky as well    The Netflix account will probably be down since users in zencitys other apartments are using it  Theres Hulu which we liked    Could not find the thermostat the whole time   They were not responsive when our new access code did not work when we got a new one since we extended our stay   I did like how there were serve ware  the showers water pressure was solid  the wiki worked well  the overall place was spacious  there were plenty of towels  and the kitchen was big  The bed was comfy as well   TIP  I do not recommend parking outside      Like street parking  my friend got her catalytic converter stolen  and she was parked right in front of the apartment  Its a safe area but not at night 
715298950,Place is great  I had never stayed in an Airbnb and was hesitant  but this place was perfect  Location is key  Close to anything and everything when it comes to shopping and food  If parking in the garage use SpotHero it is much cheaper  Try finding places that allow in and out privileges if you plan on going back and fourth between your place and shopping   Will defiantly stay again  Thanks for allowing us to stay in your unit  More information on parking is a suggestions  but we ended up figuring it all out   Front desk receptionist had no idea what I was talking f about  but let me up to the room and there I got the fob and from there it was a breeze  
713004901,It was a good stay  Only some issue such as the closet door was off the rail  markings on walI  couple pillows were cut up  spots throughout carpet  and somewhat outdated shower curtain  I communicated this with Zencity and was informed  housekeeping made note of it before I we checked in   Did notice the closet door was back on the rail when we came back to our Airbnb that was a little weird since I didnt request it  But cleanliness was up to par  Overall it was good experience It was a good stay  Only some issue such as the closet door was off the rail  markings on walI  couple pillows were cut up  spots throughout carpet  and somewhat outdated shower curtain  I communicated this with Zencity and was informed  housekeeping made note of it before I we checked in   Did notice the closet door was back on the rail when we came back to our Airbnb that was a little weird since I didnt request it  But cleanliness was up to par  Overall it was good experience
669119426,nice place in a good location  Thank you so much for letting us stay with you  The place was super cute and the space was very cute  He had one of the lamps fall when we were trying to turn it on and the screw holes looked pretty stripped  you might want to check the other just to be sure  Thanks again 
668628861,The apartment is spacious and centrally located  There were some very nice touches such as Netflix  a blanket for the couch  etc  Once in a while  there as a very funky smell that filled the apartment  not sure if it was because it is an older building    overall  would stay again  and would recommend  There was a very strange smell that occured frequently within the apartment  At one point  it gave me a headache and I needed to leave  Also  the automated lock  the back piece kept falling off the door  so I needed to realign and restick it every time I wanted to leave the apartment 
705915234,This is a very modern unit in a new building   A very comfortable bed and a large bathroom made for a very relaxing stay  This is a very modern unit  it felt like I was staying in a show unit   There were no decorations  or hints of being in Chicago   I wish you would have included instructions as to how to use the TV and the remotes   While I appreciate the free cable Netflix and so on  I could not access local TV   I also wish you would have included a list of nearby restaurants with phone numbers to aide in ordering food   I was surprised you did not include Wifi  or instructions as to how to access your Wifi   Other Airbnbs I have stayed in gave access codes   Saturday night and Sunday morning  the building door  to get to the elevator  did not shut all the way no matter how much we tugged on it   That was a little unnerving  especially since it was Halloween   Other than those little things  the unit was perfect for what I needed   Thank you  While this unit is new  there is mold on the bathroom ceiling  There were so many extra fees that it really bumped my cost up  more than I was expecting 
702335887,When we arrived  the front door of the apartment building was open  but no one was nearby  A bit sketchy  and this happened several times more throughout our stay  On first arrival  there were dirty dishes in the dishwasher  with no soap anywhere  we had to request more   The bedroom carpets and linens were a bit dirty  and so were the wood floor in the living room and kitchen   About half way through our stay  the smart lock on the door stopped working   After spending a few HOURS on chat with the hosts  trying several different resolutions  they hired a handyman to come the next afternoon  For that period of time  I could not leave the Airbnb because the door would not lock behind me  and if it did  Id have no way of getting back in   There is no physical key   Its really not worth the high fee  and Id recommend searching elsewhere  Front door of apartment building  not unit  was open when we arrived and no one was nearby  Dirty dishes left in dish washer with no soap to clean ourselves  Dirty carpets in bedroom and dirty wood floors elsewhere  White linens stained yellow  Slow responses to their smart lock breaking 
632585534,Really easy check in and out  Staff in the building is friendly and the unit itself is neat and has a cool view  But the floor around the apartment was a little dusty when we were there  And laundry is paid        per load  but it does take card  Super smooth and easy check in out  Thanks  There was just a lot of dust in the corners of the bathroom and the floor of the whole place was a little dusty too  Even though the date of last cleaning was the same as the day we checked in 
628782420,This is a great spot for a few people for a few days  The place was on the  rd floor so be prepared to walk to some stairs  This is my second time using them and I will definitely use them again  I had a good stay just wish there WiFi was working for those times spent in the house and there was a c other than living room  Apartment was changed but new check in instructions was not sent until after I had arrived at location and had to call to get the correct instructions  Issues with WiFi and had to send inquiries for two days before someone finally responded  Central air and working WiFi  the a c  Only cooled off front areas but bedrooms were burning hot in middle of night 
700413722,The place could have been better  Especially the check in process  they did not give us a key to the building  which was stressful and a bit unprofessional  We had to time our entrances with other residents of the building or figure out how to use the callbox  Whenever I communicated this to the hosts  they sent generic check in messages that they had already sent twice  The woman that checked me in poorly communicated to me about getting into the building as well  The bath tub was covered in pubic hair and there was some on the towels as well  The bath tub was also super moldy   We were definitely disappointed by the listing  The place could have been better  Especially the check in process  not having a key to the building was stressful and a bit unprofessional  The woman that checked me in poorly communicated to me about getting into the building as well  The bath tub was covered in pubic hair and there was some on the towels as well  I really recommend checking your bathroom for mold as it was all under the grout on the tub  We were definitely disappointed by your listing  Pubic hair all in the bath tub and mold lining the bath tub Sent me generic messages x  when asking for help to get into building
657031597,This experience was incredibly disappointing and considering my last stay I do not know if Ill be staying with Zencity again  I stayed with this host  same building but different unit  couple weeks back  I love the location  its near plenty of shops  and I love waking up being across the street from tennis courts  The host had the audacity to display signage boasting about the cleanliness of the room when it was nothing but  The restroom was full of urine and hair everywhere  The issue was so bad I sent the host   messages within an hour of my arrival with pictures   There was an offer after receiving several automated messages in response to my email to have someone clean the problem areas and sweep the floors   No one ever showed  The issue was so bad I used boiling water and the apartment cleaning products to disinfect the restroom  The young lady at concierge  who checked me in on my last visit  even reported the issue to a Zencity cleaner the following morning    This room did not meet the standards of cleanliness in the midst of Covid     theres no way  and you all should be ashamed  If I could have cancelled this booking and received a full refund I would have  Extremely disappointed  This experience was incredibly disappointing and considering my last stay I do not know if Ill be staying with Zencity again  The audacity to display signage boasting about the cleanliness of the room when it was nothing but    This room did not meet the standards of cleanliness in the midst of Covid    and you all should be ashamed  If I couldve cancelled this booking and received a full refund I would have  Extremely disappointed  Upon my arrival I quickly reached out to the host  the apartment had not been cleaned  The toilet was full of urine and there was hair EVERYWHERE as if someone was shedding I immediately reached out to the host about the hair everywhere  the lack of cleanliness  a piece of broken furniture  and a small hole in the wall  Initially all I received was automated emails about check in  When I finally got a proper response offering to have someone come clean I was in a tennis tournament  I responded with a proposed time for tomorrow and no one showed  Its a global pandemic at the least I expect the space to be clean
654834111,The locks to the building and the apartment took forever to open due to outdated door locks  The WiFi didnt work  It wasnt Covid    ready  No hand sanitizer  face masks  or anything of that sort  The host didnt respond to any of my calls during my stay  It was a terrible experience  The bathroom and bedrooms werent that clean  There was only one garbage bag for the kitchen trash can  Ive tried to reach out to the host several times  however  no one answered nor returned my missed phone calls  The wifi did not work at all  It was a struggle to get inside the building and inside the actual apartment because the locks are extremely old and require a lot of wiggling the keys  The location was nice  It would have been nice to utilize the Wifi  It would have better if it was cleaner  There wasnt any hand sanitizer  face mask or anything to help keep us save during the Covid    
659439541,Great little place in a fantastic neighborhood  Not much bigger than a suite in a hotel would be so if youre looking for a full apartment sized place to stay  this is not for you    however  the price was half of what a hotel would cost and the building is incredibly quiet and thats what matters most to me  Not so much cleanliness issues as it was just needing repairs in the bathroom  The fan in the living space looked like it hadnt been dusted in months 
709780584,Great place to stay  The amenities are amazing  On initial checkin the unit booked had a noneorking AC heating unit so we were moved to the unit next door  It turned out to be a very very spacious place  The zencity team was great with moving us to a bigger unit  The place was modern and clean  It did only come with only limited serving ware so if you stay here long term you might want to bring your own spoons  forks etc  The only other thing was that in one of the bedrooms you can hear the noise from the elevator going up and down since they are right next to that unit  An alarm which was so loud went off at late hours at night and did not stop for quite a while went off several times  however that is a building things and it didnt not have anything to do with zencity  Other than that the place was very nice  spacious  clean and we truly appreciate zencitys hospitality  Thanks for hosting us  We appreciate all you did to help and resolve any issues we had 
659078307,I love the building and area this apartment is in  The host are very quick to respond and get anything worked out  Would stay again 
703050571,Nice location  nice balcony 
714589123,They cancelled on me hours before I was supposed to check in and I had to stay in a filthy unit in a sketchy part of town with a dishonest owner   Zen City told me I couldnt have the unit because of  maintenance  issues  When I asked what maintenance issue takes five days  they had no reply  So  they left me stranded on the streets of St  Louis  Deplorable  You never answered what maintenance issue takes five days to repair  Not that I would believe any answer you give me  having experienced your lack of regard for customers who have made and paid for reservations days in advance  I suspect you just got more money from another client and didnt care if I was raped  robbed  or killed on the St  Louis streets Deplorable 
657039740,Overall a good experience  besides things not operating correctly and the lack of communication  Overall a good experience  however  things couldve been better if there was communication 
635139163,Loved it here  WiFi was wonky but the rest was great  The WiFi connection barely worked  Otherwise I LOVE this place  Id come back 
635080079,This apartment was OK  but Ive attempted to contact the host about two issues and havent heard back  the smell of smoke in the apartment and the fact that there isnt a fire escape because the windows are barred shut and dont budge  Hi  I messaged Ava about this and havent heard back  Theres no fire escape in the apartment because there are bars over the window that dont budge  The apartment also smelled like smoke 
652246708,This is a great location and a super property for a small family  We had an issue with the cleanliness of the place  the apartment smelled badly of cigarette smoke  our belief is that it came from elsewhere but it was very strong and never dissipated throughout our weekend stay   Also  the floor was quite sticky and the carpet unpleasant to walk on barefoot  Having said that  and given that these distracting things  we are very sensitive to cleanliness and bad smells  would be rectified  wed be more than happy to stay there again  Thank you for hosting us  We believe its rather easy to better the cleanliness issue  We noticed another reviewer has also said the exact same things  The smell in the place was very disturbing but we tried to stay there as little as possible and open the windows  We think that while your property is smoke free  the whole building is not  Thanks again for hosting us  The floor was sticky and the space smelled of cigarette smoke  As no smoking is allowed  we assumed that it came in from vents or ac of the building  It did not feel like the house was not cleaned  just that the carpet was very well used and the floors  well    Just maybe very well used as well  However  the sheets and towels seemed very clean and inviting 
632039542,This historic building is a converter hotel from the     s  The building has loads of character and studio I stayed in was very modern  sort of the best of both worlds  However  my goal for this trip was to find housing for a move to the area in a couple of months so I was excited to stay in a building I was considering  This is a fine place to stay for an Air BnB  especially if youll be out and about  but I wont be living in the building when I move  With the     s character came thin walls and a window unit AC    Fine for a short stay however  the apartment building its located in just wouldnt meet my needs for a year long lease  Overall happy  it served its purpose for a great price  This may be the buildings  issue  and a combination of the space being a studio  but it very much felt like a hotel room  I found myself refer to  my room  when talking to my friends    It felt more like a hotel stay than a home  but without the luxury of a hotel   Also  there were no paper towels  There was a holder but it just seemed weird  Again  not that big a deal   A few more towels and bath mat wouldve made a noticeable difference   I was in town looking for an apartment for my upcoming move  I was considering the Del Prado  but after this stay  I am not  Perhaps that is not within your purview and thats fine  The space and my stay met my needs  but it was not a selling point for living in the building  The floor  without socks  feet were dirty  not that a big a deal 
629083790,This unit is in a building that is currently undergoing renovations   It is a small  but very modern space  in a great neighborhood   Because of the renovations  the price when I booked was discounted     from equivalent spaces  At this price  I thought the unit was a great deal   There is construction work ongoing during the day  but it didnt bother me much  and morning   evening   night are wonderfully quiet    As another reviewer noted  there are construction workers present during working hours  but on my visit  they were friendly and well behaved   For me  there were no safety concerns   I would definitely book this place again  As this is a new place  heres a list of things you might want to fix     Cleanliness   Overall  it was fine  but the debris on the floor when I arrived was definitely annoying     The shower   It is designed in such a way that you cant close the door  thus  when you shower  water splashes on the floor   This is a weird   people will definitely not like it     There is no cord for the electric kettle  There was hair and construction debris on the floor   The first thing I had to do was sweep 
632066727,First off  the space is truly amazing and I would stay here time and time again  But great places can also come with a set of issues  I had to call Zencity for check in instructions  The host didnt respond to my messages and it was past check in time  There was a half eaten pizza in the oven  Someone walked in while I was in bed without knocking  Reached out to host who assured me it wouldnt happen again  Its a pretty noisy neighborhood and the host contacted me twice about noise in the building just to check to see if I was involved  Despite those issues  I extended my stay twice and would have again if I didnt need to get back home   That loft is BEAUTIFUL  The tub and the shower are to die for  I would have stayed even longer  Love that loft Had to call    minutes after check in  No one called me  There was a half eaten pizza in the oven 
634986880,Nice place apartment area  Stayed in a different room before on a different trip and loved it so tried out this one  Had minor issues with cleanliness ie some dirty cups and tongs that needed washed as well as having dirt residue on my feet as I walked bare foot in the space  However   these are not turn offs  I highly recommend both the room and the host  The space is very nice but upon further inspection many of the cups had sticky rims as if they were used and put back on the shelf without being watshed  A pair of tongs and pan had residue on them and I walked around the non carpeted area and had dirt accumulated on my feet 
632039570,Great value Code for the door didnt work   Two different people from front desk tried to help but ask couldnt get the code to work   The front desk associates finally gave me a key to use for my stay Trash from previous tenant wasnt taken out
631308068,Upon first arrival we had trouble getting to our room because the outside screen we needed to enter was completely broken   Also  we followed the instructions and went up the stairs as told  but this lead us to an emergency staircase and still no way to get to our room   We were supposed to go DOWN to the basement rather than UP like it said    Once we finally got in  it was very nice and just as expected  Please fix the screen on the outside entrance   Without it  there is no way for the guests to enter  We arrived late in the night but I had communicated previously that wed be getting in late so they knew to expect this   Upon arrival there was a digital screen we needed to use in order to access the building  The screen was completely broken and there was no way for us to get in  We tried calling Zencity and asking AirBnb Emergency line for assistance but no response from either   We hung out outside the doors for about    minutes until finally one of the residents let us in as they were leaving  As we entered we walked up the stairs like instructed but This took us up an emergency staircase and we still couldnt figure out how to get to our room    Exhausted and crusted we finally figured out we were supposed to go DOWN to the basement instead of up the stairs like instructed in the check in instructions 
630626015,To sum up my experience with Zencity in one word    yikes  Note  I am a solo female traveler  so my number one priority when looking for a place to stay is safety    The space itself was very nice  Netflix was free and many other streaming services were available with user login  Anything I needed for cooking was provided  Excellent location  short walk to cafes and in an area that many food services deliver to  ie  Postmates  DoorDash  etc     Zencity  on the other hand  was the worst experience Ive had with an Airbnb host  To get into the building  guests must enter a key code and then speak a code into the intercom  The only way to get in to the building and use the elevator  which must be used  as the stairs are locked  is by following these steps  Zencity said that they provide a key fob  available in the room  for immediate access to the building and elevator  However  there was no fob left in my room  I contacted Zencity immediately and was told they would get the fob to me ASAP  yet by the time I left    hours later  I still had not received a fob or any more responses  despite my multiple attempts to contact Zencity via phone and messages  Again  this causes issues for me that people traveling with others might not face  At one point during my stay I came back to find someone loitering in the entrance  waiting to follow someone into the lobby  If I had had a key it would have been easy to go in quickly and avoid the man waiting  But  since I didnt  and I did not want to say the code out loud in front of him  I waited outside  It was a scary situation for me that only ended well because a male resident arrived and made sure I got inside safely  While of course Zencity is not responsible for loiterers  they were responsible for providing a key  which they failed to do    Cleanliness  Im not sure anyone cleaned the room before my stay  more than to make the bed  The shower bath had clearly not been cleaned  or cleaned well  in quite a while  There was a makeup brush  not mine  sitting on the living room floor  which was a clear indication that the floor had not been vacuumed 
658656369,Nice place to stay at loved the area parking was a little hard to find but overall a good experience  Fun experience and loved the area
711149100,I would recommend to get every detail you can before renting from this company  Parking is horrible and Zencity arent good at communicating 
669369243,Great location  Great space  Could have been cleaned much better  Upstairs shower was unusable due to dirt and grime on shower floor  The door to enter apartment looked like it had been broken into with wood exposed and scratches around lock  Otherwise  no complaints Key fob was not offered  Could only enter through one door and the process was just a little longer than I needed it to be  Had to dial in each time and recite numbers to gain access upon entry  Upstairs shower was dirty  Could not step into the shower because there was so much    grime and grit on the floor  Did not seem to be cleaned
634989366,This Space was only disappointing based on the cleanliness   It was in a safe building with security  lake and park side  close coffee and restaurants  and had nice Feng shui inside honestly  but absolutely every surface was dirty   The counters  tables  walls  bedroom comforter  and floors  were all either not wiped down  sticky  or had hair everywhere   Its a real shame this space could be a great get away  Im just happy I happen to arrive with Lysol wipes  or I would have been even more disappointed  I left that apartment cleaner than when we arrived  I was afraid to even use the kitchen based on the filth  I should have the cleaning fee refunded as there was no cleaning done besides by me   All surfaces were dirty  cup marks  sticky  etc  Little black hairs all over the floors and bed as well  super gross to be completely honest   Its a shame because the space could have been great  Really disappointed upon arrival after traveling all day and during Covid    youd think cleanliness would be top priority  I dont understand why I had to pay a cleaning fee when clearly the space wasnt cleaned at all before we arrived  I cleaned the entire space with Lysol wipes when we got there  all surfaces were completely dirty 
655609824,Great Stay   Clean Stylish Apartment  Had issues with the unresponsive door entry system on the outside of the building  Once a resident allowed me access to the building  everything was perfect from then on The keypad on the outside didnt work at all so I had to wait around       minutes for a resident to allow me access to the building and so I could enter the apartment 
702994081,Not a bad spot to stay for the money 
632627966,The rooms are a little smaller than what they look like on the pictures and the washer and dryer doesnt really do the job but other than that the place was good just wish it was some better pool sticks 
654387670,Ive stayed in a plethora of spaces  sometimes you get what you pay for  The location was good if youre wanting to be downtown  However if you are looking for somewhere quiet this building isnt it  The neighbors were pretty loud during the quiet hours  This booking was really just a place to sleep and shower  Dont expect more There was a note saying cleaned by Haley  however the space wasnt too clean  The blinds were also broken and wouldnt close  Some of the pillow cases on the bed werent clean looking  The bathroom wall looked like there were some traces of feces on it next to the toilet 
634028475,The floors were disgusting  sticky  there was nats everywhere  I could not even pour a drink without a nat getting in it  There was someone elses hair on the floor in bathtub  no keurig  or water in the fridge or steps on how to make coffee  No laundry detergent or soap  I couldnt even turn the ac on it was locked  The floors had streaks all over them and were dirty and sticky  I was harassed by two men in the hallway multiple times and felt very unsafe  Also there was no where to park  I had to pay     the first day for parking and I got   parking tickets  Would never recommend this place to anyone  The floors were disgusting  sticky  there was nats everywhere  There was someone elses hair on the floor in bathtub  no keurig  or water in the fridge or steps on how to make coffee  No laundry detergent or soap  I couldnt even turn the ac on it was locked  The floors had streaks all over them and were dirty and sticky  I was harassed by two men in the hallway multiple times and felt very unsafe  Also there was no where to park  I had to pay     the first day for parking and I got   parking tickets  Would never recommend this place to anyone 
647403683,Good sized apartment on  th floor and it is lovely   Some  cons   The bathroom is directly inside the front door with a frosted glass door   kinda lacks a private feel  The flooring is laminate  and coupled with the loft ceilings   it make for an echoy  less than quiet environment   WiFi was painfully slow  but the router is closed inside a closet so    locatiion matters   lack of   Bedroom lighting is atrocious   Great bedding  so comfy   Nice  big windows face street with a great view   Overall  you will not beat the price on an apartment like this  period   It is a steal  and well worth every dime  Lacked basic cleaning supplies for longer stay guests  like paper towels  tea towels  trash bags  dishwasher soap  mop  Extra light bulbs for bathroom   I would have liked to been able to spot clean over the week  Parking sucks  and trust that you will get towed to the tune of       No parking ticket here   So READ PARKING TIMES CAREFULLY 
716478583,Felt safe and comfortable  Plenty of room to relax and feel at home  Hi  It was a great stay other than the bathroom had quite a few hairs that were definitely not ours and the used towels in the bedroom closet were a little strange  I would at least put them in the laundry room  Would have loved if maybe there had been a few bottles of water or coffee but other than that it was a great place and great location  Thank you for a nice stay 
632070490,Beautiful space  Love the decor  Definitely had a hotel vibe  which is exactly what Im looking for in an air bnb       on cleanliness  only issue is that were a few cobwebs in the kitchen and a couple of dryer sheets on the ground in the bedroom  Check in was a bit dicey because I was unable to use the front keypad as I was instructed to in the check in instructions  The keypad was busted  After a few phone calls I was able to get in and secure my fob from there on  getting in and out was smooth sailing    This air bnb has a ton of cute personal touches  From the coffee table books to the French press I felt like they had thought of just about everything    One odd thing to note is that upon my check out  I was greeted by the cleaning lady sitting outside of my room waiting for me  I left about an hour early  so that was a bit odd to me  I dont think that reflects much on the bnb though  since most cleaners are independent contractors or work for a separate company    Overall  great stay  Great location and great amenities  Wish it hadnt been during COVID so I could have enjoyed the work our room  rooftop  and nearby restaurant life  Maybe next time  Beautiful space  Love the decor  Definitely had a hotel vibe  which is exactly what Im looking for in an air bnb       on cleanliness  only issue is that were a few cobwebs in the kitchen and a couple of dryer sheets on the ground in the bedroom  Check in was a bit dicey because I was unable to use the front keypad as I was instructed to in the check in instructions  The keypad was busted  After a few phone calls I was able to get in and secure my fob from there on  getting in and out was smooth sailing    This air bnb has a ton of cute personal touches  From the coffee table books to the French press I felt like they had thought of just about everything    One odd thing to note is that upon my check out  I was greeted by the cleaning lady sitting outside of my room waiting for me  I left about an hour early  so that was a bit odd to me  I dont think that reflects much on the bnb though  since most cleaners are independent contractors or work for a separate company    Overall  great stay  Great location and great amenities  Wish it hadnt been during COVID so I could have enjoyed the work our room  rooftop  and nearby restaurant life  Maybe next time  I was told to enter the building with a keypad out front  The keypad was busted when I got there  I called the host  but because Zencity is a company and not an individual  it was a bit difficult to reach them  I had to call posing as someone that was looking to secure a booking in order to reach someone  If you select the option for current guest  it sends you to voicemail  It probably took about    minutes to get inside  but once they answered it was smooth sailing  They buzzed me in and once I got to my room I was able to secure my fob and didnt have to deal with the front key pad again  I only say   stars because it was difficult to get in contact with the host when I was unable to get in  However  it ultimately ended up being resolved in     minutes after my  nd call 
635764126,This is a clean  stylish  safe space that I recommend for anyone just passing through  that needs to sleep  The walls are pretty thin  so you might hear your neighbors arguing  Other than that  I would recommend this Airbnb  Your apartment was very clean  so I thank you for that  It was also stylish  which was nice  Theres no trash can anywhere except for your bathroom  and there was no toilet paper on the roll so I had to provide my own  Please make the instructions for where to park  and how to get to your apartment  more accurate 
659909294,Great location The host was great   Housekeeping is herrible it is important due to COVID    to make sure that unit are professionally cleaned before and after check in It was dirty linens in the hamper in one of the bedrooms  bathroom floor was dirty  kitchen cabinets had fingerprints on them other than that it was ok    Its all housekeeping issues Better housekeeping inside and outside the building
635964442,The place was accurate to the description  The place was mostly clean but the garbage can was full when we got there and the AC did not do a good enough good cooling the room 
659687102,The apartment is cosy and in a good area  Housekeeping needs to pull up the drapes get on their knees and follow the dust  debris  When I was checking out I found a used condom wrapper behind the curtains  The light switches were grimy as well 
635520977,The space is very modern and really clean and organized  Theyve done a good job  The bed was very firm which isnt a bad thing if you like that sort of thing  Its impossible to take a bath in that bathtub cause there no way to stop the water from running  and the dishwasher is broken  The washing machine is great my most favorite feature   I had a great time in the space thank you so much for letting me stay there   I made sure to leave everything laundered when I left and as organized as possible   I failed to leave the keys behind   they were in one of my pockets in my shorts and took them by accident   Sorry   If you send me the address Ill ship them ASAP 
635486818,Great location  Place is exactly as pictured  Was a perfect fit for our family trip 
700030922,I love how open this space was with big windows  I also appreciated the parking garage that was right across the street from the building can never complain about a keypad to unlock the front door to enter the building  The people who lived in the building were very welcoming and nice  My host responded to me fairly quick  over all I had a very pleasant stay  
673897279,The location is great  but Im biased because I used to live in that building    The parking garage is about a block away  and it was free during the weekend   It had plenty of parking   The check in and check out were very  very easy    I didnt have to do any cleaning myself   I do wish there were more towels   Be prepared for only one large towel per person   We had a one bedroom  and it was perfect for my two kids and me  There is a little table in the living room that is pulling out of the wall  and the drywall is crumbling down   Also  the towel bar is missing because one of the hooks pulled out of the wall before we got there  so there was no place to hang our towels   Speaking of the towels  I really needed extra towels for my kiddos  but no one responded to my message   When we checked in  I noticed the room and towels had a faint smell of cigarette smoke   That seemed to dissipate as time went on    makes me think maybe the housekeeper smokes     You might check on that   Otherwise  it was a very clean space   Easy check in   VERY easy check out  I submitted a request to make sure there would be extra towels  and that message was ignored    no response and no extra towels 
635075180,Great location  space was nice  Could be cleaner  There were details missed that made the space not feel as clean  Space was nice however sheets did not feel clean  bathroom didnt feel clean there was stuff on floor and hair on my towel 
635011421,We stayed during the  th of July so it was quite busy but the building decor and scenery were nice  The Airbnb itself was spacious w  a lake view from each room  There were a few things that couldve been better  the couch definitely needed to be cleaned  its a cream color so you could see every stain  One of the bedrooms was extremely cold  even after turning the a c off the air was still blowing out and the vent wouldnt close  One of the bathrooms had an issues with water leaking on the floor after using the shower for longer than    mins    Once they fix the minor things it would be a perfect stay 
633344054,Exactly like the pictures  stylish and cozy  There is construction going on next door so youll hear them working and the neighbors upstairs you cant hear only just music now and then and the occasional chair move  The doors for the bed rooms are a little hard to close so you kinda have to slam them and I think they didnt like it but what could I do    The shower head leaks but thats just a quick fix  Overall I enjoyed my stayed  It was in a very very great location  Nothing scary at night like my previous stays in Chicago  Definitely will come back  Thank you for having us in your space  Enjoyed relaxing since nothing is quite open yet 
707893249,Had problems checking in  took over an hour before we were settled into a unit that was    min away from our original booking  I had to reach out to the company the next day to figure out checking in to our original booking  Upon checking in  there was a light bulb out in the bathroom and there wasnt a lot of cups and dishware for even two people  Disappointed since I saw so many good reviews for this company  Very disappointed with how our first night staying with you went  I understand having issues  but it was very frustrating being shuffled around and it seemed like your company didnt know what was going on  i e not knowing where your keys were   and garage arm at one property was not working and light bulb was out in our unit  Just didnt meet my expectations  Intercom system was broken at our original booking  then keys were missing from  nd unit they tried to put us at  and then garage arm didnt open at  rd unit we ended up staying at  And the only communication used was messaging through Airbnb instead of calling  We got shuffled between   different properties before we could settle in for the night  Slow responses  and customer support wasnt able to get in touch with people who supposedly had our keys 
652893918,I am from St  Louis and wanted to show my boyfriend around the area   This is a great location right across from Forest Park and the front desk attendants were very nice and accomodating   Unfortunately  the apartment was not clean examples being an old bar of soap with hair on it in the bathroom  spoiled milk in the refrigerator  no trash bags in the apartment  or the trashcan   Parking is difficult   Wifi was terrible basically didnt work  forced us to leave early so we could complete our telework   This is run by an agency so there is no incentive to make it better   I prefer real owners as they have pride in their property    There is a no visitor policy which we didnt know about until we arrived so my parents couldnt come to see us for dinner    I love STL and there are so many great houses and homes to rent from   This wasnt one of them  The bathroom had an old bar of soap  and the kitchen had someone elses food in it   It seems the only thing they cleaned was the trash can as it didnt have a bag in it when we arrived  This is clearly run by an agency and not an owner   There was no help with the wifi which wouldnt even allow us to do our work remotely   We ended up having to pay for a wework as we couldnt take meetings  clean the apartment  there is a pandemic going on  and invest in better wifi 
630251543,This place has serious cleanliness issues  The host did not offer appropriate solutions  There was hair from several people all over the floor and the surfaces were noticeable dirty  Little to no effort to clean and disinfect  I noticed the morning after a late check in and was horrified  There was even something that looked like a bloody smear on one wall  It is abundantly clear that they are letting the place go between several guests with minimal attention  Hopefully they will fix these issues going forward  However  I would advise anyone traveling during the pandemic to avoid this place AT ALL COSTS   it is not safe and the hosts seem ambivalent about it  They hadnt even bothered to empty the bathroom trash between guests  and it was nearly overflowing   The amenities were poor at best  Cheap bed and pillows  no soap in one of the dispensers  stained and grimy furniture  I ended up getting a refund and booking a hotel for the same price 
636245118,good place  great location  There were endless gnats flying around  couldnt even leave food uncovered    the thermostat never went below    degrees  Even after Zencity changed the setting to cool only      degrees  it never dropped  Then a maintenance man unexpectedly wakes us up at  am to only look at the air system for   minutes to only say that it could get no colder because of the size of the building  But the location of the airbnb was perfect   all of the decor in the loft was nice 
634600654,Zencity is a wonderful host to work with  They were more than accomodational    stars Thank you soo much hospitality There was a broken chair in the living room space  I attempted to fix it so we wouldnt be charged with any potential damages 
635744164,The Airbnb itself is super nice  the building is secure and safe  There is everything you need provided in the Airbnb and the host always makes checking in easy  But  do not stay here if youre looking for a quiet stay  There is a bar right across the street that attracts a loud crowd until     am  There was street racing  squealing tires  screaming  and fireworks  I stayed two days after the  th so that one is on me   Although this unit is on the  th floor  all of these things can be heard clear as day  I luckily didnt have to be up early either of the days or I would be more upset  Ive stayed with zencity a handful of times and they are always pleasant hosts so Im not holding this stay against them I just want others to be aware of how loud it actually is
671224681,I would not recommend spending this kind of money on this building  It is unclean  and more of a hassle than a  vacation   I would really like my money back  This is not a clean  safe environment  There was a poop stain on the sheets  It is obvious that they do not clean or change the sheets  I contacted the host about the poop stain on the sheets Saturday afternoon and received a response Sunday at   am  We were leaving on Sunday so that really didnt help  It was just a hassle  The buildings elevator was  reserved  for the day and we had no way of knowing there was an additional one in another part of the building  To get to it we had to leave the building and walk a block to get to the other side  I at one time had to walk up the   flights of stairs 
633666438,Great location in a cute neighborhood  Check in instructions were very long and onerous  Overall cool apartment but it was a bit dirty   which could be concerning during the COVID pandemic  Great value though  Thanks  Place just seemed a bit dirty  Great location though and hip atmosphere  Check in directions were extremely long and onerous  and wrong  They said go  inside and up the stairs  it took us   trips up and down to realize you go inside and then DOWN  Found a condom wrapper under the bed  water stains in bathroom wall  no dishes all in dishwasher with no note of clean or dirty 
669633045,It was a nice clean place to stay they had all the necessary amenities the checking in was a bit rough because the key to get in did not work I would really update the checkin it took forever for me to get in and then I left and came back and it took another hour for the door to unlock
645336401,It is easy to hear noises from outside the room  whether its the elevator clunking or trash chute  or music from the apartment below us  Luckily everyone obeyed the quiet hours so it was fine  Truck noises on the street below may also wake you up early in the morning  You can definitely tell this used to be a hotel room but it was extremely clean and well appointed  Do not expect to lounge comfortably on the couch  and ALWAYS make sure you have the   digit code with you when you leave since the door locks automatically  Overall this stay was good and I appreciated all the security measures  Putting       in front of   th Street made it confusing at first  It would also be helpful if the listing said Pickwick Plaza  Also it should be made clear that even if the entry doors are held open by someone else  you still need to enter the room number and code in order to use the elevator Since the entry doors were being kept open due to someone moving in  it wasnt clear that we still needed to enter our room number and code in order to use the elevator  Putting       in front of   th Street made it confusing at first  It would also be helpful if the listing said Pickwick Plaza 
633370637,Stylish   fun    the couch broke just from sitting on it  though  and we had to have someone else let us in because the front door box was broken   Great location   space nonetheless   
635989119,Beautiful bathrooms  nice soft memory foam mattresses   and cool pool table 
702764602,Not the best  not the worst
635109673,This is difficult as I want to be honest for future Air bnb guests  The TV did not work because the outlet that powers it didnt work  Its on the  th floor and the elevator went out  I booked the room for the open rooftop to watch the fireworks but it was closed down  That being said  the room itself is wonderful  Has a great view  AC blows super cold  Has a bedroom fan  Bed was very cozy  Definitely has a ton of potential if all gets fixed  Needs one deep clean to last for awhile  There was a lot of hair and dirt  Im not sure the person that was messaging me  knew the room   Said for me to move the tv when it is mounted on the wall  Working tv  working elevator  open rooftop  Bed was perfect  Ac was super cold  Loved that 
634018880,A bit hot in the rooms  living room was the coolest area  could use some fans   there was issues with the WiFi use for the TV  we had to use our phone hotspot  Other than that the overall stay was great  perfect space for a vacation would definitely stay again  A bit hot in the rooms  living room was the coolest area  could use some fans   there was issues with the WiFi use for the TV  we had to use our phone hotspot  Other than that the overall stay was great  perfect space for a vacation would definitely stay again 
591196950,I was ecstatic to give this place a solid      However  I would only give it a      The apartment was just  okay   Im not difficult to please  but the apartment didnt meet my expectations  that was based from the advertisement   This was mainly due to it not being clean upon arrival  I honestly feel like the cleaning fee shouldnt have been applied  Some of the issues encountered are as follows    There was trash   strange yellow liquid in the stairwell entrance to the apartment    The floors needed to be mopped  I was barefoot for less than    minutes and my feet were already black on the bottom   The shower was not on the clean side  one of the bathrooms had a bunch of dead flies on the ceiling    The dishwasher had dirty dishes in it and the smell on the inside was extremely sour   The keurig had old  foggy water in it and there were no k pods as seen in the photos  Besides the cleanliness of the apartment  Some of the furniture in the photo is not the same in the apartment  The couch on the right in the photo is not in the apartment    it was replaced with a futon  I will it was very comfortable   Now the grey couch in the photo is in the apartment  but its worn out in person  The cushion was not great  When you sit on it  you will slide off  We made it work by just pulling out the bed inside and sitting on it that  The mattress on that was comfortable  The kitchen table stools were kind of worn as well and the table in the photo had different chairs  However  I didnt mind it  The TV changes to different apps  STARZ  HBO  etc  very slowly so I would recommend just watching regular cable  The WiFi was strong in certain places and extremely weak in others   Aside from the cons  here were the pros    Very spacious    All of the bedrooms were clean and the beds were extremely comfortable     Water got nice   hot   The heating was great in the apartment    It was stocked with necessary cookware and silverware   Parking isnt a hassle    The team of hosts responded quickly when I had a questions  In conclusion  my family and I did have a great time in the apartment  I think if the cleaning team would just deep clean a bit more  everything would be great so hopefully it gets better in the future  Accuracy in what was listed in description  Information was misleading 
660276409,The building is located in a great place 
635733391,Clean  stylish space in a really great location  Had to wait for a bit to check in because cleaning was late  but I booked same day so this is understandable  Thanks for the stay 
635717292,Good location  nice place to stay for a few days  We had no WiFi and couldnt use the tv the entire time we were there and received no response from the host  Other than that  it was a good stay  In the future  Id make sure the router works so your guests can have WiFi and watch TV  Also  some communication would be nice 
630841654,Fabulous location  great space  The building is old  but unit nice  Could use a regular coffee maker  only has french press which I didnt know how to use and didnt have time for  Good thing is there is a      downstairs and Dunkin Donuts right across the street  The stairs will give you workout     Marty you were great  Id get that toilet seat fixed and clean the floors     Any recommend a regular coffee maker  I didnt have the time or desire to fuss with a french press so I spent a lot of time and money getting coffee every morning  Thats the only thing that bothered me but the apartment is great and super location  Ill be back   The floors were dirty   it was clear no one had been there a while and no one went in before I arrived to check it  All spaces were clean as were the bedding and towels   no complaints there at all  Just the dust hair on the floors throughout  The building entry and carpeted stairs to the unit are very dirty 
711275721,This place had few issues  Garbage disposal malfunctioned which led us to not being able to use sink  cook or use dishwasher   There were few bugs around sink and dishwasher areas that were an issue   The internet connection was weak  Streaming was lot of waiting and buffering  There doesnt seem to be a router in the place  just a wifi extender  which Times out pretty often    Other than that place was clean and all needed amenities were available  Garbage disposal malfunctioned and that led to us not being able to use sink  cook or use dishwasher    Lot of insects around dishwasher and sink    Place was clean otherwise  All needed amenities were available   Internet connection was weak  Lot of buffering while streaming  There does not seem to be router in the place  just a wife extender point 
631879426,My partner and I loved our stay with Zencity  specifically at this location and especially during these times of COVID     We did wish that the space was a bit cleaner when we arrived  there were still remnants of the previous guests in a few places  The listing also advertised that we would have rooftop access and unfortunately our key fobs did not give us access and it was never resolved  Other than that they had great communication and the apartment was wonderful  Would definitely stay again  Thanks for the stay  The only issue we had was the roof was available for use but our key fob wouldnt give us access to it There unfortunately was hair in the shower that wasnt cleaned
659950715,Good place for a good price  Door entrance to the room was loose and could easily make a lot of noise even when locked  Door stop to the bathroom was broken  There were less kitchen wares available than in the other rooms Ive been 
633804818,The area wasnt great and there is no parking  it ended up being okay  The place was pretty clean  No blackout curtains and bed wasnt so comfortable  Building has a ton of residents who werent wearing masks during Covid times and one small elevator 
630558777,Booked this Airbnb last minute because I was coming home to KC for some family stuff  Tried getting into the unit around  am after getting into town and the code for the door I was given was wrong  Tried calling leaving messages   but no one answered until the next day  If I would of been in a city I didnt know I would of had to sleep in the hallway  but luckily I knew people in town for a place to crash  Next day I got a new code  got into the Airbnb and was changing when a maintenance guy walks into the unit  He said he didnt think anyone was in the unit  but was told there was supposed to be a photo shoot later and that I should call to make sure I have the correct unit  When calling zencity they wanted to still do the shoot at a time I wouldnt be in the apartment  but verified that I had the correct unit and that I could stay in it  I was supposed to have a late check out the next day to compensate for all the miscommunication and that was not communicated with the cleaning lady and she also walked into the unit while I was still I was there and verified that she was never told about the late check out    Zencity refused to give me a refund for the night that I couldnt get into the unit even though they gave me the wrong code to get in  Because of that and the fact that there was clearly no communication with staff to update them on the status of the room  and I had my privacy and honestly safety compromised multiple times I will not be booking this unit or any other listing that uses zencity going forward 
631715128,This place was in a perfect location and was exactly what I was looking for to have a stay cation  However  I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the entire house  especially the bathrooms and kitchen  During Covid there should be even more importance from the host on how the home is cleaned  The house also had no paper towels or anything for me to clean up with  We did really love the outdoor patio area  but the lights did not work to enjoy during the night time 
630818562,The good  The apartment is spacious  has a great view   comfortable beds  and new appliances  Zencity is quick to respond  check in and checkout are seamless  and the lobby staff is wonderful   The bad  As other reviews mention  it really seems like no one cleans the apartments between each guest  We arrived to a very dirty floor  bedsheets that did not smell clean and has several stray hairs  and a trash can that had not been emptied  We asked for clean sheets  Zencity delivered them promptly  but only gave us one set for two beds  Im sure Zencity would have sent someone to clean it had we not cleaned it ourselves  but it really should just be cleaned before guests arrive rather than upon request  Also  the remote had no batteries  Zencity sent us replacement ones  but after that  the remote still was not paired to the TV   Overall  the apartment is worth it only because it is so competitively priced  but it could be improved so much and be such a better value if it were just cleaned more thoroughly  or at all  between guests  I assume the lobby staff is more of Mac Propertys responsibility than Zencitys  but regardless  they deserve a standing ovation  Every single one of the wonderful women who staff the front desk was extremely friendly and cheered up our days  As I said in my email  it really seems like the apartment was not cleaned at all after the last guest left  The floor was very dirty throughout  the beds looked barely made and all the sheets had hair on them  the trash can had food and empty cans at the bottom underneath the trash bag  etc  Its really a shame  because the apartment is beautiful and comfortable  but the first thing we saw when we came in was the very dirty floor  It really ruined the first impression completely and left us apprehensive of touching any surfaces for the entire stay  As mentioned  more thorough cleaning  or really  any cleaning at all  would make a huge difference in the apartment  Additionally  the couch in the living room has broken middle legs and the remote seemed not to work at all for the TV   That being said  the apartment was still very competitively priced for the amount of space and the view  so the value was still decent 
634084444,The apartment was beautiful and exactly as listed  Its in a great location close to the Central West End and Barnes Jewish hospital campus  However  I found that cleanliness was lacking and that many folks working in the building did not wear masks  which make me hesitant to recommend this listing during a pandemic  During non pandemic times  I would absolutely stay here  but right now  I may find somewhere with higher cleanliness and more consistent mask wearing procedures  Thank you so much for hosting me  The space is beautiful  However  I would have appreciated if the space was cleaner since I found hair in the shower upon my arrival  and I would have appreciated if the Zencity staff member who entered the Airbnb during my stay  to pick up an internet cable  had worn a mask  Additionally  I noticed that there were many folks who worked in the building not wearing masks  Im not sure if theyre with your team or not  but its disrespectful not to wear a mask at work during a pandemic  It demonstrates that your company is not concerned with potentially exposing your guests and your staff members to COVID  I hope that mask wearing will become a company policy moving forward for the duration of the pandemic to protect all parties involved  Its stressful enough to travel right now  please make it easier on your guests by cleaning your units thoroughly and having team members wear masks  I found a couple long hairs in the shower and a bug in the shower upon my arrival  Improved cleanliness  especially during a pandemic    improved building maintenance  one of the elevators was down during my stay   and no interruptions from the Zencity staff  they had to come in and grab an internet cord  which was fine  but they werent wearing a mask  which made me feel uncomfortable and which felt disrespectful given the pandemic 
635948432,The apartment was nice  modern and in a great neighborhood  Unfortunately  we experienced some cleanliness issues that we felt shouldve been resolved prior to us arriving  Upon arriving  the place looked exactly like the pictures but we soon noticed the kitchen floors werent swept or mopped  One of the first things we had to do after we arrived was sweep the crumbs and dust spread throughout the kitchen  The following day we regrettably found a pair of womens underwear on the floor next to our bed   evidence that the place wasnt thoroughly cleaned before our arrival  All in all  the place was nice but I feel more attention shouldve been given to the overall cleaning   especially in the climate we all now live in 
478209876,Clean large rooms  Really just two bedrooms with a couch sleeper downstairs  Little window units upstairs really try to keep bedrooms cool  we came on a     degree index day   Bathrooms are well stocked except hand towels   weird right  Driveway was tight for our Tahoe but smaller cars  it can fit two  will be perfect  Neighbors were quiet and landscaping beautiful  The surrounding area was a little questionable but the homes location was ideal for crown center so we chose this home  Plenty of bed linens and pillows to go around  Smaller winding stairs made it a challenge to get suitcase upstairs  Lots of plug ins beside beds for phones and such  Lovely home but   Would have like to have seen the front door window frosted   a little too easy for anyone to look right in  Also  food items should not be left open  sugar   Items so high up we couldnt reach  The fridge wasnt clean but that wasnt the worst part  These was used food items from perhaps the guests before us  The fridge did have items we could use but open containers of cream cheese open milk containers and sauce packets from past guests delivery were a turn off  If you keep fridge stocked with bottle water and a fresh chilled fruit tray that would have been perfect  Used items just say  we didnt clean the fridge and here you can have someones left overs   If you want to keep bagels and cream cheese in fridge   have individual packets of cream cheese  The Host unexpectedly came over and delivered TP and bananas without ever communicating with us  He came in and wanted to put the items where they should have been delivered before our check in  Two of our group where at there and felt very uncomfortable  Update the front bedroom mattress soon 
632040839,Do not expect a quick response if anything is broken  Unfortunately the place is great but if something doesnt work  be prepared to have it stay like that until the day you leave  I stayed for a week with no electricity in the main bathroom and although I sent numerous emails about it nothing was done until the morning I was leaving  The light fixture and breakers had to be replaced for both the bathroom and kitchen area  Even after I complained the day I left  I got no response  Note to self on my next trip to St Louis I will definitely stat in the air bnb I rented before thia one     It speaks volumes that I reached out to you more than once the week that I stayed there and nothing was done until the day I was leaving  How did you possibly find it acceptable to charge someone for   bathrooms when only one was fully functional  And for me to write and send a note the day I left with no response  not even an apology was the icing on the cake  Thank you for the great St Louis hospitality Main bathroom lights didnt work and although I reached out to the hosts SEVERAL times during my week long stay  it wasnt fixed until the morning I was leaving If I was able to use the main bathroom then I wouldve been happy
637485809,Place was not clean it all floor very sticky had ants all over and to top it off it was hot as hell with the weather being in the   s my whole stay the air was only set to go to    which was not sufficient enough it was hot there were no brooms or mop in sight have to buy one and also have to purchase a fan
630425922,Do NOT pick this co  to host your stay  We will never stay here with this Company ever again  Even though the housing was well kept  the look of this place was tarnished due to the lack of knowledge of the property and the INSANE hidden fees  The cleaning fee was waaaaay higher than the room cost  Which literally doubled our payment per night  On top of this the instructions were so inaccurate it took us    min just to be able to enter the apartment  On top of this the parking they suggested was costly as well  which is common with  downtown  locations  but there were ZERO less convenient though less expensive alternatives suggested by the host to aid with options  This was not worth our time or our money  By far our worst experience with Air BnB  Knowledge on the property was severely lacking which made for a nightmare of a time trying to even access the apartment  The directions were not very accurate  The keys werent labeled like you said  it was PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the keys in the room after check out  and the parking situation should have been extremely clear and more knowledgeable on the situation  This was unlike any Ari BnB we have ever stayed in  The place did not make up for the lack of customer service or description of how to get into the apartment  Would send almost automated responses that didnt answer my question till after the auto responses went out
630380396,Great location  Loved the balcony  The parking space was impossible to get into  but another review  that I didnt read in time  suggested that if you let them know  they will be able to find another space for you  The designated one is tiny  between a pole and a large car  and on a curve  so theres another pole where you would need to be to even try to get it   There was also a very strong smell that was unpleasant but that I believe was a kind of air freshener  Sleeping with the window open helped  and I imagine they will simply use less air freshener in the future  Great location  easy check in  etc  There was a strong smell  which I think was an air freshener  but it gave me a headache  The parking space was impossible to get into  Was lucky to find street parking but would have preferred being able to park in the designated space  part of why I chose this listing  
629928102,Overall this place is fairly nice  with a few big drawbacks  Be very aware of the parking situation here  there is almost none and it is time limited  If you are travelling with any luggage or equipment  loading and unloading at this building can be very difficult or even impossible  The room has a very large amount of furnishings and gadgets  and a massive number of kitchen items  Some of these gadgets are a nuisance  like the keypad for the door  It has a    digit code that you will not be able to memorize  Not being able to memorize the door code makes it easy to lock yourself out of the room  and zencity cant be contacted through the callbox at the building  Also the smooth glass touchscreen where you enter the code is EXTREMELY sensitive to any part of your hand getting close to it  at which point you need to re enter the entire code from the beginning  And lastly  with all of the other furnishings and details  they have not yet purchased dark curtains that completely cover the windows  Dont expect to sleep past      or   in the morning  when light starts flooding in  Nice bed and fast wifi  Overly complicated check in process
640183148,Nice place
640088156,Place was clean and nice  It definitely needs darker curtains  the sun blazed in there around     am every morning  The thermostat read    the whole stay but it felt more like     I would suggest a fan in there  Location is perfect    blocks from Diversey CTA stop  Lots of food options 
669680330,Its a nice apartment with a gorgeous view of Hyde Park and the lake  I had trouble with the wifi and so also the tv  and that was pretty frustrating I had to use my phone as a hotspot for a number of work Zooms  Otherwise  it was nice enough 
652368499,the place was OK looked as pictured   my biggest issue was the plumbing   the drain in the shower was slow so when showering we literally had to wait   hours until the water drained for my boyfriend to shower   he fixed it the next day but it was a big inconvenience  another minor issue was that the wifi l tv didnt work at all  i wasnt there to watch tv but still would have liked the option   overall it was an ok place i think for the amount i was expecting a little more   the best part of the apartment is the view  
703808404,Amazing clean space  Thank you
639085052,Great location with everything within walking distance  Would help if the owners communication was a bit better  When moving the TV to check audio issues on the TV found a huge buildup of dust bunnies  Aside from the that the place was pretty clean   Could seriously work a bit more on the communication   Didnt get a response on our last day there 
703786545,To the point goodness 
719468559,Great view  The view is amazing from this unit  towels may be a little dingy  the neighbors next door are rude and wants you quiet before the allotted quiet time that starts at   pm  Did you try using bleach on these towels   We washed the towels when we first arrived because they were dingy 
637357103,Really nice super cozy   it looks just like the pictures   Beautiful view  There was a mop that smelled like mildewing since it was such a tiny space the smell was very strong  
700026060,Overall great location to a stylish place for a stay in the city for a holiday weekend getaway  It was a bummer that the dishwasher wasnt working or else I could have taken care of my dishes and the previous tenants dishes as well  The temp  Of the shower varies everyday but it was still workable 
719189292,its a nice place to spend your weekend  close of a lot of places around 
633376913,Spent a couple nights here for an impromptu getaway  The place is clean with a minimalist feel  Quiet place to sleep  Kitchen is well appointed for a basic meal  The apartment is in need of a handful of maintenance items for example not all the outlets work in the kitchen  The apartment is old and in need of updates  Decent view of the lake  Comfortable bed  Scored free street parking which was a nice bonus  This apartment could easily be   stars with a fresh coat of paint and some minor updates  There were small ants on the counter tops in the kitchen  at least two of the outlets in the kitchen are not working either  There are moisture stains on the ceiling of the bathroom  Black stained grout on more than one area in the shower 
660648965,Great view  lovely neighborhood  Will definitely be returning  Thank you you letting us stay at your place 
719132533,Good stay   Nice view with good service in the lobby 
660311616,Great location  value  and host  It was hard to use the elevator but overall great stay  Thanks for being a great host  Hard to use elevator and no key fob
640210800,Great location   As seen in the pictures  Thank you Zencity  for allowing me stay at your place 
640172989,Convenient location  Reasonable rate  Bathroom very small  Could use a little TLC thruout studio  Outlet cover by bed was broken  Exposed electrical   Bathtub could use new grout  missing in several areas  My husband found a ball of hair on windowsill of bathroom  right after we arrived  This made us question how thoroughly the studio was cleaned    Baseboards throughout not cleaned   Looked as if only center of room cleaned   Under the bed and under desk still dirty  Windowsills dusty  Quarter size splatters on floor around stove  Flimsy plastic toilet seat had loose screws   Kitchen trashcan lid broken  white tape to hold lid to hinge did nothing 
719489522,Nice location  great for   to   nights  I drunk a cup of coffee on a cup that has red lipstick on it  and I thought there was Netflix on the unit  but there wasnt  When I arrived I couldnt find a fob or kay in the unit  so I got one from the front disk 
671114187,This rental has a GREAT location   walk to restaurants  liquor store  shops  Starbucks  and the train   Check in was very easy and convenient  Bedding was nice and the place is stylish with the essentials included  We found that cleanliness could be stepped up a notch  We were also disappointed after calling Zencity to report that the electronic deadbolt on the front door wasnt working and they said they would work on sending someone out and then update me   well  the door did not get fixed  so our belongings sat unlocked in the space  and we were not updated  We greatly enjoyed the location and ease of using the rental  Suggest a more thorough cleaning and improvements to the entry door It seems the vacuum used isnt working well   there was hair and dirt  lint clumps on the rug in the living room  There was also a ball of hair in the corner of the bathroom  white soap gunk on the hanging rack in the shower  and food crusties in the fridge  The tub drain for the shower wasnt draining well so when I checked it  the entire drain pulled out and I found a huge hair ball all matted inside the drain stop  Cleanliness and security  The door to the rental is not very secure   damage to the frame and automatic lock with deadbolt didnt work 
639146393,Amazing location  Could be a bit cleaner
718365141,Loved the place  Very clean and tidy and in good shape  The electronic door entry was handy once we figured it out  The place could use a couple of things to make it great  namely a coffee pot and a couple of chairs in the living room  The lone couch is just not enough space  All in all  we had a nice stay  Not much retail available near the location
711477951,The room was nice  Great view  Looks exactly like the pictures  Couldve been a little cleaner  There was hair on the bathroom floor and one of the towels  The room was nice  Couldve been a little cleaner  The bathroom towel hanging on the rack for show was dirty
633852201,This place is centrally located in downtown St  Louis  although it is a few blocks from the more bustling areas of downtown  Still  for the price  it was worth it to be a few blocks from a ton of restaurants and amenities  The pictures are accurate  and its apparent that the furnishings are somewhat new and the place is well appointed  The building can get a bit noisy in the evenings  which I didnt mind  but if you need complete quiet this might not be for you  There is a convenient electronic door locking system  which was nice  Wifi was strong  AC worked really well and kept the place cool during a very hot few days  My biggest complaint was that the floors were extremely dirty  as if they had never been swept or mopped  and a few small repairs  window blinds  chipping on bedroom wall  were needed  The cleanliness was especially concerning given it was during COVID    and I was charged an extra cleaning fee  which I happily paid    I hope the host fixes these issues because the place is a great value otherwise  Hi  I was very disappointed in the cleanliness of the unit   I was charged a very substantial COVID    cleaning fee  which I totally support in theory and was happy to pay  but the place with really dirty  My feet or socks were blackened by dirt as I walked around  Surfaces were visibly dirty  and there was chipping and apparent water damage in the bedroom  This place had a very low base price  so I wasnt expecting to be in the lap of luxury  but the cleanliness was perhaps the worst Ive ever experienced in dozens of airbnb stays  The floors were extremely dirty throughout the apartment  There were broken window blinds  water damage and peeling drywall in the bedroom  and hair dirt on baseboards and in corners  The kitchen appeared to be well cleaned  though  I had an issue locking the door and I sent several messages to the host in the app that were not replied to  I ended up calling their hotline several times and eventually reaching an operator wh helped me  A cleaner apartment would have provided more value   especially since there was a huge cleaning fee added for COVID     The base price was very low  but with fees and the added expenses for cleaning  which had apparently not really been done  the total cost was more substantial 
634325531,I would not stay here again  When I entered the apartment  it was apparent that the management of the property does not align with the curated finishes and furnishings of the space  There was long black hair laying on the kitchen counter  When I took a shower the bath towels and wash clothes were covered in pubes  The unit is undoubtedly trendy but was not clean  One roll of toilet paper was left for a week long stay  After reaching out  it took two days before I received a response and have more dropped off  I had to go out and buy toilet paper which was not ideal as this was meant to be a safe retreat during covid while visiting a family member reviewing chemo treatment nearby  After a few nights of my stay  I asked to receive a partial refund so that I could check into a hotel  Various members of property management will respond to you  sometimes the next day and sometimes several days later  While waiting on a response  my week stay ended and I was informed I was no longer eligible for a refund  Other things I wouldnt mention if the rest of the experience had been better   the key fob to the entrance is broken and there is no way to get ahold of management in a timely manner so you have to wait for someone to exit and let you in  the unit is in the basement and the only windows are part of the property dog park  the entire basement unit smelled of musty mold  the elevator was very sticky  the outdoor rooftop was not open  the hand soap is watered down  and when it was raining the living room started flooding 
717691335,A nice  spacious place to stay for a couple nights 
661288432,This a great place in a great location  I would definitely recommend to others 
661276924,Hello  I had difficulty with checkin  messaging with host  unclear or wrong instructions to get house keys   also the photos look a lot better than it is in person  There is little to no light in here and wasnt great for me  From what I saw it seemed like there was a lot of bright lighting but I think the photos were edited  I wasnt able to find an elevator  The blinds were broken and the windows were very dirty 
661203807,The area was nice and quiet  the bathrooms wasnt cleaned completely it was hair all around the showers  The tv didnt work all my friends tried to turn it on even asked the host they said it was on the home screen we did that still nothing  Everything else besides the tv and bathroom  was nice  the Airbnb is a great location to go enjoy yourself not a far distance  I recommend thanks Zencity 
640239912,Great Location  Parking is limited due to construction but we found places  Thanks for letting us stay  The tub and floor had hair all over  It took me calling to get any help  I tried to message but no one would answer  I asked for info on local eating places and never got an answer on that either  Lots of construction so parking was tough  But other than that it was a great value 
656704802,The place needs maintenance  broken bathroom door and hand towel rod   Just a heads up  the shower head was low  my boyfriend being  ft had a hard time washing his hair  The A C in the living room struggled to cool the area but thankfully there was an additional fan that we used  There were stains on the extra comforter  Parking is rough in the evening and early morning hours  Otherwise a decent place  Reserved parking spot  Comfortable couch  Fixed bathroom fixtures  towel racks  shower head  etc    More efficient AC in living room
639498846,Nice place to stay  Close to downtown  Great amenities  Overall very good stay  Only issue was pictures were different than actual room but still very comfortable  Fun place to stay  Close to downtown  Clean and well organized  Didnt have a key FOB at the beginning to get in but the staff were able to bring a new one quickly  Overall good experience 
704267874,Small but a good place nice stay and nice amenities
717174051,Awesome communication  Thanks for answering me in time so that I can get the backup key to enter the house and catch up my plane at the end  Will recommend this place 
660669920,The place was received as advertised  Clean  fantastic location  Overall a fantastic stay  Host was immediate in responding  Accommodated me in a second set of keys I needed  Adjusted my stay a couple times as my work schedule changed  I would stay with Zencity again without a second thought  Im am already booked   
478166320,The  location is excellent  The host quickly responded to all my needs  Would definitely stay there again 
650181735,I do not recommend this place  It is completely over priced  The pictures are very misleading  The structure of the place is nice and it does have a lot of space and a nice balcony  The place was disgusting tho  I saw a bug  the couch was so nasty and badly stained that I had to put a covering over it just to feel comfortable sitting on it   The toilet seats were so badly stained  completely unacceptable  I was there for business  couldnt find the iron   messages the host multiple times about it   very slow responses and no attempt to fix the issue  I couldnt even control the air system on my own and once again  very slow or no response from the host  Multiple things were broken  it was just an overall disgusting experience and if youre looking for a nice place to stay  This isnt it  This place was just genuinely not what I expected  The pictures were absolutely misleading   the place was disgusting  The couch was so dirty and stained that I refused to sit on it without something covering it  There was bugs  the stove was disgusting  the refrigerator was disgusting  Needs new appliances if youre going to charge this much for it  Maybe I just like luxury and for the price I paid  This just wasnt it  By far my worst AirBnB experience ever  Even with communication  terrible Overall 
704204006,Solid place to stay  Centrally locates  Clean and easy to walk to river market or power and light  Walls are a bit thin  so you tend to hear your neighbors quite a bit  Very thin walls  Neighbors were fairly loud  smell of weed in hallwalls
639126368,I was excited to stay in to this beautiful room until I went to the room and saw someones things in my room  When I contacted them to inform them of the error they switched me into a different room nothing like what I booked  I had to sleep on the couch which wasnta pull out so my stay was a bit uncomfortable  In the morning I asked for towels and were never got them so Ima little displeased with my stay 
638780537,Room was good for price only bad thing was parking it was almost impossible to find parking 
638500552,The place is nice and clean  everything you could want is walking distance since its on the plaza  Would definitely book again  Thanks for being a great host would definitely book again 
638732589,Excellent location  very clean  Bed was sooooo comfortable  I will stay here next time Im in KC   Thank you  We had a great stay  The one thing I would change is the instructions for check in do not state you only have   minute to access the elevator  That was super confusing 
631475383,The place is super stylish  I really enjoyed staying here  I would just wish for a more thorough cleaning and more sanitary policies in place  I would stay here again post pandemic  but would not stay here again during the pandemic  It was in a great location however and overall it was a good stay  Things were not super restocked  no paper towels  not a lot of TP  And it seemed like they dont replace the little hotel sized shampoo soap bottles  There was one that had the shampoo seeping out and crusted on the outside and one that had a tiny hair in it  Which during COVID  wasnt super comforting  Just made me question how thorough they were in the rest of the cleaning  Everything was put together nicely though  I had an issue where I could not get in at first  I figured out I was just doing the wrong thing  but the host did not respond to me asking for help during that time 
639114203,Be sure to check for damages and report them  If not  they will try and charge you for the previous damages Thank you for allowing us to stay in your air bnb  But there was previous damages
273587916,Overall very good experience  the apartment was nice and clean  the sole point to check is the building door  had trouble unlocking every time around   Hi Chris  Stay went smoothly and the place was nice  my tip to you is to have the building door checked   I had trouble to unlock every time  and a couple of times I found it unlocked  I never saw anybody entering or leaving the building  Instructions to locate the apt key to enter the building were clear however a number was missing which forced me to do trial and error until I found the correct locker box
636913071,Checked in on July   and walked into an awesome view of all the fireworks in the surrounding neighborhoods  But things went downhill from there   The AC in the bedroom was out before I got there  Instead of informing me about the situation beforehand they allowed me to have one of my worst experiences ever in an Airbnb  Bc the The broken AC started to leak from the pipes underneath the floor  Zencity did try to get the situation fix but the repairs were too major so I checked out early  Im not a complainer but I was a bit confused on why the only supplied only   towels and   washcloth for my   week stay   I did get more after requesting   The kitchen was well prepped with silverware  pots and pans  and a few spices  Parking isnt too bad  You can usually find parking relatively close  This place does have potential to be really good once the repairs are made  It was bad luck for me 
636869872,Very clean  Only complaint was the ac was only in the living room so the bedroom was hot so I slept in the living room one night 
637445789,Great air bnb at an ideal location  The hosts are responsive and their parking suggestions helped out tremendously  The only downside is that this place is a little pricey considering the huge inconvenience the stairs are  Other than that  very stylish air bnb  Price should be cheaper  considering the huge inconvenience the stakes are
636533261,Clean and convenient  Great area  Id stay again  Clean the ceiling in the bedroom  Last thing a visitor wants to see is red splatter on the ceiling right before bed 
706418282,The skyline is beautiful and the space is very homey very quiet and safe   and the colorful light in the bathroom added an extra charm Although they were minor issues Id still like the place Im sure things will be better knowing that you had new people and I understand hopefully I will be able to book this place again in December The two companies need to discuss time for check in online The sheets were dirty with hair
719488823,It was fine for our two night stay and it was so close to everything downtown that we wanted to do 
640623663,Place was nice  The building was beautiful and the amenities were great  I would stay again  The blowdryer didnt work  When truing to get into building code didnt work 
633833615,At first site coming off the elevator the hallway seems dark  but open up the door to your two bedroom home with a view that is worth the money itself  The bathroom is a bit tight but does the job and Zencity has put together yet another spectacular home for us to stay in for next to nothing of a cost  Once again another space that you cant help but love  It was open and the building was inviting  That view was amazing and as a company Zencity has been great  We just seem to clash with one manager  Overall great stay  Thank you 
640617683,The place was nice  The neighbors were arguing one night we were there  Space was conveniently located  However it is very small  There was a dirty wash cloth left on the top of the shower I would ask the owner questions about check out and it was never answered Neighbors were literally arguing and fighting at  am in the morning
640568057,Really nice place to stay  a downtown apartment all to yourself 
719435899,Couldnt have asked for a better location  and cute apartment as pictured   however definitely be aware that the bed is just inches from the ground  could definitely be an accessibility issue for some  and that the bathroom is definitely outdated  lacks a little in cleanliness than the rest of the apartment  In summery  good value and location  dont expect luxurious bathroom  There should be a warning that the bed is essentially on the floor and the bathroom REALLY needs a deep cleaning and fixing up Mold in bathroom  plus smelled like smoke   tub didnt drain while showering     overall really unpleasant bathroom experience
701711254,Great looking place  cleanliness was a little underwhelming in bedrooms  Door code didnt work at arrival Comforter in bedroom had brown stains
718892456,Great location and easy stay  pictures make it look nicer than it is
633360426,Overall  the stay is OK  It is in a great location in the city  No issues checking in or coming as far going as we pleased  HOWEVER  the listing is extremely deceiving  The images shown are not at all accurate to the unit we stayed in  The place gave of more of a  hotel room  vibe than it did an apartment  If what was booked matched what was received  the experience would have been better  The picture in the listing were NOT at all accurate  The unit re stayed in was not the one we thought we booked  The bedroom was also lacking in cleanliness  At one point we got down to pick up something that rolled under the bed and there were visible staining on the carpet from what looked like a pet  The  view of the city  was not much of a view  Overall our stay was fine  the place was suitable for our weekend  However it was EXTREMELY disappointing to stay somewhere completely different than what we were expecting  The place overall was not horrible  however the posting was deceiving  The pictures show on the listing were not at all accurate  Im not even sure the unit we got is the same one we booked 
619158771,Very clean space  Check in and check out are very simple  Communication was very easy and quick  Great stay 
656056790,Cant beat the neighborhood or proximity to the lakefront  the apartment itself is a bit long in the tooth and showing its age  The air handler was running the entire stay   sounded like a     in the closet   but  cool air was not emanating from the registers  The Thermostat was calling for    degrees and thought the apartment was at     The apartment was about    most the day  We opened windows at night to cool it down and kept the drapes shut all day to avoid solar gain   the A C is broken  Also  one of the living room fans is stuck  both of the fans have lights that continue to flicker after they have been turned off and the fan in the  study  has a chain for the light that is wrapped around the lights and cant be pulled  While the maintenance man is fixing all that  he also might want to glue down the wood popping up from the floor in places and the tile in the hall bath  Prior to check in   no problems  After check in  sent a note about the A C   no response Air Conditioning that worked
718845161,Great plave to say right by Whole Foods 
634262585,VERY convenient and beautiful location  the place didnt seem that clean tho  there was a weird odor and it made me want to clean the entire place myself  so i did lol  also had a leaking sinking in bathroom which would cause water to cover a larger majority of the floor and  i notified them about it but they ignored me  other than that it it was ok kept finding multiple hairs almost as is they didnt change comforter or something  the place also had an unpleasant smell  i told them there was something wrong with the sink and that we didnt have a fob and they only responded to portion of the message that mentioned the fob and disregarded my complaints about the sink leaking and also being clogged
641116912,Furniture nearly broken  flimsy  No reply from host when contacted  Pest control came and sprayed for roaches while I was there  Noisy neighbors 
717656930,This was a large loft with some pretty cool views  Definitely was a unique stay  The cleaning was not up to par for us  but the communication and details of checkin and checkout were very useful  The only truly frustrating thing was the parking  All parking was about a block or so away  Zencity did provide us with great advise about how where to park around the building though  Thank you for a wonderful stay  I thought your detailed check in was very useful  the rugs seemed to not have been vacuumed  the bathroom toilets and showers were not as clean as I would have thought  the fridge was also pretty dirty  all of the glass windows were dirty as well 
661288418,Great rooms with a decent price  Would definitely recommend  Overall a great stay  loved the room other than the minor wall ceiling damage  Also just from someone thats worked hotel maintenance  someones going to steal that router that sits next to the bed sooner or later  Id mount that on the wall somewhere  There was a dirty mug left in the sink but other than that it was clean  There are cracks chips in the ceiling outside bathroom and a giant dent in the bathroom wall from the door  A damaged room should cost less than the others 
640248782,This was not what I expected in a bad way   Pros  The rate was cheap  The area was very pretty  There is parking in a gated parking lot   Cons    MICE   I should have been suspicious seeing the   mousetraps by the washer dryer  but I thought it was more precautionary  However at night I heard clear sounds around the apartment  Then one night around   pm I saw   mice running around the kitchen and livingroom  I tried to get a hold of the host to find a immediate solution or accommodation but they never got back to me   Not Clean  Although the listing says that they do enhanced cleaning measures to help combat COVID  I dont believe it  The walls are painted with a chalkboard like paint that shows every scratch and scuff mark  When I walked in there were clearly visible liquid splash marks on the wall  The handles of the refrigerator were very sticky for some reason  The remote had ketchup on the side from the last guest  I dropped my phone in the seat cushions and when I lifted the cushion I saw so much crumbs and dirt and even a dirty earbud   Fixtures  The restroom sink faucet is placed so incorrectly that when you go to wash your hands you end up splashing the entire counter  The air conditioner is preset with a schedule that only the host has control of  The lowest it can go is     If you set it to a certain temp at night  youll wake up to it at about     which is the locked setting   Overall  I could have put up with everything else if it werent for the fact that this place had a clear mouse problem and didnt inform me before hand  The directions to the apartment door should include that you enter the door at the end of the first hall  The door looks like you need a fob to enter it and it took me a while to figure out how to get to the apartment Under the living room couch cushions was very gross  There were liquid splash marks on the walls Host was difficult to get a hold of for urgent situations  Higher cleaning standards and being transparent about a clear mouse problem 
717635805,Thank you More kitchenware  Like spatula   a whisk  Close to the city
652913746,The apartment location was great  Parking on a private lot  Great access to downtown  and close to the highway  The building was quiet and the neighborhood welcoming  Walking distance to the nearby park  The apartment has all the amenities you would need to enjoy your stay  The couch shouldve been a sofa sleeper  Its not comfortable to sit on for long period  If you want to enjoy a television show longer than   hours  Check in was easy and Zencity were accommodating to my early check in request  I would stay again  just not on the ground floor  The apartment needs to be cleaned better  Theres a   inch space at the door  which needs a door spacer a th the bottom to prevent rodents from running into the apartment  When it rains there are leaks under the floor board in the bedroom and living room   Make sure theres enough bedding  towels in the apartment  Also laundry detergent  trash bags  paper towels and toilet paper  According to the occupants stay  The floors needed to be swept  The rug and carpet needed to be vacuuming  Had to clean spider webs out of the windows  Some issues that needed to be addressed immediately  it took over    to    hours to get a response
656397328,The check in process was extremely easy and it was great  We had a blast taking the Lime scooters from the apartment to our parking spot down the road  Once we got the key and went into the apartment I was a little disappointed though   When we first walked in  I used the bathroom  There was a ponytail with hair wrapped around it on the floor  The trashcan in the bathroom was full of qtips and a feminine product  Later on in the evening  we discovered the the kitchen trash had not been taken out either and was half full  During COVID     I did not expect to pick up and have to clean the place before feeling comfortable enough to stay there    Just makes me wonder what the cleaning fee is going towards  When we first arrived and I used the bathroom  there was a ponytail with hair wrapped around it on the floor  The trashcan in the bathroom was full of qtips and a feminine product  Later on in the evening  we discovered the the kitchen trash had not been taken out either and was half full  During COVID     I did not expect to pick up and have to clean the place before feeling comfortable enough to stay there    Just makes me wonder what the cleaning fee is going towards 
700455037,The overall apartment is very nice   Beds were comfortable   mostly clean  There was some blood stains and what looked like dried snot on the comforter in the main room   There was an extra blanket to use   But that did gross me out and I find things like that unacceptable  I sent pics to the host and did not receive a response for over    hours   And it was   I hope you found the extra blankets   Sorry that you had an issue with the bedding     I would post pics to here if it will allow    Checking in was easy enough   We were given step by step instructions     Now to my complaint   When we first made it to the room it was so hot in there   Ok no biggie just need to turn air on     wrong   There was an issue with the ac   Snapped a photo of the thermostat and the temperature to see if maybe we were doing something wrong   Over an hour later after a  nd message I finally got a response    Oh thats unfortunate sorry its hot  Maybe set the temperature see if that helps   Its after   on Sunday and maintenance wont be in til tomorrow   Sent another message   No response   Sent another photo at bed showing the temp the same and what the thermostat was set on   Also sent pictures of the blood stained blankets and dried snot    was not like it was all over but enough I wasnt sleeping with it    No response til well over    hours later stating hope the ac issue is fixed   it was my boyfriend finally fixed the issue with the ac  and sorry the bedding was dirty   Hope you found the extras    I did but not the point   maintenance finally knocked on the door Tuesday morning   The ac issue was Sunday at        This is a part of down town so if you dont like noise    sirens  horns  cars people etc  you may not like it here  We are from a small country town and that did not bother us  Also there are some stragglers that roam the sidewalks   And some who will approach for money   just tell them youre good and move along   I never felt unsafe even being out on the street after dark  Thanks for the stay   The apartment overall was nice   The communication from the host was more than lacking   My boyfriend had to fix the ac then I had to wash blankets   Messages were not responded to for over    hours   In my opinion thats unacceptable The Main bedroom had what looked like dried bloody snot on the comforter and blood stains   There was an extra comforter to use   but to say I was a little grossed out when I went to go to bed is an understatement When we first opened the door we were hit with about    degree heat in the apartment   Shut all the blinds and turned off all the lights and turned the thermostat down   Only to realize the ac was not working and would not cool the apartment   Sent pictures and messages of the issue and one message was responded to over and hour and then the next message about the blankets and the ac still not working took over    hours to respond   Only to say oh sorry   Hope you fixed the problem or found the extra blanket   Maintenance knocked on the door Tuesday morning   we arrived Sunday and reported the ac issue    Keep in mind this is down town  There are some stragglers but I never once felt unsafe  If the communication and concern would have been better 
715923115,The stay was enjoyable
614561414,Very stylish  very comfortable 
649553379,A few hours after check out  I had realized I lost my ID  It took an hour long phone call on hold with no answer    messages on the AirBnB app  an email  and messages on Facebook to finally get an answer back from this company who rents out the property  I ended up having to order a new ID since they could not find it  and still havent heard anything back in regard to it  Basically  if you dont need to get in contact with ZenCity and your stay will be fine  A few hours after check out  I had realized I lost my ID  It took an hour long phone call on hold with no answer    messages on the AirBnB app  an email  and messages on Facebook to finally get an answer back from this company who rents out the property  I ended up having to order a new ID since they could not find it  and still havent heard anything back in regard to it  Basically  if you dont need to get in contact with ZenCity and your stay will be fine 
700691771,Clean  nice space  Didnt provide information to check in until I reached out
713002636,The apartment was okay and had all the basic equipment for the kitchen  Bedrooms and bathrooms were comfortable and of a nice size   The only issue I had was that for both nights there was a man speaking really loud at the street making it hard for sleeping  Hi  I like the unit although it would be nice to have some personal touches to the decorations  Also some plugs werent working   Thanks for everything
638737541,Great stay if youre just looking for something quick and easy  Doesnt offer much but is very easy  and host are great communicators  Quiet building area  with easy access to touristy spots  Thanks for being an easy stay  Consider enlisting new cleaning services  Bedding didnt appear fresh  bathroom space was also seemed to be a bit rushed  Over all nice space  thank you for having us 
636502895,I had a great time at Zencity  The surrounding area was very nice and peaceful  There was a beautiful lake beach area about five minutes walk away  There is a bus train about       minutes away that can take you to downtown Chicago  If everything you plan to do is in downtown Chicago  this might not be the ideal location  The gym  elevators and game rooms were all wonderful amenities  Found different types of hairs in the bathroom tub  Couch had unidentified stains 
635468570,Nice and sweet place     Check in was easy and smooth    My room was right near the elevator which is amazing     Nice kitchen and living room set up  simple but nice   Bedroom  bed is slanted  be mindful of hitting your toes here and there   But the bedroom was nice and has a nice spacious closet  Bathroom was okay    There is a target  Whole Foods  Marshalls maybe     minutes away which is great  A park across the street  A museum of science nearby but is closed     This was an amazing stay overall   Thank you Zencity for hosting me  Overall I loved the place  the location   especially since this was my first time visiting Chicago  It was great and special   Thank you for your assistance and space     When I first arrived  the house smelt really bad like a dead mouse in the walls  I did message the company and they responded fast which Was great but issue was not fixed  I had to get air freshener during my stay   Communication was okay with host   Some took time and some were quick  My issue is with actually getting the issue I had solved   The bed one side was low due to One or two of the slacks missing so that was uncomfortable  The sheets and towels were not that clean and they had stains   I knew this before by the reviews but the room was really hot and ac only in the living room  Just felt like it couldve been maybe something more
416449059,Great location  Very spacious place  Hey Brian   I appreciate your communication with me throughout the whole booking  I know you had a rough visit before us and I hope you got my note about the bed issue in the one bedroom  I just wanted to let you know we had a great time  You have a beautiful place however the cleanliness was very poor for our stay  We ended up having to wash towels and linen bedding because there was lots of glitter and weird substances and the surfaces of tables and counters were really sticky  The towels were left in the bathrooms damp too  Based on your rating I can tell this isnt your standard either so I just wanted to share with you  Thanks again for the stay  You have the perfect location for your place  Cleanliness was a really big issue for us  The home is listed with   bedrooms       guests   there was space for everyone but cleanliness of the entire unit was terrible  Towels and linens was an issue and we had to track down coffee cups etc  There was a overly used sponge and dish soap for cleaning supplies  For the price and description I assumed the place would be a bit more put together and accommodating  The host let us know that the visitors before us kind of trashed the place   we understand things happen but one of the beds was also completely broken  We had a super great time but we also had to wash the bedding and linens as there was many different substances on them  It didnt appear that the towels or any bedding had been washed  Bedding was really dirty and the towels were hanging on the shower racks damp  Overall handles on fridge light switches and doors were sticky and gross  The toilets and showers hadnt been cleaned either 
662400935,The host was good at relocating us due to a double booking  While the host did relocate us it took then an hour to do so  Very unhappy with the relocation   unexpected change in plans  Someone was staying in the original Airbnb that was booked  The host relocated us but the  nd place was a downgrade from the original booking  Very busy street
661822374,The place was tidy and perfect for what I needed   Street parking can be a bit of a hassle  if you arent used to it   The location is convenient  I was not able to get the key fob to work  but did appreciate the keyless entry   Thank you for quick responses and a clean apartment to stay in 
704278898,Ive previously stayed with Zencity through Airbnb   had such a positive   accommodating experience that I had high expectations for this stay with them as well  Check in was very easy   the location is great  Unfortunately  that was the best part of this eleven day stay  The apartment itself has so much potential that it could be a fantastic stay but the cleanliness of the place was terrible especially during a pandemic  when the cleaning should be very thorough between guests  The smell of the building  apartment was terrible so much so that I had to buy several wall plug ins as well as candles  The washer wreaked of mildew and the dryer makes the most obnoxious sound when its on  I reached out to Zencity about maintenance and was told they would let maintenance know and hopefully the issue would be resolved soon   and then nothing came of it  There were pubic hairs from previous stays in the shower and the tub doesnt drain so when youre showering the water is around your ankles  Hair that was not mine was found on the bedding  in the refrigerator and an entire clump of hair was sitting on a shelf   All of the silverware was dirty  There was a pile of dirt that had been swept up and just left on the floor  from the cleaner Im assuming    There was already trash in the trashcan upon my arrival  These things truly made my stay terrible  Again  not bashing Zencity as a whole because I have stayed with them before and had a great experience but this place in particular needs WORK 
658519746,This is a convenient location in Hyde Park  close to Promontory Point  the   rd St  corridor where most restaurants are  a grocery store  and a neighborhood bar   At least  close in summer when a       min walk is nice  not sure about winter   The apartment is spacious  has a good view  and gets lots of light  I found the counter   adjustable stool setup to be a comfortable work space for a week  There is a      attendant at the front desk  I had a great stay overall   One of the elevators did get stuck on me twice for     seconds  it stopped on the  th floor and then partially opened and stopped  the first time was scary and then the second time I knew it would likely open eventually  But probably something for the building to look at   It would also be a nice convenient if laundry detergent were left in the closet I bought some and left it behind  I arrived      hours after check in time but they still werent quite ready for me The bathroom lacks ventilation and had a bit of a musty smell  They were also on a tight schedule and still cleaning the apartment when I attempted to check in       hours after check in time  It also would be awesome if they stocked detergent for the in unit laundry machine  I did buy some and leave it behind for others  
641832106,Great place    Thanks
638503587,The place has nice view  Park and lake is nearby  Restaurants are nearby   Its generally nice  But sofa was a little dusty  I wondered if its cleaned while ago  The soundproof was not good  I turned on TV  not loud  and somebody knocked on the wall  I heard coughing sound over the other wall   Overall  other than that everything was good 
662176264,Nice apartment right in midtown where we can get to places easy
641807422,Great place  Very clean and homey 
718658529,Booked then was sent check in information that didnt work   We could get into lobby but the code given to get key didnt work  Was supposed to check in  pm day before and never got in ended up sleeping in our car while trying to find another Airbnb for the next day   Worst experience ever from my home town  
642933194,Good location in Lincoln Park Thanks for being a great host 
639135171,The space was in a great location  as well as easy check in  The only real concerns were about the cleanliness  A lamp by the dining area was falling off a wall  there was a weird stain on the carpet  and two cups of liquid hidden in the cabinet  Overall it was a great place  just wish it was a little cleaner upon arrival  The space was lovely  and great check in  But there was some concerns about the previous cleaning before we entered the space  Broken lamp next to the dining area  as well as some type of liquid in cups in the pantry
637444962,Good location  cute balcony  kitchen has some pots pans and dishes   with a few items like salt  pepper  oil   Nice size bedrooms and comfy linens   Beware the low water pressure in bathroom Sorry I have to be negative on this stay  very disappointed  Ive used Airbnb over    times in last couple years and usually have had great experiences  The smell of smoke permeated our clothing  low water pressure in bathroom made for difficult use of sink  shower and toilet  Please  replace smoke detector batteries and coffee pot and hopefully you were able to get rid of smoke smell  pretty awful  Sorry this didnt work out  as a great location  but I would not return or recommend this particular stay unless issues fixed   I was disappointed that I was not contacted earlier   only got updates from cleaning person  and he said he had communicated this to you Due to previous guest leaving significant smoke and mess issues  we could not check in for    hrs past stated  p check in   Never got message about this  I found out as cleaning person in apt at check on time and he told me   Smoke detectors also chirping due to low batteries Intense smell of smoke aside  decent water pressure   working coffee French press  was cracked    Fortunately the bar downstairs closed at   p
637389772,Very clean  Nice quiet neighborhood   
643400603,Great location and secure building  Very pretty view   I always choose Zencity when booking an Airbnb because they seem to be consistently clean and easy to work with
643371956,Good location  Building and units are dated  Tiny bathrooms and toilet area  this place is so dated and shows  the pillows did not have protective covers on them and several were ripped  The iron had a black coating that could not be used on clothing bathroom mat did not seem clean I have stayed in this unit before
717892307,Nice lil place 
642977383,We have stayed in this unit a few times before  but this time wasnt as ideal  The unit smelled like smoke and when I brought this up to Zencity  the only resolution they had was for me to use air fresheners that they didnt have   The floors were also pretty dirty  especially the rug   The location and view from the unit was still fantastic  We have stayed in this unit a few times before  but this time wasnt as ideal  The place smelled like smoke and the floors were very dirty 
642858338,Great place but cleaning service needs to do a lot better I found a false nail in my sheets  the bedroom had not been vacuumed or sweeped  and the bathroom was unsweeped aswelll I found someone fake nail in my sheets  That is so unacceptable and dirty  The bathroom wasnt clean and the bed room wasnt vacuumed at all Its located right by the hospital so you hear sirens all day and night
642902692,loved our stay here 
636247287,The host ask that you park inside a gated parking lot where you need a key to gain access  My fianc  car was broken into inside this same parking lot  The gated parking lot has video footage in real time however the host  the property manager  nor air bnb helped us to resolve this issue  Our trip was ruined because our safety had been compromised  No one expects to go on a vacation and feel unsafe  I will not suggest anyone to stay at this air bnb if safety is your concern  My Fianc  car was broken into on the property that you all had us park in  This parking lot was suppose to be a gated parking lot where you need a key to access  When I called you all to report the issue the first thing you all said to me was  what do you want us to do   No one is being responsive to us to resolve this issue  You all have cameras through the building and our car was parked right by the camera but no one is looking into the video footage to resolve this  Customer service should be your top priority and to accommodate your guest  My safety was put at risk someone invaded my property  They stole my car keys and my house keys which means I dont have any other way to gain access to my vehicle or home  No one expects to go on a vacation where they are suppose to be safe and have their space invaded and while trip ruined because we literally spent the rest of our time worrying  The place was clean however under the bed there was trash  In the bathroom the towels had hair on them The host didnt communicate well in responding to me with an issue
659693640,Very nice place   It was quiet and relaxing  The beds and couch were comfortable   Kitchen was nice not very many pots and pans for cooking but there was a few 
653935151,We arrived to the space and it was not cleaned  It was very grouse and there was dust flying out of the vents  something ive never seen before  i had to chnage a filter that looked like it hasnt been changed in over a year  There was a   inch build up dust  hair and dirt on the old filter  Not only was it dirty but there was a bad stench of a Cat and kitten litter in one bedroom that made the whole house smell  When i messaged Zen city all they did was tell me this was not an issue and that they would only send over a cleaning lady after we cleaned twice  They told me that was my only option and basically oh well  After speaking with Airbnb  they understood and saw the grouse photos i posted and got me and my girlfriend out of there   Lastly the washer and dryer are all the way outside  down a creepy hallway  in the basement of building  Not in the building    Apartment is nice  in a great location  I just wished we didnt have this experience 
717663517,Place was great for a quick home office change of scenery 
642970923,It worked for the weekend but wasnt anything extra special or unique  Place was really clean and smelled good unlike the rest of the building  It was quiet and instructions to get into the room were long but easy to understand  I liked having a corner apartment  we got windows on   sides of place  Theres also construction going on right now in that area but wasnt bad  There is a cute coffee shop next door too  I got copy and paste generic responses  Street parking only and theres construction 
498995351,Great location to everything we wanted to do   Quiet street   It looks the same as in the photos and reviews were accurate  We met Slavik on arrival  very nice   House was as expected  would stay there again  We tried the purple peppers from his garden   Only drawback was the wifi went out 
637533662,Pictures were inaccurate  they must have multiple apartments here that they rent out  Communication was disappointing  Only two towels  one was a large bath towel  one was so small it couldnt wrap around me and Im     pounds  Overall  it was okay  Great location  underwhelming customer service  Its great that you guys have multiple properties in the same building  However  you should post accurate photos  Asked for check in info   hours before check in  was told I would get details  closer to my check in date  Responded immediately to my inquiry saying theyd get back to me  never heard back
641466292,Great location  I liked it and they have been very responsive  however  as they do not directly manage the property there was a bit of the miss communication but they did their best to handle it in the right way 
662414825,Nice location  great views out of the windows  specious rooms  everything you need for living  Noisy because of road nearby and emergency cars  Requires minor refurbishment  Especially for ceiling and bath 
633629018,The stay with Zencity was indeed professional and they were helpful  Finding parking was difficult  I tried very hard to follow the laws since Im not from here and ended up getting a parking ticket right in front of the building where there are no signs   Ticket for parking      inches away from the curb instead of    inches       Check in was a bit hassling  You cannot check in even   mins before  You have to be there at  pm or after which was not stated in the house rules  please correct me if I am wrong   I tried the code and was nearly locked out  My SO and I used the elevator multiple times and every time we pressed our floor number it went to a completely different floor   ex  pressed level    went to level   or just stayed on the lobby floor  It only seems to go to the correct floor when you scan the keyless key that they give you  which I didnt find out until today  The lobby was very beautiful and clean  Although  our room looked VERY clean when we got in  I decided to wipe down the counters and handles with disinfectant wipes so that I would not possibly contract Covid     The disinfectant wipes were dirty    which tells me these counters were not wiped off before hand  The bathroom floor seemed to have not been mopped  The bed was very clean and everything is functioning besides the thermostat  I am a hot sleeper  so my desired home temperature is set to     I had set the temperature in our room to    so that it would get cold in the room  Halfway through the night I was drenching sweat with no blanket on   I believe the thermostat AND the remote next to it to control the bedroom fan is broken  When I saw a c available for amenities  I expected to be able to turn it to my desired temperature  The bedroom fan works but only when the light is on  Although the stay was okay  it was a few things that bothered me personally  By all means  Zencity was very professional and communicated efficiently  The stay with Zencity was indeed professional and they were helpful  Finding parking was difficult  I tried very hard to follow the laws since Im not from here and ended up getting a parking ticket right in front of the building where there are no signs   Ticket for parking      inches away from the curb instead of    inches       Check in was a bit hassling  You cannot check in even   mins before  You have to be there at  pm or after which was not stated in the house rules  please correct me if I am wrong   I tried the code and was nearly locked out  My SO and I used the elevator multiple times and every time we pressed our floor number it went to a completely different floor   ex  pressed level    went to level   or just stayed on the lobby floor  It only seems to go to the correct floor when you scan the keyless key that they give you  which I didnt find out until today  The lobby was very beautiful and clean  Although  our room looked VERY clean when we got in  I decided to wipe down the counters and handles with disinfectant wipes so that I would not possibly contract Covid     The disinfectant wipes were dirty    which tells me these counters were not wiped off before hand  The bathroom floor seemed to have not been mopped  The bed was very clean and everything is functioning besides the thermostat  I am a hot sleeper  so my desired home temperature is set to     I had set the temperature in our room to    so that it would get cold in the room  Halfway through the night I was drenching sweat with no blanket on   I believe the thermostat AND the remote next to it to control the bedroom fan is broken  When I saw a c available for amenities  I expected to be able to turn it to my desired temperature  The bedroom fan works but only when the light is on  Although the stay was okay  it was a few things that bothered me personally  By all means  Zencity was very professional and communicated efficiently 
633397563,This Airbnb was perfect for our visit  My boyfriend and I wanted to be close enough to downtown   the Westport area while we apartment shop  This location was about       min away from downtown   Westport was even closer   The location itself was very clean  I loved it had its own private patio  the kitchen was perfect for our take out foods    the bedroom was very spacious for you to throw around your traveling clothes   not have to be so tidy to find it later  The place was very clean  easy to access    the location was great for our visit  The only thing I may suggest is adding a TV to the bedroom  or move the tv from the living room to the bedroom  Or a pullout couch in the living room  so guests can watch tv  relax   lay down    The extra keys on the key fob was a little confusing whether it was to be used or not    the parking lot number was not clear  We did not want to accidentally park in someones parking spot  Maybe put the Airbnb designated parking spot on the back of the key fob    Otherwise  we appreciate how clean the place was    how accurate it was literally steps from the Country Club Plaza  Ill make sure to stay here next time 
661766254,AMAZING stay  The apartment was so clean  It is next to nearly everything  host is amazing and responds to inquiries quickly  Highly recommend staying here  Only issues we ran into was some wifi connectivity and the upstairs neighbors were loud one evening 
643414863,Clean  stylish and overall a very good place  Particularly for the cost  Recommend  Great place  Bit disappointed with being promised that a key fob was going to be dropped off when it wasnt  As well as a broken record player which we were excited about 
716051546,The place is in the heart of the plaza where there is a lot of action going on   Parking was free and available which is also value for money  The refrigerator wasnt as clean as I expected   Good value for money 
490693812,A very nice apartment at a very nice location  Hi   Very nice appartment you have in Straslund at a very nice location       The only thing we did miss during our stay  was a shape kitchen knife   BG Jorgen
653504450,Be careful with this unit and renting from Zencity  Compared to other places Ive booked  Zencity just seems like a business and care more about the money than the ppl that are renting out their units  Honestly it is a business and not a person so it seem less family friendly like Im used to and not welcoming  They are not timely with their responses and not ppl pleasers   If you have an issue they always have a rebuttal but no way to solve to ease your mind and thoughts because you spent your money  I will no longer be renting through ZENCITY again  Also  the unit did have a couple bugs so I hope they fix that issue and sunlight hitting you directly in your face when you wake up because the blinds are broke  Their were roaches in unit and the blinds needs to be fixed if someone is there on vacation and want to sleep in it is impossible to do so when the sun is directly in your face 
643425426,This apt was beautiful and was located really close to a lot of activities including the beautiful Lafayette Park  The host communicated well when I called about confusion on my part with the parking  The apt could have been a little bit cleaner and it was a little confusing when initially entering the building and finding our way to the actual apt without the keyfob  Other than that I would consider staying here again  Communication was great  And the apartment was beautiful  The instructions said upon first arriving to enter the building and go up the stairs and through the doors  With the help of some residents   we ended up having to go downstairs to the basement and to the elevator which would have been hard to find if it wasnt for the help that we received  The walls were dirty throughout the entire apt and there were pieces of hair stuck to the walls in the bedroom in multiple places  Also it appeared as if the floors hadnt been swept or mopped 
636236068,Firstly  am very mad that I cant give a no star on this review  This is just a terrible experience for me and I would advice anyone thinking of booking this place to back off immediately except you dont mind dwelling in filth     this host handed me keys to an unsanitary environment  There was dust and dirt everywhere  food residue on the carpet and floor  the kitchen utensils were half clean and I found blood stains on the bathroom walls  To make matters worse this host offered me no solution and kept lying that the place was just cleaned  I literally had to partially clean this place myself just to get through the night because Airbnb werent answering my calls for solution  I have pictures of the whole experience and I await my FULL refund from Airbnb     
643007976,Nice place nice location but there was a rodent problem the host was not reachable my entire stay never spooke to an actual person the entire stay  After booking and receiving check in information there was no further communication nor response to my calsl and messages Thes is a mouse living in the unit you need to take care of this immediately i was very upset that I had to pay to live with a rodent  My girlfriend couldnt even sleep she was so scared  VERY disappointed There was a mouse running around the living room and kitchen area Tried to contact a few times on my visit when I called i got a message service thats saying I will be contacted  Immediately and I nevr got a call back had an issue with wifi as well called the number and clicked the wifi option it says the information will be text to me and I never got a text
642330644,Very Great Location  Modern and nice place  Easy to get in and out of the apartment  Not as clean as expected  Better cleanliness  If you are going to say you are doing extra cleaning for Covid    i expect it to be a very clean place  I had to sweep up the floors and vacuum the carpet because you could see dirt debris on the floors  Dirty kitchen cabinets walls  Dirty floors
637886769,Not a bad little place  close enough to everything and clean  The neighbors were a bit wild  The location is an apartment with permanent tendants seemed a bit bothered by our presence but beside that we had no real complaints 
661818591,Super
644728296,Great place to stay  Close to downtown Chicago and other fun areas 
658709793,Place was beautiful my disappointment was shower wasnt cleaned and fingernail clippings was on couch cushions which told me who ever cleaned unit didnt properly clean it other than that the place is nice an location is perfect  I previously stayed at this unit a few months back then no major issues thought it was a great place to stay  Now on my recent visit was different  Upon arriving inside unit I went to bathroom and notice shower was not cleaned and had old used bar of soap on soap holder inside shower  I was very disappointed I refuse to shower in a unclean shower  So I bought cleaning supplies to clean myself  The other issue was the front room couch it was finger nails clippings on couch seat cushions and a  lighter stuck inbetween pillows  I knew this place was not properly cleaned  Its a beautiful place but wish the unit was cleaned properly  The kitchen floor needed a good sweep and mopping also  Other than that I would recommend if unit is cleaned 
635517368,Clean  Great kitchen  Comfortable  Great location  Great place  Very comfortable  Loved the kitchen  The bath tube drains slowly in both rooms  The picture showed a dining area but the rooms I had did not have that  Thanks for hosting us  Upon arrival  a code is entered to access the main entrance  However  there is an elevator that requires key fob access  I was locked out until a resident let us in  The issue was addressed after the first check out  I was informed that theres a    second window from entering the access code to making my way to the elevator to press the floor number  Should be stated 
654301419,Great location  clean and cool place   A few issues of concerns  getting in the apt with the key fob  not enough towels and communication issues   I would love to stay there again just need a few issues addressed  Great place  location and clean   However the ac did not work and I messaged   I was told it would be the next day  I was not accepting that since it was       degrees   I was there for business and had an early morning   I needed a good night sleep   They guy finally showed up at   ish and changed filter and instructed me not to turn it on for a hour to a hour and half   So at a    pm I turned it on   Then only one bath towel per person  One last thing  one key fob  I was there with a coworker so we could not get into the garage at separate times   I asked for an extra one and was told they would try to find one   I was told I could access the building thru intercom which is inaccurate   Plus the key fob getting into to parking garage door and unit was always tricky   The door did not seem secure when shut   I had to ask last night for my check in instructions   I hate writing all of this stuff and I would love to stay here again since I will being coming to KC to work on a regular basis  I just feel the communication was not adequate and lack of follow through   Nice place and location 
644744586,The place was nice  just the communication with my host was terrible the whole trip  The place was nice  just communication with you was terrible for some reason  Besides that thanks for the spot 
711322202,This place is what to be expected for the price 
428267949,Slawik and Rebecca are really nice hosts and very responsive   The house couldve been cleaner and its pretty outdated but otherwise our stay was very nice  The house is located in a quiet street and has parking which was very helpful  Hi Slawik Thank you for allowing us to stay in your cottage  The only negative thing I can say is that when checking in  I believe there was a confusion of which house I was supposed to stay in so the house was not ready when we arrived on Wednesday    pm CST   The house couldve been cleaner but Im sure that was attributed to the entire confusion of which house we were supposed to be in   The kitchen garbage disposal was not working fully  It would turn on sometimes it wouldnt  There werent any clean sponges to wash the dishes  Im old school and dont use dishwashers lol    The bathrooms were very clean and thank you for the endless clean towels   Again thanks for allowing us to stay in your home   Thanks  Indira When we arrived at the house  host was confused and thought we had rented another property  The house was not clean and ready for us 
639091775,Great location  really liked our stay  I dont believe that the towels or sheets were washed which is obviously a huge concern right now so I went out in the evening just in time and bought new sheets and towels and sprayed down all the surfaces  Other than that it was a good stay  Thank you The towels didnt look washed  full of hair  and the sheets didnt appear cleaned so I went and bought some 
638488093,This place is awesome  Exactly like the pictures and has an amazing view of the city  We loved being so close to downtown and being able to walk to restaurants  Your room was amazing  We really enjoyed the space  We were hopeful for a little more communication Some of the plates had crusty edges We came from    hours away and had to start driving and hope youd respond before we got there day of  You never came back to replace the batteries of the carbon monoxide detector which left us feeling unsafe
639084365,Nice place in a great area Thank you Had to msg host after check in time for instructions
706299570,Great location  When you get there you will use the elevators designated for residence to access the   st floor  Once you come in be sure to use the elevators that are designated for residents to access the   st floor
703781439,Nice place for   couples or a group of four to stay  Right on the corner of a busy intersection so great for people watching  Beds were comfortable  Wish there was more sitting space in the living room for everyone to watch TV comfortably versus having to sit in the bar seats while others are on the couch  Also there were no TVs in the bedrooms so it forced us all to watch the same thing Overall this is a nice placeand would consider booking again 
662987177,A great place to stay  Please get rid of the mold and update the couch  Its a great place  Extensive mold issues in the bathroom ceiling   The ceiling required an application of Kilz and new paint which should fix it 
629705404,Nice lay out  nice area  overall nice  the provision of towels was nice  Just would get the place professionally cleaned and sanitized especially during these times  oh and pool cue chalk would be nice as well  washer was dirty   and chairs on island were a bit dirty  sham pillows were a little dusty  if ALL the power window blinds actually worked flawlessly  Soap dispenser in nicer shower had soap  a little cleaner  more art work would be nice would make it seem more homey  blank walls made it seem a little empty 
653877363,We hope to be back  This unit wins for Best Location  Walkability factor is pretty high   close to many good bistros  coffee shops  casual   fine dining restaurants  stores such as Whole Foods  Trader Joes  Michaels  Target  CVS  the University of Chicago  a bit of a hike but still walkable   Lakeshore Drive and the Promontory Walk at Lake Michigan    Beautiful art deco building with a large  cool  private courtyard for social distance visiting  Unit itself was a bright  breezy corner unit on the fourth floor  so if you wanted to avoid the elevator  taking the stairs was a viable option  Bedrooms are in opposite corners which was nice  We didnt really use the kitchen  but the fridge  toaster and microwave were nice to have  Water pressure was strong  Bed linens were super soft  I think they were the bamboo kind  with a good number of pillows  No parking spot but lots of free street parking    What I wish I had done was to bring my own Fire Stick  or a Google Cast or equivalent  so that I didnt have to sign in  and sign out  of my favorite streaming channels  They had Netflix and Sling available  so there was still a wide variety of streaming shows     IMO  the unit was a bit tired looking  Negatives were   toilet was an old model  small and almost toddler height  there were holes in the sofa  they brought in a band new sofa on our last night    one side chairs coils were unraveled  the dishwasher wasnt attached to the counter  so it would alarmingly tilt out of the counter  sink in kitchen and bathroom had some mold  very limited kitchen plates  glasses  utensils    The cleaning job wasnt the best   dirty vents  cobwebs  dusty tables  windows were so dirty you could hardly see out of it  As a precaution  I brought my Lysol to wipe down   disinfect the place anyway  so this wasnt really a bother for me  Unlike another ZenCity property that we rented last year  this one forgot to leave coffee  salt   pepper  paper towels  face   hand towels and a kitchen towel  For a twelve day stay we were given one bath towel each    total   From our experience  we think ZenCity has some nice properties and is terrific value  We can highly recommend this place  Sweet unit but it would be really helpful to clean the windows  Its a corner unit but you couldnt see out because of the dirty windows    Our building code didnt work on our last night  We were about to check out early the next morning but what the heck  Too much hassle to contact you to let you know  but we shouldnt have to since we were paid for that night    Your note  Nice and Clean  by Clariza only works if its true  Otherwise  it seems its better not to put up a sign if you cant keep the promise      sink had mold  cobwebs in living room  baseboards were not clean  windows were so dirty you couldnt see out of them  i wrote twice but had no response  there were no paper towels and it came two days later  asked for a battery for the wall clock but it never came  they came to change the sofa but didnt tell us they were coming  our building entry code was disabled on our last night 
700257562,This is my first and only critical review on Air BnB and Ive used Air BnB a lot  over several years now  Even on the rare occasion that a BnB let us down  Ive always found hosts to be honest and responsive   When we checked into this place  it was not yet cleaned after the previous guests  Like bedding in the living room  food and dirty dishes out in kitchen and dining table  That too during a pandemic where other BnBs have taken immense efforts towards the safety of their guests  I tried calling them  then sent images of the place via the messaging app   no response until I explained to the door person at the apartment that I was going to cancel    They explained to the door person that the cleaner had   other apartments to clean and this would take an hour  Only after I walked out did they message me  And when I asked them to cancel and fully refund my booking  they just sent me their cancellation policy  When we tried to mediate through Air BnB they falsely stated to them  that the problem was that we checked in too early  When in fact  we left well after check in time and no cleaner had arrived    Air BnB did a great job mediating but Zen City was terrible  Pretty apartment and would have been such a good experience if they were atleast moderately responsive or responsible 
661662584,Becareful with everything in the room  may be you needed to take pictures of everything in the room the first day that you get there  to prove that you did not do anything wrong to everything in that room I dont know what to say just feel disappoint  First when we got there   we like this place  good area  and security but when we get in to the room C  the floor was very dirty with a lot of blond hair on the floor and on the rug  we have to find the vacuum and clean them   I am Asian and I have black hair    we are couples but they provide only   big towel   in the bath tub when I start to take  a shower by run hot water and I felt soap scum on the  tub slick and slide when hot water hit the tub  I cleaned your room really good before we check out and I got email about I split something on the rug  and want to charge me    dollars to clean that   the photo of the rug the you showed to us  was not accurate   it was crisscross weave in the room but the picture that you claimed that we split something its different  we did not split anything and I do not mind to drive     miles back to your room to confirm that   I am very disappoint     cleanliness and sincere
702742937,Wow  this place is beautiful   Sorry to say management didnt have the best performance for me   Check in instructions are literally impossible   They give you access to the building and access to the apartment   But you cannot get to the apartment because you need a key fob to get thru the inner doors   And  the key fob is in the apartment   IMPOSSIBLE   After successfully  breaking in  thru the building  I was able to reach my apartment and check in   I only had about    minutes prior to an NFL game being broadcast on a local tv channel   I tried Sling and Roku  but neither offered it   I tried adding the channel  but that was also unsuccessful   I think there might have been contractual problems streaming the NFL  but when I called to ask for help  all I got was an unhelpful arrogant pr ck from Zen City Management   All they probably needed was an antenna and local channels would be easy in downtown St  Louis   Brutal   I also had to ask several time and finally negotiate to get management to unlock the NEST thermostat   I just wanted to be able to turn the heat on in the evening and off at night   Dude said he would adjust it for me via computer   What am I ten yrs old   Cannot adjust the heat for a   night stay myself   Oh  and the hot water was luke warm  leading me to believe management had the hot water heater cranked down as far as possible     Oh  forgot  same problem checking out with the keyfob   Once you leave the apartment and keyfob behind  you cannot access the secure parking area if using the stairs   So  again you have to  break into  the parking lot because you dont have access with the keyfob   This wouldnt have been a problem if they didnt intimidate you into using the parking lot by saying street parking is illegal   No  street parking is not illegal here   Just a poor overall experience  Gotta change the check in instructions to make the keyfob accessible somehow  Impossible to check in with current instructions   You cannot get to the apt because there are inner doors which require a key fob which is in the apt Multiple attempts to turn on the heat ending with me negotiating to have access to the Nest thermostat   And  an unhelpful arrogant pr ck when I actually called asking for help
655577623,Heres a rundown of the good and bad  Good  location  price  building is nice  has a pool and gym  Washer and dryer in unit  Bad  internet is  mbps which is slow and they will not increase it which is sad because its a Google fiber network with possible speeds of up to a gig       Mbps   This made it hard to work remotely  Communication with this third party management company is poor  I had to send multiple emails to get them to respond and theyre dismissive  I find when an owner is managing it is a lot better in terms of response and action taken  The rugs are girly and need to be deep cleaned  There are stains all over  I had to send multiple messages for them to respond
507657289,This is an amazing place to stay and in a very nice area  I enjoyed my weekend stay and I was pleased at how attentive Brian was given that he was out of the state  The only problem I had during my stay was trouble with the entry door opening which made me nervous about leaving and not being able to get back in  After talking with Brians assistant  he had the contractor come over to fix it and all it needed was a little greasing  Other than that  the place is very clean and well put together  As a first time airbnb user  I definitely recommend  this home  The back bathroom showers water was scorching hot and i tried adjusting the temperature and it wouldnt change
662985223,Beautiful space  clean  Only issue was the key fob not working  Key Fob did not work
660314868,Perfect location
669124424,Quick Weekend Getaway  Overall the space was a step away from being absolute perfect  The building itself is very clean and well kept  We enjoyed the stay  It was conveniently located  peaceful and we felt very safe at this location  We would definitely stay here again   A little extra attention to the bedroom ceiling fan and a few cleaning  nacks   Such as  there was a wad of hair  like from a brush or comb  on the living room floor and a used popsicle stick in the shower   Overall the space was a step away from being absolute perfect  We enjoyed the stay  It was conveniently located  peaceful and we felt very safe at this location  Thank you  The room number with the letter behind it was confusing  We were hesitant to try just the room number because we did not want to alarm a tenet in the event that someone was living there  After going back to the lobby and while awaiting a response I finally decided to just go back upstairs and see if the apartment with the number only was it   it was  Other than that everything was clear and easy to follow  A couple of minor overlooked cleaning points that we easily took care of ourselves  Outside of these things the space was clean and far from being  nasty  
474890843,This was a cute and spacious spot in a great location near local cafes and shops  The bed was comfy and the view was great  The only annoying thing was how long it took to figure out how to open the front door getting in  It wouldnt open on first  second or even third try  It had to be jangled around  When we contacted Zencity they responded with someone will bring us a new key in the morning which threw me off seeing as how my check out was   am  Luckily we fiddled around and were able to get in  Other than that the responses were prompt and the space was cozy  The front door key was annoying to deal with
656154561,Clean apartment  Walking distance to many restaurants and coffee shops  Host slow to respond when needing to contact them  Minimal items in the apartment  e g   dishes   See previous remarks Would recommend having pictures in the check in process building is large and confusing  Also  card to use elevator was cracked and unusable  Therefore  we were unable to get to our apt on the   st floor  Sent message to host that night without any response  Sent another message in the morning and there was a response that the new card would be in the lockbox  We received it   with a lot of other keys to that same building  apartments that we did not rent  This is a huge safety concern  If it had not been for our friends that lived in the same complex to get us from floor   to    on the first night  we wouldnt had been able to access our apartment that night  There were minimal dishes in the kitchen for use  Come to find out on our last day  there were dishes in the dishwasher  unsure if clean or dirty or how long they had been in there 
452105296,Walking distance to numerous restaurants caf s  Though host was very busy  when I had a question he replied within minutes  Awesome place  I would definitely stay here again  Thank you so much for hosting my friends and I  Also  happy early birthday     Lots of dust everywhere  Especially on the floors
664050413,This place was a great place to stay  It really wasnt to far from the things we wanted to do   The cleanliness of the place was Great as well  Thanks for letting us stay  We enjoyed ourselves and the place 
270874406,Great style and location  Slawik was very attentive to our needs  He even helped us find  off street  parking  Check in and out was a breeze  Really great stay  Just one suggestion  get new sheets  Our linens seemed very old  The fabric was uncomfortable and worn pilled 
660652639,We stayed here while helping my sister move to St  Louis and get situated in her new place  This is an awesome location  super close and convenient to grocery stores  restaurants  bars  and furniture shopping stores  The apartment was comfortable but the AC in one of the bedrooms was a little loud  Also  the Wifi was at times super slow  All in all though  we had a pleasant stay and enjoyed the trip to St  Louis  Just a quick note that the remote was missing from the apartment   we were able to use the Roku app to control the TV  which you suggested  but wanted to let you know here 
656455101,good good things about this place where the location and the views  The bad things about this location where they at I got stuck in the hallway for an hour waiting for the a response to change the code on the door  I also received    tickets in the    days I was there even though I was paying the meter  If I had not taken the time out to go to the place where you pay tickets I would have been stuck paying all but one of them  Also you have to make sure all the bills are paid  First the electric company came out and put a disconnection notice in the door  I had to communicate with the host wow the man was in the apartment so he didnt cut off the electric  Also the Wi Fi got cut off and I had to call and get it cut back on  The place was not clean for us to be in the middle of a pandemic I would write the cleaning   out of    Make sure bills are payed up     I had to deal with electric company and disconnect issues There is a layer of dust on the base boards and on top of ledge in shower  Ashes in window ledges  You can tell the floor was mopped with a dirty mop  Clean and parking     I got    ticket they forgave   but still 
249047035,This house is beautiful and spacious with enough room for a whole crew of people with an awesome  cozy feel    Slawik was an awesome host  A member of our party showed up hours before schedule  due to a miscommunication on our part  and she was let in early and even given a tour of the place  Slawik was extremely nice about the mix up  and even asked if we wanted him to grab us anything from the store    I would gladly stay at this location again  Thanks again for being so gracious with the awkward check in  The house was absolutely beautiful and perfect for our stay 
663886066,A nice clean space in a beautiful part of town    Not the most stylish or cozy place Ive ever stayed  but it was incredibly clean and the check in process was very easy  Never got personal replies to my messages  just copy   paste responses 
664024008,The building is not well taken care of  There was bacon on the ground on our floor and needed to be vacuumed  A used towel was left in our room   Overall  the place itself was nice  Loved the located 
710766207,Great area  place is clean   If more than two people are planning to stay  take notice that the only seating in the living area is a couch   No chairs in living area   No table for eating or for entertainment  board games  cards  etc      No REAL coffee machine like a Keurig or Mr  Coffee  If you are promoting your property as  can accommodate     people  then provide enough furniture to do so  My daughter and her friend came to visit and each brought their own outdoor folding chairs so they had a place to sit in the living area   Also  how about a small table in the living area for people to play cards  games  etc    No closet hangers provided  No  real coffee maker provided  like a Keurig or Mr  Coffee    Very limited kitchen supplies provided  plates  spoons  knifes  cook ware   These  little things make a big difference in ones choice to use your properties again  Master bedroom shower door  caulk was loose   Sides of stove top were dirty
720137267,You will sleep comfortably and the views cannot be beat  Just be sure the place has been cleaned properly before you arrive  Space had lingering smell of cigarettes  perhaps marijuana  Walls are in need of touchup paint  Perhaps a more durable sofa would be appropriate  What is there has clearly seen brighter days  I saw other reviews about the cleanliness of the space  Reached out to the host on the subject and never heard back 
719149888,It is very unclear to which building you will be located in  I a a problem with locking the door and parking  Other than that  the location was great  clean and comfortable
662115704,Nice location  beautiful place just need more maintenance work It was hair all over the bathroom and shower   and there was glass on the floor     and the Tv came off the wall when i turned it away from sun
718860812,this place is nice just need more tlc then it will be fabulous  I found a burnt towel In the closet the common area wasnt all that clean  I dont think the amount I paid including the cleaning fee was worth it  I still had the o clean the house myself before I slept there  I end up checking out a day earlier just for the inconvenience  I didnt want to book this place in the beginning it was an accident the home was way to small for me  so I end up spending more money at another location which was more accommodating 
664372208,Great location       mins from everything  We scored on free parking in the back of the building  If you have lots of luggage be aware your hauling it up   flights of steps they were very strict on checking in and checking out you check in exactly at   and have to be out by   am I flew in at   am I literally had to find nothing to do and was waiting at this front door to check in  So just know they dont offer any one that  This Airbnb for a small family not to much space in the apartment  We were aware of the stairs Ana we all had huge suitcases and i have back issues I think that should be listed  The dishwasher stinks really bad yall should check it out and for a person who wants the Airbnb to feel like home it would need more pots I had to buy almost everything to cook with those   pots wasnt going to make it work  The gate kept locking so we had to look like we were breaking in each time lastly they had a net problem they were in the trash can and where you Keep The broom and other things
717408520,Shown as displayed  very nice  More amenities like snacks and or waters would be nice to have for the price paid  Make sure to check that closet blanket
656399832,Do not stay here   Horrible customer service and mediocre accommodations   Look for another unit  Im shocked that I was told by one of your agents that I would be compensated for the three hours I was locked out of your unit and never heard anything back  I was locked out of the unit for   hours due to the electronic locking system malfunction   It took Ive an hour for the cleaning person to show up and try the exact same thing I was trying to do to open the unit  This didnt work  as I stated to the agent several times   It then took an additional two hours for someone to show up with the master key to get in   I was told that I would be compensated for my time and Never heard back from anyone   What a joke 
672630334,We stayed from Monday Friday and location was excellent  Right on division street  close to restaurants  the      if you like to run   and Milwaukee street  It was clean for the most part and the kitchen appliances and washer and drier came in handy  Parking is a little stressful but we figured it out  The coffee shop across the street has amazing coffee and pastries  WiFi in the living room is stronger than the kitchen  The sun room is a nice extra space just perfect to do some morning yoga or sip your coffee  The google nest was locked so we had to request for it to be unlocked to fit our temperature needs and they were flexible about it  The neighbors are smokers so sometimes the space smells like weed and cigarettes but we informed the host and continued to spray Lysol  Theres a church next door that rings the bells at different times of the day  Aside from the smells  we enjoyed our stay 
661840266,The place was nice  but extremely cold   The thermostat was set to an automatic    degrees and to return to this temperature after adjusting to a more comfortable temperature in a couple hours   This was annoying    It was noisy at night   There is a club across the street that was outdoors in the street  the street was blocked off due to social distancing   I suppose    It was nice to hear a DJ the first night  but every night of my stay was a bit much    especially from the yelling and screaming of partiers    Lastly   the common area at the rooftop was not clean     Overall   this was a good experience  Please remove the automated thermostat to give guests an opportunity to set the temperature of the room to what is comfortable for them   I was able to adjust it  but it only would stay the adjusted temperature for   hours      is far too cold for me  There was a couple of dust balls around as id someone swept and left a small pile  Mark did let me know they had lots of checkins which slowed down the response time  A book of experiences   local restaurants and to dos 
716042622,Does not describe exactly as in photos  Overall not bad for short stay When we walk on the floor  creeking sound was coming especially in bedroom and hall   I found some dirty marks on the kitchen floor and in bathroom corners  There is no way for us to control the heat  Bedroom went so hot in the nights  The pans in the kitchen were worned out and we could not use them  These things need to be improved for better stay in future
709746004,This is my  nd Zencity stay and I have to say this apartment was quite disappointing from the other  The cleanliness of this apartment is lacking  its quite dingy  The couch is stained and the walls are not painted well leaving lots of crack and patches of paints  The apartment does not have forks or cooking oil or pepper  Legit  one fork and salt  There could be some major updates and this place would be worth the nightly cost  Yes  the view is nice but not worth the lack of cleanliness or care of the unit  The bed was comfortable but the bathroom was aold and has a lot of rust and spots on the ceiling  If youre a clean freak like me  I wouldnt recommend this apartment but if those things dont matter to you  then do you     also  the amenities are a plus  Restaurant and market on site  I was quite disappointed in this apartment  This is my  nd stay with Zencity  The apartment only has one fork and is not ready for a stay  No cooking oil or pepper either  The apartment can do some paining and upgrading as well  Please make it better 
660307410,Nice location
671554849,The place was nice and definitely recommend staying there  The host is quick to reply  No issues with check in  Only recommendation Is to look ahead into parking  It does not include private parking  There is street parking and if you take Hyde street down to the left  and then a right at the light  There is additional parking there  There are parking ramps which are costly but optional  The place was great  we enjoyed the availability with the wifi  It is much better than having to message the host to resolve it  It was in a nice spot the only downside was the parking  I do not mind paying for parking but it would have been nice to have a separate area for guest  I think this was on my part but I did not realize the check in was in the building across  It took us a  minute to find but it was fine  n a
657469166,Nice place  convenient location  They have a French press coffee maker but no coffee  good thing there is a coffee place about a   minute walk down the street  Bring your own toiletries and toothpaste etc bc there is none  Overall nice stay Thanks for the stay  as a fellow host I wanted to point these things out  There were a ton of gauges and marks all over the walls  The console table leg was broken and uneven  the couch slopes to the floor  There was no coffee for the coffee maker  Not enough shampoo soap for   people  The shower floor was gross and needs a deep clean  There is a wood shim under the waterfall island  I think u need to send a painting crew in to put a new coat on walls and fix everything and a new cleaning crew  the exhaust vent was covered in dust and the filter in the furnace looks like it was never changed Butterfly panel wasnt working
650541176,The apartment is great   The location  right in the heart of the Country Club Plaza  cannot be beat  The apartment was extremely clean and inviting  Its a large space and could use a little more furniture and wall decor  There is only one night stand in the bedroom which is a pet peeve for me  I also missed not having a tv in the bedroom  We had an issue getting access to the parking garage but once we worked it out it was perfect  We had someone park in our allotted space one night and I read in another review that another traveler had the same issue  It would be nice to know where to park in the event that happens  It was too late to call Zencity so it was a little nerve wracking that night   We travel to Kansas City often and would consider the apartment again  For the most part Zencity was very responsive  We did have an issue using the fob to access the parking garage  I didnt get a response from them but eventually solved the issue with the apartment building rental office  The other times I contacted Zencity they responded quickly    The property could use more detailed information in the apartment regarding the parking garage and using the door fob 
705464238,Lock your car doors  Sheets were soiled as well  The bedding was very clear soiled 
721036136,Location is great and quick response
663366973,Is a good apartment with a great location to good food  There was construction going in the building the whole   weeks I was there  Since the walls were thin it made it quite loud staring at  am  Once the construction is done this will be a great place  The kitchen dishes were a bit dirty when I arrived and it would have been nice to get the check out reminders the day before instead of after I had already left 
705879661,The style was nice   the unit was clean  However  the kitchen had very few items  very few choices cook with and no utensils besides basic fork spoon  the unit wasnt extremely easily to enter  There are multiple steps to take before getting into your unit   back outside  but being a repurposed building its to be expected  Overall it was a good stay in a nice clean location 
719796551,Space is as described  Walking distance to good restaurants  Need more amenities in the kitchen  extra hooks or bar in the bathroom to hang clothes etc  The space is good but doesnt have the special touches to WOW  Thanks for letting us stay in the house  The space was as described  quite large and spacious  However  seem very bland  Need to add more color and touches to the house make it warm and cozy  The chairs and the breakfast table in the living room are of cheap quality  in fact one of the chairs is broken and the others are vey slippery on the wooden floor  My   year old son slipped while sitting on the chair and cut his lip  Need more amenities in the kitchen  extra hooks or bar in the bathroom to hang clothes etc  The furnace works well but quite loud especially in the night  The space is OK but doesnt have the special touches to WOW 
657487655,If you want a nice apartment with an awesome downtown location  this is the perfect place for you  The unit was very clean  stylish  and well secured   Some things to know    there is a kitchen with pots and pans  but there is minimal dish ware  Bring your own laundry detergent if you plan on doing laundry  There is shampoo and conditioner there  but theyre travel size and dont last long if youre staying for an extended period  This listing says parking is    day  but its actually     day  Theres also not really any street parking around the building so you have to park in the garage  The listing doesnt mention it  but there is a beautiful rooftop garden on the  th floor that you can use   Overall  I would definitely stay here again  I loved the space and location  I would just update that parking is actually     day because that adds up quickly  I would also add that theres a garden terrace for guests to use because it was an awesome amenity   Also  there were pictures of multiple units that were posted on this listing  I loved the place I stayed in  but some of the pictures on this listing were of a different unit  The photo included on the email zoomed in on the app so you couldnt see where the lock boxes were  This wasnt something I realized until I logged onto my computer and saw it  So maybe put two separate pictures 
656768468,Very simple modern place  love the location as far as proximity to things to do downtown however  parking is a big yikes  The garage was far too expensive  a local suggested parking in a neighborhood not too far from the Airbnb which was free just a walk away which wasnt bad  If youre busy during the day parking isnt a huge issue if youre around and about but if you need to park during the day I suggest a neighborhood with free street parking and walking  at night it wasnt too bad  found a spot just a block away 
661634741,This property was ok  The view was spectacular but it was decent  unfortunately during the visit my guests and I shocking observed a porn video shoot in the high rise condos across the balcony  Im glad there was no kids staying and the filters immediately stopped once they saw us calling authorities  The location was also boarded up so we had a hard time locating the building due to the wooden boarded up windows    I would told that the check in couldnt not earlier due to housekeeping throughly cleaning the apartment  However  we observed a leftover bag in the refrigerator w  molded food inside  The screen on the balcony was broken  The parking was awful and very expensive        for       nites   Zencity was immediately notified about the above issued but nothing was done  The apartment did what it needed to do which was provide me and my guests a bed and a bathroom  I dont think i would book with this location again  It was nice but not worth       I know this is not a zencity concern but the parking in the immediate area of the apartment was extremely expensive  I paid a total of      for       days  The refrigerator has food leftover inside of it from a prior occupants 
669623964,I want to be able to recommend this  because had it been clean it would have been great  Hoping its a fluke  But the place was gross  Food stuck to the stove backsplash  sticky alcohol rings on the desks  hair on the carpets and in the sinks   I didnt stay here  I have to travel for work or I wouldnt  WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC  corners cannot be cut on cleaning   Plus  yes they refunded their part but  I still lost     in service fees and    to park in their garage for the    minutes I was there  Not a great experience  I know its not one specific persons fault  but in a normal world I expect to not have hair clumps on the rugs  rings of sticky alcohol on the desks  etc  In a NORMAL world  We are in a worldwide pandemic  Protocol needs to be better The instructions do TRY to be clear But they need updated because the key pad is broken  you have to call a    go to a whole New garage  Its just a bit of a hassle  And then there are elevators right inside the door that ARE NOT the elevators you have to use so thats confusing  Then the elevators have a scan pad outside AND inside  i had to have someone help Me  They made an effort but It wasnt immediate 
717678414,This is the second time that I reside at a Zencity owned property and the price  location and cleanness of the apartment were all satisfying and on point    The two main issues that I encountered is that the internet connect was very poor and that the messages from the host were  too much  automated so that my questions were either not answered accurately or completely ignored Thank you for hosting us at your place  Everything looked clean and tidy  Main comments over the place the I have are that the internet was not working  I was able to connect to it once but it was slow and sometime later I got disconnected and never been able to connect again  Another things is the the messages are  too much  automated to the extent that my questions were either not answered accurately or completely ignored    But again  the check in was easy and the location  price and the cleanness of the apartment itself were all on point  Automated responses ignore questions asked
653878246,It was a nice place  they had subscription services to watch on TV  Theres not a whole lot of space inside the apartment  but its a lovely apartment  Additionally  the check in process was awful for me  as I was there for an hour and a half before I was able to get into the apartment  Additionally  I paid for   nights  and I had to pay for parking  which cost me half of what the entire apartment cost me  Thanks for being a good host  There were a few issues with my stay which I mentioned before  mainly parking and checking in   but I would also like to suggest putting a coffee machine in the airbnb  I was upset when I noticed your french press was not a complete set so I was unable to make coffee in the mornings     The key fob was broken when I arrived so wouldnt work on any of the elevators or door entrances  Was unable to request another from office  Didnt mention that the door handle was broken and hard to open  so it was closed until the host explained that the door was broken  Additionally  when the host dropped off the working fob  they gave me the wrong code for the lockbox  I was trying to get into the apartment for an hour and a half before I was able to get inside and put my stuff down  Didnt answer any messages that I sent  but luckily did answer the phone calls  If there was free parking  I spent over      in parking for   days because there was no free parking available  on the street or in the parking garage 
402791069,clean  nice space  apartment smelled strongly of weed for most of the night
702388602,Bare bones but the place was clean and location was great  Thrid floor hallway light was out  Two evenings unable to watch Netflix because too many accounts were logged in 
324297728,The place is really near Chicago which is ideal for viewing the city  In terms of decor  it was styled pretty well  Brian was very quick to respond and extremely informative  My only complaint  and I understand that its one thats hard to fix  is that the floor and doors were squeaky  Since you have to walk through some rooms to get to the next bathroom or living room  it made it hard to get through the house without waking anyone up during the night  Thank you for being so quick to respond  Id like to mention that there wasnt enough toilet paper for us  one in some restrooms  and we had to go buy our own 
662993433,Love the apt and there was a lot of parking
665432543,Mattress and couch cushions smelled very bad  Carpet had black mold  Mattress and couch cushions smelled very bad  Carpet had black mold
657105033,This stay was decent  The listing and location were accurate and the room was comfortable and fairly clean  However there were two blinds missing from the windows  reducing the feeling of privacy and safety  The biggest issue was the keypad  Upon arrival I spent about    minutes standing outside the door trying to get in  After two failed attempts at using two different passcodes I was finally given a Bluetooth key  which worked well and was pretty convenient  until about three days later when the Bluetooth key failed to work as well and I had to call twice before I got an answer and some help  I will say that Zencity customer service is very polite  friendly  and helpful  which made the frustration of being unable to get inside my room a little less infuriating  Aside from these issues  the place was nice and overall I enjoyed my time here  Keypad failed to work for initial check in and continued to experience issues throughout the trip
702552340,Very nice space in an even better location  Walking distance to the River Market  Power Light District  etc  I parked in the   hour parking  free from  pm  am  every night for my    day stay and never had an issue  My only complaint is how unresponsive the hosts  Zencity company employees  can be  Counter tops in kitchen were dirty  floor in bathroom dirty  I called to check about parking  no answer so I left a message and nobody got back to me  One day my bedroom light went out and I messaged the host who said theyd contact maintenance ASAP and nobody ever came to fix the light 
663296164,Okay  WiFi didnt work  and I had online school  It was very frustrating  We didnt have WiFi during our entire stay and it was never addressed 
720459354,Good location  very small amount of dishes no toaster  poor follow up on repairs needed while we were staying there    Very comfortable bed  I was disappointed that I had notified Zencity that the dryer was not working and the only communication I received was that maintenance was notified  No follow up and no maintenance person stopped by for the   days that we were there after I sent the email note  I did a temporary  repair so we could get some cloths washed    No toaster and very little dishes 
660311039,The apartment was a good size to accommodate     guests and located to several coffee and food establishments  The air conditioning was not working one evening  The issue was fixed about    hrs later  however it was too hot too sleep at the apartment and I had to sleep at a family members home that evening  I was not prorated or given a direct answer if the one night would be prorated even though I asked several times  The air conditioning was not working one evening  The issue was fixed about    hrs later  however it was too hot too sleep at the apartment and I had to sleep elsewhere that evening  I was not prorated or given a direct answer if the one night would be prorated even though I asked several times   Please let me know if the August   th evening will be prorated  The air conditioning was not working one evening  The issue was fixed about    hrs later  however it was too hot too sleep at the apartment and I had to sleep elsewhere that evening  I was not prorated or given a direct answer if the one night would be prorated even though I asked several times 
720138351,Zencity place was clean and had everything you would need  dish soap  dishwasher pods  etc   The building itself was needing new carpet and a clean up  Parking was a tad difficult to find we had to park     blocks away  That wouldnt be too bad on a nice day but it iced during our stay so made it challenging  Overall was a comfortable stay and lots to do in the area 
665768277,Great place in a great location 
665155533,Just had some issues with cleanliness  and it was a bit hot  but overall it was okay 
665493919,Very hard to find parking in that area  Didnt feel safe in that area
717873266,Great experience and value  The space was exactly what we expected  We would certainly stay again the next time we visit KC 
665454907,Very cute space in a nice area  right in downtown  Only blocks away from Power   Light District  Very clean and spacious  Would recommend this spot to anyone  Thanks for being a great host  Only thing to mention was unfortunately the water was shut off from   AM  PM during the one day of our stay  I figured you just were not aware of that work being done  just would have been nice to know  thats all  Otherwise  very cute space in a great area 
717169752,The space is beautiful and we really enjoyed our stay  The kitchen is a bit under equipped and the TV does not have capability to log into anything like Netflix  Prime  etc  There is a local satellite attached to the TV that got a few channels but the reception was poor so we didnt use it  In the kitchen  there isnt a coffee maker or many pots pans to cook with  We ended up purchasing a larger frying pan during our stay and left it behind for future guests  All of that said  we still loved our stay  thought the place was well decorated  and very clean  Thank you  It would be helpful to have a bit more of an equipped kitchen  There was a broken spatula and only very small pans to use  We ended up purchasing a larger frying pan during our stay and left it behind for future guests 
659706694,Cool spot great location We were told that there was other zen city rooms in the building  If thats the case and people show up and their room that is costing them      for three nights isnt ready  maybe instead of making them just wait  Get them taken care of so you dont have to tired  possibly very irritated    year olds bothering the nice door girl in the building  Or offer a discount for their experience  This was my first Airbnb stay in Chicago  We usually get a hotel and I have to say I prefer the Airbnb but not      that when we come back up in October we will be staying in one  We were told we could check in at      we arrived and were told it wasnt going to be ready until       Having our car parked already and our bagS in tow  this was very inconvenient  Then when we were able to enter the key pads battery was dead  That took a few trips up stairs and phone calls  Lets just say we were very frustrated after already being in the car for   hours  Last thing we wanted was to hangout in the lobby waiting to get in  Balcony needs love  windows were very dirty and t there was at least   good size spiders that have webs all over above your head  Being ready on time and a       checkout
703322911,Nice place other than door lock leaving me in hall for hours After the door lock malfunctioned i was left waiting in the hallway for hours
665483649,Great location  amazing rooftop views 
663313973,Beautiful place but it has large rats  I would bet stay there if I was you  The place it self was beautiful however  it has a rodent problem  I saw a few large rats and they were running up and down the hallway late at night  Also  they were eating my bread and fruits  I would never stay there nor would I recommend it to anyone else  Had issues with getting into to the building and the unit upon check but even though in was after hours the host did respond quickly  However  later I had additional issues with with digital key  Still the host was very responsive  Thanks for that  Nice place beside the rodent problem  But there was a big RAT in my unit
666892883,Would recommend for a short term stay
332173983,The location and ease of getting in was great  Trains are noisy but location makes everything walkable  The bathroom could have been cleaner but everything was ok 
701679637,This is simple and stylish place to stay while in Chicago  Near countless places to eat and other attractions  No issues with check in or check out  The space was stylish but I do wish it could have been a bit cleaner  I would also consider leaving more cleaning products for guest in case they have any spills or just  want to do their own cleaning after check in or before check out  Loved the washer and dryer  very convenient  Check in and check out instructions were clear and the place was easy to find  The drawers in the bathroom had a lot of hairs and dried spills from previous guest   Stain on bathroom ceiling     The trash can lid was broken and the body of the trash can had some spills on it  I wiped down all the areas I thought were kinda messy  This may not bother other guest but Im an anal clean freak unfortunately  Next to El train but not as noisy as expected  The walls were scuffed and rug had a couple dark stains as if something was stuck in them  The lid of the trash can was broken  Soap dispenser in bathroom was defective  Simply put  I didnt feel like I was having a vacation experience  It was more like staying at a friends place while they were away  Could not find a switch for the light above the dining table 
664367014,Pros great space super stylish Lots of amenities  tons of great restaurants  bike rentals nearby  Washer  Dryer Firestick for the TV  Cons  rd floor no elevator  Pigeons roosting outside bedroom window Great space great value   just a few things need to be addressed there was a chair with a broken leg that my cousin fell out of no fault of her own   there is also broken window in the livingroom that was taped up   There was also another window in the middle bedroom that wouldnt close properly and because of that mosquitoes got into the room   Lastly I think you should give guests access to the thermostat because regardless of the season some people are cold during warm seasons and others hot during cold  but either way people just want to be comfortable thanks  in advance for your hospitality  We had as n issue with temperature and it was resolved after   emails were sent 
661614235,My husband and I stayed here for one week while visiting our new grandchild   Location was perfect for us and the neighborhood is nice and it is an easy walk to many shops and restaurants   Parking is free on the street   but it is difficult to find a spot   We found a spot on the street on day   of our stay and left the car there for the remainder of our stay   We did use SpotHero the first day and were able to park in a lot that was very close to the apartment   The unit is spacious with plenty of room for two people   Bed is comfortable and bedroom closet had plenty of hangers and a luggage rack which is always a nice touch   Building is quiet and we never heard any noise from neighbors   Wifi worked great which was appreciated due to having to work remotely a few days during our stay   The A C unit was loud when it was running  but did adequately cool the apartment   The couch in the living room looks great and appears to be new  but is is extremely uncomfortable   Kitchen is minimally stocked   This wasnt a concern for us as we were not planning on preparing any meals n the unit   Only a thin dishtowel was provided in the kitchen   no dishcloth  pot holders  or detergent for the dishwasher were provided   The grout in the tub area as well as the shower curtain could be cleaner and the back of the bathroom door was cracked   Only one hand towel    bath towels and   wash cloths were provided   which is minimal for   adults staying for   days   Overall the price was right for this apartment and we would likely book again  Need to provide more towels   One hand towel for   people for a week is not sufficient   Also  no dishcloth or potholders provided in kitchen   No dishwasher detergent was provided  Grout needs to be cleaned in the shower  rug in the bedroom had visible stains 
661721280,Check in process was a good way to get your key however when we were at the kiosk we entered our code to retreive our key and got a message saying  the code was not correlated with a key  after talking with   zencity representitives and setting us back    minutes  at least  we were able to use an extra key and fob  Aside from the check in process  our stay was quiet while we were in the apartment  We never heard our neighbors except for the occasional door closing  The building itself smelled of marijuana  Although this isnt the hosts problem it still influenced our stay  The location is in a great area of St  Louis with it being in the central west end  A lot of places to go and forest park was very close  In closing  i would rent here again  The negatives would not deter me from considering this place in the future  The key to the apartment i booked was not available  It took an extra    minutes to get the extra key and   different people through zencity 
671648242,Zencity place was overall a decent stay  The parking could be a bit challenging depending on the day   the place wasnt as clean as expected however it was still a decent stay    zencity was very friendly and straight to the point  Hey zencity it was overall a decent stay  It was just a little dirty in certain areas like the bedroom    living room  However we enjoyed our stay  Thank you for everything The night stands in the bedroom were a bit dirty   so was the bed itself along with the couch in the living room 
659087952,The   th floor apartment offered a great western facing view of Forest Park and was surprisingly spacious   One elevator was broken which occasionally made for longer waits to get up and down  The kitchen was well stocked for prepping meals  and the Whole Foods just down the street was a great source of ingredients   The apartment has a clean minimalist look to it  although perhaps too much so   The bedroom walls were bare white and had no furniture aside from the low to the floor platform bed   A C was plenty adequate  and views from the rooftop at night were stellar   Frequent sirens can be heard due to nearby hospitals  but that is to be expected   Street parking only   Overall  a great Airbnb in a safe area that I would stay at again  One of the elevators was not working and the apartment was on the   th floor leading to long waits
667337689,A few missing light bulbs I think the unit had been neglected there were no trash bags or a key fob so going in and out was very inconvenient  I will say its worth the cost and a nice place 
666384105,Place was decent  The building an amenities are awesome  but the actual unit needs some  TLC Place smelt of mildew Place smelt of mildew  the shower doesnt drain  bathroom doors dont lock  tv remotes were dead  internet had to get reset   times 
601517438,You can expect a beautiful spotless home close to power and light  with a wonderful host as she provided breakfast foods  was a lifesaver     The only downfall about this place is the neighbor directly next to this home have a huge dog and never stops barking  you cant use the backyard cause the dog will go nuts and not stop  we even got woken up the next morning from the barking  since one of the rooms is directly next to the house its very loud  I enjoyed the home very much though and made for a good stay after the Super Bowl  Go Chiefs    I had said  shhhh   very respectfully  to the neighbors dog  on the right when directly facing house  while we were out back hanging out  since the neighbors had been on the front porch they were yelling the dogs name  after I had said shh the neighbor came to the backyard and said to the dog out loud so all of my friends heard  you dont have to be quiet honey   Im not sure if they know thats an air bnb home  but I just wanted to let you know about that  since I thought it was rude and not necessary  I really appreciate how beautiful and clean the home was  and thank you so much for the breakfast foods  You were lovely and made for a great night with my friends  THANK YOU    The neighbor in the house next has a huge dog that never stops barking  you cant use the backyard without the dog going crazy  without stopping  and unfortunately in the morning the dog woke all of us up with non stop barking  That was a big downfall but the house was beautiful  she made sure it was spotless and provided breakfast foods  I really enjoyed staying in this beautiful home  just truly wish it was quieter 
666519802,I found this place to be tidy  clean  and comfortable  It was perfect for my weekend away from kids  appreciated that it was quiet  yet near everything I needed to be without a car for the weekend too  Please be sure that your house cleaners keep check the bathroom window is securely closed after leaving  The window was left open in the bathroom so there were a lot of gnats mosquito types initially  but that was cleared up once it was closed  I look forward to visiting again 
667083818,Weve stayed in this apartment twice and would definitely book it again  Great building  quiet  beautiful location  The unit could stand more  and nicer  towels  as well as the pillows replaced  They were really flat  which is odd when the duvets are so nice  A coffee maker would also be a good addition  Otherwise  great place for our trips to Chicago several times a year  Love this building and plan to stay again  but the apartment needs a few items replaced  Doorperson didnt initially swipe us in to check in until we knocked repeatedly on glass  Nicer home comforts 
667067781,Great third floor apartment  Was there overnight heading back to Denver  Comfortable bed and kitchen  Thank you 
710615348,The apartment was nice  In a great location  Initially it was hard to find because its an unnumbered unit  It wasnt sparkling clean as there was debris under the bed and around the couch  The ceiling fan didnt work  Either they took the remote to limit use or its broken  It made it too hot to sleep comfortably  Thank you for sharing your space with us for the weekend  The apartment door didnt have a number and that wasnt listed in the check in directions  Most other units had numbers so looking around for     was a bit difficult  There was a lot of debris under the bed and around the couch  The ceiling fan wouldnt work  They either took the remote or it doesnt work at all  There was   light switch that didnt turn anything on  so that could be why the fan wouldnt work 
664640457,The location was great  safe   and a clean unit   The only issue was the fruit flies everywhere but we managed to make the best of it  Issues with the fruit flies
669654771,This apartment is very spacious and comfortable  Its tall ceilings and decoration make it stylish and in tone with the neighborhoods vibe  Great spot to enjoy the city  The apartament is great  Id just keep an eye on having it sparkling clean  For example the window frames and under the beds  Otherwise perfect 
706590891,Great location  
663015374,This experience was very unfortunate  Working in hospitality myself  from start to finish I did not feel like my comfort as a customer was placed at the forefront  I waited in the pouring rain for a delayed response of the check in details  The next morning there was shattering glass at  am right below our window due to the construction  Theres heavy road work AND construction happening right below the apartment that starts promptly at sunrise  The bathroom reeks of mold which is probably due to how old the building is  When I went to turn on the water  the entire handle fell off  The pipes were hissing and due to the handle literally falling off  it made it an incredibly difficult to just take a shower  Worse of all was Zencitys delayed and seemingly unconcerned response  basically saying I should have manage working with a broken shower on my own  For the price that their charging per night  it seems well within reason to expect a working shower and to be at least treated with a grain of care  Truly a disappointing experience  This experience was very unfortunate  Working in hospitality myself  from start to finish I did not feel like my comfort as a customer was placed at the forefront  I waited in the pouring rain after reaching out once I booked for check in details since it was passed  pm  The response came in about       mins later which generally might not be in issue but as a traveler in the middle of a pandemic  it left me waiting  drenched in the rain  The next morning there was shattering glass at  am right below our window due to the construction  Obviously not within your control but I do feel you should have a disclaimer to your guests that theres heavy road work AND construction happening right below the apartment  The bathroom reeks of mold which is probably due to how old the building is  When I went to turn on the water   the entire handle fell off  I did try to latch it back on to at least take a shower but the knob was too difficult for me to turn on my own  the pressure and temperature would fluctuate because I couldnt get a good handle on it and the pipes were hissing the entire time  Regardless of anything  you charge your guests      to be their own plumbers  Worst of all  is the delayed and minimal response and effort to even being helpful or wanting to satisfy your customer  Instead you say that I shouldve managed  not having an easy accesible shower in the morning  I stand that as I guest  it is not unreasonable to expect a working shower and at the very least your response in the world of hospitality  should be that of wanting to accommodate  It begs the question  why name yourself se city if this is an experience your comfortable giving to your guests 
659102740,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
669933110,I wish I could say I enjoyed my stay   Lets start with the good  The location is awesome   Just a short uber or even walk from downtown  and there are bike rentals   mins away so I rented a bike and biked to the museums and around Chicago  There is also a great Thai place STEPS from the building   Bed   The bed was quite comfy  like other reviewers say   Price   Obviously this is a cheaper listing in the area  so thats nice   Now for the bad      First off  walking in to this airbnb is like walking into a pre owned vehicle owned by a smoker    Maybe no one had recently smoked in there  but the whole place had a horrible smokey odor  Ironically there were TWO no smoking signs in the space      Second  there were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been cleaned for some time  Huge buildup of dust and dirt etc in the corners of the room  baseboards and cracks in the stove had food in them  These things made me question how well cleaned the rest of the space was   Third  the tub   shower had very little water pressure and took a long time to get hot  and every time you shower the drain backs up after about   mins of running the water  so you have to stand with your feet in disgusting shower drain back flow while you try to clean yourself    Finally  the bedroom also had top sheet   Only a duvet  Since most of the time a duvet doesnt get washed every guest  this was an additional gross factor    Last  you should know that street cleaners and construction vehicles of various kinds might wake you up in the morning  This might be seasonal  but while I was there at about  am every morning there was some kind of beeping construction or city vehicle that slowly drove by the building  Because the AC unit is in the window  it lets all the sound in    Oh and one more thing   Host says there is street parking in the listing  I attempted to park on the street and wound up with a     ticket  Clearly I missed a sign somewhere and so this is not the hosts fault  but I wouldnt stay here if you intend on having a car  There were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been cleaned for some time  Corners of the room  baseboards  cracks in the stove had food in them etc  These things made me question how well cleaned the rest of the space was  In addition  the tub   shower backed up after about   mins of running the water  meaning you had to stand with your feet in disgusting back flow while you showered  The bedroom also had no top sheet   Only a duvet  Since most of the time the duvet doesnt get washed every guest  this was an additional gross factor  I couldnt enjoy my stay because the whole place smelt like cigarettes and felt dirty  The price was good  but it needed to be clean and smell decent 
718866441,The place was quite nice   If you dont want to live in the downtown hustle but still close to downtown this is a perfect spot   There were lots of parking space available  The place was clean  and nice   The apartment Fob wasnt working at all to enter the building  and the neighbours were loud   So if looking for a quite night after a long day  this might not be the place   Overall the stay was okay  not the best of Zen city places Ive stayed  I had to wait for an hour before I could check in
668640309,Looks like the picture bathroom needs a deep cleaning
668845239,Quiet neighborhood  Airbnb looks just like the pictures   spacious and comfy    Pillows need to be updated  quite flat and worn out   Other than that  it was an excellent AIRBNB  Parking is free  but it may take a while to find if its on a weekend  Recommend this location  Thanks for the stay  Not sure if staff is aware   theres quite a few fruit flies in the kitchen  I know theyre hard to remove  but we tried our best to not leave any food out as well
716085187,I would not recommend this air bnb owner gave   men our codes to get into our air bnb to fix the heat but never notified us and we didnt have heat for   days on our extended day which was the   th day of our stay they decided to fix it we were freezing holes in the sheets  Rug linty boiler room was leaking  Forks and spoons were very dirty not like we were going to use them anyways but still HORRIBLE The key was hard to unlock we had to knock on neighbors door several times and also contacted the host multiple times during our stay  There was holes in the sheets like cigarettes holes   We didnt have heat at all for   days stay on our extended stay the  th day they decided to let   men we didnt know in our bnb he gave them our code without telling us as we are returning back to the air bnb the men are coming out of the apartment  Unprofessional as hell  The boiler room was leaking all the way to the bedroom floors and now they are trying to charge me for damages what damages  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
666328607,Nice place  direction to get in were wrong  After using access code to enter building  you cannot walk through door down the hall  This door requires a key fob  which is not stated in directions  To bypass door you need to go down the stairs towards the gym and get to the elevator to get you to the  rd floor  Need to update directions for check in  After you enter code at outside front door you cannot go through door down the hall  This door requires a fob  Only had access by going down the stairs by the gym to access elevator
665131130,Just keep looking  There was no way to call or text the host  Air bnb messages went unanswered  The parking spots out front are not an option  Find a garage  Will never stay at another Zencity property 
718371497,Overall the place was fine   Had minor issues with the ceiling leaking water through the ceiling fan It was very difficult to get someone on the phone when I was having difficulties The first two days water was leaking from the ceiling through the ceiling fan which soaked my bed and had me scared to turn on the lights
671251895,Nice place and great location We werent able to clean up how we wanted with only one garbage bag 
719199145,smh
703318549,Overall a fine stay for someone who does not mind feeling a little trapped and dirty  Yeah I got something to say to mr DM the cleaner  The sheets were not washed before we got there and had stains and smelled like a cheap ladys perfume     Sheets had stains and perfume smells as if they hadnt been washed between guests
587203310,Overall very decent place  Check in was easy and well detailed  The space was stylish with plenty of room  Full kitchen  Bed was super comfy  Only issues were some small stains on a hand towel and bed duvet  Well worth the price  Thanks for hosting us  There were smallish brown stains on a face towel and the white duvet on the bed   All other areas were super clean and organized 
711899265,No comment When the Lock Screen failed the customer service was less than expected  Eventually we did get response but clearly they were unprepared for the problem 
711277021,Was nice  Check in was the only thing not so smooth  but was resolved pretty quickly 
665430469,The place was nice  We had a little trouble with the check in and were never provided key fobs for the unit  but it wasnt a major problem 
706730470,I would stay again  Parking is a little wonky  I give it the thumbs up  Thank for the seamless stay   Great place  Parking was a little wonky 
704692845,Awesome Stay       except my fobs would not work to get into the building  or use the elevator  and it was embarrassing to ask people to let me in  then when I told  Zencity about it  no help
702994538,Apartment was comfortable and located in a great spot  Would absolutely rent again  A couple of small cleanliness issues but good value and easy communication  Apartment was nice and building was very quiet  Thanks very much  Zencity  Apartment was comfortable and located in a great spot  Would absolutely rent again but shower curtain smelled really bad and dirty dishes were unsettling  Made me wonder what else in the apartment was not clean  Front burners on stove do not light for some reason  Apartment was still nice and building was very quiet  Bathroom shower curtain was so musty that it could be smelled into the living room area and made showering very unpleasant  Every dish I used in the kitchen was visibly very dirty  bits of food and greasy residue  and needed to be washed well before use 
719199265,There were hairs in the bed and shower  the ceiling fan in the bedroom didnt work  the lighting in the bathroom is horrible  the dishwasher had an awful smell and could smelt while sitting on the couch  there were fake finger nails broken on the side of the bed on the floor and crumbs in the bed  The lock on door was broken and we had to stick it back onto the door to make it work properly  It took us    minutes to figure out that was the problem  The location is great though  The cleanliness of the apartment was not good at all  Free coffee would be nice to set out for guests  The room was unmarked  No room number was posted outside the door  There were hairs in the bed and shower  the ceiling fan in the bedroom didnt work  the lighting in the bathroom is horrible  the dishwasher had an awful smell and could smelt while sitting on the couch  there were fake finger nails broken on the side of the bed on the floor and crumbs in the bed  The lock on door was broken and we had to stick it back onto the door to make it work properly  It took us    minutes to figure out that was the problem  The location is great though  Average communication
713286175,Very awesome space and and even more awesome company  
717391286,This place is what you would expect  Everything was clean and in place  However  there was only one towel for the week long stay which I found to be pretty gross  The air was stale and almost smelled of cigarettes  And the    digit long code made getting in and out of the door ridiculous  Not to mention the verbal code alongside the code needed to enter before you even got in the facility  Parking is stupid  so be prepared to walk  I would suggest offering more towels for stays longer than   days  Only having one towel for a week was disgusting  It smelled like smoke in the room like someone used to smoke cigarettes and it was still on the walls  Either that or the air was stale  Multiple entrances made getting in very difficult  Plus a    digit code to get in your door is ridiculous plus with your hands full nearly impossible  Trash parking and multiple entrances made this difficult 
715571860,Fantastic space and an incredible value  WiFi was fine for small task like streaming music and FaceTime calls  I would strongly advise you to find an alternative if you plan to stream movies or complete work stuff  Little communication on   after check out  Most messages are canned responses  The neighborhood is being revitalized and features a mix of all incomes and backgrounds  This could be intimidating for people not used to city   urban life 
706937408,Cute place on the plaza Thanks for the stay  I enjoyed the space
584204094,Must be for those who have no trouble with stairs  Helpful if youre well versed on recycling  It is quaint and welcoming  Nice for large size families Dusty
711271754,Great space  Clean   quiet  Check in was a bit difficult and parking was difficult but otherwise it was perfect Thank you  My stay was amazing  I did have a hard time getting into the building I would definitely recommend maybe using one of the little lock boxes to give your guests access instead of all the codes  It got a bit too confusing luckily someone let me in  The process to check in was super difficult because of the time limit to get in the door and to the elevator for it to work Parking is street parking so you have to pay or walk back from a parking garage
452167326,This apartment is great for larger groups  lots of space and beds  Its also very easy to find and get into  My main complaint is that it was not very clean  There was hair all over the bathrooms and bedrooms when we got there  Brian however was very quick to respond to me and made sure I knew if he was going to be unable to respond for a little bit  Great host  great space but just needs a deep clean  Hi Brian Im not sure if youre aware but the apartment was quite dirty when we got there  There was hair all over the bathroom and dried chunks of something on the bedspread  The floor was also covered in dirt and very obviously had not been mopped in quite some time since my socks turned black after walking on it  I know you were in London so you didnt see the place after it had been cleaned but it didnt seem like it had been cleaned hardly at all  You may want to reconsider your housekeeper  It was very dirty and there was nothing stocked in the apartment at all aside from a few pieces of silverware 
485306924,The place is great for large groups  the space is very roomy and open to not feel on top of each other  But sadly the place wasnt very clean as they had a large group trash it before us  there was only   towels for    people for two nights  We had to make a target run for towels and rags  Overall great location  great parking  and could be a great space and value with a few fixes  Also if you love Italian food  we highly recommend Piazza Bella its walking distance  For the value I would have that place deeped cleaned  touch up  the paint  some of the doors dont close  the lack of towels and rags for the amount it sleeps each nights is very low  and inconvenient  I understand you had people trash it before us but thats not our problem  Arrived at check in time at   and the cleaning was still cleaning until      pm If it was cleaned  had proper amount of towels and rags for the amount it sleeps each night that would be great  Instead we had to purchase some 
673955924,The    Penn units are luxurious and with a great location towards the Plaza   walking distance   It has a lot of amenities but I was only able to use the gym due to COVID    even though  all the amenities are open   They assign you a private parking so you dont have to leave your car outside   I found the apartments are in a safe zone and the building has personnel checking out people that comes in  At my arrival to the apartment  I noticed the COVID    cleaning protocol wasnt employed   Under the couch there was a takeout sushi lid  the bathroom had hair residues in the cabinet and towel closet   I had to take care of the cleaning myself  The apartments are great  the problem is the Zencity Co  as the hosting entity  I had an accident at my unit and first it was a challenge to communicate with Zencity and when they did communicate  they tried to relocate me to a place that I previously told them was unsafe    Meanwhile they where handling the damages caused to the unit by the accident  I had to move for   weeks and pay for hotel stays while they were trying to get an available unit for me    They never got the safe unit I asked and stalled the process of finding one   Because my stay was time sensitive  I had to book another Airbnb  All because I wasnt provided an alternate option or accommodation in a safe location by Zencity   Thus  I ended up having to pay for   Airbnbs and a hotel room at once because they didnt provide a timeline on the repairs or even communicating what was being done   At one point  Airbnb had to become involved in the process   It has been one of the worst experiences Ive had with an Airbnb host  In COVID    times there is a CDC  protocol on how to handle the cleaning   It wasnt followed when I arrived to the apartment  At the moment I let them know and they apologize for it  Zencity management is very difficult to reach    I had an accident at their apartment an I quickly notified them but they answered   days later when the emergency was already being dealt with   I consider that as an unprofessional behavior  If you a have little kids be sure to rent a   Bedroom apt from the same building which has a bathtub as well as shower   Having a bathtub with a shower in the property will increase the value of the apartment   Also for guests  it would be good to have a balcony with maybe   chairs and a little table to be able to admire the wonderful view you have towards the pool at night 
701771886,Super cute building  great location  overall really good quality stay  It was a really lovely place  We were a bit disappointed  especially in these times that the room had not been vacuumed and there was still dirt in the shower from the person before us  Unfortunately it looked as though it had not been cleaned since the last person  There were sequins all of over the floor and dirt in the shower 
668121920,Nice place  very spacious  The kitchen was a little dirty  the sink had food bits everywhere and so did the included plates and silverware  but overall very nice 
666812850,My girlfriend and I stayed here for her surprise birthday trip  The unit itself was everything  the description gave  One issue I noticed was that it was not throughly cleaned  but overlooked it  With it being a basement ground level pedestrians walking pass the unit can look directly inside when the blinds are opened  The mattress also felt old and sunken in  in the middle  The major issue came the last night at approx            pm when we returned from dinner  My girlfriend being pregnant had to use the restroom as soon as we entered  While using the restroom she seen a mouse run across the laundry room floor and into the bedroom  I didnt believe her until it ran from the bedroom into a closet  We immediately went outside  attempted to call the host several times  and leave voicemails  No response    I then emailed them  which they replied pretty quick  I advised them of the situation and that we need to stay somewhere else for the final night  They were able to get us into another unit   floors up  Before that we had to take all belongings into and down the hallway  checking to make sure other mice didnt get inside our things  We finally got upstairs and I did another walk through  I noticed this unit wasnt throughly cleaned either  The light switch for the kitchen and tv outlet were wired together  So the kitchen light had to be on to watch tv  The washing machine was also broken  with a full drum of  stale water inside  I contacted the host the next day about being compensated something for having to move out so late with a pregnant girlfriend for the rodent issue  then to get upstairs to a unit with broke appliances and partially cleaned and still havent heard anything back  The cleaning woman actually came in the checkout morning promptly at    am to clean both units  I told her the situation and she seemed nonchalant as of this happened before  Zencity did inbox and advise they would fix the issue with the washing machine  But that was it  When it came to  the rodent issue it was thanks for letting us know   Im not sure if pest control came out or not I feel like the unit was cleaned for the next upcoming guest and that was it  The location was great  close to downtown  I definitely would not be staying here again though and would not be gking through Zencity  Good luck If a customer call  call them back and dont refer to inboxing especially during emergency situations  Attempted to call  but no one called back
669102004,The location is ideal if you want to walk to Country Club Plaza to enjoy the shops and restaurants  It was frustrating as the key fob to access parking did not work  It would also be nice to add bath soap for the shower 
669381771,Overall I enjoyed my stay In the second guess bathroom there were flys coming out the drain
669099783,Just what I needed  though not the exact apt pictured  
620785771,DO NOT STAY HERE  AND READ THIS REVIEW  I dont really know where to start with this review  I have never had a bad experience with any stay on AIR B B till now      First this place is filthy  I am talking dirty floors  dirty counters  Considering we are in an actual HEALTH PANDEMIC at the moment this is unacceptable  The  cleaners  and I say cleaners very loosely considering they did not actually clean  Tidied up no trash yes  at first glance it looked clean  Until you touched the counters  felt the dirt under your feet  opened the fridge and get hit with an old rotten food smell  Or just look at anything for longer than a minute   Stains everywhere  loved the big questionable stain on the master bedrooms carpet   sticky  overall  just absolutely disgusting  Not to mention the dirty BANDAID left in the master bedroom  I wish I would have brought with me cleaning supplies  but I did not expect to clean at a location with a     cleaning fee   Onto the couch situation and the kitchen chair   As soon as I step into the place  I noticed the couch  It was a bit lopsided thought this odd    on closer inspection the couch was broken  The legs of the couch were not installed properly or installed by someone who has never put together basic furniture one even with a crack  I immediately reached out to the renters regarding both the cleanliness the couch   chair   Received no aid in the matter just a  we know    also they knew the kitchen chair is broken as well  I expressed my need for actually working furniture since this is a basic necessity and I mean BASIC  I even asked for tools to fix it myself  No reply  Go figure  I actually had to flip the couch myself and attempt to jimmy rig it with a knife  I actually did better then the person who put this together Ill tell you that much   I didnt try to fix their kitchen chair   Maybe I should of since they clearly dont care   Lastly  we have the patio   You see that nice patio offered in the listing hell its even in the name    well guess what you cant access it  The door does not open to that area  So  you can waive at it from the couch   If you want to do some handywork first   Honorable mention  The lack of a clean sponge or dish soap in the kitchen  I did find a dirty sponge that had actual dirt on it and dishwasher gel  guess this is better than nothing  loved the empty hand soap dispenser it really added to the ambiance of the stay  I also have pictures of all of this   Followed by pictures of how I left the stay just as my own insurance  You can never be to safe 
707475841,Great  stylish location in the heart of Hyde Park  Would stay here again  We had a lovely time and it couldnt have been a lovely weekend  The only thing was that our FOB wasnt working so it was a bit of an inconvenience  However  the front desk staff was very responsive and helpful Our FOB wasnt working the entirety of our stay
659132343,Its a ok place to stay  We do travel a lot so we are always trying new places  The apartment I feel like it was a little overpriced for the quality of the amenities and also no window to circulate air  the building has a lot of dogs and it smells like dog urine in everywhere  But the pool is great and the gym is ok as well  I loved the people living there  they are very friendly   Zencity helped with everything I need it  but again  a little bit overpriced compared to big cities like Chicago and nys apartments  Thank you for hosting us  We enjoyed our stay a lot  but I didnt know that it didnt have windows  So the air in the house doesnt circulate   Also the internet has a very poor connection  not fusible for remote workers like us   I think they should price less for the quality of the apartament in general   But I enjoyed the pool and the gym a lot
718884193,This is not the first time this has happened  When I arrived the key pad wouldnt let me in  I attempted to contact and was unable to reach anyone or have anyone return my calls  I ended up having to get a hotel 
718110161,Superb placeEXCEPT   the sheets and towels were disgusting  After sleeping one night on the bed  I crashed right after I got in   I developed a significant skin infection in the back of my head the next day    staph infection  Im a dr  trust me   I knew it must have been dirty sheets bedding  took a look after work and thats exactly what it was    Maybe the cleaning people were tired short handed   etc  this was inexcusable   I would only stay here again if they got a new cleaner cleaning company   i spent      for a damn skin infxn  Im trying not to be harsh because what Im pissdd about isnt your fault  nor could you have know  About it     I make that clear in  my review  But the towels and bedsheets were disgusting  definitely not cleaned   The house looked like it was cleaned  swept vacuumed  etc    but that couch  the bed pillows comforter sheets were never cleaned  The towels smelled repulsive  Im sure you pay good money to have it cleaned and thats why Im not blaming you directly  but I did pay        for a few nights  and all I got was a staph infection on the back of my head from using your pillows    which is painful and disgusting  probably didnt look so good during my trial run as a physician nearby     Whoever your cleaning people are should be fired immediately  I could care less that the pots and pans had dust dry water marks all over them  or even that the towels looked dirty    but Im  never going to expect anyone to not clean the sheets and comforter    when I realized I had a bacterial infection on day    before going to bed   I went back to look at the bed and pillows  There was short curly black hairs all over the place  and smelled like body odor   I was disgusted
547104856,Brians listing was adequate for our stay and worked well with   bedrooms for my group  Could use a good deep clean to be   stars  Truthfully we were disappointed with the state of the Airbnb from cleanliness to creaking floors and confusing light switches  Youve got a lot of great potential with the place  Bathroom especially had little hairs like from shaving all over the floor and baseboards  shower floor was gross and in need of a deep clean  The beds were falling apart  the floors are very creaky  and it didnt feel as luxurious as youd want your Airbnb to feel  Id recommend better towels  bed frames  and linens 
446112673,Beautiful space and great location 
123766565,what a great price for the location  super comfy bed and although the building and entrance are not five star that should not be a deterrent for picking this place  Excellent communication  and simple check in with specific details being very clear  what a great location to downtown for the price  super comfortable bed and close to everything  the entrance is a bit dingy but that should not be a decision making criteria if you are here for the location and value 
717614670,Excellent location We sent the cancellation as much to indicate that we didnt use the  nd night   Not because we expected some form of refund   My doctor appointments were over so we headed home   Hope that wasnt confusing    
563971951,This was a very comfortable stay  Would use again  When we arrived  the lockbox code didnt work  My partner was trapped outside in freezing cold struggling to contact the host who was able to tell him to use a different lockbox  I say unclear instructions because the first lockbox should have been correct  but the contingency plan should have been known ahead of time too  Dangerous in Hyde park to be stranded outside  especially at a late hour  Struggled to contact host regarding above snafu
563330964,Had a great stay in this Ukrainian village apartment   Dark Matter and Bite Cafe were relatively close on N  Western Ave and a great place to have Brunch or grab a cup of coffee   Hosts were extremely communicative and promptly answered any questions we had   Easy to grab a Lyft or Uber to any of the neighboring neighborhoods   On warmer days definitely an easy walk to Wicker Park which has a lot to offer  About a    minute walk to the Blue Line which can get you to other neighborhoods worth exploring  Thanks again for being a great host during our trip to Chicago   Really great area and pretty close to Wicker Park and easy to get a Lyft or Uber to other hoods   I would say the only thing that would make your place even better is to have coffee on the premises  The Airbnbs weve stayed in at the past normally keep it on hand  You have so many great coffee brewers there why not leave some for your visitors as an introduction  During the cold winter months  it would be a great addition if you want to have a cup before heading out  Its a little touch but can go a long way  Best  Justin   Cara Although there were great coffee places in the area and seeing how its not really easy to carry coffee on a carry on  especially during cold weather months in Chicago it would have been nice to have coffee at the place  Most Airbnbs we have stayed have coffee   Its a little thing but can go a long way 
604550827,Great location  Smooth check in   check out  Thick dust noted on vent in hallway  Small stain on a couple of sheets and duvets 
716074271,Overall the loft was amazing  perfect location and beautiful space  However the night that we drove in from Denver to check in to the Airbnb we followed the instructions to obtain the key and the key was not there  So late at night we had to find a hotel because we could not access our Airbnb  The host   company did not even apologize for the lack of their communication  Would love to stay in that loft again the next time Im in St  Louis but dont think I will do to the confusion and the stress that we experienced during check in  Extremely disappointed in the customer service of this company not once did we receive an apology for not having the key for us on our first night we were supposed to stay in the loft  Drove from Denver to St  Louis  in a snow storm so got in late and followed the check in Instructions and there was no key  So the first night we were suppose to stay in the loft did not happen  Very slow responses and didnt even apologize for not providing the key for us 
446038503,In a pretty old building in a nice neighbourhood  The elevators can be cumbersome   they dont work unless BOTH doors are completely shut  Otherwise a pretty solid place for the price 
101669347,Great place  very accommodating host 
602093944,Very clean and great location 
561053221,Communication was smooth and check in was easy  It was a great place for a short business trip  My biggest issue with this place is that when I got in  the heat was blasting and it wasnt easy to figure out how to turn it down  and the window in the bedroom was sealed shut  Zencity was very responsive over messages and sent someone the next day to take a look and adjust the heater  but the first night was sweltering  The sink hadnt been properly cleaned and there were little hairs  as if someone had been shaving  left around  If it had been properly cleaned and if the heating worked better 
601142297,The space is much larger than youd imagine from the pictures  There are a lot of stairs but who doesnt like a good workout  Honestly didnt mind it  The location was great  THANK you for a wonderful stay Clogged shower
621041481,Great place to stay in the city 
560051864,Great place  stylish apartment and a very comfortable bed  However  the heating was not working in the apartment and it was freezing the whole time inside even though the digital regulator was set to   F but I also failed to notify Zencity during my stay  The heating in the apartment did not work at all  On our arrival day there was someone in the apartment fixing the heating and said it was all set but during my three days there it was freezing in the apt 
556036498,Very clean and relaxed  super perfect for long long layovers  Thank you  it was perfect
554588611,Great location for the price  Our rides to comedy and shedd were about     each  There is a great little restaurant for breakfast nearby called Janiks  great service and food  Street parking was easy  We loved our stay and would recommend this apartment  Well appointed and great space to relax  We loved our time at your place  It was nice to be able to walk to local restaurants  Parking was easy and the location is great for the price  Loved that there was a french press and kettle  The fresh flowers were a nice touch as well  May I suggest a replacement of the slats that were broken in the bed support across from the bathroom  I had to lift the mattress to try and fix it and saw that there were some missing and one replaced with a board not thick enough 
553216492,Great place  and walkable to convention center  The lock at the next door neighbor was beeping loudly every   sec for at least   hrs  I told several people who worked there about it but nothing was ever done  It was loud enough to be heard in the apartment  which made for an uncomfortable last   nights stay  the lock system is finicky
551976453,Great location  Looks just like the pictures  The mattress is really really hot  I think its probably the mattress cover  Also the bed wasnt made   The fitted sheet wasnt pulled over the foot of the bed and sheets were tangled all night 
116455160,A spacious  simple studio with awesomely high ceilings right in the middle of everything  this was a great place to stay  If you want to be connected to the touristy areas of the city and yet feel at home  this is one to save  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  Additional comments   The bath tub is not draining well  and the overhead light is out   The overhead in the closet is also not working   
595660184,The location was great  The walls to the adjoining apartment were quite thin so you could hear the neighbors who were fighting and swearing  Someone left their phone in the apartment so then they came to retrieve it and it was disturbing 
297888881,We had a great stay at Chris place  
308099562,Kept well cleaned  comfortable living area  Loved the view from windows and the feel of the city  I just wish there was a AC unit in the bed room because it was a little to toasty for my liking  But other then that cute small apartment I would      recommend   Hey I had a great stay one thing I might suggest is getting a fan or something in the bedroom for more airflow because it was a little warmer then my liking  Also maybe having a nicer looking shower curtain although not a necessity it would make the bathroom look a little better  Other then that I live the area and the look and comfortably of your apartment   
116338782,Great location  Bars and restaurants within walking distance  easy to shop on Michigan and drop off your bags   Thanks for the stay  the location was great  Only suggestion if you have a cleaner  the bathroom could use a once over  There was hair all over the shower and floor  Thanks again   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower  towels and linens  bathroom 
559259205,Fantastic location  Great building  Enjoyed the game room in lobby  Area walkable  Just good to know that Washer  dryer not in room but rather in basement of building  If you need to sleep in darkness  bring eye covers as the window blinds let in light  All in all would stay there again  but would know to bring my own pillows as theirs were really uncomfortable Thank you would suggest better pillows  and blackout curtains
113124024,Very nice host  Helpful  flexible   quickly to respond  i loved staying at Chriss appartments  i stayed at   of them in the same building  because of their perfect location  very central    convenience  everything u need in a neat charming place   Also   Chris provides a few snacks in the kitchen      Highly recommended   
721977965,Elevator and doors didnt work at first  but once everything was fixed it was a great place and great trip  Thank you for everything  Control system was down
660624716,Nice quiet home with charm and nice upgrades   Good beds   Centrally located and good TV and WiFi access   Would book again but would bring your own food and supplies I have already thanked Slawik and gave recommendations for amenities   I forgot to say the shower rod was not secure and fell down on two guests   Also used and expired food in fridge
112164432,Chris apartment was perfect for a weekend visit to Chicago  Amazing location and the apartment was very spacious and clean  Chris was very responsive leading up to my visit and answered any questions I had  I would stay here again for sure      
106860630,The apartment is spacious and clean and in a great location  other than the actual building entry and stairs to the apartment  which are really derelict  We enjoyed our stay and found Chris to be responsive during the booking process  There is essentially no natural light in the kitchen and living area  the bedroom has plenty  so if youll be hanging out in the apartment at all during the day  it feels somewhat cavelike  We were happy there and would recommend it nonetheless  
301745969,Great location in Hyde Park right by the Lake   mi from the Loop  Clean and utilitarian  Downside is the high cost       a night for two nights  noisy a c  only one key set which requires going down   floors to let in partner  There were no WiFi or other instructions  had to email mgr  The Zencity company rep was reasonable enough for someone with no direct connection to the space  hes a good manager for an expensive crypto hotel chain with fairly crappy service   Note that this form doesnt allow for subtleties like noisy a c no WiFi instructions  not no a c or WiFi per se   The Zencity company rep was reasonable enough for someone with no direct connection to the space  hes a good manager for a crypto hotel chain with fairly crappy service      a night for a     sq ft studio with a noisy air conditioner  no WiFi or other instructions  no reserved parking and no bulb in the floor lamp bespeaks an out of touch ripoff corporation using airbnb as a front  
721627586,n a food was left in oven from the people before  hangers on the ground and dishes were in the dishwasher still
297859232,Everything was great  Only issue was the water heater tank stopped working and it took   days to replace it so we didnt had hot water  We had an issue with the water heater tank and took   days to sorted it out 
103917978,I do not want this post to come off as negative because i would stay at Chriss place again but i know that some people might have been disappointed  Lets start with the positives    Chris did a great job communicating and the place was very clean just like the photos      I felt safe however i know my parents would have felt nervous  The building is suppose to be secure but the back gate leading to the door was open half of the time because of the garbage trucks and businesss located on the first level of the apartment  The door leading up to the apartment was also propped open most of the time with garbage from the business below  The only view is of the dumpsters in the alley and the fire escape    The Kitchen could use some help  It is full stocked with dishes  but only   pots total  Only one burner on the stove top works and the oven dishwasher do not work either  So really the kitchen can be used for the full size fridge for your leftovers    Again i hate sounding so negative when i really did like this place i just know there are some up tight people i would not suggest this place to  it was really nice being so close to the red line and being able to easily navigate to all of Chicagos major attractions downtown   There isnt anything the host can do to add value  When i was comparing the place to hotels it comes pretty close in price however his building is not very secure  The only thing that i could tell some people would have an issue with is the entrance to the apt is through the back near all the dumpsters  I saw several very large rats the first night coming to the apartment  Also your view is of the dumpsters or the building and fire escape  
584720216,I liked the location  It around a ton of places to eat and shop  Apartment clean but not much for sound proof  You can hear neighbors above you  talking in the halls and when they come in and out as well throughout all hours of the night 
99102208,Great experience  my only qualm was the check in as there was no key present but it was resolved  The place is a regular city studio which is a little bigger than I had imagined  It was really really clean in a cool trendy neighborhood of Gold Coast  Had everything I needed for my night  AppleTV  WiFi  everything you have in a hotel   Word of advice if you are driving  parking may not be the best as there is no free parking    day parking enforced from  am   pm and yes I got a ticket   Overall a great time at this studio and literally two blocks from the CTA Red line and shops  restaurants  Starbucks and the Farmers Market on Saturdays    
544630854,This is a clean and comfortable studio  Easy to catch a bus downtown  Plenty of food coffee in the neighborhood 
444236283,Very clean  more space than I expected  quiet  relaxing  close to good restaurants  Only bad was the parking  It was raining so it really sucked walking so far to get to the car 
544268452,Great location  Great location and exactly what it was advertised to be on the site  Had trouble using the keypad entry  Instructions should have stated to put your finger on the black glass until it lights up  Host did not respond to a call about it  Some mold on bathroom window 
443790982,Big apartment with good amenities  Flatscreen TV comes with Netflix  Amazon prime   Sling which is great  A bunch of food within walking distance  Only downside is that the old fashion heaters dont work to well  Thanks for having me
82806476,The host had great communication before  during  and after our stay  The location was perfect for our trip to Chicago  Thanks again  
720076397,Clean and comfy apartment  Nice location with walkable distance to any restaurants or shops or the public transportation  Just have some troubles when accessing the building  but Zencity did follow up and resolve the problem  Nice stay overall  unable to access the building
543427152,The location of this apartment cant be beat  You can walk easily to Lincoln Park  We loved touring the Lincoln Park Zoo and walking to the lake  The neighborhood is wonderful  restaurants  coffee shops and fun  unique shopping  Very safe and walkable  We were able to walk to Old Town for nightlife of even more restaurants and Second City   The apartment is basic  yet comfortable and spacious  It was a bonus having a second half bath  The building is older and you should be comfortable with this style  The value is excellent given the incredible location  having two bedrooms and plenty of space   ZenCity is very responsive and checks in to make sure all is well  Check in process was smooth  If you want an upscale location at a reasonable price  hard to find in Chicago   this is the apartment for you  fantastic location  Easy  check in good communication  suggest more cleaning in bathroom 
443704036,Zencity was a great host  I would definitely stay in one of their properties again  We encountered an issue during our stay  but their staff responded quickly to rectify it  This review is in reference to the original booking at      S Blackstone  It was clean on the surface but not when you looked closely  Ex  There were food wrappers crumbs under the bed  The kitchen table had not been moved when the floor was mopped  there was sticky pink juice under the table base  The issue with cockroaches is clearly a problem with the building  but you could do a better job of sealing up the spaces within the unit so they cant come in  After the cockroach issue  I really appreciate you being accommodating and providing an alternative building for the remainder of our stay  If we did not encounter cockroaches during our stay 
580397644,As we expected no surprises A little cheaper
443293427,Perfect place to stay Easy to get to and get around  Rooms are larger then expected which helped living out of suitcases   Would definitely come back and stay Only thing was one bedroom had a couple little pills  Not sure if pain related or illegal but didnt look that great and the couch seemed to be cleaned very recent to our arrival and could smell maybe spew or something that was caused to the couch maybe   But the smell did clear out a couple days later   Location great  Rooms big and spacious   Would come back
80225845,We had a fantastic stay in Chicago  the apartment was in a brilliant location  only a block away from magnificant mile  The apartment was spacious  the bed was very comfortable and the overall level of cleanliness was ok  Unfortunately the internet wasnt working on arrival which was frustrating as we had to wait until the next day to find WiFi whilst out to report the problem  but Collin sorted this problem very quickly once reported and we had internet by the second evening  There was scaffolding on the outside of the building  but we were never disturbed by any work  Whilst there was typical city noise into the evening  as the bedroom is set back from the street we were not disturbed  Overall an enjoyable stay all round  Thanks Would be handy for keys to be marked so dont have to guess every time entering building  Perhaps a collection of leaflets about points of interest in the city could help too  Bed sheet had few holes in it so could do with replacing 
77247525,This unit is definitely convenient  Very economical for the traveler with an itinerary that just needs a place to sleep and wash up between busy days  The furnishings are simple so make sure to bring your creature comforts if you need any  Collin is responsive  friendly and helpful  
76421041,Great location  but a bit noisey with proximity to W Ohio St and situated between   alleys  Apartment was very clean 
442501196,This apartment is in a great location   walking distance to local restaurants bars and a short Uber Lyft cab ride from West Loop Michigan Ave attractions  We were able to enjoy both the local neighborhood and downtown Chicago during our stay  The Zencity team makes check in out seamless and has very quick response times to any messages  Two bedrooms make it a great spot for two couples or a family with children  Overall great stay  Good location  comfortable space  quick response times and easy check in out  My only note is that I wish the place would have felt cleaner upon arrival  The sheets and bathroom did not look like they had been fully cleaned after the guest prior to our stay  I was able to get in touch with the host and they ensured me it had been cleaned  so may have been an issue with the cleaning service they used 
73355743,My husband and I spent the weekend in Chicago and really enjoyed the location of Collins apartment  We searched for a place and decided to book This apartment simply based on price and location  The apartment is located   blocks from Michigan Ave in the Magnificent Mile and   block from the Red Line train  It was extremely convenient for us since we took the train everywhere  Starbucks is also close by   The apartment is located on the second floor  Given that theres a nail salon  sandwich shop and Mexican restaurant on the first floor you cant hear or smell very much from the apartment  The apartment is clean and the bed was comfortable    Collin is extremely responsive and provided us with a lot of recommendations for restaurants and things to do    Keep in mind that this is an apartment and there are many neighbors  next door from all sides and above   Although you cant hear the noise from downstairs the walls are very thin   if you catch my drift    However  this wouldnt stop me from staying at Collins place again  Thank you for your hospitality 
534408359,I would definitely look elsewhere for an Airbnb because the value isnt here on this one  I paid      a night for the unit and it was misleading  The pictures make it seem like its so much more than what it actually is  For      a night youll be able to find a way better unit in the same area  Hey Chris  Im sorry but I cant leave a   star review  The Airbnb was a bit misleading and the price was outrageous for the area  I was confused by the price when I booked and had thought the entire thing was supposed to cost half of what it did       a night in that small   bedroom apartment is insane  I looked around to see if other Airbnbs or hotels even came close to that price and they didnt  The pictures of the unit are also a bit misleading and lead you to think that the unit is actually a lot larger than it really is  I would like some portion of my money back  For the price you definitely need to look elsewhere  This is a tiny   bedroom apartment right next to a few elementary schools  The pictures make this unit seem bigger than what it actually is  Parking is a nightmare as well 
532947225,Good  Carpet is needs to be replaced  Everything else was spotless  Too expensive for long term  The zencity chat support was not overly helpful 
440355864,Apartment is nice and big and clean  Problems I had were  Elevator did not work all the time  Internet Connection Problems Kitchen was ok but not the cleanest  Parking places hard to find but possible   Gym and pool were fine  Area is not the best to go out but safe  I would take it again because near to work and fine for living in    Stars  Internet did not work     of time  Elevator did not work all the time  Kitchen was not clean   Rest was ok  But I can give only   stars because of that  Kitchen was not the cleanest but it was ok for cooking  Southside is not the best area but it was safe  Elevators did not work all the time  long waiting time  Internet had problems but worked 
595199048,Sparkling clean apartment with exceptional touch of art Thank you for being a great host  the bedrooms needs more drawers   
556521459,Great place to stay with a great location  very clean and easy to check in and out  Used the gym while i was there  free wifi and did laundry  The bathroom smelled a bit like sewage the entire stay  Other than that  it was a very clean apartment with a great kitchen and living space  A dresser or another nightstand would be nice in the bedroom 
712260248,Sheets were clearly cleaned in the bedrooms  but the bathroom was filthy and shower was filled with bugs  Management was easy to communicate with and did send someone to clean  however the issue was not resolved  Would stay again if bathroom were properly cleaned  Consistent with my messaging  I would stay again if the bathroom were deep cleaned and exterminated  It was not clean at all  especially the shower 
613986863,Apartment was nice but bed wasnt made when I came in  the bathtub didnt have a stopper and the wifi was treacherously slow 
437531933,Ive stayed at a few Zencity places and have always been impressed by the cleanliness and decor of their spaces  However  I would not stay at this location again  It was much smaller than anticipated  which was not really a big deal   since it was just me and my boyfriend staying there  However  the place was not as clean as we expected  The living room was dusty and the rug needed to be vacuumed badly  Also  the shower curtain liner in the bathroom had someone elses hair on the bottom of it  Ive never had these issues with any of their other locations so it sucked to have to deal with it here  Other than that  the place was fine  Hello   Some of the suggestions have would be to dust thoroughly  The living room was pretty dusty and the rug needed a good vacuum  Also  the bathroom needed to be cleaned more thoroughly as well  The shower liner had someones hair on the bottom of it 
594026448,Perfect location and a cozy spot to spend the week 
437511268,The location of this space is great  Right across from the park  two blocks from a cute neighborhood street with restaurants  a coffee shop  bars  a nail salon  etc  The apartment is spacious and in a very safe building  doorman and extra key to access elevators   with cute decor and A C units in the living room and bedroom which I imagine are critical in the summer months  Easy to walk to from or catch an Uber or Lyft  Chris from Zencity was clear with instructions  easy to communicate with and fast to respond  I had a great stay here and would definitely look it up for another trip to St  Louis  Thank you so much for the great location and safe building to stay in  The apartment was great but there were a few touches I wish had been included  like a full length mirror and some cleanliness in the bathroom  hair and the tub   But I loved the location  I felt super safe with the doorman and the extra key code to elevators  etc  The apartment was spacious and quiet and great 
703795453,The place is quiet  the gasoline station is   minute from the building  You can go for a walk along the beach  Its the only things  that I liked about this place  There was hair everywhere in a flat  including the bed  And its not mine  because Im short haired man  and the hair was very long and brown black  It was on a carpet  in the bath  on a bad  The bottom right electric stove didnt work  The smell from air conditioning was disgusting  Please come to the flat  turn it on and smell it  I was lucky it was cold outside so i didnt use it  The door opens only after   p m  not a minute earlier
244767309,Good
598647000,The place was in a great location and it was absolutely beautiful  We only had a small problem with hair on the towels  so next time Ill pack my own 
589280546,ive used zencity multiple times during my stays in chicago  good location and decent price  this room is the best one ive stayed in based on how the room looks  couple things to be  weary  is parking can be difficult at night and the shower water pressure is not that great    will use Zencity properties again 
567095231,It was great place great area super comfy beds
589301511,Great apartment with a good chill vibe no issues regarding the host  Thank for the apartment it was very relaxing and joyful  The vibe was calm and no major issues were at play  Beds werent too clean but neat just a few dust 
707911689,Great location  Dirty kitchen with few utensils Messy kitchen with dishes and food in the sink and dirty dishes in the dish washer
276707831,Clean  convenient apartment in a really cool neighbourhood not far from the city   Thank you   I did really love the Hyde Park neighbourhood  Not a major issue but the labels had fallen off two of the three keys so it took some time initially to find which key was for which door  one key required for front door  one for corridor door  and one for apartment door  Communication was mostly very good and quick  I did find it a bit of a pain to get a text informing me that the air conditioner contractor was going to be in the apartment between noon and five on one of the two days I was there   It was inconvenient because I was hoping to have a nap after a redeye and didnt really want to go to sleep expecting a knock at the door to come in at any moment   I didnt have that nap as I was waiting for the contractor to come  and it turned out he didnt end up coming at all 
435135529,The place was extremely far away from Downtown  The whole place smelled moldy  the fan didnt work and the light switches were very hard to find  The place was extremely far away from Downtown  The whole place smelled moldy  the fan didnt work and the light switches were very hard to find 
192914676,Great location  The drawers in the bathroom do not function properly  You really should work out the Airbnb papers with the property management  It is highly uncomfortable to book and pay and then to receive the notification from you that received  Thanks  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements  Additional comments   Room is not officially AirBnB    
704693362,Good place with everything you need  Had a small issue checking in but it worked out    Super clean but was the power of the sent was pretty overpowering  The people above were super loud when they walked and the bedroom is not dark at all so if you are a light sleeper be aware 
434391389,Its a great location  With a beautiful view  I sent a long explanation earlier with my sincere and  hopefully  helpful suggestions    hope you got it   Its a great place and location  We didnt have our Airbnb password with us  and so couldnt ask several questions we had   I guess thats our fault  but because that can happen  more info should be included at the site 
203775367,Great location for U Chicago  Parking on street is fine in the day but difficult at night  Need a bedside table   Need more floor rugs  Need better parking advice for which streets to try  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  directions  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable 
702760724,Appartement spacieux et lumineux Merci pour votre r activit    r pondre et toute votre gentillesse en ayant accept  toutes nos demandes  Nous avons d  changer notre date darriv e et cela na pas  t  pris en compte dans la bo te pour acc der   la cl  Canap  tach   peinture du plafond qui se d tache du plafond    nettoyage assez sommaire  La vue est magnifique mais les vitres sont si sales    Des travaux m riteraient d tre faits pour rendre ce bel appartement plus attractif
434233420,great location   close to public transportation  neighbors were loud and apartment walls were thin  water pressure in the showers was awful  overall good value compared to other locations  there was some mold in the shower the water pressure in both showers was awful
621051773,Great location  comfortable
576454423,Very comfy beds with warm blankets  The space is a good place as home base when in Chicago  Highly recommend  The place was such a great location and warm and cozy for the winter season  A couple suggestions for improvement   The wifi doesnt work even after disconnecting and reconnecting the router  According to the nest thermostat  it hasnt been working for over a month now   The coffee machine doesnt work  Theres this notch on the machine under the dispenser that needs to click in place when the pot is under  We didnt realize it was broken until we tried to brew coffee and the machine overflowed  Also  including cream and sugar would be helpful  but thats a nice to have   Thank you again for sharing your space with us 
433450663,Simple Airbnb for travelers who are going to spend their time outside of the apartment  It does the job  Thanks for the clear communication  Apartment key could be updated  Takes a while to jiggle it open  Not sure the sheets were cleaned since the last visit
575269295,Great location  Comfy place  Walking distance to everything in Hyde Park  conveniently next to public transport  Just wish the water pressure and shower temperature was better   otherwise great place for good price  The water pressure is terrible in the shower and the temperature of the water wasnt very warm at all  For Chicago winters  it was a bit long and painful to shower under those circumstances next to a window w a draft  Otherwise great place  Need shower mat in bathroom  we had to use spare sheet we found in closet to avoid slipping around getting out of shower 
610929081,Took me a while to book this place but I couldnt stop looking at the listing  I dont consider Kansas City to be one of my favorite places but this stay definitely changed my view just a bit this visit  Dont hesitate if your considering this place Thanks so much for giving exactly what you advertise  The place was simply amazing 
606657869,We enjoyed our stay at this condo  It is easy to walk to many great places within the CWE Forest Park  It is on a very busy street next to the hospital so it is a bit loud at night  Other than that  it was great  Thanks for letting us stay and for your timely responses 
572999399,It was a great place to stay for a very reasonable price  The upstairs bathroom shower was leaking quite a bit so we only had the one shower but we made it work 
547635254,Place is good but I found so many hairs at bedroom place    but other things are pretty good
584084199,Very clean  I loved the porch swing and king size bed  Front door does not have curtains  Concur with comments about ability to get out of tub when taking a shower  Cute curb appeal to  house  Decent location  some food in fridge expired  over a month  Not worth the price paid  Toilet upstairs had a problem  Unexpired food  ask guests what they want for breakfast
571077091,Great location  clean apartment  lots of space Great stay  No hot water in the apartment and the heat was up too high The key pad lock and door took us a couple of tries
551892671,Nice home and good location  We enjoyed your house  it was very nice  They could use some TVs in the bedrooms 
550957360,Really cute stylish place 
530431393,Great place as described  Location is great with several coffee places and restaurants close by  Close to public transport  Spotty WiFi but I didnt need it  The light and fan controls dont work  WIFI doesnt work as noted by another review  Need another table tennis racket  Also some clear instructions that cant enter apartment from parking spot is helpful  Thanks
430030901,Great location in Hyde park  easy check in I would recommend a mat in the shower  floor is very slippery
429641335,This was a very cute space  perfect for a single traveler or a couple looking for a quiet space in the city  Steps away from the Metra line  which only took about    mins to get into the city  Mostly quiet  but you can definitely hear people yelling on the streets and cars honking in the mornings  Not a huge issue though  Place looked just like the pictures  but some of the cookware was a little sticky when I took it out  Gave it a quick clean and all was well  The water ended up coming out brown on my second day there  but it resolved itself  Overall  great stay  Thanks for responding to my request so quickly  Had a great stay minus a few speedbumps  Never heard back about the water issue 
252452561,The place was very nice  very clean  and exactly as described   The location is very good and checking in was very easy   I wanted to rate this stay      but unfortunately I cannot because the hot water in the shower did not work for the length of my   day stay   I understand that its not Chris fault since it depends on how fast maintenance can fix the issue  but it was kind of inconvenient to not be able to shower during my stay   No compensation was offered  either a discount or use of an alternative apartment    Despite this Id probably still stay here again since I think it was just a one time accident and everything else was great 
252184148,Great location and comfortable bed   Apartment was very clean 
249097722,The apartment was clean  quiet  comfortable and well located   Our only issue was that there was no hot water in the shower  the host was uncommunicative about the situation and it was not resolved during our three day stay   We would consider staying again  except for the way that this issue was handled  Chris   We found your apartment to be clean  comfortable and quiet and the location suited us well   However we were very disappointed that you did not address the issue of no hot water in the shower  and did not follow up after several communications to let us know how the issue would be resolved     You could have done a few things to make the situation better   The first would have been to get the hot water fixed   The second would have been to be responsive and let us know that you were having difficulty getting it fixed  instead we were left to wonder what would happen   The third approach would be to offer us a discount   With the exception of this issue and your poor response to it  we would consider staying again     Thanks  The host was unresponsive when we let him know that there was no hot water in the shower   He did not take action  or do any follow up  
702119492,Very serious maintenance issues  Toilet  bathroom and kitchen sink did not drain  sewage pipe water bubbles up from the kitchen sink  giving the unit a foul raw sewage smell  Toilet did not drain  so we were not able to go to the bathroom in the unit  a basic expectation for a habitable unit  We were told a plumber would arrive  but never did  Hosts demonstrated extreme negligence for a serious maintenance issue  Again  we arrived to the unit to these conditions  Communication was timely  but largely unresponsive to inquiries or requests  I provided an opportunity to rectify the situation prior to writing this review  but you failed to take steps on repeated occasions  Bathroom and kitchen sink did not drain  sewage pipe water bubbles up from the kitchen sink  giving the unit a foul sewage smell  Toilet did not drain  so we were not able to go to the bathroom in the unit  a basic expectation for habitable unit  We were told a plumber would arrive  but never did  Responded  but did not answer inquiries and did not address problems 
708041402,Great place  but be careful when speaking with the customer service theyll hang up on you if youre worried about lost items  Lovely place rude customer service  Forgot laptops and when called for help hung up on called back and admitted to hanging up on me  Was very rude over phone  Luckily my ex had it from when we were working 
672161599,Great place to stay for what its worth  It can be better with its cleanliness  None the less it was amazing and I would say again  It was a great place  Just the cleanliness and its a scuff marks and dents in the walls 
330391425,Very stylish and clean spot  Great price and location  Overall great place  Thank you  The email I received did not indicate yhe code to the entrance gate was the same to the door of apartment  It took a while for host to respond when We could not figure out door code 
428699501,The location is great  Its a small  simple  but cool studio to crash at if you want to spend some time downtown  for a great value  Easy check in  very communicative  The only reason my review is   stars is because of the cleanliness  Chunks of food in the sink  random scraps in the bathroom tub  and random items left over from previous guests  Girlfriend had a real issue with the cleanliness  Other than that  it was a solid place for great value  Thanks  The only drawback to this place was the cleanliness  Chucks of food left in the kitchen sinks  Random scraps of something or another in the bathtub  Items from previous guests that were simply left on shelves 
246575688,A great apartment in an excellent location and with stunning views  We enjoyed our first visit to Chicago very much and staying here was a good way to enjoy the city  There is easy access to the riverside walk and city centre  the restaurants around Fulton market and good transportation to other parts of the city  Hi Chris  Thanks again for hosting us  we enjoyed Chicago a lot and staying in your apartment in such a great location really made the trip special  There were a few issues however  When I booked I advised that my daughter would use the sofa bed  Whilst there were sheets and pillows there was no duvet or blanket to be found  Lizzie ended up sleeping under our coats which really was far from ideal  In the kitchen there was a sticker on the dishwasher which said Clean dishes drying  Please do not run  We looked inside and the machine was empty but given the very firm instruction and as there were no dishwasher tabs to be seen we didnt use it during the whole stay  We cooked a lot and so had to hand wash dishes and cooking equipment twice a day  Not much fun on a vacation when you are used to having the use of a dishwasher on a daily basis  Some help with information on the situation about leaving bags after check out would have been appreciated  We had heavy bags and wanted to make the most of our time on our last day in Chicago before our flights home late evening  Just an indication or suggestion on what to do in a strange city would have helped  Thanks  Martin  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   Not an ideal situation to enter the apartment  No opportunity to interact with the concierge and so not being able get answers to immediate questions about the apartment     Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  Additional comments   Refrigerator interior could have been cleaner   
428063771,Zencity is a great location with beautiful architecture in all directions   Walking distance to many great restaurants  park areas  lakeshore  great little shops  etc   The check in process is very easy  Apartment is comfortable  We definitely enjoyed our stay in Chicago and the great location of your place  Check in process was very easy   Thank you again  Holly The carpet in bedroom and closet as well at the rug in the living room did not appear recently vacuumed and the bathroom floor was not very clean  especially in the corners  Just overall paying       per night is pricey for a one bedroom place  even if it has the capacity to sleep   
427447435,Everything was just as described in the review  The only downside was there were building     s  That was a little confusing and the entire place smelled so strongly of cleanser I had to air out the place for a few hours before I could get comfortable    At least you knew it was clean     All and all no issues and the Zencity team was very friendly and fast to answer questions 
245038180,Great location for visiting university of Chicago and Chicago museum campus  Grocery and pharmacy very convenient for any last minute needs  Room is exactly as described and included extras such as bath products and even coffee  It is an older building but Chriss apartment is up to date  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  Additional comments   Overall very clean  Shag rug needed to be vacuumed    
426634058,Convenient location next to all Hyde park restaurants  Parking was easy as well  Host communicated quickly and was really helpful  The shower curtain is molding a little bit as well 
558197805,The hot water and water pressure in the shower left something to be desired  Tv and bed were perfectly fine  Hot water wasnt working 
426262879,Try to book this apartment over the span of multiple days so that you can fully enjoy the area and  hygge   If youre looking for something modern  clean  comfortable and well located  this is the place to be  There are tons of places to eat and stores for window shopping so you will not be disappointed  Our stay was very pleasant but unfortunately too short  Everything about this stay was great  except it was a bit too short  Additionally  while I do appreciate the communication being very clear and timely  we did feel rushed to leave the apartment  The cleaner even came ten minutes early while we were still packing  which made things a bit frustrating    Aside from that  great apartment  great location and generally very pleased  The first bedroom sharing a ceiling space with the living room had little hairs all over the floor which were noticeable on our socks  Im by no means a perfectionist  but my friend who happens to be allergic to pet hair  started developing a runny nose and an itch 
590733941,Wonderful place to stay if youre planning to explore St Louis  Thank you for the stay it was the perfect place for me and my boyfriend to stay  We did notice the freezer handle was broken and would fall off when ever we tried to open the freezer  but other then that it was an amazing stay  Only problem had was the freezer handle was broken and would fall off whenever utilized
722022707,N A I wasnt able to take a shower for the two day I was there lucky I actually live in Chicago so I just went to my house and showered  Other than that everything was decent Parking
608085367,Great location  Simple  clean  and comfortable apartment  Its likely you will have to pay for parking  but its not expensive  Hi  It was a great stay  Just a couple of details would have made it better     a bathtub stopper and   forks  if they were there  we didnt find them        Thats it though  Thanks 
590076608,The space is very nice  The view is great and it pretty close to everything you would need  The toilet flooded and I had to leave the room for bit   It was fixed but  it was an inconvience for several hours  It was assumed that the toilet was clogged before I used it 
424426502,Loved my stay  The neighborhood was nice and I felt safe  The apartment itself was clean with lots of space  My favorite part about the unit was the view of the city  Beautiful  If youre a light sleeper  the elevator is right by the bedroom and can get pretty noisey  Also  if you have a car  street parking is very limited  I will definitely stay here again 
424360355,Convenient location in Hyde Park  right next to the metra  Clean and compact I enjoyed my stay  The apartment did look a little bigger in the photos  there was some mold in the shower   and the microwave appeared to blow the fuse  but otherwise its a great spot  Very smooth communication  Thanks so much   
554124458,Do not stay here See messages and emails See emails and messages Quality furniture and cleanliness
721528184,Nice place with a good amount of space Thanks for the stay  I appreciated the communication  Dishes werent clean  clear lip marks on wine glasses  which is concerning due to COVID 
423637607,Overall was a great place to stay  A pretty simple layout as far as amenities goes and the computer desk is very tiny but the bed is super comfortable  Also the outside porch was nice for relaxing at night and the location wasnt too noisy  We did have a problem with noisy neighbors but it didnt run too late into the night 
592732947,This is a great place  the security was awesome and the people are friendly  Nice Nice Nice   There was trash in the couch
589112781,Location was absolutely amazing  right down the street from numerous amazing CWE businesses  Parking can be difficult to find  but the listing states this  so just be aware  The property was relatively clean  minus some confetti on the common area ceiling fan  Some of the most comfortable beds that I have slept on in an Airbnb  Thanks for your quick communication and detailed information about the property  I hope my notices help you all to make the property perfect for the next visitors  Confetti all over the ceiling fan and light  clogged sink in the kitchen
530933958,Great location  A lot of spider webs and spiders   The space between the windows and the screens needs a lot of cleaning  Some towels were dirty and some dust in the floors and closets  Although it is a renovated space  there are many things that makes it feel so old  like the many many layers of paint in the old doors and trims and moldings  The unfinished tile in the bathroom and the stained and saggy coat in the living room  It has a lot of potential  if those things look better 
707897295,Great location close to P L  Small hiccup during check in but once we got to our room everything was smooth  Clean  Minor drywall damage throughout the unit needing touched up  Unit had everything you would need to stay there for extended period even though we were just there for the weekend  Keycard was not present in mailbox upon arrival  was instructed to wait for another guest and sneak in behind them 
111252276,Exactly as described  Location  location  location  Thanks  Would stay again  
530194587,Great place and location  cant beat it Very attentive with quick responses   The parking situation is a little tough  but thats a good area for you
202953008,Great location  perfect for     people looking to be close to good restaurants and bars  Hey Chris   your hospitality  communication and location were fantastic  I just think there are a few things that need some attention  if were paying for a cleaning fee  and others too  there really shouldnt be cobwebs on the windows  The shower needs some attention too   mold on the bottom corner of the shower curtain was a little off putting  There were some areas where the wood was separating from the foundation which didnt look great either  Some of your cups dishes that were put away werent clean and some were even cracked  It also wasnt a big deal  but if youre going to advertise things like Sling TV  you should probably make sure guests have the credentials to log into them  I noticed you reached out and requested a   star review  but if these things were taken care of you probably wouldnt have to do that  Outside of that we really enjoyed our stay  Thanks again  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  mold  shower or tub  Additional comments   Cobwebs on windows  shower curtain mold  some areas of house were cracked  
530322526,Great location for a good price  Maintenance issue
423233995,absolute cool place to be in Chicago
422705393,This was a cute  quaint spot in Hyde Park that we enjoyed  The view of the city skyline from downtown was was amazing  Had a great stay 
526229221,Cute place  in a good area The house was a bit disheveled when I arrived and couldnt watch tv  WiFi was bad  also unclear instructions for leaving
526217447,Awesome location and perfect for the business traveler Thanks   Just a note that the bed is pretty low and the bedroom AC would be better if always on versus cycling on and off   But awesome spot
421525179,Good
714537551,This spcace is in a great location which is also safe and calm with easy access to downtown by CTA train  I can advise you change with a new bathtub curtain  it was a very old and dirty  and In a bedroom  the floor was not completed cleaned  I stepped some sand like that 
511629937,Nice and safe place to stay 
421480988,It was a very nice place  two bathrooms which was a plus  A lot of natural lighting  Parking on the other hand wasnt so nice  Very peaceful   relaxing during all hours of the day  Overall I would definitely book a future stay here  Thanks for having us 
421475388,couldnt open the apartment door with the key given to us I had to pay for a hotel called several times with no response at all terrible experience overall couldnt open the apartment door with the key given to us I had to pay for a hotel called several times with no response at all terrible experience overall
421140754,place was nice and quiet  plus  great location  also  they were very responsive 
712364327,The view is AMAZING  Thank you for accommodating my stay  The view was beautiful and it was sooooo amazing  Only feedback would be to check with your cleaning service as it didnt appear they swept the floors prior to our arrival  The floors and main area rug were both very dirty  The floor and main carpet are really dirty  Didnt appear to be cleaned before we arrived 
420782183,The check in process is easy and the door staff were very generous  The apartment itself is in a great location and close to almost everything  We did have an issue with a VERY squeaky bed  but they had it replaced half way through our stay  The wifi was also not what the instructions stated so we had to consult for the correct information  The response was quick  and we appreciated the quick response to the bed issue  Would recommend for the value and location  The squeaky bed and mattress was an issue but was taken care of quickly and we greatly appreciate it  The wifi was confusing because it is not what is stated in the apartment or the instructions 
523007539,You can expect very swift check ins and great locations  The view was also great  Bathroom drain was slow  Fix slow drains and check that sofa for possible bedbugs  I was bitten while sitting there  This was a beautiful suite  However  I found hairs all over the bathroom floor and a few strands in the bed  The bathroom drain was so clogged that it acquired standing water up to my ankles  I was also bitten a few times by something on the sofa  I know this sounds like a terrible review but there were some pros  Like I said  it was beautiful  The rooms had a simple and elegant decor  It was pin drop quiet and the views were stunning  Check in was swift and easy too  I really hope they improveon the cleanliness becauseI would love to give zencityanother shot 
522851200,The place was nice but it is way smaller than what the pictures make it out to be  The A C unit cuts on and off which wouldnt be and issue if it wasnt so loud especially at night  We couldnt use the parking garage since we were guest if Zencity so you should take into consideration that you may have to walk a long distance depending on where you park  The elevator smells and had a broken watermelon in it  The additions of Spotify and Netflix were good in the room  Just know if you have a lot of thing or if you need more space in a room you wont get it here  But for the couple days I was here it was decent  There was no parking I could find  The reason I found a parking spot was out of pure luck 
522849803,Only downside was the parking situation  thankfully we had good weather while we were there but would suggest bringing a raincoat umbrella just in case you cant find close street parking  Cute neighborhood down the street with restaurants and a Whole Foods for snacks   Theres also beautiful park across the street from the building   Overall wed stay here again 
521289059,Nice apartment  great location The touchpad lock was not working at first  but it worked fine after a few tries
453755341,Great place
418650301,The place was spacious and stylish  Check in was a breeze  Chris was very communicative  There were problems with water pressure  showering was tedious  Also  the decorative rug in the living room left dust bunnies everywhere and made my allergies flare up  I would stay here again if the rug were nixed  The living room became extremely dusty due to the rug 
417864437,Nice modern place in a great location  There were a few issues with the place  First  and most important  the furnace wasnt working and it took the better part of the day to get fixed  Also  the couch was broken and only one side was useable  Last minor issue is the towel hook fell off and I had to hang it on the doorknob  not a huge deal    Host was fairly responsive but the heat took a while to get fixed and the others were not addressed while I stayed    Overall a good value and Im more satisfied than not 
584100340,Great location  easy check in out   Parking garage across the street
722014033,The overall experience was okay It was frustrating that it took over    minutes to get inside the building due to a broken inyercom and no front desk person  Commincation with the host could have been better when trying to retrieve left items  I reached out    minutes after I left to retrieve my items and I am still waiting for them to contact me back  Its been   days as of right now  Unable to access the bulging until a resident finally let me in   The screen broken on intercom  The host was unable to contact anyone at the building to let me in  There was strands of hair in between the sheets on the bed and on the gray vent in the bathroom  The floors were pretty dusty  I left a couple of books at the apartment and I have yet to hear back from anyone since       I sent the initial request to retrieve the books  It is now       
519504254,Fun  funky neighborhood   Very convenient for city transportation   Tons of greats restaurants and shopping   Space is extremely minimalist  no extras  Enjoyed my stay and will book again  Appreciate the space and location   Price point was on target   Thanks  Bathtub jets werent clean  but probably because they arent typically used 
416546033,Located near U Chicago  this is a safe area to be  and has a bit of night life going on as well  There are a few bars and restaurants  as well as a couple clubs  Plenty to do around there while feeling safe to walk around at night   If you are looking for more downtown Chicago  it is about a    minute drive  However  being    minutes away brings down the price considerably as opposed to staying in the heart of downtown Chicago  If you have an opportunity to bring a car  do so  Will save a lot of Uber money  plus parking was incredibly easy  lots of free street parking nearby   The place itself was about what we expected  I came here with my girlfriend for a weekend away  and we werent planning on spending a ton of time in the apartment  The place was fairly clean  we found some loose shavings around the bathroom sheets  but nothing too bad  Mostly clean  we felt safe  and was walking distance to some nearby attractions  Worth the price  Overall a great experience  We greatly appreciate being able to stay at your place  and are thankful for the hospitality 
415858811,The place was clean and well located  A little charmless but perfectly fine  We mixed up the keys and accidentally left our house keys on the table instead of the Airbnb keys  We wrote to Zencity immediately  They were not very helpful or accommodating  They asked us to mail them back the keys which we promptly did but asked us to pay    dollars for them to mail us our keys and that was after I write to them several times and they did not respond  We made an innocent mistake and they were far from gracious about it  A bit of a disappointment
721971246,The location was great worked for what I needed it for and quick responses 
714093429,Super clean and tidy  Loved the sun room and the warm blue blanket  Thank you   
516629577,Dont even know where to start  Pubic hair on the  clean  towels and in the shower  Fire alarm beeping first night  all night  A C  Nest  kept adjusting and changing on its own  not sure if someone else was messing with it remotely but it is weird that the A C was adjusting by itself  Other than that  the apt was very nice and nice location  Beautiful views from the window  Pubic hair in the shower and the  clean  towels
516617969,Great location and hip vibe   but rough exterior and entryway   Comfy beds and linens   but lacked kitchen supplies and TV options  Older apartment with stylish furniture 
515969562,Zencity was a beautiful Airbnb in the perfect area with so many restaurants and things to do within walking distance  The only complaint I had was the cleanliness in the bathroom  Overall I enjoyed my stay and would book again 
415041621,This apartment is exactly as it is presented  good value  and conveniently located near the University of Chicago  the     bus stops out front and takes you straight to and from campus   The building is dingy and aged inside but the apartment itself is quite nice    One negative for light sleepers is the the elevator shaft is on the other side of the bedroom wall  and the building apparently has a very nocturnal population that rides the elevators from dusk to dawn    I also had issues with my key and had to rely on the kindness of the building residents to let me into the lobby    Overall  Id recommend the place  for heavy sleepers    it is cheap  clean  and conveniently located  The kitchen and internet are fine  and the tv selection was good  The ability to check in early would have been nice  as I had a very early flight and a long day waiting to get in  I arrived well after check in to find no keys  was left out in the cold waiting because the cleaner hadnt finished yet  Given that I had requested an early check in and been refused  being at least on time would have been polite  generally okay but some attention to customer oriented service would go a long way  My attempts to report issues with the key were far more frustrating than they should have been 
708188524,Great place
704234978,First Id like to say considering staying in Hyde park I assumed that regents was going to be ok to stay in during my visit  The experience I have over the weekend was horrible  First off  the walls were dirty  the couch  and the kitchen sink was linking from the bottom  The bathroom had surfaced mold around tub and ceiling  the bathroom sink had a disgusting build up around faucet  This location needs a serious upgrade  The most worst experience I ever had
512864403,Heres the deal   This was my first experience with Air BnB   Suffice to say that disappointment is an understatement   I could handle the fact that there was no parking as I was visiting my brother  in critical care  at Barnes and we parked the car there   But as soon as I went to take a shower and saw the handle was broken off and that we had to rig it to work  I called and left a message   I assumed  incorrectly  that someone would be over to fix it for our next day   Sadly  that never happened   I have no idea why they Wifi password written on the chalkboard was incorrect   Fortunately  when I called  someone clarified  you need to add        Funny how it works when you have the right Wifi password   So imagine our surprise when day two left us with very sporadic Wifi   to the point of connecting and dropping within a minute     Finally  I couldnt understand why my Bible was getting wet on the coffee table   When I looked up  I could see the ceiling was leaking   Again  I called and had to leave a voicemail   Suffice to say  no one called me back to see what the issue was   Fortunately  the girl had the front desk called her maintenance guys so hope it was attended to before the next guest experience the same   All in all  I cant give you a five star rating   Considering the price we paid compared a hotel and the unfortunate set of events that plagued our stay  it is simply not possible   At least with a hotel  we would have been refunded some of the money due the extremely poor experience  Heres the deal   This was my first experience with Air BnB   Suffice to say that disappointment is an understatement   I could handle the fact that there was no parking as I was visiting my brother  in critical care  at Barnes and we parked the car there   But as soon as I went to take a shower and saw the handle was broken off and that we had to rig it to work  I called and left a message   I assumed  incorrectly  that someone would be over to fix it for our next day   Sadly  that never happened   I have no idea why they Wifi password written on the chalkboard was incorrect   Fortunately  when I called  someone clarified  you need to add        Funny how it works when you have the right Wifi password   So imagine our surprise when day two left us with very sporadic Wifi   to the point of connecting and dropping within a minute     Finally  I couldnt understand why my Bible was getting wet on the coffee table   When I looked up  I could see the ceiling was leaking   Again  I called and had to leave a voicemail   Suffice to say  no one called me back to see what the issue was   Fortunately  the girl had the front desk called her maintenance guys so hope it was attended to   All in all  I cant give you a five star rating   Considering the price we paid compared a hotel and the unfortunate set of events that plagued our stay  it is simply not possible   At least with a hotel  we would have been refunded some of the money due the extremely poor experience  Shower handle was broke   no one fixed it  no one responded to the issue   Living room ceiling was leaking   Called and left a message   no response at all   You would think this would have registered as  we need to fix this   Location was described accurately  However  no parking available was a dissapointment  Had the shower worked without our rigging the handle and the ceiling not been leaking  the value would have been worth it   More disappointing was the lack of host response 
512831968,The vicinity is good  The air conditioning  AC  did not work for first two days of our stay despite repeated requests to get it attended   The systematic response was indeed very slow  I think the host should have on their own refunded the amount for first two days when she knew that there was a problem we were facing due to non functioning of AC  It had not yet been refunded   In fact we had to go out and stay some where else for the first days as it was very warm inside the apartment 
512810069,Great location  Beautiful views  clean and quick responses  Thank you so much for having us  
454092644,Cool spot if youre visiting Hyde Park  Old building but good value
509534902,The place was clean and convenient to transportation  After the third day there was a toilet issue but the problem was resolved quickly and professionally  Transportation was convenient  the   bus was right outside the door and a    minute scenic ride along Lakeshore Drive to the city  All in all  great stay  The floors were a bit dirty  My socks and bare feet got filthy 
509519448,Nice location and nice neighborhood Just the entrance of the main building in the basement a little dirty and mouldy
508370925,The place was convenient and perfectly situated not far from UChicago campus  Too bad the building is old and would need some renovation and quick maintenance  The check in and check out was efficient and practical  We could stay in touch with Zencity all the time  which answered quickly to all our messages  We notice that the hairdryer was not functional  R novation de la salle de bain
508914434,Overall decent stay  About what I wouldve expected for the price  Last couple of Zencity Airbnbs Ive booked have have some issues with cleanliness  primarily in the bedrooms  so book with that expectation  Overall good stay  Was concerned about not cleaning out the rooms properly after every customer  Hair from a previous customer was left underneath the bed sheets  I was anxious about cleanliness for the rest of the stay 
508873974,My first weird experience on Airbnb  I made a mistake when booking since I needed a place where some friends could spend very briefly before going together to a friends wedding  I assumed that that would be not a problem since this place is published as  entire apartment   I understand that customer is supposed to be an adult and responsible person and they can act as if it were their home  this is not the case in this place so I think it is something that future visitors should consider  There is no such assumption of good faith here  I was even warned that I could be taken out at any time if I dared to take a visit  so if you are not used to these kinds of extremely conservative rules  it may not be your place for you  The worst part was when I proposed to change my reservation for two weeks later that I would return to Chicago  it seemed like a fair proposal since I would stay with them for the same price and I could look for another more convenient place  they simply ignored my proposal and after my insistence they told me that I could cancel  losing more than half of the money   The location was quite good  it is somewhat far from the center  loop  but it can be easily reached using bus and the Uber pool is less than    dollars  Also the apartment is quite comfortable and well decorated  the towels and sheets were quite clean  Only two small details  the air conditioning is in the main room and it is not good enough to cool the bedroom  and although I did not use the kitchen  on the last day I saw a small cockroach walking there  All the place was clean except because there was a cockroach in the kitchen  I saw it the last day before leaving  Not really an issue because I did not cook but definitely it can be annoying for other people It was quite unfair that you ignored the fact that I made the reservation by mistake and when I proposed you to postpone the reservation you only told me to cancel losing more than half of the money More empathy with a customer that made a mistake with the reservation
508295349,There are quite a few things that could be improved with this location including the cleanliness and appearance  What you see in the photos is not what you get  Water pressure and cleanliness of bathroom bedroom and the pillows was not up to par  I highly recommend fixing this for future guests 
508287912,Has a great view and is located in a beautiful area  Parking was a bit hard to find around the neighbor hood 
507523335,Great Place 
453739048,good place  great location 
505676459,A bit like staying at your little brothers place its clean  but not pristine  and yeah there are some stains and spills and scuffs  That said  the location and the value cant be beat if youre in Hyde Park for an extended stay  Thanks for the speedy response and for being a great host  The kitchen and bathroom floors both felt oily  and because there is no dishwasher in the space  the cleanliness of the dishes was a bit touch and go  The water damage to the wall and window in the bathroom was pretty severe  The giant stain on the couch was off putting 
505051628,Our stay here was really good but there were a couple things that could be fixed  When we first got to the apartment the door was unlocked which made it look suspicious  Cooking at the place was hard because if the lack of utensils and the AC unit not working at times  We loved our stay  Only con was when we walked in for the first time  the door was open which made it look suspicious  As of ammentities   a few things were lacking   Like kitchen utensils  it made it hard to cook   Also the AC did not work at times  Other than that it was a nice place to stay in 
504988081,Great part of town and this was right in the thick of it  Place was as pictured   clean and spacious  My only negatives were that you are definitely dealing with a corporation  and not someone renting out their place  Had an issue with the drier and took a while for a response and was like calling a customer support hotline  The suggestions that were then offered almost via email were almost bot like  I figured it out myself but to their credit they extended our checkout by an hour since we had wet clothes  Also   I wouldnt take this place if you are planning on making noise as you can all the neighbors and they can hear you  But for value and location  perfect  The steps up to the place were pretty filthy  but once inside all fine  definitely speaking to a corporation  not a human 
504411349,Good location  but parking is very difficult 
503814116,Beautiful apt  Great location for us  Toilet was leaking from the bottom  Sink in bathroom not draining well  Otherwise the place was great and a perfect location for us 
412479951,Wouldnt stay with this company again  You can check my reviews  I have nothing but positive reviews  I know when things are clean and when theyre not  Given the fact that this unit as well as most of this companies units are low cost  I dont believe this means that the units get to be disgusting  ESPECIALLY  when Im paying almost the same amount Im paying for a nights stay in cleaning fees  I had to vacuum the unit as well as use the disinfectant spray on all the surfaces  I went to the target around the block and got air freshener and candles  ran the fan for hours just so it wouldnt have the musty smell it had when we got there  This was our second unit with zencity after staying in another unit in the same building and having to add another night  The bedroom doer was broken  The bathroom door doesnt close as well as being a very outdated and dirty bathroom  The fridge wasnt clean and had old milk from the previous guest in it  The linens and the towels had an excessive amount of random lint and hairs in it  The whole stay I was very uncomfortable and this is by far the worst experience Ive ever had with Airbnb Horrible horrible response time  I even had to call to get a response and she said she would call me back  never did  As soon as you walk into the unit it smells unpleasant  The couch in the living room as well as the rug need to go  Theyre dirty and disgusting  The fridge looked like you had never cleaned it out ever  The kitchen sink was dirty  ALL of the linens  towels  blankets  had random fuzz  lint  hairs on and in them  Refer to above  Horrible response times  And it wasnt just on the times you guys claim to not be as available as I saw in other reviews No matter the price the place should be clean  I dont believe you guys even clean the units out  especially me coming from one unit to the next  the first being directly above my second
601518012,Great place to stay 
501510954,So bright in the room  Place needs better curtains 
708183206,Beautiful view of the arch and a organized space
500185760,Very nice room  very quiet and comfortable  Parking   but its an unavoidable situation 
186869552,Great location  Xlnt communication with host  Great value  Tried early check in  only an hour  but it wasnt available  It never came up  but didnt like the fact that the Airbnb thing was on the down low  Really appreciate the snacks  may consider adding a clock on the nightstand  Had to hide the Airbnb affiliation  
706211828,Very disappointed   Easily the dirtiest Airbnb Ive had to stay in  If I were at a hotel I would have requested a new room  Unlucky for my boyfriend and I  we got there late and had a flight early the next morning so we had to sleep in that filth  There was hair everywhere in all shapes and sizes  The sheets  extra sheets  bed spread  floors  walls  along the toilet  and bathroom floors all had hair  There were stains on bed spread    To make matters even better the door didnt lock unless you pushed it from the outside  We felt very unsafe so we slept with a bar stool in front of the door  Only thing that would have done is heard if someone came in   We stayed in one of their other places a few days prior and it was one of the nicest Airbnbs I have stayed in so I hope they make this right  Disgusting place would love a refund or I will be sending pictures and videos of the place to Airbnb  I recommend getting a new cleaning person and finding someone to fix the door that is unable to lock from the inside  Very dirty Other peoples hair everywhere  stains on bed spread  and the door didnt lock unless you pushed it from the outside 
497557926,Quite good  well decorated in a great location  Check in was painless  exactly as described in the email  The washer dryer was a great touch and was useful to me  The only problem was neighbors in this building were pretty loud  But overall I still recommend it 
496502397,Great value  clean and in a good location  Host was very responsive  Water pressure in the shower is very low 
495242033,Great location  Within walking distance of everything  Water pressure wasnt very good as its an old building  and kitchen was very small but overall a decent value  Water pressure is very low at all faucets with exception of the shower which never really got hot despite the time of day being used  Also  a few more kitchen utensils would be helpful but overall good value 
409711601,What started out as a decent stay  ended in a terrible stay  In the unit that I stayed in  the window broke  and would not latch and stay closed  Thus  in temperature that dropped to    degrees  I was expected to sleep in said room  When I complained during the   oclock hour  the questioning I received  inferred that I was at fault for breaking the window  Seeing that I dont smoke and it was freezing outside  I had no reason even to think about the window  yet alone opening the window  When I requested maintenance  I was told that they were gone for the day  and would have to bundle up and wait until the morning  Again  it was    degrees outside  When I complained more  I was told to turn the heat up  in the midst of    degree weather coming in  To make matters worse  the radiator worked when it wanted to  barely emitting any heat  After asking for a refund  they said theyd only be willing to offer a refund on half a night stay  When I said that was unacceptable  Zencity ceased communicating with me  Needless to say  I will never stay in this property again  because they dont consider the health and safety of their guests  After staying in your property in March of      and referring to classmates to your property this past week  I was extremely disappointed and offended by the way you handled the situation with the broken window last night  Unfortunately  I would no longer use your properties when I come to Chicago or refer people to your properties  To expect someone to sleep in a room  with a window open  allowing    degree air in is not only ridiculous but dangerous  Im appalled at your lack of customer service  A lot of hair left on the floor in the bathroom and hair left on the pillows and linen in the bed  When I called the host with an issue on two separate occasions  they never returned my call  after saying they would  When communicating through text  the responses were extremely slow  There is no value in sleeping in a room with a broken window in below freezing temperatures and an insensitive host 
495175128,Great place  A bath mat would be great and the option to open a window   Kitchen towels would be nice too   Thank you  Behind furniture and pendants were not dusted  Everything else was great 
495174653,The unit was very spacious and clean   Great location   right across the street from Forest Park   It is also across the street from a hospital  so it was quite noisy at night   Made it difficult to get a good nights sleep   The parking situation was also a little difficult 
494645423,Great place in a nice area  This worked great for a work trip 
494635281,A delightful experience   Parking is a nightmare  but thats life in Chicago   Expect to walk a couple blocks from where you park  Loved everything about it except the bathtub was extremely slippery  I almost fell every time I took a shower  It really needs a mat of some kind for safety  Everything else was perfect 
168021603,Great stay    Empty water bottle in lamp and the shower curtain on the inside has some sort of black mildew stains nearly covering it   
494145804,Great time  Very close to downtown 
493529633,Nice place in Hyde park for       people  Great location and A C works great  Window sill is rotting due to moisture  It really isnt a place to sleep   b c the sofa does not pull out  Also  sofa needs replacement   it is not comfortable 
492917388,A good studio apartment with everything youll need Carpet was dusty
492874014,Great location  Huge space for   person  I was able to walk most places  There wasnt a long mirror to get dressed but other than that good stay  Child friendly building but quiet at night 
492706470,This place is in a nice neighborhood about    minutes of a drive from downtown Chicago  There is also plenty of great nearby restaurants  museums  and convinces within a    minute walk  we didnt rent a car   just Uberd   Since it was mid July when we stayed  and being from Colorado  we didnt anticipate how hot and humid it would be there  Considering it was built around the     s  the little swamp cooler could only cool the living room  everywhere else was just a sauna  Had a good stay even though we were there mainly just to sleep and shower  Thanks for being a good host  It was strange to see that the bedsheet did not fit the mattress 
492663053,Dont expect a view  but it is a GREAT location     Thanks for the hospitality  I would just say having soap on deck for the guests would be great  There was shampoo  conditioner and lotion but no soap  And the AC remote control was a teaser because it had no batteries in it     Other than that we had a great stay  Having soap  Also  having batteries in the remote for the AC
492651888,This place is exactly as advertised  The apartment is actually pretty roomy  There is a nice size bedroom and outlets on both sides for charging your phones  The living room has a loveseat and tv  which is hooked up for Roku and Netflix  There is a small table and two chairs next to the kitchen  There are Starbucks beans  and you can grind your own fresh coffee  There is a pot to heat water and a coffee press  Of course  theres the refrigerator  stove  microwave  and dishwasher  The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and utensils  Nice  clean bathroom  There are extra towels  sheets  and supplies in the closet  Checking in is super easy  I felt a little uneasy checking out and leaving the place unlocked with the key on the table   but it worked out okay  The building has a doorman  so really only residents have access  so it felt very safe  Parking is a bit of a problem  but they mention that up front in the listing  On one side  LaCleade Avenue  you would need a resident sticker  You can park about three blocks away on Forest Park Avenue  One night there was a torrential downpour  so I parked in the hospital parking garage  which is a half block away  It costs me     to park between   pm and   am  Considering the weather  it was money well spent  It has two window air conditioners  one in the living room and one in the bedroom  I was there during the hottest week of the year  with temperatures well over      The place stayed very cool  I will definitely come back to Zen City on a future visit to St  Louis  Great place  just as pictured  Very clean  The coffee grinder was very hard to operate  get the kid off and on   My husband had to help me get the kid off  The first few days I thought the pot to heat the water wasnt working  but my husband figured out on day   that the plug just needed reset  Maybe a Kuerig would be easier  The check in and out was very easy  I was there on the hottest days of the year  and the AC worked well  keeping the place nice and cool  I brought my own shampoo  but I noticed the shampoo and conditioner samples in the bathroom were mostly empty and I didnt see any in the closet for restocking 
491738385,Its one of the Air BnBs out there   pm is kind of late 
407625709,The space is a great location and a great deal costwise  The place was dirty upon check in and we had to clean it to stay there but that problem was fixed  Street parking may be a bit of a hassle so prepare to use uber lyft upon checkin the kitchen and bathroom were dirty as if they had not been cleaned at all  I cleaned the place before my stay  the host did not reply to the first two message issues with resolutions until I got AirBnB involved
407619791,Clean  easy arrival  great location  Good value  Sitting area could use more comfortable furniture  Nice space  I wouldve given an excellent rating if the furniture was comfortable  The couch would be better suited for a waiting room but was horrible for watching tv  Also  given the weather  a rug by the door wouldve been helpful   no where to put wet boots  Again the space is nice  Id rent again if you upgraded the furniture in the living area 
407595473,The appartament was doubble blocked so there was people there when we arrived  The host offered us a new house but we endeed up staying here as the other guests left  The appartament is big the beds are very comfortable    Goodluck The appartament was doubble blocked so there was people there when we arrived  The host offered us a new house but we endeed up staying here as the other guests left  The appartament is big the beds are very comfortable    Goodluck
406993403,The experience was okay for the price  I think that next there should be a price reduction for the lack of heat and the room downgrade  The quality had a big impact on the stay  so much that I preferred to sleep somewhere else on the  nd night   I did not stay at the location that I booked The room was a downgrade but the price was the same 
488782429,Only has air conditioning unit in the living space  So was very hot for sleeping on the room 
708207717,Good basement apartment  well located given its value  Clean and quiet  We were unable to watch TV because it was being used by too many other TVs  This wasnt expected and was a poor experience  Cleaner was still in property
488187929,Such a beautiful space   We got there and the apartment was a little warm   They answered immediately when I sent a message about it and came in and fixed the issue  The place could have been a  little  cleaner but I think I was more sensitive to it because of the price tag for the weekend  The beds are comfortable and the natural light is beautiful  Would stay there again  Place was expensive  I feel like the cleanliness should have been perfect  A few of the towels were dirty and the floors werent clean 
435538089,Not worth the price
486487059,Pretty nice view of the lake  About       from downtown  The  pillow cases had stains on them 
486446634,Nice and convenient
485382299,Solid place
404559751,Wonderful location  nice kitchen  shower does not drain  you may need to bring your own towels and linens due to the cleanliness of the ones we recieved  nice home  the towels and bedding had several stains on them  the sheets had BLOOD on them  just too many stains and dirt  the place is phenomenal however the lines bedding  and towels made the stay incredibly uncomfortable the towels were stained  the bedding had a huge stain on it  the new towels they left on the second day were stained  everything was just stained I wish I would have known to bring my own bedding and towels 
484882331,Super nice place  Very spacious and clean with a good view of the city  Would stay again  The balcony door was broken when I got there  It didnt secure correctly leaving the door basically open  I would try to review the space more thoroughly during cleaning  prep for next guest to ensure it didnt happen 
714275332,This feels like big city living  Building is lovely and the space is modern chic  Large space and easy to find  Very comfortable beds  Very nice building and decor  Significant amount of mildew on the bottom of shower and carpet is very soiled
148348368,We ran into a few hiccups while checking into Chriss place  Mostly  it was due to the unit not being ready on time for our check in  Even though we had to scramble to find last minute lodging for our trip as the unit wasnt ready  Chris was gracious  He offered to provide us lunch  on him  He gave us a full refund  And  apologized sincerely for the unit not being ready  Pros  this unit is indeed in a GREAT location  Close to tons of fun shopping and excellent restaurants  Walkable to many great attractions  I would feel safe traveling here alone  Its an affordable Uber from the airport  Chris is able to offer many great recommendations for restaurants  It is a good value for the money and the building was cute  despite the unit not being ready for our stay   Please do not provide units to guests unless theyre maintenance issues are resolved and the cleanliness is kept up with   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  late host  Additional comments   Incorrect keys given  not able to check in on time     Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens  dust  bathroom  kitchen  Additional comments   Broken toilet  trash on floors   
714139197,Grate place to stay  the apt is great and big 
484812128,Wish I couldve showered but the shower was broken 
714087274,Awesome
708360199,Decent place in downtown  Close to attractions  Parking isnt great but walkability within the city center makes up for it 
708350481,Clean and nice location
483548158,Nice apartment  Parking was difficult at times due to street parking being limited  We would have liked to have a spot in the apartment complex parking lot  Furniture was not the most comfortable and seemed cheap  Over all the apartment was very nice and clean when we arrived  Host was very nice and checked up on us frequently  Thank you for hosting us  Very clean home  Parking in the parking lot would have been nice  Sometimes at night we had to park far away due to limited street parking  Not as close to downtown as we would have hoped 
481884024,Misleading listing  Its a mistake to deal with a host like Zencity because its a property owner  not a home owner  and they take no pride or care  What they offer is not worth the price and the standards of the accommodation make you think you wouldve been better off in a motel  Your satisfaction is not their priority  out smarting you to keep your money is  Dont trust these people with your stay  Have no pride in what they do and do not care about customer satisfaction  they do a disservice to the reputation of Airbnb
479342318,Zen stay 
481309632,Great view  skyline of Chicago  Appartement was a nice basic place to stay a couple of days  in a nice building and all the basics present in a full kitchen  With the airco in the bedroom  and a ceiling fan in the living room  the temperature was better than outside  Bus connections to downtown are fine  and by car it takes      min 
459776431,If you expect nothing  you will never be disappointed
480393306,Cool If it wasnt a roach on wall and ants everywhere it would have been great
479945349,Great location located just a short Uber ride from downtown  Plenty of restaurants and places to do right on the street of the apartment Disappointed the entire place needed a good vacuum and dusting  For it to have been clean
714101701,Pros  Great location easy check in  Cons  no parking place smelled of body odor  The entire place had a really musty smell like body odor had to buy a bunch of candles and air fresheners No parking included is a pain car got towed for parking on the street
479924161,The CWE is one of my favorite neighborhoods in STL and I love that this Airbnb was right next to Wash Us Medical campus since the friend I was in town visiting is a student there  It is also close to lots of great restaurants both in walking distance or a      minute drive    I travel and stay in Airbnbs pretty often and have had great luck finding   star properties  I thought this trend would continue on my recent trip to STL but unfortunately it did not  This Airbnb has Pros and Cons  but overall it wasnt close to being a   star experience and in the end felt more like a   star    Pros  Clean apartment with a tech forward design  My room came with stand up iPhone chargers on the night stand  a white noise maker with several different noise options  and a mounted    inch Sharp TV with built in Roku in the living room with HBO  Netflix  etc already loaded up and ready to play  The interior is modern with black and white furniture that gives off a nice level of trendiness  Lots of soft towels for showering and freshening up    Cons  To start  a difficult check in process  I got in after midnight after a delayed flight and the access code provided in the email to enter the building did not work  I later earned this was because of system upgrades they were in the process of performing at that time  Either way  if someone wasnt leaving the apartment as I was trying to come in  I wouldve have been struggling to enter for a while  When it came to get my key from the lock box  the code did not work the first two times but did on the third despite my not doing anything differently  Next  extremely slow WiFi  making getting online nearly impossible  I never did any work while on this trip but even using my phone to check Yelp took minutes due to the WiFi speed  Additionally  the mattress on the bed was brick hard and I struggled to fall asleep each night due to not being able to get comfortable  I want to say that I am someone who can fall asleep practically anywhere and the firmness of a bed almost never bothers me  The fact that it did at the unit was telling on bad it was  Seriously  I cant get over how hard the bed was  and at one point I considered sleeping on the much more comfortable couch    Finally  there is no central air in this apartment complex  instead they each have wall units  The units worked fine and kept the house chill  so I wont factor this into my rating but did want to mention in case someone prefers central air over wall units  Thanks for the responsiveness during the check in process 
479898340,my sheets werent clean upon arrival  was hair in them     there was hair everywhere in the shower  so maybe the  sparkling clean  aspect everyone else experienced was just skipped for me  Other than that the place is really nice and only minutes from dt LMAO Thx for hosting
479188150,Was a good place only complaint was no AC in the bedroom and slow draining shower  other than that it was wat was expected very clean and host always reachable and responded prompt  Check in was easy and finding parking was a breeze  The bed was extremely comfortable  I recommend
400006921,Its a great place to stay
478178134,Save your    not worth the hype   Doesnt even have central A C
477654392,Good neighborhood and location of apartment  Decent value but common area carpet in stairwell was stained dirty and pictures dont fully represent the apartment  Apartments location was convenient and clean  But it had a VERY strong smell of cleaning agent which was overpowering during our entire stay 
368669364,Nice and cozy appartment  Hi   It was a nice stay at your Appartement  We enjoyed it  Even though first the heating didnt really work and the dishwasher wasnt really clean and didnt work   hope you can fix that for your next guests  Anyway  we enjoyed staying at your place and are grateful for the easy check in out and the good communication   Thanks and best regards
477600110,Nice and comfy  great location
452113778,We had a great trip  The location of the apartment was perfect  So close to everything  I would absolutely stay here again  More detail should be paid to the bathroom cleaning  There was hair in the sink and shower 
608116000,The place is a very good place We enjoyed the place  We always like to come back
475711126,Wonderful location  Close to many cute restaurants and bars  Well designed  I would stay here again for sure   Thank you so much for an awesome stay  We loved the location and would love to stay again  The towels smelled like smoke  I am sure this is due to the cleaning service  but it was a bit shocking 
475688268,Great location
124720890,Chriss place is a good find  Clean  great location  and perfect for two friends enjoying a weekend getaway  The only thing to note is the fluctuating apartment temperature  Its an older building with radiators  and the apartment gets extremely warm  coming from a very cold natured person  without being able to significantly adjust the heat  The only small balance is window AC units  Id recommend very light summer sleepwear  we stayed in January   Thanks for a comfortable stay  Our only concerns were the uncontrollable temperature  was extremely hot at night  and the large hole in the ceiling of the living room  Even if it wasnt opening to the outside  it was unclear how concerned we should be and was just generally unsightly  Wed probably hesitate to stay again without the hole being fixed 
475621732,Good location I feel I shouldnt have to pay a cleaning fee the apartment was not clean  These areas were not clean If i didnt have to pay a cleaning fee the place was not clean floors were dirty shower was dirty towels had stains in them 
475120647,Great location and management  Would stay here again 
475020170,It was exactly what I expected based on the pics  Cool area and on a pretty street   Like others said  building smells weird  but the apartment doesnt 
474943988,Vistas espectaculares y un nivel de servicios en el edificio  inmejorable  El apartamento es muy correcto y la ubicacion muy xula    pero falta  el sofa cama indicado 
474933038,Everything OK Hello  everything OK  Would put A C in the bedroom and paint the place a little  WiFi was very unstable so we had to use our Phone Data 
120182157,My mother and I rented this for our annual Christmas shopping getaway  The location is PERFECT  Steps away from Michigan Ave  a parking garage a block away  and in a safe area    The place was very clean and well maintained  nothing fancy just your basic necessities for when you come home and crash     The only thing that was strange was the key pickup  He hides the key on a lockbox on a scooter in front of the building  The building has scaffolding construction so it was hard to find at first  but once I found it the rest was easy    Chris was very helpful with questions and responded quickly  I would definitely recommend his place and would stay again   We absolutely loved your place  If I was moving to Chicago I would rent that out  However there were a few things I wanted to address       The place was very clean except in the bathroom we did find mold mildew on the window  You may want to take care of that before the next tenant       The door to the fire escape was not very secure  You may want to add a lock to it       The plug in by the bathroom came out of the wall when I attempted to remove my charger  It was loose       The TV was awesome  but it took us a while to figure out what was included and what was not  Maybe having a list of whats available   Netflix  would be helpful    But all in all the location and apartment was beautiful  We would definitely stay again   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   Instructions could be a little clearer  It was hard to figure out where the lockbox was at night in the cold  It may be difficult to locate it when it snows  The building is also under construction so it took us a second to find it    
113388768,I thought Chris place was great for my stay in Chicago  It fit the description and it was very clean  The neighborhood was safe and in such a great location  Walking distance to lots of things to see  The building was a little bit off putting  as mentioned in the ad  but the apartment itself was awesome  Thanks for the great stay  
104954375,Place was clean and pretty spacious  Great location   
367367495,Overall  I think this is an absolutely wonderful place to stay if youre visiting Chicago  About a block from Lake Shore drive so it was super easy to get pretty much anywhere in less than    minutes  The kitchen was clean and plenty of kitchen utensils for cooking  Whole apartment seemed very nice and clean  I only have two complaints about this rental  First  it says that you get a key fob because they lock the doors to the main entrance after a certain time  so we got locked out on Thursday night  Secondly  I had some serious issues with the bed  The pillows really suck  We always travel with our own so I would suggest doing that  The bed itself had wooden slats  like ikea beds  and some of them were broken or just missing so the mattress sunk in several spots which was annoying  Lastly  the sheets seemed like that hadnt been changed but just lint rolled  poorly  lots and lots of little black hairs and fuzzies which is just a little unsettling  Luckily  there was an extra bedspread in the closet and we brought a blanket so we were good to go    Usually could find close street parking that was free and seemed like a safe area  close to some good restaurants and the Industry museum  Friendly staff  Close to the shore and its a quiet neighborhood    I would definitely stay here again  Just ask for fresh sheets and maybe a spare    The sheets seemed like they werent clean  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet  towels and linens  Additional comments   It didnt seem like the bed had new sheets on it  Lots and lots of little black hairs all over and they didnt seem too clean    
112571203,Chriss place is in a fantastic location  So close to the lake and downtown  Very walkable  Great cafes  bars and shops nearby  The apartment itself is pretty basic   nothing wrong with it at all but at the same time  lacks much charm and personality  It could do with a few extra touches to make it memorable or special   
472446426,Nice   clean on the inside  Very comfy  Didnt like the area too much   they were working on the carpet in the whole building  all the carpet was pulled off the floor   they started working really early so it was very load  Other than that  everything was fine 
472006815,Stayed here for five nights   The bed is very comfortable  the WiFi is good and the TV and living area are great   The apartment is very spacious and is actually two good sized bedrooms and a small one with a futon and desk   Lots of closet space too   The apartment is on the  nd floor with no elevator so bear that in mind   Also  the apt is on the corner of a busy street  Clark St   so if youre sensitive to urban noise  this may not be your place unless you like waking up early   The shower water pressure is not great   Overall  if you need to stay in Lincoln Park and want to be near the park zoo  this is a very convenient apt 
471999367,Awesome place to stay  Close to everything  There should be a note added about the neighbors cigarette smoke coming through the vents  especially if a guest is allergic  Other than that  great stay  There was a bathroom towel underneath my bed when I arrived 
367313801,Great location  Walking distance to many places  Chris was great with communication and helped out with a minor hiccup during our stay  The place is exactly as pictured  The water pressure isnt the best but this is to be expected from an older home  Its renovated and looks very stylish and modern  The kitchen is great for cooking as well  A great place for a couple to stay  This was my first Airbnb and it was very good  When Im back in Chicago I will stay book another Zencity property for sure  Thanks for making my first Airbnb experience so positive 
580394230,Nice apartment  TV has every service you could want  Supplying coffee in the room was a great touch  Just overly complicated to get to the room 
470962956,Nope Zencity has always been responsive  But this stay was terrible especially given the amount we paid  I understand that you gouged us because of UC graduation weekend demand  Past experiences with Zencity have always been positive  Thus i assumed that for the money i paid I would get a nice place  Very disappointing  Half a shower curtain  paint peeling  bathroom door did not  close Two nights for over         Seasons would have been cheaper  Shame on me    Bad lighting  sofa sagging  back door was unlocked when we arrived 
470962383,The place was nice and roomy   This place would be great for a longer stay     days  because it has everything you would need   We had an issue with the lighting  but thanks to the wonderful employees  we got everything back up and running within the hour   The building outside of the room had a smell   Besides that  everything was great  Thank you 
573620028,I had a great stay at Brians place great host very responsive to my needs could use a little refining but youll definitely enjoy the environment  again brian thank you for the amazing staycation  again Im a Chicago native who also had to deal with the Lil challenges of hosting  Im always available to audit and general inspections
528194952, 
88713764,The building was under construction although that was not noted in the description  Inside the apartment was nice and clean 
469992019,Very clean and convenient to school  The responses were quick to all inquiries and the check out was simple and easy  The wifi is very slow  unfortunately  which impacted the work I had to do  Everything else was very nice  Thank you for your hospitality 
466718294,Enjoyed our stay  Good spot to explore Chicago  A little pricey considering the location and the size of the studio 
468069079,This space is in the heart of Hyde Park  and the unit offers good views of the neighborhood and downtown  A deadbolt lock that we were not given a key for prevented us from accessing the unit  Lock code didnt work Took more than an hour to gain access after failed lock code 
468061139,Stained sheets  Clogged tub  After taking a shower  pools of water all over the bathroom  Missing items listed as amenities  soap  shampoo  salt   Not enough dishes to really use the kitchen without running the dishwasher constantly  No replacement trash bags  Sent a maintenance person without checking if that was ok with us  Would not recommend this location for this price   needs to be significantly cheaper given the experience 
366404819,The Zencity one bedroom apartment is spacious and airy with minimalistic furnishings and muted colors  It was the perfect retreat after hectic days in Chicago  Its in a charming     s building  close to the    bus to downtown or the Metra  There are good restaurants and stores within easy walking distance and the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry is right across the street  Communication with Chris and the self check in were efficient and easy   My only wish for the apartment would be that eating in would be easier with a microwave and table with chairs  I plan on returning  Chris  you have a wonderful  spacious apartment in a charming building in a good location  But then you know that  I would suggest that you check the place after your cleaning person has completed preparations for the next guests  There were pubic hairs in both tubs  hairy fuzz balls and other miscellany on the carpet  some of which I cleaned up   and the cutlery and dishes in the kitchen were not clean from the previous guests  The kitchen is very functional  but it was not possible to eat convenience food because theres no microwave  And theres no table and chairs where you can sit and eat easily   To put things in perspective  yours is the  th Airbnb Ive stayed in during       including Dubai  Sarajevo  and Minneapolis  and I have my own Airbnb apartment  which I rent out in Germany  Im not really a picky guy and I often give   stars  I hope I can do that the next time I stay at your place in Chicago  High cleaning fee on top of excessive Chicago taxes 
466924258,The space was very functional and in a great location  The building and apartment were easy to get into  Two minor concerns     while the bed was comfortable  the couch was not made for sleeping on and needed to be propped up to prevent tipping over  and    the water pressure was low while I was there and the water was not particularly hot  Still  for the price  it was a nice stay 
364902446,This bnb is a perfect size for a single traveler or for a traveler of    It was very clean and organized  It did get a little cold during the night but Chris mentioned that the building itself was on a heating and cooling cycle or something along the lines if that  The floor squeaked every now in then but other than that our stay was absolutely lovely  Thank you   We enjoyed our stay at your airbnb  We used some plates for our dinner but when I went to go wash them  I couldnt find the sponge  so I ended up using soap and paper towel  That was a bit of a struggle but other than that  it was good    
465873830,Stayed here for business and was not disappointed  Highly recommend 
363391349,My wife and I enjoyed our time  We got away for a couple days to dream and set goals for the new year  Walking distance from everything you need   Food Target  Starbucks Safe and awesome neighborhood   The place was nicely remodeled  It was not as clean as we hoped and some minor issues with hot water  the windows not closing all the way and letting in cold air and supplies such as hand soap and dish towels  But again nothing that was major  These are all very fixable things that they can fix for future guests  Im guessing they will be fixed      Thanks Chris for your help  I already sent you everything in a different message   
460980397,Very good location 
361028925,Great space especially for the price  The building is a bit old so expect possible issues with things like window seal paint or doors closing a little weird but it didnt bother me just gave it a bit of a older feel which i enjoyed  Great space to stay at  The shower tub was a bit weird as the water had over time started to rot the window seal  Also the bedroom door came off the wall as the hinge wasnt secured to the door frame  Other than that the space was nice and warm on arrival  it was listed as a studio apartment when it is actually a one bedroom and the neighbors were a delight  The lock box was left wide open and keys had fallen out 
705867750,My stay at this Zencity location was disappointing  My   stars are for the view from the bedroom and the convenient location  Read this review until the end because any travelers looking to stay at any of the Zencity locations should beware of the stunts they tried to pull    The Space This apartment looks a lot better in pictures than it does in person  Definitely in need of some updates and TLC  Paint on the bedroom walls is cracked and chipping  The hosts provide you with the bare minimum but honestly  there is nothing else special about this place    Checking in Checking in was quick and easy  Front desk staff was kind and friendly   Now  Ill speak on my experience  I knew Id be landing in Chicago over an hour before check in and when I asked the hosts if Id be able to actually check in early  I was denied which wasnt terrible but it may have saved me  a huge headache later  I finally arrived to the Airbnb at      on the dot to find that the apartment was dirty  as if someone checked out and no one came to clean after   Bed was not made  leftover food was in the refrigerator  living room rug and the kitchen were dirty  Im sure everyone has heard that COVID is still a thing  so walking into a dirty Airbnb during these times is the last thing youd ever expect  right  When I messaged the hosts WITH pictures  the response I got from Stuart was  Sorry about that  It seems there might have been some miscommunication over another tenant in the building using the space or not last night  Im checking now to see if we can get a cleaner there right away     Ok  so does that mean that someone else may have access to this apartment without your knowledge  Not a very settling feeling for a solo  female traveler    I did book this saying there were   guests for my own safety  and Im glad I did because who knows what else couldve happened    It was now too late and a cleaner was not around so I had the option to go to their other Airbnb which luckily was only a   minute walk around the corner for the night and then go back to the location that i actually paid for the next day   I was desperate and had no other options for a place to stay and agreed after going back and forth with the hosts and customer support about how much Id be refunded for my inconvenience  Zencity didnt want to refund me the cleaning fee for their dirty apartment but thankfully Airbnb customer support said yes along with only     for the first night   The new apartment was fine but upon reading reviews for it I found that a female solo traveler stated that a male cleaner came into the apartment while she was there  without warning and she was very uncomfortable  When I pointed this out to Zencity i was assured by Marty that the cleaners have already been notified that Id be checking out late so it wouldnt be a problem  Guess who knocked on the door at       a m  on the dot the next morning   the cleaners  More miscommunication Im guessing  They left once i explained the situation and an hour later i walked back to my original Airbnb and it was clean  Like the way it shouldve been when I first checked in  I was not very comfortable during my stay just knowing that someone else had access to the apartment  I was nervous whenever i left out thinking someone would come in and take or go through my things  I was nervous when i went to bed at night knowing that I was alone  but there were no other problems  Now heres the good part  Zencity had the AUDACITY to accuse me  a non smoker  of smoking marijuana in their apartment and had the nerve to request      from me because of it  This is the lowest  most desperate and manipulative thing Ive ever heard of an Airbnb host doing  Maybe theyre mad that they lost money because of their own mistakes and miscommunications  Thats not my problem  Like I said  the best part of this Airbnb experience was the view and location so travelers  beware 
460163652,Apartment Is very much like staying at a hotel  They have everything you need from toiletries to irons and such  location is good  and parking is free and easy to find in neighborhood   Need to have a plan for using public transport ahead of time as the closest station is a Metra  not the L  You need t take a bus line to the L but many options around  Would use again  Location was great  parking super easy and communication was very quick  It was a good choice   Couch cushions need a bit of help though  smooshed down back cushion  and I would suggest a longer pull chain on the light in the fan so you didnt have to stand on a cushion to turn light off  Stay was much like being at a hotel with good amenities and location  Open food items were left in fridge  Bathroom floor could have used a sweep Location was good with nice cod and store options nearby  A little more complicated to get to things downtown  Need to have a Ventra or Change for bus to get you to an L station  Metra is nearby but not as convenient
360186244,This place is an exceptional value  very quaint and comfortable love vintage apartment  amazingly one and a half bathrooms in a one bedroom conversion  I love this charming little place  my stay was very pleasant  Thank you for your hospitality  I would only suggest that you upgrade the living room furniture bit as a sofa was a little rustic  also there was a terrible odor throughout the building but  thankfully not in the unit 
359720268,Good place to stay access to washer dryer was a bit hot in apartment but overall great experience Was a bit hot in apartment
476619240,The house was good  The location was suspect  Host good  House nicely up graded  House was great great location was not so great  Thanks for all the goods in the kitchen  Think location could have been better  Due to location 
613253708,Zencity was always quick to respond and offered a great place to stay  It was clean  comfortable    they made everything from check in to checkout very easy  The only suggestions I have is cleaning all the towels prior to guests staying there   in the kitchen having measuring utensils  Im not sure how many guests even use the kitchen  but thats something I love to do  But overall  it was a great place to stay   I would definitely come again  There was only   clean towel but it was really no problem to throw the rest in the wash  I didnt specifically say I needed anything else  but after staying in many airbnbs  many of them have a few more amenities such as soaps or cooking utensils  ie measuring cups 
458851848,Loved communicating with Zencity  They made our stay easy and affordable  Thank you for all your help  The only things we did not enjoy was was the hardness of the bed and the water pressure in the shower  We greatly enjoyed the cleanliness and the assistance before the stay 
456880375,Perfect spot to just get away peace and quiet    Thank you I enjoyed myself nice and peaceful
456430835,The place was alright  The hosts did not respond when I had trouble with the wi fi code and the problem was never resolved  The wi fi code did not work  and when I asked about it  nothing was done  I was not able to do work at the airbnb 
453348409,no dresser  desk  or kitchen table  everything else was ok
456097178,Nice atmosphere living room  Please arrange the bleach or washing liquid next to the laundry machine  It was nice atmosphere in the living room 
456003880,Great Location
455438756,  The AC was a little loud  Parking instructions needs improvement 
717881033,Nice apartment for the price but the intercom failed to work multiple times which left us stuck outside for hours  Fix the intercom and should have a number to call Intercom failed to work multiple times and waited hours to get in the last day
357180841,Great Host
453350492,I recommend if you want a good view and clean apartment The place was not safe
714957740,Strange problem filled experience  Earwig beatle in my bed sheets  Bizzare room setup  poor shower pressure  a building system that has you removing your mask to yell at a robot intercom system that still doesnt understand you  Broken appliances including broken deskside lamp  damaged tv with lines on the screen  weak pressure in the shower  The bedside lamp is broken  There were atleast   insects  The water pressure in the shower is poor  The   recognition system does not work well to let people into the building   There are no available power outlets for the lamp by the desk so it is unplugged  also no outlet ofc for any laptop the guest may use at the desk  Didnt respond until I called There was an insect in my bed that I had to kill 
452721652,Spacious common area  good location  Fire alarm did go off in the middle of the night  not sure if it was accident or the guests in the air bnb across from us were smoking in the stairwell  But we were able to easily reach the host to turn it off 
357107850,Great place  Great place  The only issue was with parking it was very difficult to find parking 
354978199,The space was really great  The host always responded quickly  If youre driving here  I suggest using SpotHero to find parking  The neighborhood is really safe and clean  with great shopping and restaurants  There are   pretty long flights of stairs  but it really wasnt horrible  Totally manageable  The space was really great  There were previous guests leftovers in the fridge  however  Didnt bother us  just wanted you to know   A small suggestion might be adding a full length mirror in the apartment  It was a very minor inconvenience  but we had   girls trying to do our makeup in one mirror in the bathroom  Really loved our stay overall  though 
450487800,AAA  AAA 
354115728,Loved the location of this air bnb and Id stay here again   The only reason that my review is     stars is because we had a non working key and the halls in the building were not in good condition   However  the unit was sparkling clean and having   bathrooms was extremely convenient   Also  lots of food and shopping options nearby  Thanks for everything  We are in Hyde Park often and would stay again  The location was perfect   I would note that the hallways are pretty run down and there were also unpleasant smells  however the unit was wonderful  One of my keys didnt work upon entry   However  the maintenance worker was extremely helpful and allowed us to come in and brought us a working key later   We are very grateful to have run into him 
448955958,The location to UofC was great  Cleanliness was lacking  Thank you for the great location to campus  but cleanliness is lacking  I love that there was a French press  The hot water was nearly non existent  thank you  The bedroom had hair on the floor and on the toilet from a previous tenant  A cockroach crawled out from behind the shelving in the closet area next to the bathroom   The plates were dirty with egg residue on them  I wish we hadnt paid so much for a room that was so dirty 
351380640,The setup is amazingly convenient  comfortable and stylish and the price is great  Hi Chris  the zencity apartment is amazingly convenient and stylish  I had a very good stay there  One small thing though is the room has a slight smell  perhaps from some cleaning liquid or something 
619504193,Such a nice little place  Perfect location 
717408781,Nice place for     people   The area of Hyde Park was in walking distance to the Museum  park and Lake Michigan   Whole Foods  Marshalls  and Michaels is within walking distance as well   Make sure to bring extra bath towels too   Over all it was a nice stay  I would suggest to have more face and bath towels  the sensor on the front door lock was hanging off like it is barely making it  I would suggest a blender for the kitchen as well  Overall it was a nice stay for     people  There was hair all over the inside of sheets and pillows   Dirty pots and pans  food left in microwave  The cleanliness of bed and kitchen is why I rated the value less than   stars
446965654,Great location and set up  but they went cheap with a poor bed and mattress  When staying   nights   having towels fur   nights is good The bed was terrible   hard to sleep on such a poor matress
350894465,No comment No wifi for   days till you put an extension  No water during a shower  because the building is too old and it can not support all the people using the shower  Police at midnight in the next door apartment as guests were fighting        had to leave the apartment at midnight and move to my sons apartment  The suggestion is  THIS APARTMENT  THIS BUILDING IS NOT PROPER TO BE OFFERED FOR SHORT RENT  I WILL NEVER EVER TRUST AIRBNB AGAIN  And I am sorry for that because we as family have rented via airbnb in snowmass colorado  rio de janeiro brazil  filadelfia  atlanta etc     I am very sorry  Best regards Building hall  corridor  elevator  smell horribly and are dirty Hairs in the bathroom corners  dust and spots in the kitchen cupboards  Black spots on the bedroom walls The location is fantastic because it is close to the restaurants and shops  The problem is the building too old  dirty and UNSAFE
442926778,The place was clean and comfortable  The check in was easy and the stay was nice overall  My biggest complaints were that it wasnt like the pictures and there was a bit of a smell like fresh paint or a new mattress or something  Hopefully that is dissipated for the next guest  Overall I would recommend
444299041,Overall good stay  Clean and well located apartment  However  there is a fairly noisy ventilation that can be heard throughout the apartment    points could be improved     The ventilation of the technical room  boiler  is very noisy and it can be heard throughout the all apartment     The CO detector was beeping during our stay  Despite our call to the hotline service  no concrete help was provided to fix it     The shower curtain of the clawfoot Tub is too short  You might replace it 
444254906,Location was great  host was very responsive  but the cleaning staff could pay more attention to details  Need to make sure cleaning staff prepare unit correctly for next guess  and be willing to accommodate guest better if they have problems at your location  Also provide a parking spot location for guest would be helpful 
589712266,Great place to stay  need little work Thanks for everything No local channels  master bathroom shower head didnt work well at all
443718531,Upsides  great location  very easy instructions  responsive hosts  lots of extra supplies like towels etc   Downsides  old  couch was broken  shower curtain was very moldy and gross  in fact the whole shower was   lots of ants and a silverfish roach
442489620,We got there on time and Had to wait over an hour to check in   Waited an hour   after checking before I could get the keys   Couch smelt bad
566195588,Zencitys apartment has everything you need for a weekend stay in St  Louis  cooking supplies  iron and ironing board  plenty of towels  and is walking distance to Forest Park as well as a bunch of Central West End restaurants  bars  and a Whole Foods   The rooms and bathroom were clean  and the apartment was attractively decorated   Check in was a breeze   There was a little confusion on my part about where to leave the keys at check out  but the Zencity team was proactive about communicating   The only down side is that the building was unusually warm  other residents mentioned the same thing so it wasnt just one apartment  and the mattress cover under the fitted sheet didnt breathe  so we woke up sweating several times each night  wasnt what I was expecting with nighttime temps in the   s    The window ACs worked fine  but if we closed the full length curtains to block out light in the bedroom most of the cold air was redirected toward the floor   Eye masks solved the light problem but the bedroom still didnt get cool enough to prevent some sweating  and the window AC made a moderate amount of noise   I bet if the building wasnt unusually toasty we wouldnt have had a problem  Thanks for hosting us in St  Louis   Not sure why the building was so warm  but the window ACs were pretty straightforward to use   If you could please be a little clearer in your email instructions about which table to leave the keys at for check out  that would be lovely   I assumed it was the front desk but they had no idea what to do with the keys and eventually I just tried to put them back in the lockbox  Im not sure if yall regularly wash the mattress cover  but it smelled slightly sweaty   It also doesnt breathe at all and the building was rather warm even with the window AC running  so we were waking up several times a night trying to cool off   The sheets and comforter were definitely clean  and all of the spaces were clean  it was just the mattress cover that smelled off 
443292989,  
443276853,Nice spot  Central location  Great for business travel Thank you for accommodating me  The kitchen was pretty dirty  It may hav been because I got into the space a little early 
440250605,Enjoyed my stay 
443242867,Communication and check in worked well  We got quick help when the electricity went out  We enjoyed the stay   Hi  I have written a text with recommendations that you probably received The sink was dirty
442876897,Great location and nice space  The television did not work at all  It said  searching for signal  
350572503,Muy buena ubicaci n para actividades en la universidad Demasiado ruido en el sistema de calefacci n  Ropa sucia colgada y abandonada en el closet de la sala
442031358,When I arrived  I followed the check in procedures and put the code in the kiosk  They gave me   incorrect password  and I had to wait    minutes for someone to finally give me key to my Airbnb  When I arrived to my room  my bed was not made also had stains on it  The trash was also not handled as well  Other than that it was a pretty cool stay  The rooftop was gorgeous  Please make sure you fix the check in Key issue  Also  please follow up with the cleaning people to make sure they clean up the apartment before new guest arrive  The bed was not made when I arrived  I had  to change the sheets  Also  the trash can was full of trash  The place wasnt cleaned at all 
596747417,Cute little apartment  Finding parking is very difficult  In milder weather the parking wouldnt be such a hassle however  in snow and ice walking several blocks to park is very inconvenient  Be prepared for very loud neighbors next door  Several nights in a row they were screaming and fighting into early hours of the morning  More than once I had to go sleep on the couch to try and get some relief  Great little apartment  Apart from the check in issues  which I will say were resolved quickly  the difficult parking options  and the disruptive neighbors its a cute little place  Was unable to get the key and come to find out it was not ready at check in time due to cleaners not showing up  They had to call a new cleaner to come in and wasnt able to officially check in until a few hours later  There was still hair and soap scum in the shower and in the bathroom sink  I assume this attributed to the rushed cleaning job  Very hard to find parking as there is only street parking available  Also  VERY loud neighbors  They were aggressively fighting into early hours of the morning several nights in a row  The check in issues and parking would have made this listing a better value 
557680322,Great Airbnb for a quick stay in Chicago  Host is very helpful and responsive  as well  Would stay here again 
350221356,Space is clean located in a great neighborhood close to great shops and restaurants and close to public transportation  Overall location  cleanness  and easy way of check in was great  Adding a larger rug in bathroom and in the living room would make the space more comfortable to stay in  especially when walking barefoot through the durning Chicagos colder months  Living  room furniture is uncomfortable  I would recommend investing in a more comfortable sofa for future guests 
441218881,Great location  well decorated and clean  Parking was difficult as there is no onsite parking  We liked the space and location and it was clean  but the sheets wouldnt stay fitted to the bed  the white curtains and shutters let in a lot of light when sleeping in bedroom  and parking guidance was needed given that there was no onsite parking and nearby streets were permit only  Otherwise  check in was easy and the unit was well decorated and had good features  Thanks 
350214976,first of all  this apartment is rented out by a service  so there is no host  i would be wary of renting from a management company like Zencity instead of a host  since they dont really care about you  we had major issues getting into the apartment building and locking the apartment whenever we left  because this was a management company  we reached customer service reps who werent able to help us   only try to call someone onsite  when we tried to follow the instructions to get into the building  the zencity customer service rep kept hanging up  luckily  someone leaving the building let us in  otherwise we would have been outside much longer  when we had issues with the lock and could not leave the apartment since we couldnt secure our belongings  they were unable to reach their  emergency services 
350200027,Overall a nice  clean place and great location  Free street parking that couldnt have worked out any better for its convenience  Did have trouble connecting to Wifi and soap dispensers did not work  Otherwise no other issues and was a great place to stay  Hey Chris  I had a couple things that I wanted to bring to your attention that we had issues with during our stay  I spoke to you before about the WiFi and soap dispenser that were not working  after trying to trouble shoot those issues  we ended up having to connect to a different network and use soap outside of the apartment  The apartment was clean but we noticed someone elses leftovers in the fridge that left a foul smell for the rest of the stay  Overall the place was nice and clean  but I hoped those things would have been addressed before we came in  Someone elses leftovers before our stay were in the fridge that left a foul smell for the rest of the stay  Only partial addressed our concerns 
350180799,Great price for good location  nice apartment  in good area of chicago  Great price for good location  nice apartment  in good area of chicago 
438840600,Great locations  Great restaurants   shopping  Parking wasnt free but not crazy expensive either  Would stay again      Checking In with the voice box was a pain  The ladies on the other end hung up on me    times  Kept forgetting to open the doors for us  Other than that  Great      
560747227,Sparkling clean apt with quick responses from Zencity and a good location close to the park and multiple bars and restaurants  Good location and sparkling clean place with quick responses  The cleaning fee was very high as I only bring a small bag and always clean up after myself  Perhaps that fee could be negotiable in the future 
438437046,Room was clean and affordable  had some communication issues with the host  Also  the listed wifi had no signal inside the room  The host forgot to send the code to get the room key  and then didnt respond for a couple hours 
708483786, 
437314133,Would stay again
436650277,Great space  Much larger than it looks in the photos and it has nice big windows with plenty of natural light  There is a HUGE closet that is not pictured  Its walking distance from u of chicago and around the block from a number of restaurants  if youre coming for quick visit you may have found the perfect place   My main issue with this spot was the smell  There was a really awful sewage y smell in the bathroom and the closet  and the odor changed throughout my stay  so I know whatever it was  it was  fresh     The smell is easily contained in the bathroom closet area by a door so I had no odor issues in the rest of the space  I was Locked out of the building as I was given an incorrect set of keys upon arrival  keys received were also mislabeled There is a really awful smell in the bathroom closet area Key issue was cleared up after a few messages and a phone call  However  when I was advised that the air conditioning unit would be installed during my stay I requested that it not be installed until after I leave  It had been fairly cold at night and I was concerned about staying warm  My request did not receive a response and the unit was installed anyway  The smell in the closet bathroom was VERY BAD
604255482,It was a great little place to stay and was a great location  The unit definitely wasnt ready when we were going to check in   hours later than the open time  The host did take a while to respond and it was an inconvenience when we needed to get in  When we did check in there was still laundry in the dryer going  It seemed like the cleaning took longer than it should have  Other than that the unit was great and perfect location 
722414354,The rules were a bit strict but overall a good stay 
712867405,generic  they all are the sa h e  so if something seems a little off  it is likely a LOT is wrong  perhaps give a heads up if tradesmen are coming to fix things  dont forget about a problem when notified  the kitchen had been thrown together  missing basic stuff  and the cleaning supplies fell out at us upon opening a cabinet  the bedroom had a window open that couldnt shut and what looked like a swiffer pad attempting to cover an opening while the AC unit barely hung in the window  it also smelled of smoke when we entered  the place was freezing with no heat 
548085471,So overall my stay here was good  But there was one big problem that I feel like people looking at this listing should know  the photos arent correct  When first getting there I noticed right away that the room I was in wasnt the correct room so I messaged Zencity  Before this they were responsive but after the problem came up it took them awhile to get back to me  When they finally did they told me that this was a new listing so they were using photos of a similar listing they have until they got the photos for this room  and that they had put in the description that they were using different photos  I looked and I could not find that anywhere  They also told that the photos are correct now  but they are not  So I messaged back asking where it said that in the description  and they never responded to that question and instead ignored it sending me a message completely unrelated  This was my first time using Airbnb and Im a little disappointed and not sure about the future since this one wasnt completely honest 
468987993,Stayed here as I was in town for business  perfect space for one  Quick to respond to questions and eager to help accommodate  Appreciate the quick response  wish something could have been done about the shower but really no complaints 
579859370,The unit was very stylish  clean  and comfortable  a great deal for the price  The common area leading to the unit does seem a little sketchy but the neighborhood is a safe one  so dont worry too much   One thing to note is that the walls seem to be pretty thin so you may hear the neighbors playing music or talking loudly  The window also looks out onto a deck that people may smoke hang out on which is right by the bed  It wasnt a problem for me luckily  Had trouble receiving instructions via email 
707119100,The location is great  within walking distance from several great restaurants and coffee shops  The studio is small  but cozy  We had to book last minute  and they were able to accommodate us  It is a ground level apartment that looks out on a parking lot  which didnt feel very private  especially since the blinds dont quite fit the window 
433023637,Check in process left something to be desired as keys were not in lock box as instructed  However  Zencity was relatively quick to respond and once I figured out there were keys in second lock box  got in just fine  Location is great if youre visiting UChicago   walking distance to campus and nearby shops 
432695691,OK   a little dirty but otherwise nice  Stains on sheets  floors covered in debris that would easily be cleaned with a vacuum  shower sticky
432093794,Could not check in  Called the host multiple times  no response until   AM the following day stating they would look into it  At  pm  the day after check in  I received a text saying that they would not be refunding me and that they were able to open the lock box 
432032247,Apartment is as advertised  Zencity staff are quite unresponsive  though messages often get ignored and you have to be proactive about following up  When we moved in  the bathtub was almost entirely clogged and it took several days for the problem to get fixed 
431265127,Poor management  Would not recommend  Learn to effectively communicate
429644005,Its a nice place where you and your significant other can stay at
599294734,I was wowed by the price and style of this place   The location was great  Check in great  The modern style great    But if you are particular about cleanliness  then DONT stay here  Hairs all over bathroom  shower  and rugs   Like a lot   And even pubic hairs   The elevator was out so we had to carry our heavy ice chest up three flights of stairs  Wont stay here again  Lots of hairs all over bathroom  shower  rugs Clean
595751820,Pros  The place is big and open     bathrooms was nice    Cons  It hadnt been cleaned the best  I could see dirt on the rugs and floors   Frozen beer in the freezer and beer was spilled all over the ice  I wasnt really concerned with any of that until they tried to make me pay a      fee for something on the rug   I hadnt even been in the place but to sleep   So consider yourself warned  they may try to blame something on you and get you to pay a ridiculous amount to replace it  The spill wasnt mine  For you to say it was a stain and try to make me pay      is ridiculous   Anybody could have cleaned that up  You should probably reconsider your cleaners  Frozen beers exploded in freezer and carpets hadnt been vacuumed and floors hadnt been swept  I didnt communicate with them at all If it had been cleaned prior to my arrival 
428989165,Everything Was Great But Went To Bad Really Quick  I Went To The Store While My Girlfriend Was In The Shower  Came Back And Slipped On Water That Was Leaking Really Bad Downstairs From Upstairs   Almost The Whole Floor Was Soaked   I Took Lots Of Pictures And Videos Everything Was Great But Went To Bad Really Quick  I Went To The Store While My Girlfriend Was In The Shower  Came Back And Slipped On Water That Was Leaking Really Bad Downstairs From Upstairs   Almost The Whole Floor Was Soaked   I Took Lots Of Pictures And Videos
428730106,Nice place  great location  hardest part is finding a parking spot at night 
428119515,Zen city was very hospitable and such a nice clean space  It was close to many different places and we enjoyed walking around the area  Would stay here again  Thank you for hosting us  Ive stayed in other Airbnbs before and it would be nice to provide a booklet or note of top things to do or eat in the area to make guests more familiar with the area
592720574,Great place  Way better than what I expected Great place  the only downside is parking   but now that I know I would stay again It was only a one time thing No parking
717385386,Unit faces the road where ambulances dispatch so lots of siren noise at all times   great location if needing hospital though  This unit is facing the street that dispatches ambulances so very loud and busy   BUT great location to hospitals
427450193,More communication needs to be called   The hole in the wall was not done by me it was done by someone before   I will not be held responsible for that 
426661767,Nice and clean space in a convenient neighborhood  nice design and comfortable  Kitchen has everything you need and more  coffee grinder   Subtracted a star as its very loud and street facing   right next to a highway and ER  you also hear noise from corridor  Apartment also runs a bit hot 
717179903,Nice  sleek  clean and comfortable  Thanks very much for the great stay    was exactly what I needed  Just a heads up  there are a few broken pieces  bits and bobs in the apartment  Also I couldnt tell if the water dispenser in the fridge was working and safe to drink  Apart from that kinda stuff  it was a good experience and lovely for a couple nights rest 
708718632,Very clean and fresh near the market place if your interested in produce Thank you sending warmth from Florida
426600684,The space was comfortable 
604231705,Great KC location and they were very attentive when I had any needs at all 
716523230,NA Thank you very much  Happy Holidays 
425162127,Super clean  quiet and cozy  There was lots of towels and a fresh pair of sheets for us   Super cute space with a good view   Loved it and would definitely stay out again 
425115752,Nice place  We had a good stay   Only problem was the TV    Struggled to get it to work  couldnt find any instructions in the unit  and once we did  there was no way to control the volume  I think the listing is about     night overpriced  The combination of the size of the unit and the location make it a bit overpriced
714416184,This is my second time staying here and its about the same as last time  Please keep in mind that this apartment faces the street  is about a block away from a major ER and is on a very busy street  I personally dont mind street noise  but for those who do this isnt the unit for you 
423284734,The place was nice and clean and in a very good location  It was also very well stocked with towels  dishes  and salt pepper oil  However  there was no parking and we had to park a couple blocks away for     a night  Also  although we had no trouble finding the place or checking in  it was a little unsettling that I never got responses from the host on the Airbnb app  All the messages they sent were pre formulated and they would sometimes respond saying things that were not relevant to my inquiries  It seemed that responses were automatic  pre typed ones which often did not make sense to what I was asking about 
446477802,The place was super easy check in  and over all very cute  It wasnt quite as clean as I expected  it wasnt dirty  it just wasnt sparkling clean  Overall it was a nice place to crash for the night  I would recommend it overall 
422691342,Nice location  Views of skyline at night on clear day  The space was nice  Inside temperature wouldve been perfect if it was    outside  There were stains in on the sheets and the bathtub wouldnt drain so it left a nasty film in the tub   I only showered there once  Other than that wonderful place  Being able to control temperature in house  I got sick because I had to open all the windows to even out the temp 
417250058,Lappartement est bien situ 
669892704, Long review  summary at the end     The space is absolutely beautiful and spacious  The pictures dont complete do it justice  The sunlight is amazing  There is a lovely bathtub in the main bathroom thats not pictured well  Also  someone mentioned theres not a coffee maker  but there was actually a French press  Expect parking to be the same as most major cities  We had no problem parking on the street for most of our stay  However during busier seasons  you may need to park in a lot and walk  Since checking in is contact free  make sure to follow the instructions carefully  Youll get your key from the package entrance back entrance  but once you have it you can enter through the front   My only major complaint was Zencitys customer service  We had an issue with the lock alignment on our door  unsure if it was due to weather or another problem  It took a very long time to figure out how to lift or pull the door perfectly to lock it  and we would spend several minutes unlocking the door when we would try to enter  We let Zencity know how difficult it was getting in and out of our apartment  and they said they would send a person out to check on it  That person never showed  A few hours later  we questioned about it to find out they had  got sidetracked  and wouldnt be coming   Tl dr   Overall  its a VERY stylish  convenient  and affordable place to stay  Just be warned if you have any issues  they may not be resolved well  While the host did respond quickly  they werent as helpful as expected  We had an issue with locking and unlocking the apartment door that lasted our entire stay  I understand that weather changes often affect doors frames  but either that was quite severe or not the only problem  After an unhelpful phone call and     minutes of fighting with the door  we figured out the  trick  to locking it  However  unlocking upon return was an even bigger issue  It would take us several minutes each time to enter the apartment  and leaving it unlocked was not an option we were comfortable with  When we complained  a zencity member said they would send someone out to check on it  We waited for a few hours and found out  only after prompting for an answer  that the person they sent  got sidetracked  and couldnt make it  That information should have been given to us immediately rather than us having to ask if we were still going to be helped  Im normally not one to complain this much  but Ive worked in customer service for years and I did not appreciate how I was treated 
422605083,Great location  By trash shoot so a bit loud but we were out and about mostly so this wasnt a big deal  Very clean and cozy  Thanks  Just the trash was a bit loud and never got WiFi to work but didnt try super hard  Great spot overall
362601149,Nice neighborhood  The place was okay  it just seemed poorly prepared 
572403592,Check in is fantastic  amazing location and local  outstanding eateries  Place could have been a little cleaner  but overall it was a nice stay  Thanks for hosting us  We just found a few hairs here and there around the place that was not ours  We thought of using the tub in the bathroom  but it too  had some hair and dirty spots 
419779096,Great location  big space  reactive host  Thank you for your hospitality  I cant leave you a   stars because of the bed linen  Maybe next time just make a second check just to be sure that everything is clean 
587109313,The space is a bit larger than in the photos  which was a nice surprise  No on site parking but there was always street parking available around the corner  Along with needing a fob to work the elevator and exterior doors you need a separate code to enter your room  Nice location and a nice place 
585378681,Exactly what is pictured   theres also residential on street parking if you have a car  definitely a must if youre visiting St  Louis    Very minimal  but the beds and comfortors are some of the softest Ive ever slept in   I was very well rested during my trip  We had a great stay and the beds were the most comfortable  I think you could charge a bit more and it would make it even better if you had some basic cooking items stocked like oil or pan spray and directions for the sink garbage disposal which was finicky 
416931005,Nice place to stay with grocery stores   local amenities around 
416476218,Great place location  very hot in the winter though because of the radiators The heat was very high I dont know if you can control that though because of the radiators  but otherwise thank you  it was great    
415831982,No cuenta con parqueadero  es mejor buscar donde dejar el auto  si es que se va con uno
582747210,I really loved this space  It was very stylish and stunning  The bed was super comfortable and the shower was very relaxing    My only negative critique of the place was that there was a lot of construction in the building  This started promptly at   am  There were loud thuds and hammering both in the hallway outside the space as well as what seemed like the unit above us  I am sure this construction wont last forever  however  it may be something people staying soon may want to consider before booking this place  No  it was described accurately  The only thing is that there was a lot of noisy construction in the building that I was not expecting 
582218892,Great place  So there was a huge spider  We didnt see any others but it was huge and kind of clear looking  I understand we were in the basement but it was really big  I want to book again soon because were coming home for New Years as well  Although Im a little scared of spiders 
711846140,Location is by far the best thing about this space  close to most everything we did in KC  It was very clean  and well supplied with necessities  Only complaint is unclear check in instructions and unresponsive host  Value is excellent as well  given the location and free parking  Described unit as     B  there is only a       Jew did not work in door  had to put in long code every time to get in 
568564929,Zencitys place was very nice and clean  However  expect to have a hard time finding overnight parking  I found a SpotHero a couple blocks away and had to walk uber back to the townhome  I would add specifics about the street parking on the listing  For example  listing that temporary parking is free on the same block until  pm and paid parking can be found on North ave  The parking was a challenge
412103838,Great place   clean  spacious  and stylish  Comfy bed  Wasnt able to control the heat but the building was on a cycle so it came on independently  Thank you  
411509308,The location was convenient  but the space lacked some standard touches 
410731946,This is a great place   The location is ideal  right off of   rd street and close to bars  restaurants  the Metra  and the lake   The place was very zen and its a great space  especially for the price   There is a lot of free parking around the building  The place needed a good sweep   There were dust bunnies around the bedroom   The bathroom also had a clump of hair in the bathtub upon arrival
579820799,Zen city Airbnb was a nice experience  The amenities provided were all brand new and pretty much what I expected and needed  Great  safe location  restaurants and bars right across the street  Yoga spot one block away   Everything was very clean and modern  I enjoyed my stay very much  Also the roof access and view is a nice plus to the overall experience here   During my stay there was construction done on my floor and it was bit loud in the morning but Im sure thats just a one time thing  Also I think the building could use some big floor mats because everyone dragged in snow slush   If you plan to cook here just bring spices and maybe few extra kitchenware    Overall great value for the price experience so I would stay here again for sure  Thank you for providing a brand new modern Airbnb  I would like to suggest to perhaps put big floor mats by the doors to the entrance d the building  the snow and slush made things dirty very quickly
573223894,Great place    Very convenient and safe Place was clean
722392118,I honestly just have no words lol
408099013,besides lockpad on door not working place was good lockpad to door was not working
609940040,Great location and really clean and modern  The location of this unit is perfect and is was very clean  I would suggest that the electronic door lock be replaced  The ordeal of getting back into the unit once it stopped working took about an hour 
406997303,It was okay  A little dirty and the bedroom door was busted and the bathroom door wouldnt close fully meaning anyone could open it  The bath jets feature were non working  And the table was pretty chipped up  Other than that the bed was very firm almost a little hard but you slept pretty well on it  I didnt know if the windows were thin or what but it was colder in the bedroom and you could hear almost everything perfectly going on outside  I tried to close them again and the same thing happened  It was    dollars for one night so Im not really complaining I mean it served the purpose I needed it for  Seemed like the place was falling apart kinda Door busted and bathroom door wouldnt close  Dirty plates and bowls  Dust around corners
406954245,Nice stay
406184707,Overall nice stay at Zencity place  as pictured in listing  Would have appreciated the apartment being warm upon arrival due to Chicago below zero temperatures  Hey Chris  thanks for the stay  I would have appreciated the heat being on in the apartment since supposedly there was a guest prior to my arrival  I was also able to check in earlier than expected even though you stated it wasnt available  Overall nice stay just looking for a little more hospitality 
404605400,Overall a decent value and well located to visit UChicagos hospital  Minor cleanliness issues with some hair in the shower and on the bed  but would probably stay here again for the price  Other than that  no complaints  A few clumps of hair in the shower and on the bed  as well as a minor stain on the comforter  Additionally  the electronic soap dispenser did not work so I ended up using a bottle of bath soap from the shower instead 
706961818,This was a stylish and well located place to spend a month in Chicago  Thanks  I had trouble getting in touch with the host about receiving a package 
612485136, 
405176623,fumes were coming through the vents from the unit below  me and my bf could barely breath through the toxic varnish fumes  host refused to move us to another unit  terrible customer service  fumes were coming through the vents from the unit below  me and my bf could barely breath through the toxic varnish fumes  host refused to move us to another unit  terrible customer service 
405175248,A good location  A great gym to work out in   Easy  SpotHero  parking    ft away for     to     night  heated parking garage was a plus in cold Chicago winters      Ideal only for a single business traveler  When I arrived found all of the Glassware  multiple plates and  some silverware in the drawers had been used and replaced without being cleaned    Arrival was after   am the day after check in so had to run a load   Aside from that  the place was clean 
400026388,Great place to stay in Hyde Park  Good location  no problem parking     cleaning fee 
721540559,The key fob did not work  I was told the security was supposed to fix the key fob but security told me that the company is supposed to take care of that  The door to get into the apartment was hard to unlock you have to unlock it then lock it back and keep turning it to you here click  Had to stand outside in the cold until the security guard came to let us in because the key fob wouldnt work every time we left  No parking  The view was great The apartment was clean Key fob did not work  Kept getting the runaround about who is supposed to fix it  Hard to unlock the front door to get into the apartment  Had to stand outside and wait for the guard to let us in
403347664,The place was nice but parking is horrible  The Hyde Park area is known for having first come first serve parking but this location was very congested  If you plan on going out at night  take an Uber or Lyft because Im pretty sure you wont find a park when you come back  Also  the elevators can run slow since there is over    floors so be prepared to wait a few minutes 
563662844,Did the best I could to review  We unfortunately werent able to come to Chicago bc of weather and unable to cancel bc they have strict but very clear restrictions  All I know is that communication was prompt and civil 
573571085,This place was nice because it was right next to so many restaurants and whole foods  In addition the zoo and park were right across the street  There were alot of run walk trails in the park to enjoy  This place was a much nicer stay then the previous location  Hard to find parking initially to be able to walk to location  Maybe provide a parking map of the area prior  The place was clean  There was some smell in the bathroom  Probably due to a drain issue because I could see bubble coming out of the sink drain periodically throughout my stay  This place was right next to the zoo and some nice walk run paths 
402509487,Space   Location makes it easy to feel like home away from home  Thank you so much for hosting me for another work week visit  
402216612,I enjoyed my mini getaway for peace   felt like home away from home   Thanks for being a great host  Felt like home away from home  
401050640,Great place if you going to the McCormick Convention Center  The place was acceptable  Could have used another blanket  Better functioning bathtub shower 
400570684,Nice location easy to find and chek in  close to everything 
708066603,This place was in a great location   Quick access to everything that I wanted to see  It is as pictured and is in a quiet neighborhood  The key fob was a great benefit bc without it you are left putting in codes to gain access to the building  The neighborhood is quiet and I felt completely safe going in out at night  They responded quickly to my question and resolved my concern quickly regarding the air being locked  I would stay with this company again  I would suggest better cleaning especially with covid  Just seems like whoever the last person was to clean rushed did  a half job  The appliances had not wiped cleaned  the floor was dusty and the walls in the bathroom need to be cleaned  stainless steel appliances had not been wiped  Walls need to be wiped as well  The floor could have used a mopping as well  The toiletries were helpful but not as clean as expected 
569441431,Nice stay  But no willingness to negotiate check out
578052840,Overall it was convenient  My stay there was great overall  there were a few things that didnt work in the house like the main bathroom shower was the biggest inconvenience
720460760,We arrived and had to put in a bunch of numbers to address the building then was promised a key fob to make it easier but it was missing   There is no gym access as promised  The direction to laundry were unclear and responses from the host were slow  There was a dirty lint brush on the floor when we arrived  There was also not as many kitchen tools as promised  Overall it was overpriced for what it was 
304487521,I loved this apartment  I would recommend anyone to stay here  
364938292,Its a nice apartment in a really great location  pool  gym       The staff in the building is not very friendly  Its close to different train lines  But being in the center of Chicago you can walk all distances  Great variety of shopping  and all in walking distance   The apartment could have been better cleaned  staff in the lobby was not very helpful     they could be really nicer
603708256,Nice space near downtown Difficult to get in Some crumbs on floor and counter
601049172,It is a good location and nice building  However  there were issues that were not addressed properly by the host  The apartment is stuffy  noisy and facing the parking lot 
363855835,Really nice and cute place  not far from the city but a little expensive to Uber every time  There was some mold in the bathroom and in the showers curtains and the hallway wasnt inviting but thats not the hosts fault 
363380922,Great stay 
363368689,Overall it was a very good apartment but there was a very disgusting smell of rotting meat throughout the apartment  We had to spray our own body spray in order to just sit in the common area  Overall it was a very good apartment but there was a very disgusting smell of rotting meat throughout the apartment  We had to spray our own body spray in order to just sit in the common area  The apartment was clean but throughout the place had a rotting meat smell to it both in the hallway leading to the place and inside the place 
363006050,Great price  and the view was beautiful 
362609274,This host will assume criminal activity if youre black  DONT DO IT I checked in early because i didnt have to meet the host  When i called to see if i can check in i got an approval and someone else was already there 
362606001,Apartment was clean  very stylish and comfortable  Location was what we needed too  Had a little but if issue getting in at some points because I wasnt given the key fob and the call service was unresponsive  Otherwise  would recommend 
362603667,Nice apartment but since the toilet was messed up the entire time  the building smelled and the area wasnt the greatest  I dont think it was worth the price but Im happy I got a studio to myself vs staying with others
362546497,This place is convenient and quite a bargain Thank you for your cozy place at a great value
362521929,The place was stylish and for the most part comfortable with minor adjustments  I would rent again  It wasnt that the house was filthy but a little more attention to detail would go a long way  Like wiping out the fridge from previous guest or making sure there isnt crumbs on the stove or counter tops  The kitchen trash  could be cleaned out  the throw blanket in the common area should be washed between guest  it smelled like smoke  The bed linens was so wrinkled as if it wasnt previously changed  although it was 
360442768,Value was good TV did not work could have been a little cleaner TV did not work after communicating with Chris still no luck Perty disappointed about that Late night arrival could not see address on building due to bad lighting had to get out of the vehicle with a flashlight to see the number
184389684,Location was perfect  Short Uber ride to the city or other nearby areas  Chris was a great host  Check in was effortless  The apartment has everything you need  Bathroom ceiling was moldy and gave a pretty unpleasant odor  Other than that  the place is perfectly described on the website  Chris   place was goodnfor what I was looking for  However  the mold in the bathroom  ceiling above shower  gave off a terrible odor  Not sure if thats safe for future guests  In all  I would book again as the location was perfect and the pricing was fair  Thanks again for a great stay  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  Additional comments   Whole apartment was perfect  However  there were issues with the bathroom ceiling  Significant mold residue gave out a bad odor in the bathroom    
181414174,Cet appartement a  Des avantages   emplacement au pied du m tro     stations du Loop  il est grand et bien  quip   sauf le sofa  Le lit de la chambre est large et confortable  Des inconv nients   mal insonoris   lappartement est bruyant jour et surtout la nuit  Le sofa nest pas un convertible  il est impossible dy dormir sur les coussins en pente   R cup ration des cl s dans une bo te avec code ce qui ne permet pas davoir des explications sur lappartement  quartier  et de faire part des probl mes dans lappartement    Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet    Nous navons pas rencontr  notre h te  les  changes ont  t  faits par messages sur la plate forme airbnb      Situation excellente au pied du m tro     stations du Loop  lappartement est grand  Par contre il est mal insonoris  donc bruyant car le quartier est bruyant jour et nuit  Par ailleurs quoique le lit   places de la chambre soit confortable  le lit annonc  
356523853,This is a great place to stay in Chicago  close to the green line as well some shops and just a perfect place for exploring and being able to set up shop for exploring town  I did really enjoy my stay  the one downside were a few of the cleanliness issues that I noted  The bins in the bathroom were only partially emptied   There were some nuts under the bench in the living room and tomatoes on the balcony   The bottle opener still had an old cork stuck in it 
355745862,Always like staying here when Im in town  Floors needing Vacuuming
359247253,A bit of a dated building  floors and elevator  but in a great location  stylish and comfortable furniture  Communication was great  check in and check out was super easy  Thank you for the place  it was in a great location   super easy to check in and out and your communication was great  Overall  it was great 
351665375,The place is in the town and good location 
358504135,Overall good space for a single traveler in Hyde Park  Had to sort out a miscommunication with another guest who seemed to be double booked in my room which was inconvenient  but the host worked it out eventually 
357533674,my wife and I enjoyed our time here  great location and not far from the city bed sheets were not changed or cleaned
356002818,Great location and nice place in wicker park  Thanks I really enjoyed my stay  The only negatives were no coffee maker and not being able to get mail  Some of the furniture in the living room was very flimsy especially the couch which needs to be replaced  Would also like to see more utensils for the kitchen as well  Other than that I really enjoyed my stay  Fantastic location in wicker park and overall a very nice place   Thanks
354938852,Great location  place was just as shown in the pictures  Would stay here again  Thanks for being a great host  
354376063,Nice place  Chris got back to me in a timely manner with whatever concerns or issues I had  Its a nice place but the quality of the furniture is extremely cheap  The towels in the bathroom had hair on them  the silverware still had caked on food  and bathroom sink drains slow 
354375609,The stay was a bit underwhelming  There was construction during the day in the hallways of the buildings  It was very loud  The heat was not working properly and the unit was quite cold  The construction also brought a strong odor into the apartment 
345948215,Great place  lots of amenities and WholeFoods nearby for quick breakfast  Friendly neighborhood 
353557932,Reasonable price  nice area 
353360028,Good trip  great place 
353150776,The place was small and like the picture but it wasnt clean like the picture  And it had a strong smell to it  Great communication and easy entry  But the smell was really bad
352685647,Fine place  Two bathroom the first or shower broken second one the water cant comedown
351667532,The best host site  Awesome location the only issue we incurred was the lack of a tv remote  Couldnt watch the television during our  day stay  However the view was beautiful 
352700655,Great view and amenities in the building  The apartment is clean  Driving to Downtown Chicago takes like    min  Street parking can be difficult specially if you come back late  I would come back  To few of everything on the kitchen  Silverware  dishes etc  Makes it hard to need to wash every time you cook instead of just putting the machine with a full load  Parking was hard to find specially when returning late 
351694629,Good location 
597124396,great stylish place next to Euclid Ave  which has a lot to offer Im not giving   stars due to the annoying pipping of the smoke detector in the staircase due to low battery 
351399365,Decent place for a good price  Not a lot of nearby parking  The keypad was hard to use     I would enter the code in multiple times before it worked Just a few webs in the corner of rooms with lot of lil bugs Not a lot of parking
582832812,Beautiful place and location
580469287,Place was great  Location cant be beat  We were right above the L and were nervous at first  but quickly realized the apartment is very  very well insulated  Never even heard the train  Walkable to so much  spacious apartment  Glassware in kitchen was dirty  Shower caddy a little rusted 
580922050,Everything was good host always got back to me   only bad thing was the WiFi issue couldnt enjoy TV while there but it was a great place  to stay thank you for the easy venture Everything was good host always got back to me only bad thing was the WiFi issue couldnt enjoy TV while there but it was a great place thank you

325056337, 
346405911,Really wonderful location and well kept apartment  Minor issue was probably due to age of complex heard creaking and pipes going off throughout the night 
709079236,Nice  clean furnished apartment with nice in building gym  Walking distance to Power   Light district  Checking in late at night was a little difficult  but Zencity was available for contact and resolved the issue quickly 
551782972,Nice area lots to do and everything in walking distance  Wish parking cost was included  Bug
349146275,Great location  Space was clean   Was a bit more dated than I expected but was very comfortable  The walkway up to the apartment was pretty terrible which made the first impression a bit negative but overall the apartment was comfortable and clean   Host was available with questions and accommodating
595727781,The location is great and the space is very comfortable
346997495,This place has a great location if you are visiting University of Chicago  It also was very easy to get downtown  There was a Target right next door as well   I valued having a kitchen  It was also easy to independently check in and check out  Overall it was good  There were small things like nails on the floor  and I almost stepped on them barefoot  I moved the nails to the coffee table   Also  Friday and Saturday morning  the living room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke  I opened the windows  and it took a couple of hours for the smell to go away  In the meantime  i just stayed in the bedroom 
346714906,prompt responses  great host and properties thank you for taking note of the issues 
177707198,The apartment is clean and comfortable  with modern furnishings and amenities  Its a studio with a nice view of the pool and still has plenty of space  The location is great  walking distance to shops  restaurants  etc  Check in didnt feel super secure  though  and the host didnt disclose that a major crime had taken place in the unit next door just a few days prior to my arrival  Hi Chris  I was really surprised to arrive at the unit and see tape on the door next door indicating that the Cook County Medical Examiner had sealed it off  It looked like a death had taken place  and sure enough  after some research  I found that a gruesome murder had occurred there just a few days before I arrived  I know this is totally not on you  these things happen  but I would have appreciated a heads up  It was quite shocking  and although I liked the apartment  I was pretty creeped out the entire time   Did not disclose information about a major crime that had been committed in the unit next door  
346398860,Easy entry  great location  true to photos 
673992093,Great location downtown  If youre staying during the week  just know youll need to figure out a parking set up if you have a car with you  But on the weekend lots of parking was free  Really great place if you want to walk around downtown Riverside etc  The A C wasnt really working  so at the end of the day when it was warm outside  the unit got very warm and took most of the night to cool off  But we loved the location  Great place to stay  The instructions didnt correctly get us to the floor the unit was on  since we needed a key fob to use the elevator  A resident helped us so it wasnt a big deal 
345942213,The neighborhood is nice  close to restaurants  Floor 
345138235,Great view  easy entry  nice space  Chris  thanks for all your help   Over all it was a very good and easy stay   you have really nice neighbors  I dropped the top of the soap and reached behind the sink to get and picked up a bunch of hairs   Sorry to be nit picky 
582172033,Great location for Roscoe Village  North side visit  Easy self check in with code lock  Unfortunately  once inside the unit was disappointing  No pictures on walls or decor of any kind  Two couches and pool table  no coffee tables at all  Dining table was small outdoor type table with   metal chairs  The main room literally had at least    recessed lights   No coffee maker  incomplete dish set  only   bowl   Just no Chicago charm at all  Brian  please see my notes for why the value was just not there for this rental  Just take one weekends profits  do a little cleanup and some minimal decorating and tour place would be sooo much nicer and worth the rate  We were surprised bu several aspects of cleanliness  First  even though it was not necessarily dirt  all of the main windows still had half scraped construction labels on them and none of the exterior glass had been cleaned in quite a while  The floors which the owner made a point to ask us to take our shoes off for  had not been cleaned very well at all  Visible dust and dirt along the walls  The most unacceptable though was food debris on the dining room table  I have pics of all of this if you would like  After check in  we had a couple questions and sent message but never received a reply at all  We did find the wifi info but never did find out why there were single serve coffee pods but no coffee maker  This place was just blahhhh  Not a single picture on a wall  no decor of any kind  Two couches  no coffee tables  what looked like an outdoor table with metal chairs    plates  but only   bowl  the hand held shower head was completely missing in the master bath  no coffee maker  the railing at the top of the stairs wobbled a good     inches  very unsafe  the paper towel rack in the cushion was loose on the wall  the light switch for the master bedroom was on the far wall so you had to enter a dark room and walk all the way across to turn on the light  Same with the kitchen  The handle had been broken off the dryer and there was a piece of a coat hanger stuck in there  Pool table  but no queue chalk that we could find  cables hanging out below the wall mount TV  Owner was wuick to message that there should be no parties  yet this property felt like a college frat house environment  For about       you could completely change that and make this a really nice rental 
343759513,overall its a good experience to live here  bad traffic and hard to park
343179108,Historic  safe building in an ideal Hyde Park location  The place is lovely and suited me perfectly for location   the issues I had were completely fixable and I would trust to stay in a zencity place in the future  the floors werent that clean and the dishes were put away wet  water was puddled in glasses and bowls  it got hot and stuffy and the construction in the hallway for two days was awful 
342863506,Great place  Very accurate interior Building lobby  elevator and hallway was really dirty  gross smelling and shabby  In apartment   counter and stovetop and fridge not wiped down  and floor had not been swept or vacuumed  Too much   for fair cleaning work and small space 
610004876,Great for a one night stay in the city  Beautiful space 
343159695,That was a good experience the pool is Awsome and open at   am peoples are Smart  location is perfect  Chris is a interactive super host Thank you So much Chris for the Stay
610044606,The location was really amazing 
339624408,It was a good stay  But  I think it was overpriced  The couch wasnt comfortable and there were not  a lot of amenities  tooth brush  tooth paste  snacks   I just think that for what we paid we couldve been accommodated a little more  Hey  the couch wasnt very big or comfortable 
336631730,The place was nice and the location was perfect  My only complaint would be I left an article of clothing in the house  I reached out to the host not even   min after I left but i never received a response back
338468887,Overall the studio is in good condition  It is not a luxury studio  so if you want fancy  this is not for you  The location is nice  close to restaurants and campus  About       minutes to University of Chicago  depending on how fast you walk  I didnt give five stars because the bathtub was not very clean and it also had draining issue  After the water ran for   minutes  water started accumulating and covered feet  This was uncomfortable  I emailed Chris about this issue on the second day  but the issue was still not solved after I checked out five days later  Hope this issue can be solved now so the next guests can have more comfortable shower experience 
602378603,A great  vibrant space  I asked multiple times about an item that was left behind and got no response
595081744,The apartment was lovely  however  there were just multiple issues that were beyond the control of the host  A leaky roof and the entrance device had been taken by the previous guest  The device used for the parking and entering the apartment had been taken by the previous guest so anytime we went to enter we had to renter a   digit access code During a rainstorm there was an issue where the roof leaked 
337574236,The only reason I didnt give this a   star rating is due to the counter tops and stove top not being clean prior to our arrival   The location was ideal for our stay and I loved the layout of the space   The only other suggestion I would make is to add additional coffee cups  there were only   and we had   guests  and wine glasses   Aside from that  we had a wonderful time staying in the area  The only reason I didnt give this a   star rating is due to the counter tops and stove top not being clean prior to our arrival   The location was ideal for our stay and I loved the layout of the space   The only other suggestion I would make is to add additional coffee cups  there were only   and we had   guests  and wine glasses  Unfortunately  the counter tops and top of the stove were not cleaned prior to our arrival 
337541914,Very modern and stylish but slightly smaller than expected  However host did not respond to our message 
337277588,Really nice location and stylish space   Power went out in the morning so leaving down the stairwell in the dark was tricky  but nobody could plan for that and all in all it was a nice stay   Would stay again 
337223298,The room is great   it looks as it is displayed  but the apartment itself is quite old and you might want other rooms that Zencity offers if you are looking for clean and fancy apartments  Thanks for sharing your room with us 
337166479,My husband and I were very happy with our stay  Very clean and cozy apartment with awesome views  Close to restaurants and nice neighborhood  Thank you very much 
336688977,Very clean and stylish  The building itself was quite noisy  You could hear neighbors very well  Thanks 
335254879,As advertised  Thank you very much for the stay 
334310463,K dark smudges most likely fingerprints it would have been nice if there were more
334268589,This complex and apartment are pretty trendy  The apartment is definitely minimalist  which works  The location itself is about a       minute drive from downtown  Check in was very easy and the host reached out multiple times during my stay to make sure everything was fine  The bathroom still had hair on the floor  sink  and bathtub from the previous guest  Also  there was a used  still wet  towel hanging in the bathroom  Its pretty close to the waterfront  but it isnt near much touristy stuff  if thats what youre looking to do 
334258742,Great place for the value  My girlfriend and I didnt spend much time in the unit as we were out and about exploring the city so  this place is a perfect place to rest your head at night  The only negative was the odor in the hallway of the building 
333057424,Very nice and cozy
333005633,Good stay  
332975044,Basic place to stay in Hyde Park  Very pricey for what you get though 
332557996,You will be staying in a bit of a construction zone as the building is under construction   It is noisy during the day   The heating system smelled like natural gas when we tried to turn it on   I had an employee enter the apartment without our permission while I was staying there and greet us in the morning unexpectedly 
332155746,everything is good  the host is very nice  just there are some voices when you walk on the floor 
331804888,simple but nice  Was very clean and easy to find  Parking was a bit of a struggle but the place is in a nice part of town 
330632991,Great location with a great interior I just wanted to let you know that the front room bed isnt working right  We ended up not sleeping too well   Everything else was great 
331413323,Great location   Thanks for the great trip to Chicago  We loved this neighborhood   Common room ceiling looked like it may have a water stain  The jets in the tub looked old and dirty 
331023566,Good quiet place nice views of lake The place was clean but had some holes in one of the doors that needed repairing  WiFi didnt work that well over all decent place to stay
593651224,Everything was clean except comforter didnt look clean  I had to switch it out and there was no response from host  Internet was not good for utilizing tv  Thanks for hosting me  I did request a small refund for uncleanliness and no response back for the internet issues  The comforter had yellow stains and hairs  I also found a bug in the bed that was dead 
328977077,I really enjoyed staying at Zencitys apartment  The location is perfect for a short trip in Hyde Park 
329364005,Amazing location and very spacious  Small cleanliness issue  but was easily fixed with a few wipe downs and vacuuming  Would definitely come again Only suggestion I have is to do one deep cleaning to get rid of pesky bugs on the shower curtains  the rest of the bathroom and the room  Other than that it was an absolutely amazing space    Thank you so much for a great place  There were bugs in every room both dead or alive  In the bed under the sheets I found a living spider  that I got rid of  then I cleaned the apartment myself before going to sleep
329351195,Excellent location  Clean and Safe  Thanks for hosting us We had a comfortable stay 
325090570,Great spot  Pretty simple  but worked well for   couples  A little bit of a walk to get to the train  but great access to bars  shops  restaurants  We had a great time 
587257635,Nice stylish apartment  the location was great  The apartment building is still under construction  but the noise wasnt too bad  My only complaint is that the first day of my stay I woke up to find workers in the apartment installing lights in the kitchen  This is something I would have expected the host to notify me about  The first morning of our stay there were workers who came into our apartment to install lights in the kitchen  which would not be a problem  but its something I would have expected the host to notify me about 
325433113,Overall  good experience but rather expensive for what you get  its really loud at night  Theres a train that you hear consistently and planes that fly across as well  pretty expensive for a small place  to be honest  Amenities are nice though
587239831,Grate place  I would love to stay here again  Funny lil story a worker set the fire alarm off we didnt kno what it was at  st my wife woke me up by slapping me   times asking  what is that noise  I was still sleep I look at the furnace and turn the heat off and went back to bed  Other than that everything was clean perfect stay
325071840,We had an unfortunate mishap during our stay   The water lines broke one night and we had no water  i e  no toilet  shower  or tap    Zencity worked as well as they could during this time and offered an alternative location  timing made us unable to take advantage of this    While our stay was not as relaxing as I had hoped  I cannot blame Zencity and appreciate the effort they put forth to fix the issues 
324766720,Just be careful around the area at night  Dont travel alone  be wary and be viligant  Can be rough at night  Would not recommend travelling   walking to the train station alone  Always get a taxi to play it safe  Quite expensive for such a small place
322612992,With a few adjustments  the unit is okay  There is no window covering on the main door to the unit  with it being glass  Id recommend placing a curtain or blinds over the door  Soap scum on shower caddy  Hair and dust balls on sheets pillows 
323018308,Great location to the University of Chicago  easy access to downtown and other attractions  shopping  dining and more  Your directions for checking in are excellent  It could have been very confusing for us non city folks 
323461232,This place was perfect for my short stay in Chicago  It was located in a safe and quiet neighborhood  with easy access to Uber or Lyfts when traveling downtown  I would definitely stay here again  Somewhat confusing and it took a bit for them to retrieve the keys 
323076069,Everything you need for a great stay at a great location in Hyde Park  IL TV did not work    Shower drain was slow
322626720,Cute place  Great breakfast spot up the street  You should alert people to the train noise
321150946,This place was very nice and clean  Exactly what we expected when we rented it  We had a lot of trouble with WiFi  It wouldnt connect on the tv so we ended up using our personal hotspots to use netflix 
322602835,Nice modern contemporary space as presented  Clean  artsy  minimal  Check in went on smooth  host made  it a point to check in with the guest in regards to their stay  Place is recommended  Your place as expected was nice  We had a great stay  Thanks 
321916380,Good location  I stayed on a weekday so its a bit quiet but it will probably be more lively on weekends  Building is undergoing a lot of construction and was awoken at  am to construction noise  Building is very old as with all others in that area  so set your expectations well 
321066221,Good area to stay in great places to eat and really quiet area You could really use a bigger trash can for the place or let guest know where they can take out trash  And also a can of air freshener or plug ins would be great and a mat in the tub The tub wasnt clean and should have a shower mate or something if the stains are permanent
319217665,Toooooo hot  Walked in at     checked an hour later and it was now     Ac ran nonstop all night  loudly  but still never dropped below       Smoke detector hanging from the roof instead of being properly installed   Otherwise  location  the place itself  and the instructions to get in were all good  Nice location overall but the AC was terrible  It was just too hot  We were pretty much sweating all night    There was also a hanging smoke detector  instead of being mounted  Not sure if that was even functional or not  Definitely not up to code  Could be cheape
318468192,great location  right on Milwaukee ave and walking distance to lots of restaurants  also you can park on some of the side streets nearby for free  the room itself is clean and large  would stay here again  only tip is to drop your luggage at the step before parking your car  only issues were that the a c couldnt keep up with the heat this weekend  so the apartment was warm all weekend  supplying fans would be nice to counter this  also the bathroom sink faucet is very loose   otherwise great location
318391216,Perfect location in Wicker Place The additional fees made this not worth the value
318384283,Clean  well equipped  esp  the kitchen   easy check in  Thank you  Chris  for trying to get the wi fi working   I did reset it  power off on at least twice   but that did not resolve the issue   We look forward to staying in your properties again  I could not get the wi fi or the television to work all weekend   Host made efforts and checked on his end  found that his end was okay    We did okay  off the grid  for the weekend but it was a bit annoying   We stayed previously at another Zencity and everything worked great   We will plan to stay again in the future with Zencity  I know that Chicago rates climb during holidays  but it was disappointing how much more the weekend cost us compared to a non holiday weekend 
317701940,Nice base for exploring Chicago   Full kitchen  W  D  great bedroom   full bathroom   WiFi  flat panel big screen w  apps   Close to transportation  markets and some dining  though we spent more time closer to downtown  The wife and I discussed this again  and what she again wanted to communicate  was the stairwell cleaning needs    Ill leave it at that  As per prior review  the bathroom needed more attention 
315357625,Place was graat  Totally worth the cost  AC Unit did not ever really pick up on air  Space was pretty warm the entire stay 
315025563,Great location  Comfortable place  It was a nice place and we felt comfortable  A table next to the bed would be helpful  We liked the area  where we attended graduate school  The coffee shop bakery across the street is excellent  We found that you didnt respond to our message about a broken toilet seat  And while helpful  your messages about parking could have been more clear 
722379496,Great experience  Towels were pretty bad  The place was cozy  Thank you
347555347,A reasonable place  but we had problems with a sewage smell in the apartment   We aired out the house and closed the tub drain and that seemed to fix it   Otherwise  a nice place  Again  it was a reasonable place but we were disappointed by the sewage smell and the lack of responsiveness to our call  House was clean but there was a bad sewage odor when we entered   We opened window and turned on bathroom fan   We think it was coming from bathtub drain or one of the sink drains so we ran water to flush the sinks and closed the drain stoppers in the tub and two of the three sink drains    didnt see a stopper for the other kitchen sink drain   The smell went away  but came back the next morning after a shower  so we think it was coming from the tub drain   This is something that needs to be fixed  We called about the sewage smell and the phone receptionist said someone would look into it and call us back   We never heard back  Price seemed somewhat high   Not unreasonable  except for needing to deal with sewage smell 
311640354,great place and location  would stay with zencity again  the smell of mold was very strong and pervasive throughout the unit
311598461,Great little spot in Hyde park a two minute walk from the south shore   th stop  Perfect overnight getaway for my girl and I  The lockbox was a bit difficult to find as it is placed in a dark alley behind the building haha  Host was very easy to communicate with and helped us find the key responding quickly  Definitely recomend  
311588916,Beautiful place in a convenient location  Perfect if you dont mind hearing the Metra trains nearby 
113390828,As described  no frills  but great location  close to everything 
607417474,Beautiful stylish modern high rise Apetment  Well appointed  loved it  Place was great  Beautiful  spacious apartment  it was not clean   Hairs in the shower and bathroom drawers  dust accumulating on the floor in the bedroom  Otherwise wonderful
346395923,Great style and comfortable place  cons  didnt take a hot shower during my stay and smell Didnt take a hot shower during my two day stay and there was always some smell
309137367,It was so nice and clean   hey  My stay was amazing  thank you so much   However  I didnt enjoy the shower  It was only very hot or very cold 
309113130,The apartment had ants in the bathroom and large bugs crawling on the walls in the bedroom  The A C went out multiple times during our stay  if you plug in too many things at once the power goes out  The apartment did have nice furniture arrangements   Ants were all over the bathroom floor and large bugs were on the walls of the apartment in the bedroom  The A C went out the first day  and we notified the host  but it was not fixed until the next morning 
308592859,Great experience overall  Include parking details 
308020656,The pictures definitely look better than the reality of this place  The building is quite old and out dated  The shower head is old and ineffective  needs to be replaced    The worst thing about this place is the A C unit they have in the space  Its an old window air conditioner  it blows out cool air but doesnt cool the room at all  youll just be sitting there for hours waiting for the room to get cool and it wont happen    I couldnt sleep and had to check out the next day and pay extra for a hotel for the rest of my trip   I definitely recommend not staying here  theres definitely much better options closer to the city  and Zencity charges a     cleaning fee  but for what  You should invest in a proper A C unit and a better shower head  you shouldnt accept guests until you have resolved these issues  You cant run an airbnb like this and I feel cheated  
308017070,Pretty good  However  you either get a very cold shower or a very hot shower 
306888062,Good communication with the host  Sofa bed is not suitable for sleeping  The bed is very comfy  The common hallway is super stinky  
712475189,double check that apartment has been cleaned thoroughly before you book  this place smelled heavily of cigarettes and was dirty all around  had to leave and book a whole place smelled if cigarette smoke  walls were browned and chairs had grease spots   had to leave because it was not worth the money told me they would refund me and then went ghost great price   great building but not as depicted
306484327,The apt was nice clean and neat we didnt realize it was on the   th floor
244509641,Had a cozy stay  The area was nice  short drive to the city  Check in was very easy  Thanks Chris
595631990,Nice  clean  modern apt  We had a nice stay  Thank you Thank you  We enjoyed our stay  The only recommendation I would give is that it would have been more convenient to have two keys  My parents stayed with us and we were not always together 
342799736,Overall its good value for money  It was   stars experience though  and I didnt want to leave not perfect review at all  but Chris specifically asked us to leave   star review  so    Super easy check in check out procedures  Rather spacious  Big smart TV with Netflix etc  Nice Neighborhood  Close to the bus and metro stops  Kitchen area was clean and surprisingly well equipped   Chris answered all of our questions quickly  Floors in the rooms and bathroom could be cleaner  Bathroom needs several updates  broken toilet paper hanger  small chips in a sink etc  Soundproof could also be better  it felt like our upstairs neighbors were giants with cases made of stone  We werent happy with the cleanliness of our bed linens  but Chris told us where we could find a new set  though he sounded a bit sceptical about that problem  I feel like I had to send pictures of every hair and mark  not just one   Comforter case needs washing   huge yellowish stain  and we couldnt find extra comforter case in a new set of bed linens  It was the biggest problem for me  But as I said it was nice apartment overall  good value for money  Could be cleaner and also needs couple of updates  but overall it was nice apartment  thanks  I already told about bed linens imperfections  Comforter needs washing  at least comforter case  it has huge yellowish stain right in the middle and we couldnt find any extra comforter case to replace it    Toilet paper holder is broken  Chips in a sink  Hair pins on a floor in bathroom  Some random small pieces of plastic paper on a carpet  Ventilation grid falls off  living room area  
303546516,Good but AC isnt effective   Hot water used to stop while showering  AC isnt available in the bedroom  Living room AC is not effective to reach the bedrooms  
706434072,I like the apartments design and choice of furnitures  Even the plates and mugs are of choice quality  In the morning of our checkout though  unfortunately there was a nearby construction site so we woke up because of the noise  There was also a tiny issue with the slightly clogged bathtub drainage  Other than that  I highly recommend this apartment for any traveler who wishes to enjoy downtown Chicago  Its a very comfortable apartment  Everything is accessible from the building  Security in the building is also good  Hello  Thank you very much for welcoming us into your apartment  I truly enjoyed our stay here  We just noticed that the drainage in the bathtub shower does not drain fast and is slightly clogged  But other than this  everything is commendable in this apartment  Kudos 
303011341,The room was clean  quiet  nice bed and conveniently located near U Chicago  Everything was great except the room was uncomfortably warm and stuffy despite having the AC and fan on  Everything was great except the room was pretty warm and stuffy even with the AC on high  fan on and fewer lights on   Woke up sweating   Notify host and he said he will check it out the next day but it was our last day of stay   
301709341,The neighborhood is clean and quiet  but close to coffee shops and nice cafes  Check in and communication were great    Considering the price  the apartment was pretty bare bones but clean and comfortable  Its not the hosts fault  but I have to mention that the neighbors were making a lot of noise when we checked in  even though it was already dark  Folks who are sensitive to noise might consider earplugs   The overhead lights didnt work when we turned on the switches  we had to find the switches for the lamps  The wireless network name didnt exactly match what we saw  we had to try several of them to connect   Very expensive compared to what amenities are offered  
342448945,Location was great  close to stores  restaurants and U Chicago  Parking was tough sometimes  but expected  Location to U Chicago was great as was neighborhood  Parking was an issue  but we expected that  The folks upstairs were extremely loud  until about  am  Mostly just loud foot traffic  Hazard of staying on bottom floor I guess  Took a few tries to open the door  You had to pull the door handle and input code so the lock would release 
301080060,The actual apartment unit was very nice  However  the building itself was very old and the hallways smelled very badly  Thankfully the smell did not go into the unit   
589173426,Very reasonably priced for the space  Responsive hosts  Street parking can be tricky on weekend  Floors were not clean   hairs and obvious dried urine around toilet  All other surfaces seemed to be clean 
342306589,Great location
342300770,Great location if you are visiting the museum   Historic building had its charm and very secure  Hyde Park is very walkable  Appreciate the apology for after hours automated response  Suggestions for unit improvements given to host Found a pill on living room floor After hours auto reply responses should be removed
300233790,Great location for food and accessing downtown  Lots of street parking  
716311538,This apartment was very clean  spacious enough for     people for a few days   check in was horrible  Starters on essentials  If trying to find parking at night be prepared to drive around for    min or more  This apartment was very clean  spacious enough for     people for a few days   check in was horrible  Starters on essentials  If trying to find parking at night be prepared to drive around for    min or more 
340979080,Amazing home  beautiful space  extremely clean    comfortable atmosphere  A repair man showed up while I was asleep to fix items around the house   would not leave unless I let him inside  He said he had to do it at that time  I am a young girl   felt very uncomfortable  I had hours of my stay left   decided to leave early 
340345028,I really enjoyed my stay at the flat  The furniture was nice  like in the pictures and the bed really comfortable  Nice towels also  There was a lot of natural light in the flat which I enjoy  For cooking a few things  the kitchen is definitely well equipped  stove  fridge  freezer  toaster  I think a mixing bowl would be good though and perhaps a water cooker  I make tea every day    If one comes to Chicago for the university  the location is great because the Campus is in walking distance  Unfortunately the supermarket close by just had closed  for good  when I arrived but there are possibilities to shop if one walks a bit  One can take the train to Downtown  which takes       minutes to Millenium Building  Thats quite good in Chicago   I really enjoyed the included Netflix and modern TV with couch for the evenings  So I would book it again  Hi  I really loved my stay at the flat in Chicago  Thank you again for the good communication and for fixing the internet relatively quickly  For me as a woman travelling alone  I would have felt a bit safer though  if one could lock the appartment from inside  The day the man from maintenance just showed up in the flat made me feel a little uncomfortable because I dont want someone to just enter the flat when I am perhaps changing or sleeping  I said that already that the communication on this could have been better  but I guess that came through  Also  I know the building is quite old and this is not easy to work on  but the shower only from the top is not ideal  And  it was quite hard to get a stable temperature in the flat  because the heating  when turned on  would heat like crazy and sometimes one couldnt properly switch it off  But I grew up in an old building like this  so I know it is quite difficult to do anything about that  Thank you again for your hospitality  Cups and plates were perfectly fine  but the drawer with knives and forks needed a little clean up  Also  I find it great when there is a little bit of salt  pepper  oil  because that is really annoying to buy  But there was lots of food in the fridge  When I finally decided to take some of the ketchup I realised it was expired in summer       It would be great if someone could check on those things  But I have to say  I hate throwing things away  so I think it is a good option to leave something for the next person  It just requires Zencity to check from time to time 
714939636,                                                                         
293162648,Just a heads up to future travelers  this building is very much under construction as of July       The description says  a quiet getaway  and that is definitely not what you are going to get in this apartment  Its very loud and felt like you were in a construction zone during the day  The workers are talking  yelling   using power tools right outside our door on the  th floor    Would have been nice to know ahead of time that the building was under construction and to expect some noise during our stay  Also  internet was very very spotty  Lost internet TV service for    minutes at a time  about   times a day while we were staying here  Also  this wasnt an issue for us  but  you do have to walk up a lot of stairs to reach the apartment  It was fine for us but I could see it being an issue for others    Other than the construction  which Im sure is just temporary  the apartment itself is exactly as shown  Very clean and nicely decorated  Had the basic amenities  The best was firm but comfortable  It was extremely quiet at night  which is nice since youre on a very busy street    The location is fantastic  very close to many bars   restaurants and right by the Damen blue line CTA station  If the construction doesnt bother you  this place is absolutely fantastic  But if youre looking for a quiet place to relax during the day  this probably isnt the place for you   It was extremely disappointing that you did not mention the fact that there would be ongoing construction in the building and on the floor we were staying on  It was extremely loud and uncomfortable having workers yelling back   forth to each other throughout our stay  Power tools being used at very early times  definitely not the  quiet  getaway as advertised  
292731234,This was a nice apartment and really clean     
292673987,Its a good base   clean and pretty comfortable  Definitely does the job 
291912553,The apartment is in a very cute neighborhood and we really felt like part of the community  Great food within walking distance and the building was quiet  We had a great first experience using Air B B 
291376854,Good place  Location has really challenging parking  No recommendations to whats in the area  Response time just okay 
291371923,Excellent s jour pour quelques jours   Chicago  A recommander   Quartier sympa pour le soir avec un logement calme et proche de la boue Line pour le centre et la roport  A recommander Merci pour la disponibilit  de lhote  Climatisation bruyante
290079008,Great location but more hotel than home away   Although you have a lovely looking apartment  It was very obvious that no one lives here as a number of essentials were not in place from the start to the end of my trip  Internet  Iron  TV remote  blocked bath tub   Took a while to verify key handover   Gaps in information  I had people coming into the apartment without being notified
285369518,Apart from some problems with the sink and the laundry during our stay  we enjoyed our stay  Towels and linens could be cleaner  but we werent too bothered  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  towels and linens  bathroom  kitchen 
283296097,Lovely space  Great location 
172684951,We stayed here to go to U Chicago   For that  turn right from exiting the building and that is an easy walk   Turn left from exiting the building and you get to the restaurants and grocery store   While we are not from Chicago  we are also from a pretty dangerous city   and I wouldnt recommend walking around   especially going to toward the restaurants and grocery store in the dark   This appears to be a newly renovated room in an old building   We were surprised about the window air conditioner   The place was fine   A hotel for one night might be just as good if not needing a kitchen  The TV    not sure what the issue was but we tried to get it to work and tried   Hot water in the shower   need to put directions      The pillows on the couch were kind of disgusting   The key on the scooter is a good idea  but when I opened the box it was half full of rusty dirty water   The piece of silverware and the pot that I used were not clean   I didnt look at the rest  
711483427,Super host  great value and great location  But its so hard to get any response from them at late hours  Floor is sticky and bathroom wall has stains 
282902716,This is an awesome place that you will want to spend more than   day at  I would stay again  Also   there was limited street parking available  Its a beautiful property in a beautiful neighborhood I did find hair on the restroom floor  in the hallway   Jet tub looked a lil suspect and the upstairs toilet seat should be changed out  Also   i tried my hardest to get thre patio open multiple times and couldnt   I was disappointed i couldnt experience it 
604841659,Great location and view  Directly above Taco Bell  Overall a good stay  The needle on your turntable is missing  so the records wont play  And  the handle on the faucet in the bathtub is broken 
333747730,Nice and well kept place with great views of the lake  It is a little tricky looking for parking if you dont plan to come back to the apartment by    pm  Otherwise everything was great from the host to the apartment suite  Great place just hard to find parking if you plan on driving 
234145370,Great spot if youre looking for a more low key experience  A bit small but very comfortable to stay and the price was for sure reasonable
171002431,Very clean and Chris was very responsive  One note  we stayed on a Saturday night and got very little sleep because of the noise from the neighbors and individuals outside  
710079723,I was doing a staycation with my partner and this location was excellent  Easy parking and close to so many restaurants and shops with a Target right down the street  The unit itself was cozy and easily accessible  Thank you for taking care of our issue with the door handle as quickly as possible  I appreciated the ability to get ahold of you so late in the day and to be followed up with again later that evening 
171500137,Great spot  A few broken items in apt  including a curtain rod  a closet door  and a drawer on entertainment center  I really enjoyed my stay  great location  and cool old building  I would definitely stay again  Thank you
709180165,This is a lively and quiet space  It was my second visit and I am sure I will be returning  The place is so great  I am sure I will return again  Hope the kitchen faucet issue gets worked out  it splashed all over the place 
332560086,It was really bad experience  I dont recommend this apartment or host at all   While Im sleeping someone tried to open the door by the code and the end she entered right and she told me that she wants the other floor but my concern that how other people can open and know the code of this apartment  Also  the host isnt responsible at all  I cant reach her  so at the midnight I left the apartment and she called me on the morning shell send someone to change the code thats what she offers after all bad experience happened  I really advise everyone to not book this apartment if you care about your safety and have family  They dont have any responsibility 
279394233,Delightful little apartment with great sun in the morning  Chris was very quick to respond to messages and check in was easy  The location is near lots of neighborhood conveniences  There is an in house washer dryer  but if its not working  as we experienced  at least one laundromat is right around the corner 
277569980,Good little place to stay  The neighbors next to the apartment was a fun crew to hang out with  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom 
277531693,I wish I would have know that the host asks guests to lie about staying with Airbnb when they check in  For reasons unknown Chris requested adiminantly three times that I not mention Airbnb when checking in with the building doorman   Chris never checked in to see how the stay was going   Everything else about this apartment is normal  however you can tell the apartment was finished on the cheap and is bland as if the host never spent time there   Compared to other Airbnb stays  this apartment has a great location but has uninterested host  If Chris wants to be an excellent host I am sure he can learn from this and improve    Host requests guests lie about staying with Airbnb  
276742111,Lovely location and balcony  Walls paper thin but quiet neighborhood  Bathroom was not great but livable  Had problems with plumbing all week We are not picky   but living with a smelly sink all week was pretty nasty Some issues throughout   windows really dirty  bathtub jacuzzi nozzles disgusting  Sink clogged and smelled like sewer all week   did not come to fix despite repeated communications Said he would come to fix sink all week   did not show Expensive for what you get here  Location great   all else mediocre
276422555,Great location and beautiful space  Very clean 
276394848,nice location  good for   to   persons stay   Thanks  Chris  Mostly we had a good stay other than the last night  we were ubable to get help from you to fix the outrage  issue  we had to call the building person ourself midnight   Please  locate where the the eletrical panel yourself first  Thanks again  electricity  was out one night 
607740782,Great location in Hyde Park  good communication with host and checking in  Comfortable space as well  The only issue I had was with the cleanliness of the common space  The couch wasnt clean at all  glad to have an extra sheet to layover it  Id say more accurate photos of the living space and the quality of the couch wouldve helped 
707150718,Nice place photos dont do it justice  Shower is amazing  Bed is comfortable  but a tad awkward to get into since you have to step up and onto the end of it  Kitchen is nice  but the drawers are a nightmare to use  dont plan on cooking much aside from maybe making instant ramen or reheating takeout delivery  since there isnt much to cook with  Comfy couch and chair in the living room  In unit washer and dryer is a huge bonus if you have an extended stay  remember to bring your own detergent and fabric softener  Thanks for the stay  the pictures online dont do the place justice  However  there were no paper towels to help me clean up after myself  so I needed to buy some for the duration of my stay  Also  the bench at the end of the bed broke when I sat on it  for the first time  on the last day  and scared the daylights out of me  I was glad I wasnt injured  Glassware in cabinets was all dirty  had to run them through the dishwasher before use 
567442265,The apartment is spacious  nicely decorated   and would be great for multiple people  The kitchen was well stocked  Bed was very comfortable  Apartment is a  th floor walk up   there is no elevator  Couch was pretty narrow and not very comfortable  Thank you for being so responsive  In apartment washer and dryer
567136249,The location is fine  However  the impression of the pictures is misleading and cleanliness is an issue  The place is just worn down and needs a remake  All written above  Carpets are done and someone needs to clean the apartment and wet clean the floor until its not sticky anymore  The place was not wet cleaned for a very long time 
567422593,A clean  spacious spot  with a nice shower 
720992500,Our airbnb was a wonderful stay  My boyfriend and I stayed there for a week  the area is very nice with restaurants  Whole Foods right next door  and an amazing atmosphere all around  The only thing about the area is that there is no designated parking area right outside of the apartment unless youre lucky enough to get a parking spot out on the street  But  there is a parking garage about   minutes away from the apartment and meter parking as well  The apartment was very very clean and so cozy  I would absolutely recommend booking with them   Thank you so much for hosting us for the holiday season  my boyfriend and I are long distance and getting together is so important to us  and having a beautiful space around an amazing area made it even better  There were only a few times where response time was slow but other than that  contacting during the day was a breeze with fast responses
330492162,This is a good place in Hyde Park  It is very professionally managed and we enjoyed our stay 
268634410,Everything was great Most of the dishes were dirty Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen 
166862846,Nice clean apartment on a high floor  The location was very convenient as a base for traveling anywhere in the city  The only downside is that the check in process turned out to be more difficult than expected  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  check in arrangements 
261520742,Nice place  Great location  We made an error with our checkout date so apologies to the host  Great value 
714720174,nice for the money 
582210073,Apartment is cute  few discrepancies that need to be addressed  Overall experience good  Shouldnt have had to contact host for checking information  should have been in my box  Tub and sink full of hair   Kitchen floors full of debris hadnt been swept   Couldnt lock apartment door from inside of apartment  check in on Friday wasnt fixed until Monday  Location good  parking at a toss up 
259294634,Simple but comfortable and very quiet  I liked the books on the shelf 
258148512,I feel a responsibility to share that I was burned by an uncovered radiator that was flaming hot in this place  The radiator is in the bathroom  My stay was during the last weekend in April    I ended up in urgent care and have been in pain    and I know I was lucky it wasnt worse  I do hope Chris will have these covered soon to prevent future injuries  and have suggested this  Other than my burns  this is a pleasant and very clean apartment in a convenient part of Hyde Park  The radiator must be covered to prevent future injuries 
600980071,It was very easy to check in  Location of the unit was convenient with a cool view and cheaper than most  Would recommend to anyone travelling to Chicago 
326598360,Great communication  nice renter  Thank you for letting us stay and for the very quick responses to our questions  There were a couple bugs around  nothing crazy  but I just dont like roaches 
256367402,Exactly as advertised   Great Hyde Park location
256356543,Visiting family in Hyde Park and enjoyed our weekend visit at Chriss place 
254908961,Very clean and quiet place with all the basic necessities  Perfect for someone visiting the University of Chicago or doing research there  Thanks for the hospitality  A very clean and quiet place with all the basics  And sorry that I messed up the ending reservation date  My fault entirely   Good for visitors to U Chicago  but of course  its not The Loop or sexier areas of the city    Not a critique of Chris  but I found the Airbnb prices a bit high in general for Hyde Park  
714715335,Be prepared to pay a lot for parking but the stay in the loft was doable  The furniture is very low to get in and out of  So bring extra pillows  We made rhe most of our stay but i would like to see somethings done a little better  Like doors that lock naturally  not so low furniture  it made it hard to ger in and out of  cleaner walls there were a lot of scuff marks  But we did make the most out of and found ways to enjoy our stay  Thank you again  Directions were a little vague The apartment could have been cleaner  and walls cleaned a painted  Downtown with no parking except after enforcement hours   no near by parking
254893000,Very convenient to a nearby Metra line  clean  reliable commuter rail to downtown  and University of Chicago   Its a decent  basic solution to lodging if youre on a tight budget  Chris was also very good at communicating   Significant accumulation of items in closet area  i guess for storage   Clearly off the beaten path of main Chicago attractions  but of course the customer know that a priori  Convenient to University of Chicago and Metra  however   
254695879,Great place
709886205,Communication was top notch  Among the best in customer service  Accurate listing and great pricing  I will definitely be using their services again  Loved the place  Communication was fantastic   Great customer service  Among the best  Carpet was not vacuumed  I went to do a floor workout and there was so much hair and stuff on the carpet that it stuck to my shirt  There was also   lightbulbs out    Other than that it was great 
249679185,Nice place and near many things  Good for a weekend trip  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  late host 
248081382,Super clean  stylish and convenient to U of Chicago  Chris is a good communicator  Would stay again if in the area  though there was a faint mildewy smell in the room  There was painting going on in the hallway so not sure if they may have been ripping old wood out that may have contributed to that odor  Great place and location  There was a moldy smell in the apartment even though it was super clean 
702741811,Dont plan anything for the start of your trip because the room might not be ready on time  We had to wait over an hour in the cold for them to finish cleaning our room and provide the key  The room not being ready at our check in time was very disappointing  Financial compensation would be appreciated and then I would increase my review  We were late to our dinner plans  had to stand out in the cold  and created conflict between my girlfriend and I  Extremely disappointing  Our check in time was      and the room wasnt ready  We had to stand outside in the cold for over an hour before we could check in  This was a very disappointing start to our trip  We wont be using this company again 
321561700,Clean and simple place to sleep  Chris thanks for the place to sleep  Clean  AC was off and there seemed to be a bad odor perhaps from an animal Over priced for location and amenities  Just a good place to sleep  Added fees seemed excessive 
243937372,Nice place  cool style  the neighborhoods a little sketchy but overall it was alright 
316177001,Zencitys apartment was super clean and very conveniently located close the the University of Chicago  The bed was VERY comfortable but the futon in the living room was not so much   This apartment is perfect for one or two people exploring Chicago  visiting the University or the medical center  I felt very safe in the neighborhood  
243078569,Good location very close to UChicago
240865091,Booked Chriss place for a last minute trip to Chicago  Chris was very responsive when issues came up  and the location was great  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  towels and linens  shower  odors 
316133612,It was a very clean  and comfortable stay 
342335073,Brians place is fantastic  the space was massive and comfortably fit a large group of us  The pool tables and large TVs were great for when we wanted to hang at the house  and the location was walkable to a  variety of restaurants  coffee shops  and a couple bars  The place is pretty bare as it seems the property is only maintained to host Airbnb guests  but it had almost everything we would need for a short weekend stay  If we were staying longer  we may have needed a few more household items  I think the house could use more basic supplies such as extra sponges  paper towels  trash recycling bins  plunger  Furthermore  would have been nice to know the wifi issue beforehand but we made it work with local coffee shops  Only one issue with a delayed response for Wifi issues  Otherwise he was extremely responsive and helpful 
157388501,Nice stay at Chriss place  Very spacious  and some positively unique elements  Slept two on the bed couch  but comfort and privacy probably best for one person or a couple  Overall  pictures and description are accurate  the noise from the upstairs neighbors  whimpering dog  was very present and did get old at times  The neighborhood was pleasant and conveniently located    It more or less looks like the pictures  though the dim lighting and grungy aesthetic make it less comfortable     The loft is spacious and interesting in a good area  but would welcome soundproofing efforts and improvement on the aesthetics   
314320639,Nice 
235178824,My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay Chris I received your message about the shower curtain but it was too late to pay you via this app  do you by chance have the square cash app or google wallet so I can reimburse you  So sorry about the makeup  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  odors  Additional comments   The apartment smelled of feet  Mild feet  Other than that I was rather pleased  Nothing a little febreeze couldnt help  
314306033,For the most part clean  In a nice neighborhood  check in was easy  Was a good stay  It was a good stay  other than the stain on the duvet which may have been bodily fluids  Everything else was clean  It was a nice neighborhood as well  I would suggest they tell about parking because I wasnt aware if I could park behind the building or find parking on the street 
233652898,The house is in a great area in Chicago  Half way from Downtown and funny areas like Wicker Park Logan Square  Amenities are above average and youll feel welcome right off the bat   Great responsiveness of the host  Thanks for hosting  I can just suggest to share earlier Wi Fi credentials  maybe a little note on that white board    
600430207,Great location  space and value  Close to local amenities and great communication with host  Check in was quick and easy and we felt very safe  Thanks for being a great host for our first time in Chicago     wed certainly stay here again Needed a bit of a vacuum but didnt hinder our stay 
313562981,When in the actual apartment  I found it nice and in a great area  It was lacking a microwave and was a little hot  but other than that I enjoyed it  However  after my stay  I got a      request to pay for a supposedly broken couch that I sat on for less than   minutes which was definitely weird and confusing  Not exactly sure what was up with that  I would book again but cautiously  Perhaps take pictures beforehand    
591200305,Great price for such stay
231954751,Great stay   thanks
590769839,Its a cool and affordable to stay  Parking is troublesome at night 
311606938,Correcto Es mi primera experiencia con airb b y aunque fue bien  la llegada al no encontrar las llaves en el cajetin fue un poco estresante  La persona que vena de limpiar fue abrupta   Llegamos como a las   y las llaves no estaban el el cajetin  Preguntamos a una persona que salia y resulta que habia estado limpiando el apartamento  Si hubiesemos llegado a la hora de check in hubiese estado sin limpiar   El pasillo al apartamento estaba sucio y ol a mal Lejos del centro
589153622,Location was great and our room had some nice modern touches throughout the space  The game room was not fully in tact  pool table missing pockets  shuffleboard had no sand pieces   Front desk was helpful 
589298986,Very nice for the affordable price  easy check in with the doorman  easy to find with address  Only problem I had was with parking  I spent about    mins after arriving circling the neighborhood for a place to park  I highly recommend making a plan for parking before arriving  Parking was a nightmare   definitely make sure you plan for parking before your trip 
589194993,Location was great  Nice building  Clean  The location was great and it was clean but it was not very comfortable  That couch is not a good place to sit  Just felt a little cold in there 
598176962,Nice place with an amazing view Try to get fresher blankets  towels  etc  They towels and sheets had stains
227027572,Good
226259645,Nice appartment with all the appliances youd need  walls are a little thin though and Chris got pretty rude when we checked out    mins late   Having let him know in advance we were a little late waking up   Thanks for having us stay  Not sure whats happened with the towels so sorry for any mix up   CHECK Out  
310518338,Very nice safe area   I would definitely stay again   My stay was ok  i had issues with the apartment door  The key wasnt working  I had to play with the key for a little while before i gained entry  The tub was dirty and had hair in it  The water did not go down which means the drain was stopped up  The bathroom trash was full  
586138254,Dont rent here if you have a car because you will never find a parking spot Reserve a parking spot for those who rent this place  I can never find a place to park my car and and the tow trucks keep giving me citations I had to pay so much money for parking Parking is expensive and never found a space to park
582831266,Good place
310506993,Great place to stay  very clean inside the apartment  Thanks for being a great host  the place was great  may want to look into cleaning the outside because we seen a few roaches in the hallways and also the different keys was a bit of an inconvenience  Other than that  everything was great 
310464642,Convenient location in a great area  This is not someones true home  more like a hotel property  which means its very clean and empty of personal belongings  The host is incredibly responsive  A few oddity of the apartment   mirrors hung very low  no hooks for towels  the couch is not comfortable for sitting  So I would recommend it for a visit where you arent going to be spending much time at the apartment  but not if you want a place to relax for many hours   
221490972,Great place  look so just like the photos good place for couples or people needing a clean space in a convenient neighborhood  Nice clean spot perfect for you on your travels or couples looking for a nice Air Bnb 
714928785,Very misleading when they told me the parking was      per day  for the garage parking when we were charged     for parking there for   hours and    for only    minutes  Kitchen is NOT equipped to cook or even eat really so bring your own if you plan to eat here  Besides that it was clean and looked nice  Its on the corner so theres plenty of natural light and a decent view  Perfect if you just want to have somewhere to chill at the end of the night  sleep  and shower  The garage parking was WAY more than the    a day you said it was  We were charged    for when we parked in the garage and put our things away and then left  approx     minutes  and then were charged another     for when we parked in the garage for approximately     more hours  I would suggest being more clear about the parking costs if youre going to even mention it at all  Also you might as well just take all the cooking stuff out of the kitchen if theres literally     of the tools you need to cook or eat any kind of decent meal  We would not have been able to find the lockbox if not for the AMAZING man at the front desk  It was stated to  see photo  but no photo was sent  Besides that it was decently clean and looked nice  The netflix was a good bonus as well 
142527147,Chris is very responsive and there were some very nice touches  such as leaving snacks   I stayed during a cold couple of nights and was freezing  the radiator heat didnt work that well and there was no wall thermostat  one of the knobs had come off the radiator and this was how you controlled the heat    Place was pretty charming and clean overall  but could use a good thorough dusting and vacuuming   Great location  a bit noisy on the  th floor  walk up  from outside   Occupancy  cleaning and AirBnb fees added up and I wouldve saved money with a hotel   Im getting less enthused about AirBnb        Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  floors and carpet   Given the occupancy tax  cleaning fee and airBnb fees  this isnt really a bargain  
307067894,Space was in a great location and clean   Thanks again for letting us stay at your place    Space was great however there were a few things that could have been better  For some reason the thermostat we had set at    yet we could not get the temp below      Also there was a lot of construction that was going on downstairs that was extremely loud  I work nights and could not sleep during the day because of the heat and the construction noise  Because of the reasons  I would not want to rent your place again unless this issue was finished fixed    Maybe warn guests about the construction  If I did not need to sleep during the day it probably would not have been a problem   
197181662,Great location to explore the marvelous city of Chicago Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  odors  floors and carpet 
200497292,This was exactly as advertised  Super clean and roomy for a studio  The neighborhood has a lot to offer within walking distance  We could walk to the Museum of Science and Industry  If you are doing lots of city activities  theatre  tours  etc this may be too far south  We never did end up watching TV  We were able to get audio but no video  Didnt have lots of down time but    maybe a small guide with directions  on the  clicker sequence  would be helpful   We spent more time down town so this was a bit far  Hyde Park is a great place but we didnt have time to explore all the shops and restaurants close by  
140947154,Nice quiet spot in a great location  Shower is a bit weak though  Good spot  great location  weather was not great but not your fault 
195537911,Very close to train and restaurants   Apt is clean   Chris is very accommodating and available   Has a window AC unit  so did get hot at times  I would stay there again 
188523608,Had a great stay  Would recommend staying here  perfect location  easy to get around and specious appartment 
301081790,This high rise luxury apartment offers spectacular views from the   th floor  Location is central to many fun Chicago attractions and directly across the street from the incomparable Gibsons Italia restaurant    One note of caution regarding sleep  If youre a light sleeper  please know this unit sits right above the train tracks  You would think being    floors up would provide a sufficient noise buffer  but that wasnt the case  When the trains roll through it is very noisy  Otherwise it was an excellent place to stay   Overall the place was comfortable and clean throughout  The shower curtain could definitely use some TLC or even be replaced  
709231941,While the location of the unit and the host communication were stellar  the cleanliness of the unit was not  To be honest I was very disappointed in my stay  Besides not being able to work the TV because there was no remote  and the Roku apps I downloaded did not work because there was no way to turn the TV on  was the least of my disappointments  The countertops had dried soap on them  There were dirty footprints on the floor  There was a Dorito on the floor behind the couch  Most upsetting of all was I found two different kinds of hair in the bed  I seriously think the unit was not cleaned after the previous guest checked out  Two different kinds of hair lead me to believe this to be true 
183601489,Pretty good location   My only real complaint was the bathroom was less than stellar but livable for a short period 
182030588,Nice place Tub was slow to drain  Had difficulty locating lock box  
613278442,Great location  comfortable space  great mattress and beddings   Roku TV with the works   Easy  enjoyable stay  Thanks  Enjoyed the place  Cheers  Cleaning service left dirty dishes in the sink   Not a huge deal though   Rest of the place was clean 
297848816,Looks just like the pictures  Cute and modern  Would recommend 
172677030,Overall  a good place to stay  It pays off your cost  Your guest had some difficulty communicating with you at this part of their trip  host unreachable 
168562797,Totally central to everything    So perfect to get to all the spots in Chicago  Can be noisy but its a minor detail compared to all that the area has to offer  Thank you for everything  
296350083,Very close to Wholefoods and bus stops that will get you many places    The place is quite spacious  Landry was hard to find   It was a little hard to get to from OHare  I was suggested Uber or Blue Line  However  it would be really great if the cost and time it takes to get to were also mentioned so that I could make a comparison and make a decision  By the way  you can take Blue Line to some parts of the downtown but not to Zen City  It is hard if you have a big luggage    There was a partial view of the lake from the room  which was nice   There was no concierge when I reached there  The janitor could not help me  I had to wait until he came back but as I tried to check in  he was training the janitor   I asked about the laundry but there was no reply  I found out about it on my day   at night  It was too late to go and buy detergent or fabric softener  
158174363,The place was as advertised  A great location for getting around downtown Chicago  I will go there again when I am in town for business  Chris communicates instantaneously which is a huge plus  Thanks Chris for being accommodative  
152669312,Really good location and it was very easy to get around the city from this apartment  Space is pretty small but definitely checked all the boxes for what we needed  
144847140,Good spot close to downtown Chicago in walking distance to Magnificent Mile and Millennium Park   thanks for having us   Manuals could be more detailed  
715230841,Great space  Thank you the stay was awesome 
143600858,Chris was a great host  providing great detail and support leading up to checkin  His studio is the right amount of space for     people  clean and comfy bed  The only downfall is that I could hear his loud neighbors upstairs very  very clearly every night  Walls are thin in that building  Other than that  you can never go wrong staying in the Gold Coast area as its super central to everything  on a quiet block  
143198617,This place has a great location and is close to many good restaurants and bars  Although at night it can be a bit noisy outside from the streets and the Internet was sometimes sketchy  the experience staying there was overall pleasant  Thank you for having us  We enjoyed our stay  Key lock was bit troublesome  
142926905,The place is very clean and in a great location  Check in is easy  even though getting the keys to the apartment is a bit awkward  All in all  recommended for a short trip to Chicago 
142287332,Everything was better than expected and the location was fantastic   Per other reviews  bring summer jammies in the winter   it does get warm in the apartment  My stay was great with the exception of the HEAT   I understand the radiator situation but even with the windows open AC on  it was still like a sauna 
182471532,Other than the floor being freshly stained  Brian was quick and expedient with responding to our needs  Great location and place  Thank you for letting me and my friends stay  And for the quick replies  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  floors and carpet 
483598999,Good Place Thank you
658605500,Slawiks place was a great space for my large group friends  When we entered the house  we expected   beds  and although there were   beds  one of them was just a mattress in the master closest upstairs  Theres no door either so I dont feel like it really counts as a bedroom  We didnt end up using that room and two of my friends ended up sharing the king bed    Its a gorgeous older house  but with that  comes a lot of spiders  I got bit a couple times at night and we found a handful of spiders in the weekend we were there  The cleanliness of the house was not an issue though  All the rooms were well cleaned and so was the kitchen  Overall  the house was decent  It had great common spaces  spacious areas  a ton of bathrooms  and it was only a    minute drive to Kansas City 
120088109,The space is very spacious and cozy  Location was also very prime as you are within walking distance from most attractions in the city  Check in and check out was a breeze  and Chris made everything pretty easy  He was also very fast to respond to questions    We would have rated this stay   stars if it werent for the construction on site  Chris does mention this in the profile  we just didnt expect it would be very loud early in the morning    Once this construction is over  I would stay here again   Unfortunately the construction was a huge deal for this trip  Maybe if it was cheaper we wouldnt have minded the construction  but for the price  that was a let down  Other than that  everything was great   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower 
115713481,I love the location of this house  and it is big enough  There had noise in the room  probably something wrong with condition system 
106690526,The place is warm and cozy  I highly recommend anyone who will go to Chicago for a business trip    
112911109,We felt at home in this lovely and comfortable apartment  It is located in a great location with restaurants  grocery stores  the subway nearby  and downtown at a walking distance  The apartment was as described by Chris  We will come back      
112299429,Great location  simple but convenient appartment  Chris is a great host  
108118175,Awesome place  great location  great host  If youre coming to Chicago and you want the most central location with a great spot for pretty much anything  This is it   Thanks for being so responsive whenever anything came up  You saved our stay and made it as enjoyable as possible  Thanks  
107562471,El studio de Chris result  en una gran estancia  el lugar estaba ubicado en una excelente zona residencial desde donde se pod a caminar tranquilamente al centro de la ciudad o de donde se pod an tomar diversos medios de transporte p blico  Los espacios fueron exactamente los que se muestran en las fotograf as y los servicios ofrecidos fueron los esperados  Sin duda alguna volver a a quedarme en este lugar y lo recomiendo ampliamente  
106691718,                          Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs 
535571331,Enjoyed staying here   it was a good location and a good value  There were a couple of things in the space that were still being fixed  but the hosts were good about communicating what those were in a timely fashion 
106157020,The apartment was in a fantastic location in a lovely area of the city  Plenty of welcoming bars around  Within walking distance of many of the main attractions of the city  The apartment was clean and well equipped  Slight miscommunication with the keys but quickly resolved by Chris  Overall a wonderful experience 
105971523,Chris was perfect  he answers to my all queries  the flat is well located  big and clean  A good experience in Chicago  If You have a small video to find the entrance it will be great  
105677630,Place was great  Thanks Chris  Only thing I noticed  not sure if a problem on my end or the wifi  was that the wifi was slow and periodically died   Thanks  Rob
103273437,Nice  simple apartment in the middle of Chicago downtown  Came for work and needed a place to stay so this was perfect  Has an issue with arrival  mostly my fault  and Chris was on the scene within    minutes  Thanks 
102595813,There was no problem  Everything was fine  according to what I was expecting  The apartment is very friendly and confortable  Location is perfect  near everything you need   I have no recommendation
101847236,First time using Airbnb and I loved the extra space as compared to a hotel room  Chris made it easy  Clear instructions for check in and check out  Thank you for a pleasant stay  
99677292,Great location  and clean and inviting  Building is old  so hardwood floors that you may hear the people above you  Stairway is dated  Nice high ceilings 
97480918,wonderful location and huge place  we had a bit of trouble getting in  and chris paul were so responsive  they were fantastic  no cleanliness issues at all  the wifi wasnt working at first  but it started and was fine through our stay  they even offered us a gift card for the hassle     thanks guys for a fantastic stay     ps  its right above a bar  the apartment is quiet  but if youre sensitive  bring a pair of earplugs 
97784938,He is great and very accommodating and responsive   
88963328,Place was nice but scaffolding on outside blocked the entire view which was disappointing  Towels hanging up were used and door was unlocked when I arrived  It seemed like someone had just left minutes before I got there  My first experience so not sure if this is normal 
133580385,Great place Chris was very easy to contact and had everything set up  I would say that at night it does get noisy  but that is also big city living  Great location    Thanks for having us great place very centrally located to everything we needed    
85499482,The location was awesome   The place was cute and offered what we needed   
81841529,Excellent apartment close to everything in River North neighborhood  Very responsive hosts as well  
79583112,Very convent location near restaurants and bars  Hubbard Street just a few blocks away is awesome  Downtown is within walking distance or just a short drive  Nice and clean apartment  Host was very helpfullwith any questions I had  
72148611,Great location  great space and clean apartment  Colin was great and came to meet us with the keys at a time of our convenience  Easy to get everywhere from this spot 
70557379,We had an amazing time in Chicago  We were in a fantastic location in the heart of River North  Only    minutes from Michigan Avenue  The apartment was clean and spacious  Thanks for an amazing place to stay  
580898859,Perfect location in Soulard  Excellent room with the classiest touches and amenities  The common areas were not clean and smelled of chemicals  The apartment itself was impeccable  The carpet should be fixed to protect you from any liability of someone tripping and falling over the dog eared corners  Excellent location and excellent place overall otherwise
573226779,Very stylish and clean place  Close to public transportation and a hint of seaview to the north  Parking situation has been a struggle
608847034,This apartment was nice  and for the price  a great value  Its right next to a coffee shop and has a gym in the basement  which is also where the laundry room is  no detergent available   The parking situation was my least favorite part about the trip   there was no formal parking lot  only street parking on a very busy street  No shampoo or shower soap was provided 
541667048,This unit is a very clean and safe building  unit  The location was just a few blocks from the train making it very easy to explore the city  Would definitely stay there again  Thanks for the speedy response to issues  It may be time to replace the futon  very uncomfortable for sitting or sleeping 
540495854,Charming and quaint space close to West Town and West Loop neighborhoods as well as downtown  Perfect for a couple or single traveler who likes ample space
531920370,nice place  spacious and good location  Blinds in unit are old and need to be secured   One of them fell off the wall and was missing the handle that you turn to  close the blinds 
531902115,Nice place  great location 
539137733,Good and convenient location for visitors to Uchicago 
592706844,Perfect place and location if you go in Chicago Found a few hair in both beds Thanks
592705501,If you wanna be close to restaurants and stores that are in walking distance stay here 
531496222,Nice place   Location is great  about    minutes to the convention center  Couch is awful though  Thank you for letting us stay  There were areas that were dirty  Bit pricey
528191893,Good location
538316986,Amazing location  chic and clean apartment  Noisy at night and slightly impersonal experience  Inflexible about timing  arrived an hour early in the rain  not allowed to leave bags at place  Very few amenities  soap  kitchen utensils but little else  Very noisy at night Impersonal experience
531051338,The place is in a great location  The hosts were super quick to respond  Great for a short trip  However  a fan in the bedroom would have made the stay better  The stay was pleasant  But a fan in the bedroom would have been better
589782779,The value of this place seemed great  It was my first time in Chicago and the location gave me easy access to the other areas of the city  The restroom was dirty  Itd be better to have a deep clean before having guests 
534317539,Great Location  and walking distance to the Lakefront  I sent a private message to you  Didnt know there was a special section   Location was great   The lakefront is walking distance and blocks away  I love Hyde Park  I had a great time eating and visiting this part of the city  Check in was easy  and the Door persons were engaging and friendly  Chris at Zencity checked in to make sure I was enjoying my stay 
594473218,Nice location and apartment  We were disappointed in  our stay as we had issues checking in and with amenities in the apartment  Keys were mixed up and somebody had to come figure out which key we needed  Not helpful  generic responses that didnt resolve anything
530947268,Overall  the apartment was in a good location  clean and good value   My only issue is that the pillows were uncomfortable   If you pay a good price to stay then I would expect to have good pillows and a comfortable bed  otherwise id stay at a hotel   The place overall was great   Kitchen had all you need to comfortably prepare meals and had a dishwasher for easy cleanup   The Hyde park area is really nice and very beautiful   There are a plenty of parks  amenities and very accessible with good public transportation     Taking the bus to downtown Chicago takes no more than   min  so it was very convenient and nice to be outside of the city grind but nice to be close to it as well   Had a great time and will consider staying at Hyde park again
530182794,Everything was great except the bathtub was clogged  Excellent Central west end location  Everything was great except the bathtub was clogged 
722574360,Great location  Cozy  The bed was amazing   Could improve on cleanliness  then it would have been perfect   All in all  I would stay here again  When you enter the apartment building from the side door  there is a strange odor just as you enter  Floors were dirty and sticky  Left my socks unusually soiled   The drawers in the bedroom were dirty inside  The drawers in the kitchen had sticky food stuck in them  The oven mitts were soiled with red sauce  The countertops had debri on them  I loved the place  Great location  Well furnished  Fully stocked kitchenware  The bed was so cozy  For the first time ever  coming home to my own bed was a disappointment  If the place would have been well cleaned  I would give   stars across the board 
567811568,Attentive host   Nice place   Good value  Thanks for being a good host  Cold air return vent in bedroom covered in dust   Food crumbs on floor at base of bar stool area  Close to the person I was visiting
722378517,Fantastic location and nice sized space for     people  The sunroom is absolutely fantastic and was my favorite place to spend the morning with breakfast  Hosts were very quick to respond to inquiries and the location is perfect for easy access to Hyde Park 
526210886,Location is excellent  Walk to get breakfast and sit in the park or on the water to eat it  Building is very nice  easy access to everything in Chicago  The rugs are gross  really should lay flooring  The bed is is very small for such a large room  Mattress and pillows are terrible  Need drapes that fit the windows so the light doesnt peer through at sunrise not allowing sleep  The rug is terrible  Dirty and dingy looking  Dust and just particles gathered up on it as well 
526155346,Very basic and simple Airbnb   perfect for those who dont need much more than a place to rest between busy days in the city  Great location and very easy to communicate with the host company  Thanks for a great stay 
524776213,Great little place with a great location  Excellent communication  This little place is great and you guys were super helpful at check in  I think the bathroom could have used a little more attention on the cleaning side  a bit of mildew in the shower and some debris on the drain  the shower door is also slightly broken at the hinge  making it difficult to open and close  Additionally the fan in the second bedroom did not work  Otherwise I enjoyed my stay and the cost and location were fantastic  as well as the communication 
524759129,The place is amazing with a great view  the building is spectacular  parking is not so hard  Hi  thank you so much for offering your place for our stay  The place is beautiful and the location is perfect and with an amazing view  Our only suggestion are the cleanliness details for future guests  Thank you   It would be really nice if one would find the apartment with a wholesome cleaning because the toilet was a little dirty the same as the bathtub that the second day got clogged  and other small cleaning details
524341490,The place is very cramped  The building had a nasty smell  The place looked very unsafe and the deadlock for the door was not working  There is lot of bleach and clorox smell in the room  I decided to vacate earlier than my stay due to these reasons and didnt receive refund  Dont stay here  The place is very cramped  The building had a nasty smell  The place looked very unsafe and the deadlock for the door was not working  There is lot of bleach and clorox smell in the room  I decided to vacate earlier than my stay due to these reasons and didnt receive refund  Dont stay here 
524318881,Great place with an even better location  Only had one problem with this place  The air conditioner did not work in the bedroom  When I reached out to them about this they said they were aware of the issue and that flipping the breaker would get it working again  Only problem is it would only work for       minutes before it stopped working and flipped the breaker  So needless to say this was not a solution and I had no air conditioning in the bedroom all week  Great place  But the suggestion to just flip the breaker to get the ac to work in the bedroom is not a solution  Not even fifteen minutes later and it had stopped working again  An air conditioner that worked in the bedroom 
579457286,Convenient location  Breezy check in process  Stylish space 
715232352,The key fob wasnt there and the response was terribly slow and non existent from the host  It didnt really matter just had to use the keypad  the listing says      fee for the missing fob  hopefully I wont be charged since it wasnt there upon check in  Place was ok  blind was broken and kinda loud next to the train but its Chicago  Some foreign hair was present throughout the airbnb   
523912058,Nice and spacious apartment only steps away from the Belmont Red Line train station and the Boystown neighborhood  The building door and vestibule need an update  Digital door lock on the door and not with a key that can easily get lost  The bathroom would also deserve an important update  Light too dim  equipments too old   The code for entering the appartement should be more simple  Impersonal process  The entry door and vestibule need an update
523878579,Outstanding place to stay 
714714527,Great value for money  Place is clean and kept very well  Theres plenty of towels  linens  and basic supplies Issue with the building access and fob key
522805230,Perfect location  clean  accessible  professional   Property is managed by Zencity  furnishings are minimal  and impersonal 
492821760,Brians place was great  Very good area  easy check in  and comfortable for our group  He was also very responsive  However  we did not have enough supplies like trash bags  dish soap dishwasher pods  paper towels etc  Hey Brian  thanks for everything  Honestly we were a bit disappointed with the lack of supplies in the kitchen  as well as the fact that when we locked ourselves out of the from door  one of us was very easily and quickly able to unlock the door from the outside  This did not make us feel as safe as we would have liked  We also would have liked to have a coffee table given the nature of our group was a bachelorette party  Because of this I would love if we could get a percentage of our nightly rate returned to us  We had to go out and purchase certain things that we felt like should have been provided 
584864779,This is a great quiet location  Enjoyed the stay 
584793964,Great location near the museum and lake beach  Elevator and halls had a funky smell
522165234,The place was clean and convenient    Pros  The location is fantastic  Close to the university and to the lakefront  Everything is walkable and stores are close by  The apartment was conveniently furnished  although not high quality  There is an air conditioner in the living room only  but all windows can be opened    Cons  The old building has very low water pressure  which has nothing to do with the apartment directly  But we did find the shower head was leaking from the sides and so the already low water pressure in the shower became more of a trickle  We did report it to Zencity and they were very fast to reply  Zencity wanted to send out a handyman  but we didnt spend much time at the apartment and probably missed them  The shower head was not fixed during our stay  so make sure to check on that    Altogether I would recommend the place  but I did find the price a bit high  Thank you  Zencity for the stay  And thank you for the effortless check in and check out  and the fast responses to my complaints  I will recommend you to others for sure  The furniture is on the cheaper side  which is fine   The shower was old and stained  but most importantly the shower head was loose  couldnt be tightened by hand  and so the water was coming out of the shower heads sides  which was an additional issue due to the already very low water pressure in the building  I feel the price could have been lower 
609315655,Location is super close to Chicago Booth and is walkable distance  Space is very clean but could use some extra amenities ie tooth brush  tooth paste  There is a gas station convenience store and coffee bar right next door  Safe  Overall  good value  Overall great stay  I detracted   point for amenities  It would have been great to have extra toothpaste and tooth brush there
580380307,Great location 
603685333,Good place to stay  Very ideal location 
608117844,The price is right  so you cant expect perfect   The floors and overall cleanliness was average   My only real issue was I arrived to no toilet paper  soap  or shampoo for a shower   There was hand soap available   The apartment is nice in a decent location but the price is indeed very good   Overall a   star experience  The floors were dirty and overall the cleaning between stays is below average 
600030997,I ended up not staying there due to the building itself  The hallways had a strong  unpleasant odor and the space itself wasnt the vibe I expected 
281360005,O apt   bem localizado e fica confort vel para duas pessoas  Acho que roupa de cama e lou a poderiam estar mais limpos  Check in f cil e o Chris responde r pido  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  kitchen  towels and linens 
281359868,Easy Check in process   Great place   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom 
557296687,awesome place  great for couples      Tub backed up from Hair clog gage
466879620,No electricity  hot water  or gas  We checked in around    pm  exhausted from a long day of traveling  The check in instructions were incorrect  so we were led to the wrong door to enter the building  When we finally heard back from the host  after waiting outside in the dark for almost a half hour  they told us that even though the instructions say  the door to the left of the lock box   and there is a door directly left to the lock box  you are supposed to go to the second door  which is further down the building and not at all referenced in the instructions  When we finally got in  there was no power in the entire unit  Again  it is    pm  we are very tired  and already irritated because we couldnt get in to the place  Again  I have to message and call the host and wait for someone to get back to me  They tell me they have to call the electric provider so we just need to wait  We waited almost an hour in the dark until the electricity was reset   After that  we are all so exhausted we get ready for bed  We try the hot water and its not working and we figure  maybe it just needs to heat up and we will try again in the morning  We were wrong  There was no hot water all weekend  We had to take ice cold showers  Again  the host told us it was a provider issue and we just needed to wait  There was also no gas   so we were unable to cook   I am not a high maintenance person  and I realize this was a relatively inexpensive spot for a Chicago stay  but electricity  gas  and hot water are basic living needs  They wouldnt put us in a new place and they would only refund us half of what we paid  after I went back and forth with Airbnb all day   Instructions for check in were wrong   It led us to the wrong door  and then we had to wait    minutes to hear back from the host who finally responded to tell us  Oh yeah  the instructions say the door to the left of the lock box but really its the second door further down   This was all at    pm when we were exhausted from traveling and just standing outside in the dark trying to get in  Because its a company  you have to wait to get through to people and give them all your information just to talk to someone  Electricity  hot water  and gas 
605156051,If you are visiting Hyde Park  the location is good  You need to change shower curtain  It was so dirty 
606628212,Very stylish Hello  thank you for a great stay at your home  I wanted to give you a few factors that were noticed in our stay    There was an exceptional amount of dust on the fans and under the bed  This was manageable  However  the street parking was a bit unsettling  The car next to ours had a brick thrown into the window on our first night  This is completely out of your control of course  however  I wanted to share it with you as it was in your location and to keep yourselves safe moving forward  Thank you 
603741982,Thank you
555458133,The location of this unit it great  The natural light is wonderful   The unit has plenty of space to move around  Getting into the unit itself is a breeze with a touch key pad  We would recommend this unit and stay again  We have stayed at many in states and abroad  This unit was lovely but little information about amenities in the unit  it was a search and find and felt a little like looking through someones home   I prefer the information to be left on the table for arrival  Id rather items be setting out so they feel welcome to use  Notebooks are great with location of thermostat  coffee pot  extra towels  etc  The closest coffee shop and public transportation  Because of the later check in I feel most people arrive after dark and for us in pouring rain the instructions were fine but side of building could be better lite for ease of lock and door entrance   Trying to follow instructions in the dark pouring down rain with luggage was a challenge   We greatly appreciated the unit and its location  Hope you rent it for one night going forward as we will need a unit in this location in the future   I searched it for our next travel date and it requires a two night stay Although I understand the fees for services I wish they were advertised on the first page  This is likely an issue with  how the advertisement appears more  than the unit itself 
518989014,The two most important things about a place to stay are the bed and the shower  They are the things that you cant do anywhere else  Everything about this place except those two things was   stars  but they alone dropped it down to   stars   The bed was very soft and had an exceptionally warm comforter  Those may sound like good things  and for some people maybe they are  but the result for me was that every morning I woke up drenched in sweat and with severe back pain  Any amount of the comforter covering me would cause that part to sweat because it did not breath at all   I would recommend immediately purchasing a firmer mattress and a more breathable comforter  Ive stayed in many hotels and Airbnbs  and this is the worst sleeping experience I can remember   The shower barely drained  I complained the very first night of a week long stay  they said theyd  filed a maintenance request   and I never heard another word about it  Despite cleaning the incredible easy to clog drain grate twice myself  which was disgusting   I never managed to take a shower with less than   inches of water pooling at my feet  A disgusting way to start every day   I would recommend getting a less easily clogged drain grate  making sure its cleaned every flip  and checking that the drain is functioning properly more often  I would also recommend making sure to have someone in the unit fixing a problem within    hours of a complaint like this  Shower drain was clogged and would fill with several inches of water during a normal length shower  Complained of shower drain issue and was told a  maintenance request has been filed  but never heard back after that about anything actually being done 
281270460,Great area  
710063129,Great location  literally   minutes from shopping stores  Starbucks  bakeries  and  restaurants  Place was very spacious and bright  The host was very responsive and answered all questions I asked  Great place but will say its not the best for kids  since people live below you and floors are thin  Also cleaning could have been better and attention to detail in areas that people use the most  it made me feel certain things werent cleaned well  Please make sure sheets on bed and covers are properly washed  I saw stains as if someone stayed in the room and the person who was suppose to clean just remade the bed with the same covers  Very uncomfortable I had to get my own blankets to sleep with  Bedrooms could have been cleaner  Sheets look like they were used and not washed  also had stains on them  Dust build up and spider webs under beds and around room corners  Also the shower could have been cleaned better  I saw hair from prior guest on the walls and in the window sill 
598139630,Amazing and beautiful place to stay in  The location was perfect and had so many things to do within walking distance  Love love love  Amazing place  We had so many friends ask us where we stayed  Key was not in lock box  quick to respond but we had to wait in our room while cleaning lady cleaned around us for about an hour
598704254,Nice place and good location  but one of the neighbors smokes and the smell tended to seep in through the front door 
597445528,No complaints  everything went well   The only thing is there isnt any on site parking so keep that in mind depending on what type of trip youre taking  Over all good experience  Besides parking being a hassle depending on the time of day  everything else is good with the location 
518517468,While overall clean and safe  this unit is very bare bones and is more a place to drop ones head at night  The walls are fairly thin  and noise travels through them  as well as bathroom vents  Despite all the warnings to be quiet on our end in the listing  even when just speaking  neighbors could be heard  were coming from NYC and have a fairly high neighbor noise tolerance too   That said  location wise this was perfect for our purposes  close to family we were visiting     as well as nearby to groceries  a number of parks  the lake  and the train  but in general for city sightseeing or to from ORD could be a bit far for some  Hi there  An automatic  or k cup  coffee maker would have been much appreciated  More towel racks in the bathroom are needed  as are more essentials    shampoo  conditioner  soap  etc  Also this was noted as a new listing  but the duvet covers on one bed were torn and felt a little thread bare in general  and there was some blood on the other  Also  I realize the keypad is safe  but an override once in the unit  or an extra deadbolt locked from the inside would have felt safer 
598092998,Good Hot water to take shower
604246556,Zencity strives to provide a clean  comfortable living space at an affordable price  I will always look for Zencity properties when traveling to Airbnb locations  I would definitely recommend this Zencity property to my friends and associates and I would also come to the same unit to stay again whenever Im looking for an Airbnb location in St  Louis area  The bathtub wasnt sparking clean but was touch up clean  I can tell when extra elbow grease cleaning is done  especially in the shower and bathtub areas 
601529149,apartment was cute   nice amenities    it could have been a little cleaner   window sills could use some attention       The apartment had a very strong smell of Pot most of the time    in fact many of the apartments in the building reeked of Pot  window sills needed attention
595673466,Cool spot in a fantastic neighbourhood  but the walls are super thin and we heard all the comings and goings of the building at all hours  Floors
599324341,It was beautiful place in a nice neighborhood   Downfall was being on the third floor with a broken elevator   heavy luggage  Also felt bad having white sheets with fresh color in my hair lol  But everything about the space was absolutely beautiful  They even had fresh coffee beans which was AWESOME  I definitely will stay again  just on the first floor lol The elevator was broken so being  on the third floor was a pain especially when it was time to take our luggage 
593686943,Great location 
722841748,Would stay again  Parking is tough but a great place 
597059829,Great location with all the amenities to make you feel as if you are home Awesome time  I will always look to stay when in town 
548017236,Great location  large apartment  Would definitely stay here again  Hey  I enjoyed my stay but it might be nice for your guests to add some basic things to the kitchen so they dont have to be purchased  coffee  tea  salt pepper  oil   The radiator leaking during my stay and leaving a pool on the kitchen floor was not ideal  but I know that was out of your control  Thanks so much  the place was great 
722829465,Go through what looks like the gym door to find it Quite a bit of hair in the shower and toenails on the floor  Couch looked to have some type of fluid on it
280630780,Chriss place was clean and super close to local Metra that takes you downtown  Free street parking is a bonus   Only gripe is there was no sofa bed as advertised and seen in the pictures  The sofa was a loveseat and I ended up having the share the bed with my travel companion  which turned out to be ok but was not ideal  Thanks for a great stay and helping resolve the power issue quickly  Just wish It was made more clearly that there would in fact be no sofa bed 
515855526,The place was great  We had a little difficulty checking in but besides that  it was great 
515231335,A nice little spot in the south loop  Walking distance of the green and red line which made easy access to the city 
589749558,Location is great and has many things to do all around it  I really appreciated the parking pass in a gated area  came included with my stay  instead of finding street parking    Bending was also super soft and cozy 
514647923,The bedroom was really hot  There was a fan in there but with the hot weather it didnt do much  There was an ac in the living room  but I would suggest getting a better ac unit  I was hot the whole time in the apartment  Also they offer laundry service but no where in the place to purchase detergent  which is kind of pointless  I would also recommend putting a coin machine in the laundry mat  The check in process was annoying   The instructions only said to go to the person at the front desk  well we got in around midnight due to a delayed flight and no one was at the from desk to buzz us in for about    minutes  After we made several calls to Zencity to assist us  they were no help and all they kept saying was they will send a message  I asked to be refunded for the cost of the room for Tuesday the   th bc we didnt even get to be in the room that day and all I got was a response that someone should have been in the front  Once the front desk person arrived she acted as if she did nothing wrong for being away from the desk for so long and showed no empathy  After traveling all day  you just want to get to a comfortable place to rest your head  The bedroom was really hot  There was a fan in there but with the hot weather it didnt do much  There was an ac in the living room  but I would suggest getting a better ac unit  I was hot the whole time in the apartment  Also they offer laundry service but no where in the place to purchase detergent  which is kind of pointless  I would also recommend putting a coin machine in the laundry mat  The check in process was annoying   The instructions only said to go to the person at the front desk  well we got in around midnight due to a delayed flight and no one was at the from desk to buzz us in for about    minutes  After we made several calls to Zencity to assist us  they were no help and all they kept saying was they will send a message  I asked to be refunded for the cost of the room for Tuesday the   th bc we didnt even get to be in the room that day and all I got was a response that someone should have been in the front  Once the front desk person arrived she acted as if she did nothing wrong for being away from the desk for so long and showed no empathy  After traveling all day  you just want to get to a comfortable place to rest your head 
587223147,Good stay  Use this place to stay in the St  Louis area for New Years  This place was clean and had comfortable beds  The only down side was pretty low water pressure in the master bathroom 
592663815,Very good experience overall  Communication was amazing  Check in was very easy  Overall stay was very nice besides a few things already noted  We definitely would recommend book with Zencity again  One broken glass in the cupboard  also looks like there was blood in the freezer ice maker from meat  So we had to burn the ice and clean the ice tray out 
587141786,Excellent location for stay at Childrens hospital  Price is fantastic  
586163598,Worked exactly for what we needed 
590816631,A great stay and very close to Ballpark Village and the stadiums  however  construction on the building was a bit louder than expected Thank you for a great stay  You may want to alert future guests about the construction on the building though  The building was under construction so it made the stay a bit noisier than expected  other than that it was a great stay
590461156,The place was very beautiful  Only problems I had were the ceiling started leaking water and the fog for parking wasnt available upon check in  Fog was missing for parking Water started leaking from ceiling 
585308612,very nice place to stay except for  one thing  during my stay  there are still construction going on inside the building  so there are quite some noise  But this shall not be a problem in the near future
716876108,I would have had a better experience at the motel    This was the absolute worst experience Ive ever had  We couldnt get into the apartment for over   hrs  When we did the apartment had no heat and was beyond freezing  We were told to turn on the radiators and the noise would stop after a few minutes  We turned them on and went to dinner to escape the cold and noise only to return to a freezing cold apartment and raging radiator  We were told nothing they could do and other guests complained before but it would stop  It never stopped and the heat never cut on  Not to mention the dirty dishes  Best part  host was unapologetic and seemed irritated with our request for a warm place to sleep  Unable to open the door with because they provided the wrong code  Then i was unable to contact anyone Unwashed dishes in the sink and dishwasher Host answered our messages several hours later No heat in the apartment  We slept in full clothes
583333264,Convinient to go every tourist sport of St Louis such as Arch  Soulard Market      new studio apartment to own cook your meal  Should recomment to my friends and others A little bit time to wait hosts help Due to under construction  some common areas had building material   minutes to Field Food     minutes yo Soulard Market Value to recomment to the others
592133834,Truly awesome location   This block has so many good vegan and gluten free resteraunts that made me very happy   Check out No Bones resteraunt around the corner  so good  The building is a bit creaky and old  sometimes you here your neighbors walking around above you  but its not too bad    Overall its a great spot  would do it again 
591532288,The location  check in  and cleanliness was excellent  I found the sofa to be uncomfortable  very hard  I couldnt find pot holders and had to use the kitchen towel instead  Overall  I am very happy with my stay  The sofa in the living room is extremely uncomfortable  The black light in the corner of the living room has a floor switch  which is very difficult to reach because it is in a corner  It would be very helpful to have pot holders for the oven 
508944801,Skip this nightmare  The building is dark and dank  the elevators out of service  None of that is Zencitys fault  but their slow responses when something goes wrong  in my case  a very active cockroach in the bathroom  make this an unpleasant stay  and simply not the small savings  I am still waiting for a reply to my most recent message regarding my refund  In the meantime  I hope youve done a thorough cleaning and extermination in the studio  Information about how to find the lock box was a little confusing  but the lack of information about which floor a room was located on  and how to get there  meant I wandered around a bit trying to find my way  Stained sheets in the bedroom were the prelude to a cockroach in the bathroom 
582152597,Building was not very nice however the inside of the apartment was great  It took until day five of our stay for the dishwasher to get fixed but overall it was a very nice place 
581371930,This place was very clean and stylish  Check in was very easy and the host responds quickly to any questions you may have  I will definitely stay again  Thank You for being a great host  Really enjoyed my stay 
564353285,very clean
580462383,Great location and very nice place to stay  If you arent use to people walking around above you ear plugs at night would be a good suggestion  We would definitely stay here again 
580455273,Bath tub takes forever to drain   Basically taking a bath and shower at the same time   Very small apartment   Washer and dryer downstairs and u have to pay with a debit card to wash and dry your clothes 
713014796,Place is super cute I loved that they had a little table in the kitchen  which was helpful for WFH  Location is very hip and street is well kept  It could have been cleaned better there was visible crumbs and hair on the table seats and lots of hair on the living room carpet  But other than that it was good  
130807511,Great location   Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   Had to wait to check in   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bugs  Additional comments   Found some roaches in the kitchen   The alley entrance had rats     
603791000,Overall LOVED this Airbnb  This was my first time booking online and it was fantastic  Close to everything and stunning interior  We had a little hiccup with the check in time  but overall well definitely be booking again  Loved staying here  we will definitely be booking again  We had to check in much later than expected which kind of delayed some of our plans  but overall we loved it 
462966218,Great location  next to many restaurants and conveniently located to all the happening spots in STL  Easy instruction with access to the unit  Stylish unit and very spacious  No complaints other than the unit had NO hot water and very poor shower water pressure  We rented the space for three evenings and couldnt even shower because the water ran so cold  Had to use a washcloth for all of our daily grooming which was very disappointing and unpleasant  Other than that     great space and location  Please check the showers water supply and pressure  The pressure was horrible and the lack of hot water made the stay unpleasant 
578685951,Nice place but still under construction  Washer machine flooded  no response to fix it  Terrible experience 
129567180,I had a charming stay at Chriss apartment   Comfortable and close to all my needs   Communication was great and instructions were very clear and precise   Thanks for a great stay Chris  Clean comfortable charming apartment  Chris was an excellent host
582240079,Its an amazing place  conveniently located  and the price is the best value Ive come across The construction going on was very noisy  as well as there were people hanging out in the hallway til  am    You can literally hear everything going on in the hallway
582243104,The apartment was very stylish  clean  and equipped  Close to Forest Park and tons of things to do in Central West End  Parking was easy   Everyone at Zencity was very communicative and quick to respond  Would definitely stay here again when visiting family in St  Louis  Beautiful space   A few suggestions would be  drink coasters  drying rack for dishes and or more dish towels  reed diffuser in bathroom 
613669207,Parking was expensive  Place was nice  Clean and comfortable  The parking could have been better  Adding a parking pass for guess to use would be helpful 
503317967,Fine stay
503298255,A comfy place to stay in the beautiful city  The noise was a huge issue that made for a less than perfect experience other than that it was great thank you very much for hosting us 
614885132,Loved the place super nice very clean a cozy great area  I will definitely stay here everytime Im in St  Louis Only down side was getting locked out and mice
579453726,This apartment was exactly what I needed and was super nice  My only complaint is that at the time of my stay there was construction work that was going on in the building everyday and started at like  am  I wouldve enjoyed my stay more if there hadnt been construction  The worst part was that it started at like  am  If the construction was finished 
579060756,Wonderful place   Wonderful place   Construction was a little noisy but it was only during the day  Other than that we loved our stay and will definitely stay again   
574727780,Great spot for value and great communication
579043433,Highly recommend staying here  Wonderful location  Very clean and beautifully decorated  We will stay here again when in St Louis  We highly recommend Zencity  Some constructive criticism  On the day of check out the electrician knocked on the door at     am and wanted to come in and install under cabinet lighting  They should have been told that check out was at    and not come before then  Its minor to me and we understood that the building is still under construction but guests should not be bothered by workers  Other than that the fob was missing  Over all we had a wonderful time and will definitely stay again when in St  Louis  Thank you 
568719306,Great place great location  would use this place again Great place great location  would use this place again Lady bugs spotted few times near sofa
574727811,amazing place  kitchen was amazing  no cheap pans that everything stuck on  clean fridge  clean bed  couch was comfy  place comes with an HDMI cable for your convenience   the gym was a bit of a disappointment  was definitely expecting more  parking was a challenge at first but if you take that last right before you hit the building you stay at immediately to the right is free parking  the space is very limited but if you can make it work it beats paying the meter  the room was amazing  I love the minimalist feel to it  especially in the kitchen  By far the best pans I have ever used at an Airbnb  the couch was comfortable   and the place was overall spotless clean  over all definitely a good stay in St  Louis  all automated responses next to a huge hospital and traffic there is a nightmare traffic is loud  gym was a disappointment   parking was a slight challenge 
500081265,I stayed here for about two weeks for a work trip and it was great  Amazing location right in the loop next to many offices  transit  and right across from the Riverwalk  Nice and quiet building  i never had any issues with neighbors and the view is also amazing  Could work on a better cleaning checklist  but it was overall a very positive experience Just need to make sure the place is swept properly and checked for personal items  Since it looks like its for work trips and longer stays  you could also provide some more shower soaps than the small ones provided  The kitchens hand soap dispenser is really funky smelling  you might want to replace it  Other than that  it was great There was a lot of hair all over the place leftover from the previous resident  There was also leftover laundry from the previous resident 
576145640,The loft is in a great location  blocks from the Arch  light rail stop  and grocery   Amazing homemade ice cream shakes are available at the restaurant right downstairs   After dark  the streets are pretty quiet so noise isnt a problem   The place is spacious and has enough amenities  and electrical outlets  to make a short stay very enjoyable  Thanks for the great communication for this stay  you have a super location in town for anyone going to conferences at the local hotels  It appeared that no vacuuming had been done between guests  the countertops had residue on them  there was a dirty bowl in the kitchen cabinet  and the shower curtain had mysterious stains 
498454035,The apartment was fine and very clean  They have clearly made this space habitable  however  it is managed by a property management company  We had an emergency and needed to check in a bit earlier than expected  We asked the host to accommodate us coming a little earlier   only an hour  The host refused but it was very clear that both responses from the host were automated because they were exactly the same  We also were not allowed to leave our bags at the premises after checkout which was very inconvenient considering our flight was very late  The host referred us to a bag storage business  We have hosted in the past and would never dream of doing this to our guests  I guess it is to be expected as it is run by a business  but a little hospitality can go a long way  Automated responses 
572720827,Good place to rent  recommended  Good experience
532411922,Very good
611684950,This is a below average quality corporate apartment  Flat was not clean upon arrival  Extra linens were clearly dirty  Dishwasher does not work  Dishwasher does not work  Flat not clean upon arrival   Extra linens just balled up in closet and not clean  Neighbors dogs barking at all hours of day and night 
571788538,Easy check in process  very clean  great stay  Not super quiet  but being so close to Barnes Hospital  thats what I expected 
713444009,excellent space for short term housing  unfortunately   if you plan to stay longer than a weekend or are here for a work contract    they refuse to allow access to the mail  must find temporary mail services    first time ever being refused mail access on airbnb when renting for months    thermostat is locked so you have to call sometimes to request to have it unlocked to control the temp in your apartment  also    you may be locked out of your apartment for over    mins as they use bluetooth locks and they malfunction sometimes   zencity is out of california so there is no one on sites for any issues or customer service  there is no    hour contact number  you call  leave a message and someone responds via email  location is excellent with restaurants and easy access to everything   Rented for   months if zencity didnt have the monopoly on airbnb in STL   i would never stay here  unfortunately its the only avail apt close to my contracted location 
533395846,This space was just what we needed  The bed was super comfy  Would stay again Everything was good  Its not a huge thing but I think it would add a bunch of value if you added any type of full length mirror  Upon arrival there was still hair in the bathroom sink and in the shower 
575321120, 
494668539,Appartement tr s bien  quip   tr s bien situ  et avec une terrasse sur le toit avec une tr s belle vue sur Chicago  La piscine est en fait un petit bassin rafraichissant     cm de profondeur  Tout sest bien pass  dans lappartement  Il est tr s bien  quip  et la terrasse est superbe  Tres bien situ   N anmoins le m nage netait pas complet  cheveux et poils ds les salles de bain et sol non aspir  et sol de la cuisine collant   Le bassin sur la terrasse nest pas une piscine mais une pataugeoire 
494605959,large  spotlessly clean  fashionably designed flat in a safe  modern building with gym  free coffee tea bar  and meeting rooms working areas  Wifi in the unit was weak and unstable  thanks for your support during my stay  Ive tried to be careful about my review  because I definitely will stay with you again  and my previous two zencity experiences have been  tar      you have to sort out the wifi  or at least inform  guests that it is not of sufficient strength and stability to be used as an office    you did not tell me  but i figured out  that the ground floor lounge has excellent wifi   that can be something you offer other disappointed guests    In the previous two units I stayed in  a nice touch was the full bag of coffee you left in the cupboard  The nearly empty  good for about   cups  bag left this time was a disappointment
573617032,Nice space  easy to get to  close to downtown   Good amenities   Be careful with the walk in shower    you step DOWN into it   It was a stumble the first time  The space we needed was available at a good price and a great location   The building renovations were extensive and messy  but future travelers shouldnt have such problems  Numbered parking spaces  but no mention of assigned parking   Due to renovations in entire building  spaces probably not assigned when we were there   Construction company also had both entrances to building blocked at various times  forcing us to wait outside a bit  Building renovation dust in bathroom and adjoining utility area   Should not be an ongoing problem  though 
711275667,It is a small place  if you stay in winter then pay attention on the heat and make sure you understand how it work  Otherwise  it is a nice location with everything you need  Thank you for hosting us  we had a nice vacation  the only issue was the power outage  so make sure you do better next time A little slow in response to fix the issue that I had with the light in small bedroom and kitchen The response of the power outage in kitchen and small bedroom  I didnt expect to be solved immediately  but the issue had not been taken care of after    hours  Zencity need to speed up about that
278296691,Chris apartment was great  right as described  check in went smoothly and the location was nice  near downtown  We was not at all flexible with checkout time  I asked for    minutes but it wasnt posible  But then again it says so in the policy  overall great experience  Thanks  
563352771,It was ok Never received a fob for the apartment complex  When the cleaning person asked about it they dismissed it like it was no problem 
278223343,Chris is an awesome host  His overall hospitality was good  Quick responses and a nice location   Chris is an awesome host  I really enjoyed my stay an the location was perfect  The main thing I liked about Chris was his quick responses to any and all of my questions and concerns  We travel to Chicago often an I wouldnt mind staying here again  
572099457,I would not recommend staying with Zencity at all  Upon arrival we found the whole apartment dirty and without towels in any of the bathrooms  The towels that we did find look like they were thrown in the back of the closet  The host was unresponsive when we tried to contact them with the issues  We had to stay in apartment for over an hour until we found other accommodations  It was a very inconvenient situation for us and we will not stay with this host ever again  Did not get back to us when we had issues about cleanliness 
531457765,Great little spot  Very clean and bright  The door doesnt have the numbers on it which is a little confusing at first  Easy to get onto public transportation to go around town  Easy to walk to Wrigley field  Thanks for letting us stay at your place  It is in an awesome location  so easy to get around    The door doesnt have any numbers on it which was confusing at first but the photo helped  Thanks for that    I think if you had a tip sheet for where the trash recycling is etc that would be a nice touch 
491076067,The apartment was clean and in a great location for work I was doing in Hyde Park  The building itself is not super nice  and the AC wasnt quite able to keep up with the hot chicago summer  but the bed was comfortable and the host was very responsive  A great place to stay if you just want somewhere to sleep while youre visiting hyde park Your downstairs neighbor slipped a note under the door about    minutes after I arrived    pm  chastising me for walking too loudly and threatening to report me to you  You might consider speaking to them about this 
571059659,This is a great place to stay Its a great place to stay I just want to get in in a timely manner Ive had a few stays and when Ive arrived there were people still cleaning and one time couldnt get to the room because of a malfunction with the elevator I came in on my last stay and the covers were stained and hair on them as if they werent washed other than that spotless One of my stays the door didnt lock unless I was inside
592712207,A very comfortable  modern unit in a prime location downtown   Access to the buildings gym  basketball court  and small grab n go convenience store was a nice perk  too    Great value for the price and would absolutely stay again  Loved the space and what a prime location but would have appreciated responses to my messages  Definitely would stay again though  thank you 
569189436,Enjoyed my stay  Building has cool amenities like games room and lounge   Will stay here  again  
715728800,nice
126005801,Had to leave due to maintenance work that was done in the middle of my stay  However  they tried to help me find a new place and address the issue as best they could  Still quite unfortunate that they were not able to anticipate the disruption that caused me to have to find another place to stay last minute  Thanks for trying to help so quickly  although you might want to figure out a way to know if these things are going to happen in the future  as I am sure you know 
722802157,Was disappointed with this stay  I have booked through zencity before and was very impressed with communication  Check in process is not accurate because you have to access the building through the back and not the side  Did not have a remote to use the tv  notified them Monday and did not get the issue fixed  They just blamed it on the previous stay  
722585638,Great place   Clean unit with a nice view   Got a few noise complaints for having the tv up but other than that it was great
722221918,Great location  however the check in process was not well planned out  Our key code did not work  Luckily there were a few other Air bnb guests who teamed together and helped us into the building  If it werent for them we would have been locked out for a long time  Thanks guys    Hi great stay  poor check in  Caused unneeded anxiety  The key code didnt work
714103435,False advertising  No W D in room  Late responses from host with lack of information about units This host is using false advertising Parking
545136455,Terrible host service 
542593458,Great location  A little loud street noise because of nearby hospital traffic  ambulance police car sirens   Close to Starbucks  Whole Foods   bars Smelly  Leftover food in the refrigerator
488761920,Perfect location and right price in Chicago  We enjoyed being there  everything were great specially the location  please make sure the cleaning people changes the towels and check the extra sheets prior to arrival  Please make sure to tell your guest that they have to tap on the keyboard to wake it up  And please make sure to examine and remove unsafe equipment from the premises  All being said  I certainly would consider renting this space when the next opportunity comes  Thanks for being a good host and respond quickly 
275763908,The other reviews on this apartment are accurate  Id like to add that  as to be expected  parking was hard to come by  Be aware that you may have to park one or more streets away   Better  more clear check in instructions would be helpful to future guests  My suggestion     Arrive at the address  You will see a large green awning out front     Locate the alleyway to the right of the building  while facing the building   Many   SMALL   lockboxes will be located on the side of the building in the alleyway      Use the code to unlock the correct box     Enter the building through the door under the green awning  Key   will be used to unlock this door     Once inside the lobby  turn left  Use key   to unlock the glass hallway door  An elevator is located to the right once inside the hallway     Take the elevator to the  th floor     Use key   to unlock the unit 
598692312,Great place to stay close to all the fun downtown  Highly recommend 
589781686,Our stay was great  the place was very clean
719145719,A great place to stay  Tidy and nice place  Long code is a hassle to type in every time but we stayed for one night and it wasnt too bad  One thing that isnt mentioned in the instructions is that they key fob works for the rest of the building but not the actual room door  where you type in long code   However  Great communication when i reached out for clarity on this  I would stay here again and the bed is really comfortable  Thank you for hosting us  Overall clean  Small details like soap marks on dishes  dirty empty bathroom garbage can and mold on bottom of shower curtain  barely noticeable however  Sheets were clean and the place was tidy 
607243255,Its hard to write a review due to the unique circumstances of the stay  Apparently the night before we arrived the upstairs neighbor had some sort of a water leak which made its way down to our apartment  Now by no means do I fault Zencity for that   its totally out of their control   but what confused me is that there was no communication about the issue until we showed up  So imagine my surprise when we open the door  theres a horrible odor coming from the kitchen  the heating was off  on a day that was    degrees   an industrial fan is blowing on the floor  and theres a mop and bucket sitting there with a strange liquid inside  Additionally  while sitting on couch a few minutes later  a man barged into the apartment  without knocking  and started asking me questions about the aforementioned water leak  which I still had no clue about at this point   Again  while I dont blame Zencity at all for the leak  I would have appreciated a heads up about the situation before I had arrived and more clarity on what was being done to clean it up   Beyond that  the apartment was mostly as expected and advertised  Location was great   we walked to many restaurants  bars  and the Whole Foods  Unfortunately there was a horrible smell in the kitchen our entire stay which I assume stemmed from the leak  All in all  Im not sure how to review a place with such a weird problem happening that most likely wouldnt happen to others  toilet wasnt super clean  there was a lot of hair on the couch and the bed no communication prior to check in regarding the flooding and clean up that happened the night before
717442051,Very nice place to stay and very central to everything  Parking was not difficult to find and getting in and out of the building was easy  You have to be quiet and not turn the TV up too loud or use anything that is too loud because its easy to hear through the walls  however  Very good stay though and extremely clean  I couldnt figure out how to work the key fob  however it was no issue because it was easy to get in and out of the building with your directions  I apologize for the noise complaints  however  we were just watching a movie and it was prior to   pm and then another was in the morning at      ish and all we were doing was blow drying our hair  The next door neighbors sent in noise complaints a few times and two of them were during normal hours not quiet hours and all we were doing was watching a movie and blow drying our hair 
605499497,This place wont let you down it was great and I would come here again Thank you so much  Be prepared to here ambulance non stop haha but its was fine
605482305,This was a great stay  the only issue was with the parking lot  There were other reviews that stated issues with not having the key fob when they arrived  There ended up being plenty of street parking but it was the matter of stating there was a private parking and it was not an option  I would have gave you five stars  but I read other reviews that had the same issue with parking 
618754903,The location is great but for price it was a very small space  that was overly secure to the point where it was a hassle to leave and come back  But communication and directions were excellent for getting there   Wifi was very weak  The furniture wasnt comfortable and oriented awkwardly  We also  had to re clean the dishes before using them  This place is fine for a short stay if you wont be spending much time there 
485385705,The beds were very comfortable  check in was delayed   hours 
485334982,good location good building nice view
575559979,Good location and parking Its filthy
559038740,This is a very small basic place  but the location is great  Corners and window sills
483717549,The Airbnb was at a great location and is just how it looks in the pictures  We enjoyed our stay  But unfortunately we had a lot of problems checking in  There was no fob left for us to get in and out of our building and it was never provided for us during our entire stay  even after we notified Zencity  Additionally  the wrong WiFi password was left for us  Besides these hiccups  we had a good experience  We enjoyed our stay  It was a great spot in an ideal location  Unfortunately  we had problems checking in  We were provided with the wrong WiFi password and never received a fob to get in and out of the building 
482528789,The apartment itself was well decorated  and the bed was pretty comfortable  During the hot summer months  the small window AC didnt cool the unit to a comfortable temp  so sleeping here was challenging  The WIFI here didnt work either  but that may have just been a temporary issue   Overall  would not care to stay here again  It would have really improved our stay if someone had taken a minute to turn the AC on before our arrival   The unit never got to a comfortable temperature  and sleeping was very difficult  Working WiFi  functioning AC
481351088,Cute apartment  The rooftop was one of the best thing about this AirBnB  Perfect spot to end the night  We were able to see the entire skyline lit up and it was gorgeous  Besides the apartment smelling like cigarette smoke when we walked in  everything else was amazing  Smelled like cigarette smoke in the whole apartment
479863984,Really convenient to a parking deck  Target  eateries  the lake  and University of Chicago  We felt safe and comfortable here  Thanks again  We lived our stay in Chicago 
460238406,Great location  The space was much bigger than expected  Perfect for a weekend getaway for two  Only complaint was a few of the dishes were not cleaned properly  Would definitely stay at this location again  Thanks for hosting us  We enjoyed our stay  However  some of the dishes had not been cleaned properly  We also would suggest adding a can opener and wine key to the kitchen supplies 
555527728,Great place  Could be a bit smoother with the check in process    Aside from that I totally recommend this place if your big on cleanliness   style  Awesome pad Great place as always  The check in is the only thing that really stood out  However  the house cleaner was polite   sincere   Great place  just poor communication on your end   Overall  Id definitely stay again 
477715502,Definitely an amazing location for couples  Try this location its located in just about the heart of Hyde Park Absolutely amazing location  I definitely enjoy staying with Zencity  I just wish the furniture would be a bit more comfortable 
552450763,Good location  Close to blue line and some lovely bars and restaurants  Some areas of the apartment need updating to match the furniture and other fixtures fittings  Beds were comfy  While the place is in a good location it needs a bit of work  The windows are very sticky and dont work in some areas  The blinds didnt work in majority of apartment 
459759751,We enjoyed our stay at this Airbnb  It was a great location right next to forest park and walking distance to many restaurants  The rooftop was a great added touch  My only feedback was that the towels we were given smelled like cigarette smoke  Other than that the apartment was clean and true to the pictures  There was also a Bluetooth radio for us to use which was a nice touch  We enjoyed our stay  The only thing was that the towels left on the bed for us to use smelled like cigarette smoke  The apartment did not however and everything was very clean  Thank you  Towels given smelled like cigarette smoke 
460184782,Great modern place with easy access to public transportation and shops and restaurants a few blocks away  Thanks for being very responsive to my messages that was definitely a plus   The only suggestion I would have is to try and make sure that it is wiped down the same week or a few days before someone elses visit  especially on the black couch  The place itself presented itself very well  however there was dust all over the couch and looks as though it hasnt been wiped down in a week or two 
459557758,Awesome location and very spacious airbnb  Great response from the host leading up to the visit  As a note  the sofa bed is a couch that folds down into a futon  and temperature control from the nest thermostat was difficult to manage resulting in a cold downstairs and hot upstairs when sleeping  Entry was easy with the keypad  and the patio area looked great  but we didnt have time to use it  Hi there  thank you for having us at your place in Chicago   The location was wonderful  The Airbnb was incredibly spacious  and the beds were comfortable  The massive master bathroom was impressive   My communication with the host prior to arrival was great  In regards to feedback  there are a few things  We were anticipating a true sofa bed  as advertised   not a futon type situation  We were able to have an air mattress delivered to make things more comfortable for our friend who was planning to sleep on the sofa bed  Also  temperature control was difficult  The downstairs would be very cold and the upstairs was very hot which made sleeping comfortably difficult  Finally  we were not made aware of the large ceiling issue in the kitchen  This was not revealed in the pictures advertised  and it wasnt fixed during the maintenance visit that was scheduled during our visit  however  we were not told what that appointment was for   We did have an unfortunate issue with the couch futon on the last day where the arm seemed to break when one of the guests was leaning against it while sitting  We received the      request and sent the money within    hours  We apologize for any inconvenience  It seemed that floors in the living room kitchen area may have been missed by the cleaning service prior to our arrival  The linens and bedrooms were clean  The construction ceiling issue in the kitchen was not mentioned prior to our arrival or documented in the pictures advertised 
229631547,The host canceled this reservation    days before arrival  This is an automated posting 
551728470,Couldnt ask for a better location  Think the cleaning service rushed a bit  The floors hadnt been cleaned and there was no soap  Otherwise  everything was good 
604827488,Very stylish place   Thank you  The place looks great  but unless you pull and hold the door to  it wont lock  and the towel hanger next to the bathroom sink just fell off the wall when I went to dry my hands on it  I placed it back on the wall just as it was before I used it  Room entry would benefit from being easier  but the place has definite potential  Thank you for your hospitality   
458194731,It is a pretty nice place at the heart of Hyde Park  Its very convenient and Chris from Zencity helped a lot in terms of checking in and checking out 
458165183,Overall   the place in itself is very functional and clean  Customer service was horrible  They just didnt care about our needs and never offered any viable solution to the problems that the place presented  We had requested to cancel our last day and were denied the refund in spite of the fact that it was a week prior to the rental date   It was really cold in the apt  and after not responding to our messages the first day  we were told that is was too bad it was unusually cold  We had an entire day with no lift and were not notified     we were staying on the  th floor  The second day a lady and a gentleman came in unannounced and made a hole in the wall to install something  The third day a guy opened the door without notice and came in to do some maintenance work  I was in bed  I had to insist to send him away  The neighborhood didnt feel safe nor friendly   we were two ladies traveling for work and somewhat this place popped in our zip code request  it was very far away from our area   Not a place I suggest to anyone wants to enjoy Chicago  we had requested to cancel our last day and were denied the refund in spite of the fact that it was a week prior to the rental date  we had very cold days and after not responding we were told that is was too bad it was unusually cold we had an entire day with no lift and were not notified     we were staying on the  th floor  the second day a lady and a gentleman came in unannounced and made a hole in the wall to install something  the third day a guy open the door without notice and came in to do some maintenance   I was in bed  I had to insist to send him away  Overall   the place in itself is very functional and clean  Customer service was horrible  not safe customer service was horrible 
477161654,The space is beautiful  great amenities  beautiful rooftop   However  be aware of the parking issue   the cleanliness issue  BUGS   BUGS   BUGS   The space was beautiful  but there were nats EVERYWHERE   we put the flowers in the closet so that helped a little     then came my worse nightmare  A PREGNANT ROACH   Luckily my boyfriend killed it because I would of just got another airbnb all together if I was by myself  The pillows   sheets had stains on them  so we had to switch those out  There was hair EVERYWHERE  in the shower  on the floor  in the sinks  The cleanliness issue really put a damper on our whole trip  Having free parking available 
545627739,The heating problem needs to be fixed  Also  when the curtains are drawn at night  why do they cover the aircon  Please fix this problem  Also answer the phone or text messages  The heating was set at    degrees  We texted and phoned  left a message on the         answer phone  vague text message in reply  Couldnt get the heat down  the aircon was full on low  The thermostat was not user friendly  We left after two days and went to a hotel 
475735089,Convenient Hyde Park location   Street parking was no problem 
544251774,The entry way and stairwell leading to the unit were musty  dank  and had a strong serial killer vibe  The apartment itself was exactly as advertised  medium clean  and everything worked fine  The w d was not in the unit and I never made the journey to the dungeon to check it out for myself  You get what you pay for and this was great for the price 
474849931,The apartment looked exactly like the pictures  i was extremely impressed  The only bad thing i have to say is  i had ZERO cell phone service in the apartment  i had to walk outside the building to make receive calls  This was super annoying  So if your taking a business trip i would not recommend this building  Everything was amazing except i had zero cell phone reception in the apartment  My phone only worked on WiFi  i missed so manys important calls as my phone said  no service  the entire time  Super annoying  Front desk asked for an email  she basically didnt know what she was doing  I stood there for    minutes waiting for her to figure out how to do her job 
601530776,Nice place but still being renovated  There was drywall dust and paint chips throughout building  including apartment   Someone spilled a salad in hallway Friday which as of Monday was still on the floor  City traffic noises were pretty loud at night and construction noises in the building were fairly loud during day  No key fob as promised we had to use code all trip Said they would get new key fob and to park on street until contacted  Never heard back 
331809140,Stylish space with plenty of room  There were random hairs on the sheets 
471476339,The space was as described and in a pretty good location to get where you would want to go while staying in St  Louis  However  there were some cleanliness issues  I found dried on food on dishes that I was trying to use  There were black hairs on the towels  dish towel  and in between the sheets that were on the bed  After the stay  I was asked to give a   star review   not just please give us a review or hope you enjoyed your stay  I responded privately that my stay did not warrant a   star review and gave the same reasons to them that I gave above  I never received any communication back after I sent that message  Two days later I received an e mail stating that zencity had given me a review  Someone was able to get on the site to leave a review on me  but not to respond to a message about issues that the apartment may have  Some kind of communication with the cleaning service is much needed  Dried on food on dishes  black hairs on towels  dish towel  and in the sheets on the bed  In the beginning  the host was very helpful  Recommendations of restaurants and things to do  After the stay  I was asked to give a   star review instead of just asking to review the space  Once I responded privately that the experience was not worth a   star review and explained why  all communication stopped and then I was notified that I had been reviewed  So obviously someone had time to be on the site 
708182939,The lighting in the unit isnt as nice as the photos   It was clean  check in was easy  and good value for location 
602376589,We had a good stay and had a very easy checkin checkout process  Room are bigger than we had expected and the bed was very comfortable  you have easy access to the hospitals but it also means that you will hear ambulance very frequently   Will stay here again if I need to be in this area  Only thing I would improve is around the cleanliness of the utensils in the kitchen but we ended up just using disposable anyways 
704851497,Great place and even better location  but communication with the host was not good and we couldnt park our car in the parking garage of the complex  We loved the place and the location  but when I messaged about the key fob for the parking garage I didnt get a response  Since I was moving across the country I had valuables strapped to the top of my car and did not feel comfortable parking it in the street  which I ultimately had to do 
500745071,We had a great time 
590783641,Great location right next to Forest Park and WashU  Good amount of space and full kitchen was a great bonus  Would recommend to family and friends traveling in the area 
594073876,Nice location and very home like feeling inside the apartment  However communication was NOT good   often took multiple messages and a couple of days  to get a response  Interacting with the workers was not pleasant but as a whole  Id give this place a       Will never be staying in this location or with you guys again  So beyond disappointed  You guys use to be great  Cleaning lady was halfway through cleaning when we walked in after check in  Asked for a key because we were having troubles with ours and it took    hours and a triple text to get a text back and over    hours till we actually got one 
199324227,Chriss place was the perfect location for a first timer exploring the City  Everything was in walkable distance and the location of the apartment on the second floor made it very quiet and private  Great experience  Chris  we enjoyed our stay  The only note we have is that the carpet in the bedroom was a bit sticky  Thanks again    Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   It was a bit difficult opening the lock with the key as well as a bit awkward   Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  floors and carpet 
259313254,The apartment was very conveniently located and the views are awesome  I dont think I couldve done better especially for the price  The shower handles fell off very easily  the floor boards shifted very easily  small details like these made me uneasy that something would break and I would be to blame  Fortunately nothing did break  otherwise the views are wonderful and the apartment conveniently located  the small tradeoff compared to the positives and the price made it well worth it   Thanks again 
524262907,This was my first Airbnb experience and it wasnt bad at all  The location was awesome and it was very clean  I didnt agree with having to pay for parking everyday  I think a parking space for the the guest should be included  A parking spot should be included for the guest  Paying for parking everyday was a bit of a pain 
257279746,This is my second time booking with Chris  I would certainly book with him again  There were a few small issues with the apartment and the building  Outside of your control   the hallway had a terrible smell the during the entire stay  Inside the apartment   the bed and coffee table are of poor quality and partially broken  leg on coffee table detaches any time it is moved  bed frame makes noise whenever I would move  
230036678,The host canceled this reservation     days before arrival  This is an automated posting 
602081367,Awesome view and nice space  Some of the area wasnt super clean  dried food on the living room table   I also tried to reach out for an early check in with no response at all  Overall  it was in a nice area and I had a good time 
255794728,This apt was great  It was clean  minimally decorated  there was a large supply of snacks and we had a lovely stay here  There was an issue post stay but it seemed to resolve itself without any further issues   There was an issue post stay which seems to have been resolved but I have not had any feedback post issue 
253460863,Great location  We felt safe there  and it was quiet  Wonderful kitchen  However  the place needed some repairs before we arrived  Many excellent features  but the windows need serious repair because we could not close many of them and had to endure winds and rattling blinds the last evening  The apt  lock should have been fixed prior to our arrival  We liked that the objects we requested were there for us to use  We liked how big and modern the kitchen was  You do need a large  sharp chefs knife in the kitchen  Great laundry facilities and excellent TV and Netflix access  Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   difficult to find and open locks for older guests     Some blinds on the windows were dirty    Host is difficult to reach    Its OK for what we expected  
595744420,Beware if you like to sleep before     AM  This apartment is above a bar with loud club music playing every night  Music begins at    AM  lasts until     AM  In addition to the music  the bar patrons are very loud  Constant shouting and fights  vomit on the sidewalk  The actual apartment is fine enough  but the proximity to this bar is a huge issue  You should disclose the fact that this apartment is above a bar when renting and that loud club music plays until     AM every night  It is impossible to sleep here  This apartment is above a very loud bar  club music until     AM every night  Lower price considering you cant sleep here until after     AM 
597444378,Place is nice and easy to find and stay in  The bottom sheet doesnt fit the bed and the kitchen has very minimal items so anything you want to cook you have to buy all the spices for  even salt and pepper 
587799699,Amazing location with no need for a car if you are staying in the CWE   Great building with lots of amenities and super friendly staff  Would definitely stay again  Hey guys   overall great stay  Your place is in a great location  The Internet challenges on day   were annoying but it got better  I would recommend a few more items in the kitchen just in case someone actually wants to cook   Otherwise loved the building and your place was super clean 
248057768,Comfortable and a great view  The area is more business oriented rather than neighborhood y  There arent many cafes or cool restaurants right nearby  but its nice to be on the river and you can Uber to more charming neighborhoods  Its in a high rise building so you cant open the windows  which may be an issue for some  The building has very nice concierge service  The bed was very comfortable  Good for business trips  Thanks so much Chris  Your place was great   the shower wasnt super clean  but it was ok   
594063133,Great price for the location parking is free and close if your in by like   pm needing a fob to get in to the building later at night made us feel safe kinda smelt like oil in the apt and a blind wasnt even installed but over all good stay There where a set of blinds not up whole place smelt like oil and was covered in oil  Picture frame in between the windows was broken
584843025,The space is just as nice if not nicer than the photos  If you find that there is not an available keyfob like we did  then there is normally plenty of street parking  There are plenty of extra linens and towels  Be wary that construction starts early  I slept through it but my partner did wake a few times around      am   Without the keyfob be wary that you are limited to going in through the main entrance and using an unlock code for both doorways  Again  not the fault of ZenCity but still an unfortunate reality  Everything else was perfect quite honestly  Thanks for everything  A few things   obviously the key fob not being in the unit was an issue  But secondly the dishwasher doesnt work  It whirres and spins but no water comes out  Waited a day for the initial response about the keyfob but everything after was good
247459920,Chris place was VERY clean and nicely arranged  We enjoyed the spartan modern feel and found it to be a nice calm place to return to after touring around  The shower and bathroom are excellent as is the closet space  We did not end up watching Netflix but it was nice that there was access for us   LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION  Hey Chris  Thanks for a great stay  We really enjoyed the place and found it suited our needs  A couple small things  you may want to see if your cleaning crew can go a little lighter on the detergent  it smelled so strong in the bedsheets and was overpowering  I ended up having to shower after sleeping to get the scent off  May just be an issue of their ratios  that said we really appreciated the overall cleanliness  The second thing would be a heads up to guests to bring earplugs if they may be light sleepers as the dog barking and running around upstairs ended up being an unexpected disturbance  I hear the ceilings are generally thin in Hyde Park so it could be a nice tip  Thanks so much 
592282716,The area was great I like how there is restaurants and bars around  The music may be loud but the place was great to stay  Thanks for the great host
197076742,Great location and loved the amount of space we had  The bed was comfortable  Only thing was the toilet was dirty when we arrived  and shower wasnt great  The flooring could also use a hot mop  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  toilet 
605472713,I had a huge problem with being accused of smoking indoors with no actual evidence and not being given the benefit of the doubt  Other then that the place was stellar I had a problem with being accused of smoking indoors without being given the benefit of the doubt  Other then that place was great
244427909,Not bad  It is what it is  we had a place to stay that was clean and comfy and safe  I wouldnt stay here again because of the fact that it was very boring with no extras  Fridge was completely empty  very basic bath products  fake flowers  little decoration  Bathtub doesnt work and there is very low water pressure  Good location and easy to park  It was good for what we needed but it included absolutely no amenities or extra touches  Very basic  Water pressure is low and extremely annoying  No bath stopper   Cheeto on the floor    Expensive for what you get 
582246883,Good place to stay in Chicago  Close to everywhere and host responds really quick  Street parkings are limited although its free  Building is a bit old but decent overall 
715768798,Besides the fact the tv wasnt working it was kool
715613487,DEFINITELY consider booking with ZenCity for an affordable   convenient stay   if the prices right  what would Bob Barker do  Great hosts   
239392617,Affordable apartment in a good location if you need access to the University  The apartment is a    to    train ride from downtown depending on which train you take   The apartment has all the kitchen amenities you could need  the bed was comfortable and the TV with Netflix was a great addition  for the price I would definitely recommend a stay here  Hi Chris  thanks for the stay at your apartment  The experience was mostly good  however when I arrived I found the toilet seat to be unclean which was a bit disappointing  Id also recommend changing the shower curtain as its looking pretty stained  It would be a cheap thing to replace and would greatly improve the visible cleanliness of the bathroom   Overall I enjoyed my stay and appreciated the kitchen amenities as well as the TV with Netflix  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  unsanitary toilet  unsanitary shower or tub   Good if you need access to the University but a train ride from downtown Chicago  
619716563,The apartment was in a great location  and super spacious  Can accommodate many guests at one time  The cleaning fee is high  and the place wasnt as clean as it could be  Overall  was a good place to stay  and would stay there again  Overall  we enjoyed your place  I would recommend getting better cleaning crew  or lower the cleaning fee  Also  there wasnt any bowls  which was something we found ourselves needing  I would also recommend buying a cooking sheet or two  since you do have an oven  Floors Was a good value per night  but the cleaning fee was high  and the space didnt seem that clean for the price people have to pay for it to be cleaned after their stay 
529373132,Loved the place and location  Much better than a hotel  however  I had trouble checking in and accessing the building  The key fob didnt work the entire time I stayed  The key fob didnt work the entire time I stayed  Im not sure what happened but every time I needed to enter the building I had to wait for someone to go inside and hold the door for me  Sometimes I was out there for a long time  Key code didnt work to get in the building and no one answered the buzzer 
524264941,Amazing hospitality from the front desk  Lovely stay  Wish there was more utensils for cooking  Great value for the place  nicely decorated   Very fast responses  Amazing hospitality from the front desk  Lovely stay  Wish there was more utensils for cooking  Great value for the place  nicely decorated   Very fast responses 
524309498,The space is nice and clean  Located in a great spot as well  Host is great with responding  Overall nice stay  Only wish would be a fluffier mattress   Thanks for the great space  we enjoyed our stay and had a lovely time in Chicago 
233238932,Chriss place is adorable  clean  has everything you need for a comfortable stay and the neighborhood is great  Walking distance to food  transportation  grocery store  etc  Its great value for only being about    min to downtown and Id definitely stay again  Overall  your place was generally solid  Location was awesome  cute space just a couple of small things  the apartment smelled like someone had been smoking in it  I know it says no smoking on your listing so I dont know if someone violated that or if maybe the cleaning agent your cleaner was using just had a funky smell  but I bought a candle which seemed to do the trick   Also  I know this isnt within your control  but just in case you werent aware  there is construction starting at about      am that happened both mornings I was there on the apartment across the hall  which was a bit of an inconvenience as I was on a work trip and wanted to be well rested  However  I remember apartment living in NYC and know you cant always account for that stuff  I would ask them how much longer theyll be working just so you can give your guests a heads up while theyre working on the space so you dont have to weed through more messages like mine  Check in was a little wonky too  I know I didnt communicate what time I was arriving  which is on me  but I assumed because it was so much later after your scheduled check in that the space would be ready  I would definitely stay again though  none of those things were deal breakers for me  but just wanted to give you feedback  Thanks for having me as your guest  Dani Your guest had some issues with the check in process  entering the home  Additional comments   The keys werent in the lockbox when i went to check in and had to wait for the cleaner to bring them down  
559095976,Brians place was in a very convenient location for us  central to everywhere we needed to go  Unfortunately  communication with him was pretty poor  I had received check in instructions the day of check in only a couple of hours before I was arriving  I had to reach out to make sure he was still sending instructions  Everything felt a bit last minute for him to be sending details shortly before my stay  I had then reached out asking if it was possible for a late check out  but he hadnt responded until much later the next night to the point where obviously we had already been checked out of his place for quite some time  Overall  cleanliness was good and the place was big enough for all of us  but unfortunately  communication really lacked  It made me second guess if I should book again as Im afraid he will not be accessible if a problem does occur in the future 
707531420,The property was as pictured and the location and value is hard to beat  Although the listing did not display this for us  the property is strictly non smoking  Wed also caution that the neighbor s  can be a bit sensitive to noise  The neighbor introduced himself to us in his underwear while we were checking in  We also had to learn later at night that the property is non smoking although there is nothing stating this in the house rules  only a sign we couldnt see on the porch at night  This would have saved us a bit of embarrassment and may have informed our decision to rent this property over others 
510823890,Hago una recomendaci n y es con respecto a la tina  ducha  que estaba obstruida  Desde el primer d a que llegu  solicit  reparaci n y hasta el  ltimo d a que fueron    nunca fueron a repararla Solicit  desde el primer d a que llegu  arreglo de la ducha que estaba mala  obstruida y nunca fueron a repararla
510117864,I came here as a place to crash before travel  and it was really good for that  The room is immaculately clean  and it seems that it has either been recently renovated or all of the furniture is new  Getting the keys and getting in the elevator are a little tricky  but once you are in there  its pretty nice  Obviously a beautiful place and comfortable  The wifi really didnt work  no network was showing up that was just  Zencity   it was all like  GEXT or something like that afterwards  The Xfinity thing worked  but if I had stayed longer it would have had to be renewed once an hour  Thanks for being on call to help though  Somewhere close to the front door would be nice  Some of the automatic responses werent quite what I needed 
508306823,Dont judge a book by its  cover  On first approach to this unit you may question your choice   But  once you enter the space  you will not be disappointed   It is clean and comfortable and provides all ofthe comforts of home  We were lucky enough to snag aparking spot on the street out front  and we didnt move our vehicle all weekend  Enjoyed our visit to Chicago Our stay at Zencity   on N  Rockwell was comfortable   but we found the front foyer to the building was not very clean or welcoming   Also  not sure what the constant smell of air freshener was due to   but I found it bothersome as I am sensitive to perfumes  Otherwise  all was fine  Entrancehallway to building was not very clean or welcoming 
506553225,Nice location  nice appartement  Only the shower was not great  The bath tub was clogged  so water would accumulate during shower  The bath curtain was dirty  Also you should do something about key n    it takes about  min each time to open the door playing with the lock  The rest was fine  
484825449,Nice apartment in a good location but amenities are bare bones  Apartment is managed by a company that manages multiple properties   it shows  Corporate vibe to communication  lack of flexibility regarding help storing luggage  a common need   no coffee  dish soap  or anything in kitchen other than a few dishes  Overall not a bad spot but lacked the friendly human touches I typically appreciate when using airbnb 
700017332,Our stay felt quite the opposite of many reviews posted to Airbnb  Overall  disappointed with our stay and the lack of service provided by Zencity  didnt feel very  zen  like     The apartment felt a bit more run down and dirty than expected  We had a difficult time accessing the AC controls because they are locked by the property manager making it a very uncomfortable sleep on the very uncomfortable beds even with the partially working fans on and windows open  It should be common knowledge that peoples comfort and sleep during their stay is top priority  would you agree Zen   insert YES neon sign here      In general  we felt the price did not reflect the value of our stay and service  Would not recommend even with the location being much desired  Overall  disappointed with our stay and service  Will be avoiding any future stays under the name or entity with  Zen  in it   Despite the instructions  the code to access the key was incorrect and it would have been helpful to know exactly which exterior door to access and was difficult to find the  sweet spot  to unlock the doors  In general  the apartment did not feel clean  Lots of communication leading up to the trip a week   a few days before  but communication and care lacked when asked about gaining access to the AC controls and or being given a fan to supplement the broken ceiling fan in one of the bedrooms  Im willing to sleep in an uncomfortable bed but atleast provide some air so were not sweating throughout the night  even with the windows open    Lowering the price to match its value 
715927857,N a
495220293,This is a mediocre Airbnb at best  Robotic communication  Smelly building  poor location  Not accessible to McCormick Place  soldier Field etc   super corporate vibe all the bad of an Airbnb and none of the good Auto generated messaging   not real people messaging you   no reply addresses etc 
487956385,We like front desk person
713813324,Very cute place but poorly kept   The unit could be so gorgeous with better upkeep  Arrived late after a   hr drive   still needed to clean for   hours  washing all linens  disinfecting surfaces  before I felt comfortable sleeping there 
713137754,Great place to stay
479862725,Zencity is the third party handling this location and frankly I would stay away    If you have any travel issue  I e  cannot access the building  they dont have a number to contact anyone to get it resolved immediately    I had reserved this particular location with two teenage girls because of a concert that was going on    Check in is only after  p and the event was open at   p  so we only were able to get to the Airbnb by after midnight    Support cant help you  You dont get direct contact to the host  You also dont get any compromise for the experience you have    We were locked out and we felt unsafe  It was frustrating and scary  Luckily the email support answered us  but it was not timely    We spent almost   hours sitting by the door  unsure of what to do  I almost had to book a room elsewhere    Place was nice  once we were able to get in  but at the expense of dealing with Zencity and being denied something in return  its not worth it    I would much rather book at a hotel  because I know Im GUARANTEED access to my room  I think its ridiculous that I cannot speak directly with the host whether through Zencity or even through Airbnb    Its clear Chris has no concern for safety  has no sympathy  or even cares for what happened  I wont be staying at an Airbnb ever again    At least a hotel will GUARANTEE an accessible room     Chris should have courtesy towards his clients    Its simple business practice to take responsibility for a bad procedure  and in return  do something to make up for it    I feel betrayed because I was not taken care of and Im sure I will continue to be ignored    Clients concerns should not be ignored  I hope this company can learn from this  Its unfair how this has turned out to me when I had two teenage girls to look after    Were very lucky that nothing bad happened to us  There wasnt a second lockbox code provided just in case the first key was missing  Theres no way to contact anyone on the phone and receive immediate support during an emergency  Customer support could give no advice in what to do  An email was provided but it was not timely 
476211906,Nice place and great location  but management was sub par  I booked same day for a last minute extension of my trip  Had to wait for    minutes outside the unit for access instructions  When I finally got in  the place was half cleaned and the crew was working in the unit across the hall  They didnt finish my unit until    hours after check in  There was also no coffee stocked  but there was a coffee pot and filters  Yay   I also had the next nights guest try to enter the unit at   am  They offered me a     refund  Waited    minutes at the Airbnb for access instructions  Cleaning crews didnt finish until     hours after check in  Call center has no idea what the management companys processes are  Better management
474878837,Beautiful apartment  Close to everything we were doing 
470805257,A pleasant stay  Hi Chris  we appreciate your prompt responses   three extra pillows  and though we would not call anything truly  bad    We found your place was not as welcoming as other apartments we stayed at in other States  Europe   Asia   It lacks the basic necessities like tissues paper  aluminum foil  saran wrap  foot towel  coffee   tea   Your tea kettle is broken   We couldnt make hot water for our tea    The foot rug in the bathroom didnt look clean so we didnt want to dry our feet on it   We loved your foam mattress so much that well buy two for our home   Thank you Bathroom floor  shower curtain  soap dish   rug
219894485,Great location  Nice area  Easy check in and check out  Host was responsive  Shower wasnt always hot enough but overall my stay and the place was very enjoyable  Would definitely recommend  The place was nice but the water temperature was cold at times  The room also got very warm so much so that we had to open the windows to cool down the room 
217107151,This was an amazing space for an amazing price    Only complaint is the bed  It was extremely firm  as in similar to sleeping on a plush carpeted floor  Not a great idea to get something so extreme for the average traveler  You should at least have a mattress topper available in case its a problem for someone 
463010586,The apartment was perfect  It looked exactly like the pictures  so there were no surprises  It was also very clean and well kept  The bed was very comfortable  even though it was a queen and I normally dont like traveling with my husband if we have to sleep in a queen    One thing to note on the location  if you didnt look at the map    it is close to the hospital and a busy street  so if you dont like hearing ambulances and noise at night  this might not be the place for you  We live in downtown KC  so this was nothing new for us and the noise didnt bother us  but I could see how it could for someone else if they werent familiar with the area    The only reason I was unable give this apartment   stars was because of the late after hours check in  The instructions were very clear  but when we called the Zencity number via the intercom in the foyer  there was no answer  There was also no doorman to let us in  So  we had to sit there for about   minutes and figure out what to do   then a nice gentleman who was also staying there via AirBnB Zencity let us in and he said he arrived about an hour before us and had the same issue  We did arrive around midnight since we were driving from KC and hit traffic  etc  But even arriving late  there should be some sort of process in place to make sure guests are able to get in  We started to get a little worried we were being ripped off  In the end everything was wonderful and the building and apartment was great  Thanks for the wonderful space  It was a great location  and perfect for what we needed  The only issue was getting into the building using  late after hours check in   Another suggestion would be a king bed    My husband and I havent slept in a queen for quite some time  the bed was very comfortable  but wouldve been better if it was a king  The instructions for late check in stated to use the intercom in the foyer of the building to call Zencity and then youd be buzzed in  But  there was no answer and there was also no doorman to let us in the building  Thankfully  a nice gentleman let us in and he said he arrived about an hour earlier and the Zencity number did not answer to let him in either 
459563371,This was a great place  The area is super trendy and everything is very close by  The only thing was there was a weird odor in the apartment building  not the apartment itself   Also there was a wine glass that had a lipstick stain on it as though it hadnt been washed  But this was a great space overall  Great location  The place is super nice  Thanks for everything  One of the wine glasses had lipstick stains on it  It was like the glass hadnt been washed completely  just rinsed 
457673575,I had great experience with Zencity before  but this time it was a bit disappointing  The key given to me has a wrong room number  and the passcode into the room was not given to me  making the check in process very confusing  The response was in time though when I sought for help  The value of the room is not so good compared to the price  the building and facilities were a bit old  key has wrong room number  and passcode to the room not given to me
672944354,The apartment is cute and a great location  The bedding had some dirty marks but it was clean other than that  My only issue was that at one point the elevator wasnt working and you needed a stair garage key to take the stairs which we werent given  When I contacted zen city the guy I spoke to on the phone was pretty dismissive and unsupportive of the fact we were locked out and wouldnt  even give me a rough timeline or plan for getting it handled  Fortunately the elevator started working again so it wasnt a big issue but just something to note
213877247,Great place  Im seriously thinking about buying a place in Chicago because my stay was so good  Thanks Chris Great spot however didnt know how to work the heater and was a little cold  Never the less   you are a GREAT host
457632606,Great place   nice location  Only thing that sucked was the parking 
210127222,The studio was very conveniently located by the University and is a perfect location for a school visit  Internet worked well after we found the correct instructions  the ones in the book and not the ones on the whiteboard   The bed was very comfortable and the linens very clean  The bus connection to downtown is only a   min walk away and a grocery store is nearby  Otherwise the neighborhood is uninteresting  but most people dont come to Hyde Park for the neighborhood  Hi Chris  the place was pretty much as described and served us well  I reviewed it as we found it  However  I must say  I was a bit put off by the request for a   star review as this really distorts the information that is given to other renters  like me    Oh  and the purchasing of movies somehow does not work  Netflix as well as Amazon requested a password for the purchase of movies  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  shower or tub  Additional comments   Overall it was quite clean but the bathroom did have quite a bit of hair and dust     very appropriate 
447975121,If you are happy with super clean and have no reason to want anything to make it feel cozy and welcome  this is the place  Location is great  You will feel super safe and so much to do in walking distance  If you want to snuggle on the couch and watch a show   bring a blanket  No extras here  the soap bar was TINY  not good The experience would have been much better if there had been any effort to make it feel welcoming  There was small hotel sized bottles of shampoo and a hair dryer  but there was no extra towels  no effort to make me walk in and smile and feel like I was happy with my choice to rent this unit  It was sterile and clean  Not even a single sample of coffee on the morning after my   am arrival to the city    Ive just stayed in so many airbnbs and the reason I keep choosing airbnb over a hotel is for the fun experience of seeing how different hosts welcome and treat guests  Its just inspiring  This one left me feeling like I should have just used a hotel 
436704058,Great location  We appreciate the stay  Our place was a smidge dirty with hairs in the bed and random crumbs  I am understanding  Some crumbs and hairs randomly through the place 
206970580,Great place  good communication  Hi Chris  I would have given you   stars  but I was actually a bit taken aback when you sent a message requesting that I leave you a   star review seems a bit presumptuous  and should be based on experience rather than a request from the host  Great place though  thanks very much 
576459386,Great place and host Initial code was incorrect  Quick response though
444233744,Room     leaves a lot to be desired  The kitchen has NO counter to work on  no cooking sharp knife  very little cutlery  if youre   tall you can use the cabinets  seating only for    The bed was lumpy  no air condition in bedroom  the tubs are slippery  the worse sofa to sit on  We sat on extra pillows on top of the sofa to have a little comfort  It was noisy   No lighting as you come in at night  you need to turn on a lamp that barely lights the living room   Theres a place to sit on in the living room that is super dirty   In short  that and a previos Airbnb place we stayed on Blackstone have the worst places weve ever stayed  I dont recommend this place except for having two bathrooms  The apartment was not what we hoped for or expected
573944976,Ive stayed in this building before  My family lives on both sides of the water so it was a nice location  The second time staying here I was placed in the basement  Little natural light coming in but it was still a cute place  My biggest problem was with the shower  The pressure was absolutely terrible  It was sprinkling on me and I had to stand directly under it to even get that  I called to have someone come fix it but it was never fixed  I know there was someone that came to  check  the shower head because there was urine all over the toilet seat upon my arrival  I would stay here again if the host was better about getting that shower head fixed and if they didnt allow workers to just come in and make themselves comfortable around my stuff  I reached out multiple times about the shower head  No one ever came to fix it so my sister and I were bathing in sprinkles of water  which sucked  I understand that this is a superhost but showers are essential 
150370776,Very nice recently renovated place  Easy to get to from the airport and only a      minute Uber drive to downtown Chicago   Thanks for hosting us  
430448878,Not designed for comfort  Not designed for comfort  Also the power strip in the bedroom didnt work  Keys were miss labeled Less noise
429306434,It is a nice place   Parking is very difficult though at night time  I would like to have known more details about the parking situation 
428725921, lots of natural light   spacious  comfortable bedrooms  nice kitchen with filtered water from the fridge  French press and coffee grinder  bring your own coffee  theres a little grocery store about   blocks down   basic kitchen equipment  Netflix and other streaming services   Bluetooth speakers  charging stations  small touches like extra pillows  sheets  lots of towels  lint rollers  umbrellas  etc were well stocked   street parking very easy to find   no full length mirrors  pet peeve  Just get an    one at target and hang it behind a door    thin walls  very easy to hear neighbors     Overall  a good place to stay in a pretty convenient area  Would recommend  Thanks for the quick responses on our issues  The space was really nice and comfortable   We were really unhappy on our first morning  especially with all of the warnings about noise levels  decibel readers  and quiet hours only to find that our upstairs neighbors clearly had an after bar party from           AM   I dont want to leave a bad review  because most of the experience was good  but the noise and the bathroom situation was less than ideal   Just honest feedback  Thanks for letting us stay  As I had mentioned  the cloudy  standing water in the clogged shower was really gross and off putting  It led me to believe that the shower floor had not been cleaned between guests  The toilet seat was really loose and wobbly  like  extremely    so my husband tightened that and plunged the shower drain  which was quite gross 
404302163,Overall a pretty good place  but the pictures made it look bigger and less worn down 
423268855,The overall stay was okay  The space and location were great  I stayed for   days  When I got there most of the dishes were dirty in the dishwasher  I located those AFTER I purchased paper plates and cups  The living room and bathroom needed to be cleaned  as it hadnt been swept  and there was long brown hair in the tub  On my last day  I cleaned the entire apartment and washed the linens  as I assumed I needed to because the apartment hadnt been cleaned after the previous guests  I came out to find that my car had been towed  It hadnt been specified by the host nor in the listing that parking is PRIVATE and paid for by residents  Im currently out of an extra      that I had to pay to get my car back AND a cleaning crew showed up  So a waste of energy as well  Im highly disappointed and disgusted  Hair in bathtub  living area had not been swept or vacuumed  dirty dishes left in dishwasher
419754248,Fairly trendy  Bathroom is nice  Bluetooth speaker is a plus   Apps loaded on tv  Wouldve liked a coffee maker  even if coffee isnt provided    Good neighborhood and clean place at a fair price  We enjoyed our stay  Although clear instructions about the location of the lockbox was provided  there arent any numbers on the doors  so it was a little confusing  Also  it wouldve been nice to ha e a coffee maker  even if coffee wasnt provided   All in all  it was clean and quiet  so we werent disappointed
419225643,The place is a nice size for a couples getaway  Pretty quiet neighborhood and complex  I had very little issues with the place other than one night there was a strong garbage like smell  I assume it was from one of the rooms around because the walls are thin  It lasted for hours then went away  Other than that I would definitely recommend renting it out  This was a very nice space to stay in  a great size and it was well put together  I enjoyed the stay and the nice area  thank you for allowing us your space for the weekend  Nothing major just finger prints on walls and crushed chocolate like pieces in the bedroom and livingroom
415779646,The heating system is very old and makes strange noises  The building has strange smell The building and the place has bad smell and heating system is scary
412108484,I wrote on another unit from this company and Im going to write on this one too  I would never stay with this company again  The place was disgusting  I dont believe they have people cleaning the units  at least in the building I stayed in  As soon as you walk in your reaction is  ew   Had a disgusting smell  The couch reaked  of body fluid odor and had what I believe to be a stain from sexual intercourse  All of the linens were dirty as well as the fridge and the bathroom  I had to go to work cleaning the unit as soon as I got in because it was either that or leave and not have a place to stay due to things being last minute  The company has a horrible response time and are very unorganized  Ive never had a problem with any Airbnb Ive stayed in and Ive now stayed in a few to say the least  This one was absolutely gross  You pay almost as you do for a nights stay  as a cleaning fee  Just to have the unit very gross  Would never stay with this company again  Very gross
408070719,Nice location  quiet  perfect for those who want privacy and a good view of the sunset rise  Easy access to trains  neighborhood   expressway  Parking is hard to find  It was a warm little place with all the necessities  supplies  good bedding  storage    Directions need to be more clear and weather sensitive since the building was blocked off for ice  The neighbors were quite loud with their music but it was fine seeing that the walls are indeed thin  Inside smelled fresh  outside the apartment smelled of rotting fish because of the pile of garbage at the end of the hall    The laundry situation should have been handled better  Laundry machines dont really accept all cards  mine was a visa with a chip and it never read on any machine     Response time was bad  but even though you took long you still answered with accurate info but a little too late  for i had to figure it out myself or attempt to mend the situation myself 
722796738,Nice place
403254375,The location was very good and you can find groceries and food within walkable distance  the floor was not clean enough  you dont want to walk on your bare feet
722772202,Very clean  stylishly efficient and very well situated with places like Harper theatre Pizza Capri Silver Room and plenty of shopping within walking distance there was delay and abit of confusion about the key and access at check in kitchen and bathroom could be better stocked with complimentaries  paper towels  water  etc
401927458,The place was a bit older than expected  the sheets on the bed were a little dirty with stains and lint hair but other than that it was alright
559713396,The space was GORGEOUS  Super stylish and comfy  The only issue was with check in  room was not ready at check in time and the host did not give us a heads up about it 
366522412,Great location  Big space  Make sure you ask them to clean before because ours was not  I really did love your place and would maybe stay again  but the way the cleaning situation was handled was really poor  We wanted to ask for a refund of some sort due to your phone service and lost key but your cleaning woman was so nice we did not  The key was not in the spot they said it would be  making us wait    minutes in the cold calling back and forth with the company  We came into the apartment trashed  It had been overlooked  When I called Zencity to ask if it could be cleaned  they were very rude and asked if it was  urgent   The cleaning staff was very nice though when they arrived  but I felt uncomfortable the entire stay knowing the place really wasnt that clean 
364511264,The place was very clean  but  much smaller than I expected it to be  The bathroom was extremely small and I didnt even want to take a shower because of the joke of a shower head that was there  It was very hot when I arrived and the old school heaters made it difficult to bring the temperature down  My husband searched all over for a remote and was unable to find it so we never touched the television  The heater in the living room was leaking when we returned after a night Out  and it was  water all over the floor which was annoying  The host was responsive but unable to actually make our stay more comfortable  I appreciated the place being clean  in a nice area  and well stocked of toiletries but with the little issues we had helped me to decide that I would never use this location again 
362589600,The location is the best part  everything we needed was in walking distance or driving distance  Theres not much to the apartment itself  so you have to make it your own experience or youll be bored but its nice and has great things for a getaway  Zencity are great host  they check up on you and kept it professional  I loved it   I would rent with them again Thanks for hosting us   The linen was just badly stained and there was no dish liquid soap to clean dishes especially for those who dont use dish washers  I did use it but the dishwasher still didnt clean dishes well even after pre wash 
362119539,This place is very near to Chicago downtown and very accessible to all restaurants and pharmacies  The room space and the amenities are all great and very much clean You will get everything what all are needed for a stay  We dont have to carry any samples also  But we had a issue with bath tub in which the water is not draining and accumulating which became a very frustrating problem for us  Also the bathroom size is very small  We did not find any room temperature settings in the room and we felt very hot in the room  The room is an old one but with all upgraded things and is clean  Thanks for hosting  We enjoyed our stay but we had a big issue with water draining from the bath tub  The water from the bath tub is not draining out and accumulating  So it was a major issue for us as we both couldnt even take bath for   days  All other amenities are good but as bath became a problem for us we are not satisfied very much  The responses are automated and not clear
361770325,Very disappointing experience  Check in was fine overall  though the host did not inform of a second non working lock on the door  therefore we had some difficulty accessing the unit  Tub was completely filthy    dirt and hairs throughout the tub  Shower curtain was stained with dirt as well  Hairs throughout the tub  bathroom floor and hairs on the bedroom sheets  Large bug on the wall as soon as we entered the unit  Host was slow to respond and refused to send someone to clean the unit  although we thought we paid for an already cleaned unit  until the next day  We waited around the next morning and no one arrived to clean while we were present  Very disappointing   especially due to it being Christmas weekend 
359654941,The place was nice and everything was appreciated but the hallways are terrible and the bed was kinda uncomfortable  But overall the place was nice and in a good location Thanks for being a great host
356579353,It was one of the worst experiences I have had with Airbnb zencity is a unprofessional company I had medical supplements maild and everything arrived fine I picked them up from the mailroom BUT THE LAS   pakeges that were diliverd I was told by the mail room employee that it was in the mailbox so I contained Chris from zencity he said he would go on Monday to get it from the mailbox this was a Friday I said ok Monday come around he never replied until I contacted hem then he said that there was nothing in the mailbox I had tracking the tracking information said the pakege was diliverd whe theres a diliverd the delivery company scans it therefore I knew that it had been delivered then Chris sent me a message saying that he is not liable for anything I basically believe that they kept my pakeges he was rude and disrespectful  You are unprofessional company
714431748,Very clean place in a great location  Would stay there again  The place was very clean and stylish  My only suggestion relates to the sofa  It is not in good working condition and so watching Tv to relax was not as enjoyable  The sofa should be updated and maybe consider adding a Tv to the bedroom  Other than that it was an excellent experience  Merci
355774512,Es un muy buen alojamiento  lindo  amplio y por sobre todo  totalmente equipado   Localizado muy cerca del centro de convenciones y de estaci n de metro  Quiero agradecer a Chris su hospitalidad   Nos oriento muy bien respecto a nuestras necesidades     cosas nos gustar a decir     La tina del ba o se vaciaba muy muy lento  Debe haber estado parcialmente tapada  Lo comunicamos y no fue resuelto durante nuestra estad a       El ruido del aire acondicionado era muy molesto    De todas maneras  nuestra primera experiencia con Airnb fue muy buena  la repetiremos y la recomendaremos   Gracias
354411213,We enjoyed our stay in Chicago very much  Check in went perfectly and the place was beautiful  even though the fridge in the kitchen wasnt perfectly clean and we the heating system was quiet confusing  Im not sure whether we did something wrong  because when the temperature in the lower floor was warm  the upper rooms were completely overheated  But nevertheless  this place was nice and we totally enjoyed staying there  The area around the place was also very nice with cool bars  restaurants and shops  and we could recommend this area for a stay in Chicago  Hi  thank you very much  We liked your place very much  but the fridge wasnt cleaned inside and we had some problems with the heating system  as when the lower floor was warm  the upper rooms were way to hot  Would be good to get some kind of instruction  But nevertheless we totally enjoyed our stay in Chicago and at your place   Thank you very much Fridge wasnt completely clean and not all rooms were vacuumed
353571840,El departamento es peque o  no es nuevo  Est  en una villa estudiantil  El pasillo tiene malos olores  y el refrigerador no funcion  durante mi estancia lo que hizo que mi comida se echara a perder   Est  muy bien conectado tanto por metro como por bus  Tranquilo y con supermarkets cercanos  Tiene lo b sico para una estancia tranquila y de presupuesto c modo  Las llaves fueron dif cil de encontrar  las llaves no funcionaban bien  El anfitri n respondi  pero no resolvi   las inquietudes  recomendaciones de transporte  problema con refrigerador  El refrigerador no funcion    d as  la comida se ech  a perder  El anfitri n no ofreci  Soliciones  tampoco respondi  sobre recomendaciones de tr nsito 
352643698,If youre looking for something cost efficient then this is the place to choose  Thanks for having me and we would definitely stay again  Before check in  I was given a specific lock box to open for the keys to the entrance door and apartment door  After using the code I was given for the lock box I discovered there were no keys  I had to wait outside but no longer than   minutes for a response in which the keys were in a different box  Also the the actual apartment key seemed to be new or maybe the locks were recently changed but I myself and my guest had a difficult time locking and unlocking the door  But we both were pleased with the space and views of Hyde park  The space fit   people comfortably for a very reasonable price 
351135832,Great location  walkable to a lot of stuff for what we needed  Great space with a very comfortable feel to it  Would stay here again  The shower head in the bedrooms bathroom didnt work at all and the main shower had a hard time draining  Not huge items but wanted you to know for the next person 
349511969,Better than expected 
539061865,Awesome location  and great value for the price  There were minor issues  but nothing that would prevent me from staying again  Check in and check out was very well organized and easy    Be prepared to walk up   stories of stairs to the penthouse level though  Its an awesome space  but can be hard to get to if you have mobility issues 
535931261,Nice area  cute place but fruit flies everywhere   Also construction was going on so we were awakened at  am every day by heavy machinery   Overall cute and homey  Other than the two above stated
708330811,I typically never write bad reviews and often am pretty easy to forgive and accomdate for the situation  However  when I had arrived  the place had not been cleaned despite their COVID policies in the listing  There was brown and yellow things floating in the toilet and other waste  The sheets hadnt been changed  towels that had been used were still hanging and the floor was not clean  I did  book my stay the day of  but I dont think that if a room isnt ready  that it excuses a room from not being cleaned prior especially given the pandemic and need for cleanliness as a health and safety risk  I did contact support and at first they said they would send someone for touch up  but it really needed more than a touch up   needed a full clean  Thankfully the lady who cleaned the room was kind and did a great job  but I am definitely not booking again with Zencity ever again and did not appreciate the nonchalant approach at first when I made my request  When I first arrived  the room had not been cleaned  There was scum and leftover waste in the toilet  The sheets had not been changed  Towels from the past person were still hanging and the floor had not been cleaned 
343502935,Host number on listing does not take calls for AirBNB reservations  Gave me another number which just slowed down response time  Keys left did not fit lockset  so I was unable to check into apartment  Ended up paying twice as much for a hotel        a few blocks away  The number listed on your page does not answer Airbnb calls  This delayed a prompt resolution  Your instruction said one key should open both locks for the apartment door and it only fits one key  The second key  the one that broke  does fit the lock but broke before unlocking  N A
341688593,Moldy bread left in the kitchen cabinet made the whole unit smell like trash  Other than that the unit was excellent and as described  The immediate area wasnt super vibrant  but overall the location was great  close to two different L lines and just a short ride to the loop  Didnt get buzzed in  luckily another resident came by at that moment Moldy bread left in the kitchen cabinet made the whole unit smell like trash  The immediate neighborhood is pretty dead  but its close to downtown and multiple L lines for getting around  Expensive  but all the options in Chicago were 
337806107,El alojamiento es tal cual ves en las fotos  tiene muy buenas conexiones con transporte p blico   una estaci n de bus en la esquina del edificio   y un Whole Foods a poca distancia  El apto tiene lo b sico para una agradable estad a y Chris resolvi  todas mis dudas  No puedes dejar tu equipaje despu s del check out en Recepcion ni tampoco recibir paquetes mientras no estas  Chris   Thank you for give all answers that I needed  I wish I could leave my luggage in the reception because of my late flight  La persona de recepci n del edificio poco amable
337580051,Fab spacious apartment  clean and comfy with good kitchen  Responsive host  Hi Chris  The apartment is really lovely and clean  As this was a work trip the WiFi issue was quite a serious problem for me   the Xfinity solution didnt really work  Thank you for trying though   I dont know if it should but the vent in the kitchen makes a lot of noise  though once used to it it wasnt a problem  The graffiti that can be seen through the paint on one of the rooms was a little intimidating  odd to someone new to a city   The beds were super comfy   lovely clean linen  Problem with building key  it was almost impossible to use  had to use back up one in the end  Was worried would get locked out  Sometimes a  it delayed in responding   WiFi issue not really resolved 
336806566,This place was a lot smaller than expected and not worth the price 
336722176,Location  location  location   We liked being five blocks from the train and Whole Foods   Having two bathrooms was an unexpected treat   Bed was wonderful  I added a note on a previous page   We enjoyed our stay and would choose to come back again   I could have given five stars if the missing coffee pot had been replaced  We communicated four times after arriving requesting the replacement of the French Press pot which was missing   Although Chris promised to drop one off  it never arrived   A coffee pot is listed as one of the amenities   I also suggest the addition of a dish drying towel  There was a dish rag  but no drying cloth 
334635613,Very cute place in a nice area  Not far from public transit and quick ride to downtown  Loved the place  A couple things I would recommend are to offer water or some sort of water filter  Additionally  the bathroom door didnt close 
326616781,Needed a place to stay in Chicagos Hyde Park neighborhood  unexpectedly  Was delighted to find this listing as the location was perfect   PROS  Centrally located  on a quiet block  in a great neighborhood  It is a two block walk to   rd street which has many stores and restaurants  including a Target  This listing also has an in unit washer and dryer  with detergent and bleach provided  There was a smoothie blender  coffeemaker  french press  and all the basic kitchen utensils  Salt  pepper  and cooking spray were also provided  The unit was well stocked with toliet paper  paper towels  and cleaning supplies  The space was large  uncluttered and easy to maneuver  The bed was well made  comfortable  and provided a good nights rest  The tub had Jacuzzi style jets   CONS  The listing was not as clean as one would like  There was a thick layer of dust on all the light fixtures  the fire extinguisher  and the windows  The hardwood floor  in the kitchen area  was gritty  There was a large spider in the corner of the bedroom  to the right and above  the bed  There were two large water  bugs in the shower  The tub was discolored  which made it look dirty  When a     a night listing is almost doubled in price because of a     cleaning fee  one expects things to be clean  In addition to the regular and expected displeasure from finding a rented space in this state  it was doubly bad for us because my partner has asthma  She had to go find a cafe while I cleaned the unit of dust  before she could come back in   Over all this was a nicely appointed space that would be perfect for up to   people to stay in for as long as was needed  The convenience of an in unit washer and dryer really set it apart  above  and beyond   It would be a four star listing if it had been properly cleaned and was a little less expensive  As it was  I give this unit     stars  Whomever is doing your cleaning at this location is not doing a great job  Otherwise the space was lovely and just what we needed  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  shower  bugs  floors and carpet  Additional comments   There was a thick layer of dust on all the light fixtures  the fire extinguisher  and the windows  The hardwood floor in the kitchen was gritty   There were two large bugs in the shower  Also  the tub looked discolored  which made it look dirty   
617328257,Nice little spot right in midtown  Very easy check in
324764543,Very nice place to stay  Hyde Park is nice area  and downtown is within reasonable drive train ride  I would make sure to stay within Hyde Park area though  apparently things can get rough around it  Apartment was nice and clean and building is very quiet  no problems at all comes to noice  Water temperature in shower was a bit inconsistent  that would be my only complaint  Thank you for providing us a place to stay  Mostly I was happy with the apartment  The water in shower was not very warm  It was not freezing either  and showering wasnt too uncomfortable  Still  I could not give a   star review due to that  We wanted to check in earlier than I originally told the historia  after the  pm check in time still   I asked If there was any problem to do that  but did not get an answer  The earlier than planned check in worked out fine  but it would have been nice to get a response  The street building is located on is very nice and quiet  I also liked Hyde Park area a lot  Apparently Hyde Park is close to some rougher areas  so its good to do some research of where not to wander  Uber and Metra were convenient ways to get to downtown Chicago 
322271236,Great location and good value  Communication with the host could be confusing  and guests should note both that     a digital keypad is used for entry and    the door and keypad alarm is extremely sensitive and likely to go off  even when simply locking the deadbolt from inside  Had a tough time getting good information or responses  The check in instructions in the details page were different than those sent via message ahead of time  and my follow up questions by message and phone went unaddressed unreturned   Unit location is great  and values pretty good  but the difficult check in and communication issues overshadowed it for me 
317071496,Pros   Great area  walking distance to Frank Lloyd Wrights Robie house  University of Chicago  etc  Theres ample street parking and the building is cool  Easy check in and checkout  Very responsive communications from Chris   Cons  The studio did have a really strong smell of cleaning products when we arrived  We opened all the windows and left for a couple of hours  during which time it mostly dissipated  Also  the rug under the sofa futon was wet  Turns out the problem was the AC  We discovered that it leaked when running  which soaks the floor  We reported this to Chris Zencity and he was going to check it out  so probably not an issue for future guests  Finally  the door to the bathroom was very difficult to close completely without brute force  Might be an issue if youre staying with someone you arent very close to 
319502491,The place is as described and looks like the photos  Location is great  being on Milwaukee and in a bustling fun neighborhood like Wicker   The only downside is the place is still under construction and  super sketchy  For example the construction workers are scary unprofessional   yelling names  listening at the door  they knew my wife was alone in the apt  it was like they wanted her to  checkout earlier so they could work  How they even knew this info was unsettling suggests  Zencity   works with them  Otherwise I am not sure why youd be bothering a tenant guest suggesting they hurry up  leave  Something definitely not right here  I would not recommend staying because of this    Disclaimer were born and raised in Chicago  we live on the south side  this was is crazy to us 
456459652,Great experience overall  Clean  well located and modern  Mattress and pillow situation could be better but OK for short stay  Great experience overall  Clean  well located and modern  However  the pillows need to be upgraded  they were all extremely thin and the mattress wasnt that comfortable 
314936419,The suite had a nice vintage feel too it with a touch of modern here and there  The place was very clean and had all the amenities that is required  WiFi is very spotty though and host takes a very long time to reply  Parking is a hassle because there is no parking on premises  so you either get very lucky and get street parking or you have to park farther away and pay  The neighborhood is very nice and is conveniently close to many shops  Overall a nice place  just little things that made me not completely enjoy my stay   Hey I left a bag in the apartment and I was wondering if there is anyway I can retrieve it    Hard to find Parking 
715328255,Very nice  homey  and stylish place  Really close to highway and hospital so expect alot of city noise and ambulance  We loved your place so much  It was very homey and stylish  I will check out more places in the future  Host never responded to me but I had no questions just updates Nice area and very close to the highway so lots of street noise
463114818,dont stay here lost email with instructions host never responded to a long time to in dirt on bed said there was street parking   good luck with that
462938926,We had a solid stay  Great communication about how to check in  a spacious unit with a comfortable bed and linens  and a lovely location bonus  The Hyde Park Community Art Fair turned out to be one street away  which offered up a great way to visit the neighbourhood and enjoy local street eats  Thank you for the effort you put into our stay  We really appreciated the detailed instructions for check in  the spacious layout  and a comfortable bed    We had a few issues that Ive mentioned elsewhere  that made our stay a bit below a    experience for the price  we do appreciate that it was an extra pricey weekend everywhere due to the conference   I did want to mention that considering you have lockbox entry  I felt a bit stressed having to advise exactly when wed be checking in  on top of fairly rigid timing in the first place  plus then you didnt respond back once I tried to offer multiple best answers possible  With no context response  I couldnt tell if there was an issue  or if this was just a gentle inquiry  On the whole  our experience was solid and our public review will reflect that    Best wishes   leilah While most of the space was clean  there were several stains on the couch that were pretty unappealing   and empty and non functional handsoap in both bathrooms  For a pretty expensive booking fee  a bit of flexibility with check in time  a less worn down living room  and not having to hunt down our own soap would have made this a    stay 
460988214,Very close proximity to Barnes Hospital  doorman very courteous and helpful  Maybe have coffee available   When I think of B   B  there is usually coffee available and very often very simple breakfast items  Initial responses speedy but later they were more delayed  e g  had to ask them to resend final details of check in  did not respond when I had to check out   days early or acknowledgement when I checked out  Due to its proximity to a major medical establishment  am guessing many guests are hospital visitors or patients as in my care   As a result  hospital stays are dynamic   as in my case in that I pre paid   nights but due to an unexpected early hospital discharge  I only stayed one night   My stay was quite expensive for one night  Also the service charge and occupancy fees were quite a large component of the total cost which I have not experienced in other stays 
161836573,We enjoyed being so close to Michigan Ave  Would stay here again 
161796055,Great location  Didnt include much information about Wi fi and cable 
153747064,Great location  convenient to public transit  food  nightlife  Just poor water pressure and temperature in the shower and sinks  Made it difficult to get ready there   We enjoyed the convenient location of the space and it was enough for what we needed it for  but the shower pressure was almost non existent  Also I couldnt get any hot water  so I was forced to shower at my friends apartment  Had I not known people in the city  this would have been a big problem for me  May want to have someone take a look at it  Thank you for the smooth check in and check out  just fix the water and it will be great   Found a used tissue in the window ledge    While getting the key was easy  there wa son instruction for the code to get into he door from the lobby to the stairs  Had to ask someone who lived there for it    There was very little water pressure and no hot water in the shower  Ended up showering at my friends apartment  I liked the space but not having a shower that worked well put a damper on things  
607331031,Good stays with zen city  Small thermostat issue at this apartment  Im sure they will have it resolved by the next stay  Good bed pillows and great check in experience  Will stay with them again Have stayed with you all before  and like you guys  Consider this stay a one off as it was a bit subpar with thermostat issues and used washcloth  but will explore staying with you all again on my next trip to kc  Used washcloth in shower Thermostat issue
148290528,Pros   terrific location  Convenient to everything the Gold Coast has to offer   His unit is on a quiet street  Building is quiet for the most part  Chris responds to your questions in a timely manner  There is an instruction manual that helps explain everything    Cons  The unit could have been cleaner  We found old socks on the kitchen floor and next to the bed  dust on top of the refrigerator and on shelves  woodwork around doors and base boards are dirty  I found a half empty pop bottle on the window sill next to the bed  Water pressure is low  maybe it was just on our weekend  and I went to take a shower and the diverter wouldnt stay up  thus no water came up through the shower head  No showers this weekend   With a little attention to detail  this could be a   star place  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  dust  bathroom 
138410904,The apartment building location is very convenient and close to a lot of great places  The entry to the apt  itself though is odd  but Chris spells it out clearly in the instructions  Stairs up to apartment are very steep   Living room furnishings  futon and eating table chairs are bare bones  not comfy  Bed was comfortable  but room was chilly because of big windows  My husband uses a CPap machine and had to put a folding chair next to bed to put it on because there are no nightstands  although plenty of space  Nothing to see out windows except brick wall and dumpsters  Chris responds quickly and supplies lots of tips and information about the area   The apartment is fine as far as a place to sleep  not hang out in  and you cant beat the convenience of the location   Thanks  Chris  We enjoyed our visit to Chicago  My only suggestion is that we couldnt find a blanket  You might want some extra bedding  My husband wanted to sleep on the futon but we couldnt find extra sheets or a blanket or anything  The bedroom was much colder than the other room   Also  people should be warned that the stairs are quite steep and not safe if you have bad knees  The location  except for the weird entrance  was convenient  
128089860,Cute and cozy apartment  perfect for a couple wanting to explore the city  Central to just about everything and very convenient  Chris was very helpful and always reachable via AirBNB messenger   The apartments location couldnt have been more convenient  The place was cute  cozy and very easy to relax in  The only ongoing issue was the very loud heaters which we couldnt seem to turn off  The noise was so disturbing that it kept us from sleeping a couple of nights  The temperature was also pretty hot and hard to control maintain  We also thought that a microwave might be nice addition to the kitchen  Thank you for lending us your place  
722845017,Wonderful location  great parking  Felt very secure  Thank you for everything  Great location  Love the parking  The furnishings of the unit were a little sparse  Some difficulty getting into the building
590081358,Great place to stay for a short time
582261783,Nice aesthetic  quaint space to be alone for spiritual retreat  Also  Baileys downstairs has really good shakes   Ive never tasted anything like it I liked this place so Ill probably be frequenting this stay and youll be hearing from me again soon with another booking   Ashley Security and checkin was a bit difficult because of the codes not working sometimes but it didnt hinder me from enjoying my trip because of one two mishaps
582265089,Building was under construction so there was a funny smell literally everywhere  Was clean and nice  just expected a finished building for the price Building was under construction
580991769,This is a very nice and stylish space  We loved how convenient the location was and how easy it was to get to and get into  We didnt love how much of our neighbors we could hear  music and conversations  but we stayed the night during a trip so we werent there for too long  We were a last minute stay and we appreciate being able to get us in and enjoyed the overall stay  Thank you for the stay  The location was perfect and it made a great pit stop on our journey 
611618230,I was waiting for   more hours for check in 
583384352,Centrally located on main strip of central west end  No designated parking but street parking on the side with meters  Wi fi was super slow the whole time  We couldnt log into Netflix because there were too many users  Check in instructions were very complicated but well laid out  The florescent lighting is abrasive in most rooms  Feels more like a hotel than an air bnb  Nice lobby  nice furnishings in the room  Good water pressure  The listing says sleeps   but only one bed available  Very pricey for the amenities available  Not many  Clean but I do not recommend  Add a wi fi server because yours was very slow  Too many people were on Netflix so we couldnt watch  we had to use our own  Please sign out of ours  Also the listing says sleeps   but there was only one bed  There is no designated parking  Try using soft white light bulbs for lamps  not as abrasive Parking  Working wifi  Netflix that worked   Food staples  Difficult instructions to check in to follow very complex  Non flourescent lights 
720086617,Super cute apartment located walking distance from tons of food and entertainment  The apartment was a little messy but besides that it was excellent and definitely worth the price 
582716349,The Bell Lofts is a beautiful building in a wonderful location  Stores  restaurants  attractions and even medical facilities are well within walking distance  This apartment is nice  Its very clean   Do note that the walls to the bedrooms are partial walls and do not connect to the ceiling  if youre sharing the space  dont expect any privacy     I enjoy staying at the Bell Lofts  this stay was ok  but there are certainly better ones in this building  If I were you  Id skip this one and look for a stay that is run by one or two individuals rather than a management firm  Theyll take pride in their space and make sure its outfitted with more than the cheapest furniture  Theyll care enough to answer the phone when youre unable to access the building   Still  you can certainly do worse than this loft  Its overall a nice space  Thank you for our stay  the building was clean and beautiful   Maybe Im a jerk  but does it seem unreasonable that hosts might offer some recompense for forcing someone with arthritic knees to use the stairs for a stay on the seventh floor  You probably think Im being ridiculous  but it caused significant struggle and pain for my wife   Id have appreciated any kind of gesture of good will in an attempt to try to help  Without a functional elevator  the toll on her knees was too much for us to do our planned activities for our trip  In retrospect  it would have been better to have stayed elsewhere the first night and asked for a refund  I had trouble accessing the building  there was trouble with the intercom system  Ill give extra leeway to the hosts as checkin was on Christmas Day  however it was a drag standing on the street in downtown St  Louis on Christmas Day for a while before discovering an unlocked back entrance all before receiving a response to my phone call  That might have been ok  but since the elevator wasnt working  I had to lug our suitcases up to the  th floor via the stairs 
717211553,It was fun staying in this beautiful apartment  Perfect size for my boyfriend and I  The bed was comfy and the tv let us sign in to watch a movie  The only thing was being in an apartment building you cant tell what will be going on around you  It was kind of loud from nearby apartments yelling and racket that youd expect from being in the city  The price was well worth the stay  I would recommend  There was a moldy pillow in the bedroom closet that was a little bit of a put off  other than that everything was great  parking makes it kind of difficult
570498151,The location was good  The apartment is a bit worn down compared to the pictures but thats pretty standard  The kitchen was nicely stocked with everything youd need to cook with  They provided Netflix which was petty cool  We didnt have any towels when we showed up but once I asked for some they responding instantly and fixed the issue  The only pain in the bum was the no parking thing and going out to the meters every two hours was annoying but thats not their fault  but deff something to keep in mind  Overall a nice stay  I would suggest getting some roach traps for the kitchen since I saw one but it ran away before I could kill it  Other than that it was a nice stay  Thank you 
611372776,Beautiful  quiet and spacious  Responsive maintenance crew  I didnt expect a refund for the bathroom issues but it would have been nice to offer something in its stead There was hair all over the shower and the toliet was slow to drain and got backed up
713271909,The kitchen amenities were helpful for basic cooking and bedroom living room were nice and comfortable  The kitchen sink only gave out hot water  the cold setting didnt work  Parking was ok  mostly a side street half of which they may ticket during business hours  Noise was good in the apartment until someone moved in above me playing loud music       but otherwise never bothered by anyone  There is construction on a new apartment complex right next door however  Laundry was ok  and could pay only with a card  Fitness center fine for basic workouts  Elevator is helpful  I couldnt ever get the deadbolt to work and towards the end of my stay the door wouldnt close latch from the inside  I had to pull hard from the outside to latch it  I just locked the handle from the outside with the key fob to lock the apartment  I let the landlord know these things after I left so they may have this fixed soon   Thank you for the stay  Towards the end of my stay the door was unable to close from the inside and I had to pull hard from the outside to latch the door  The deadbolt also never worked  The kitchen sink also only gave out hot water  it had no cold setting 
566195147,Great location  great ambience and space  Needs a little cleaning and doors secured but overall we loved our stay  Im from STL and I love the new lofts  The bathroom and laundry room floors were dirty from construction and someone walking on them with wet feet and there was a lot of trash in the building  Not just construction trash but trash from the homes too  The door and windows were also open upon arrival  The second day the place smelled like weed as well  The space was great and we enjoyed our stay  I wouldve given a five if the place was secured and clean upon arrival  I will definitely stay again 
564336702,Great location  very quiet given busy neighborhood   Parking less complicated than expected    free parking on street from     pm until early am if you could catch a spot  which we did two nights in a row   Bed super comfortable     Apple chargers all over the place much appreciated  Might want to fix the front door handle    quite loose   The dishwasher almost didnt work   Would have washed dishes by hand  instead of trying to use the dishwasher but no towels to dry with   Nothing a huge deal   All fine but not great  Kitchen garbage was totally full with some nasty stuff    obviously missed by the cleaning crew from the previous guests   Hairs of numerous kinds in bathroom   I used to clean homes in a previous life  so Im picky about such things  I tried asking questions about parking  it was a pretty big concern   I also love my coffee in the morning and asked if any coffee was in the property   I either missed their reply  or didnt get one   I think the latter  but room for error on m part 
614042084,Nice stay  Please provide more towels  wash cloths and linens Good value  But the owner charged me for pillow cases and duvet that I accidentally spilled medicine on  However  it was washable 
609994492,Great clean place  great location  Just was looking for a little more amenities  body wash  shampoo  etc    Check in time was confusing  Air bnb asked and confirmed a check in time but the check in time on Zencitys end was not the same  Overall a really good stay  Provide a little more amenities  Standard body wash  etc  
308021844,Our family of    including   grandchildren had plenty of room in this double unit  It was easy to get to Wrigley and other Chicago sites  Thanks  Brian  Add the few amenities I already suggested  but its a great place 
596431917,Pros   Great area to be in for shops and things to do Apartment was nice and well set up  Cons  FOUR flights of stairs to walk up with no elevator  No overnight street parking  No Netflix Pros   Great area to be in for shops and things to do Apartment was nice and well set up  Cons  FOUR flights of stairs to walk up with no elevator  No overnight street parking  No Netflix
615212831,Gorgeous apartment with great view  Would recommend  The apartment was lovely and gorgeous views  Thank you 
643656625,Great place nice apartment   I wish their was a broom so I could of swept after myself   since the floors are dark all crumbs from cooking etc were very visible and I felt bad leaving it that way    Air conditions wasnt the greatest but I had a fan with me and it helped   Shower was very nice   relaxing  spa like feel  
575594148,The location was great  There were many restaurants in walking distance  The building was filthy upon walking in  There was sticky floors as something large was spilled everywhere leading to the elevator and the elevator smelled of pee and beer  They ended up mopping up late into my second day of the stay but still wasnt spotless  Bathroom wasnt the cleanest  But the rest of the suite was charming and well decorated  Bed and sheets were clean and comfy  There was apparently a leak above the unit and two days we had visitors from the building to inspect  Not hosts fault  Could have been better for the price 
707827196,Property is as shown in the pictures  very nice  The balcony was pleasant to sit and relax on  Great location  short walk to the Plaza area   The on site gated parking is excellent  Also you are minutes from all major attractions  Bring your own soap and shampoo for bathroom as none are provided  The only I had was the noise  You can hear extremely loud footsteps from the unit above  I mean really loud  and the unit on the same floor next to this unit  Shouting from someone upstairs one evening  and their washer dryer you can hear  This was almost constant for my entire stay except for when the people were gone or sleeping  If you are bothered by this I would suggest looking elsewhere or bringing earplugs  headphones  Otherwise great stay  Long black hairs  kitchen counter  bathroom floor  shower stall No response to a message I sent on Saturday the  th
581333022,Nice neighborhood  good transport  easy parking on the street  The building is safe with helpful staff  You should solve the lack of responsibility in case of any problem with the room  I think it is not acceptable that you rent the room in a building and dont take the responsibility for and the building either  You two should make it clear  Other than that  this is a good place  we were satisfied  Thank you  When a sudden problem came out  they replied to my email but misunderstood and did not solve the problem  I had to figure out a phone number of the company in the middle of the night  Made some phone calls without moving forward and if I hadnt been that distinct  they would not have found the solution 
576895601,I checked ahead of time to make sure a later arrival would be ok  I was told there would be no problem  I got into rental property place at roughly  AM and was told by the staff I was not on the list of guests by Zencity to be staying in the apartment for the night  I showed them my airbnb reservation along with my receipt of payment  The rental property staff tried contacting Zencity where they said they were being answered and then told they would get back into contact with them before getting hung up  It took until  AM for them to get back into contact to let the rental property know that I was approved  I had a meeting this morning in Chicago that I only got   hours of sleep for  I leave Chicago Saturday morning and now my trip is ruined because I am exhausted from last night  I had paid for a service that was not met  I had planned and notified them of a late arrival and was told it would be ok  I would have otherwise made arrangements to get into town earlier had I been notified it would not be ok  It was frustrating being told by the rental property that we would most likely not be allowed to stay the night and having to figure out other arrangements  Asked for a refund that they said they would grant over the phone  however didnt hold up to their word  Escalated to airbnb  Carpeting was poorly vacuumed
579842252,This place is great  everything is accurate  Lots of space for   people and the front desk staff are the best  Th The place was great  our favourite part about our stay was the staff at the front desk  WE LOVED THEM  The bathroom shower curtains were moldy  floors were dusty  hair all over washroom  the living room floors were dusty and the bedroom blankets  sheets and pillows were covered in stains 
575577631,My fianc  and I had multiple issues with this Airbnb  First off  upon arriving I was told per my itinerary that the keys to the apartment would be with the doorman at the entrance to the building  Which was not the case   the doorman could not locate the keys and seemed to act like he had no idea what I was talking about  I was also told not to mention anything about Airbnb and instead say that I am staying in a corporate rental  Not sure why the secrecy is necessary but if there is some type of stipulation with the apartment building that bans Airbnb hosts from renting units out you probably shouldnt put your paying customers in the middle of that dont you think  Anyway  He ended up calling a maintenance worker to let us into the apartment after he verified my identification  Upon being let into the apartment at      pm  Airbnb host was not flexible whatsoever about check in time even though he knew it would result in us being basically stranded with nowhere to put our luggage for several hours  the room was occupied with several people whom Im assuming were cleaning the apartment although there was quite the language barrier between us  They informed us the Airbnb   that I already paid hundreds of dollars for for LESS THAN a    hour stay  was NOT ready for us yet and to come back later   mind you our check in itinerary told us  pm and it was well passed  pm by this point  So we had to leave our luggage  which my fianc  didnt know at the time contained an extremely expensive engagement ring  with   complete strangers in an apartment that we still did NOT have keys to for another hour  Which as you can imagine was not a comfortable or secure feeling  When we finally returned the cleaning lady was STILL there and I basically had to ask her to leave  We both have been traveling since   am that morning and were exhausted and had dinner reservations  that we ended up missing because we couldnt get ready in time due to our late check in  to get ready for  Also  the floors surrounding the apartment are currently under construction so expect ALOT of very  disruptive noises throughout the wee hours of the morning  At times it sounded like someone was going to basically come through the ceiling  Not happy whatsoever and will not be booking with zen city again  I hope you guys do better 
570988769,The unit is in a great location with restaurants bars easily accessible in this safe and clean neighborhood  The hosts were very prompt in their communication  The TV is loaded with popular streaming services and the kitchen is well setup  One downside was the shower had barely any water pressure and the tub didnt drain very well which made showering very difficult  Hey guys  there seems to be an issue with the shower and tub that seems to have been reported by an earlier user as well  The shower barely has any water pressure  some previous guest had mentioned this in the reviews  and the tub doesnt drain  The second thing was the bed sheets had stains on them and there was a hair stuck on the photo frame above the bed  With that said  the place itself is well laid out and the location is great  Overall we were fine for the short stay but fixing the shower and bedsheets issue would go a long way for future guests  Bed sheets had stains  Bathroom tub didnt drain and the shower water pressure was barely functional 
570533719,Great location  responsive host  a bit pricey  Looked good  neat  floor and counters were not really dirty but not clean either  Choice of blanket vs comforter  ability to adjust room temp  no thermostat  too cold to leave window open   lower total cost  At      it was overpriced   Still worth it if you want walking distance to lake and town  but less comfort than a hotel room for nearly same cost 
610555811, my stay was maybe   weeks ago so things couldve been fixed by now   Its a decent Airbnb for the price youre getting  The pipes in the master bedroom make some noises at night  The  cold water  faucet on the master bathroom doesnt work  so youre basically gonna have to brush your teeth with hot water  The bath tub doesnt drain very well  All in all  its a nice spacious apartment with nice lobby staff  They just need to fix those flaws and itd be perfect 
615876493,Pros  Nice spacious apartment in a great location  Check in was a breeze and the space met our needs for the weekend    Cons  Host was not responsive at all  seemed like a company managed this and doesnt check their messages  Had been trying to ask questions for almost a month before checkin and never received replies    Outside it was pretty cold and windy but inside the apartment was insanely hot  It was a sauna in there and there didnt seem to be a thermostat in the unit    WiFi speed was just awful  I wouldnt even list it as a feature  Videos constantly pause and load at    p  Tried to watch a movie but decided the WiFi was too bad to put up with and had to hotspot for their smartTV   They only provided   set of keys for   guests  Excellent space  please check your messages  That is how your guests customers communicate with you  Host never seems to check their messages  seems like a machine was on the other end 
620864515,Its nice the water pressure in the bathroom is very light and the water doesnt get hot   Overall thanks for being a great host
201940553,Really close to the train station so it was easy to get to from the airport and its a short Uber ride to downtown  Everything went great the place is really nice and really close to the train station so that made it really easy to get there from the airport  And thanks Max for all your help 
607288290,Very cute place in a good location  Host didnt respond to messages and didnt provide check in instructions until I called    minutes after check in time  But other than thats awesome place  Ensure to respond to messages  Host never provided me with check in instructions and I had to call them while standing outside door to get in  Pillows smelled a little bit Didnt respond to any messages until    minutes after check in time
466670633,Our group had a nice stay in this beautiful home   the house was as pictured  A highlight was sitting on the porch in the evening to enjoy the nice breeze  The location is about a    minute ride from downtown Power and Light  so it was easy to get to restaurants and other attractions  If you have group members with mobility issues  do note that there are stairs up to the house  inside the house  and the claw foot tubs require you to step up and over a ledge to get in  Great place to stay for eco conscious guests  Thank you for hosting us last week  We had a great time and enjoyed your home  We mostly had everything we needed during our stay  but I would recommend for future guests that you add a baking sheet  only close thing we found was a toaster oven tray   a pair of tongs  and a couple of cutting knives  we found one but it was very small and dull    Those would help in the kitchen for people who want to cook a few meals   Your house is beautiful and we appreciated all of the hard work you put into it  Thanks again 
616437087,Decent place  Not the best part of town 
608871162,Great space in a nice location  Space was very comfortable  I enjoyed my stay  I got pretty cold in the living room area due to only being able to raise the temperature to     With such large windows I was wishing to get it to at least        Bed was very comfortable and clean  I never received the parking fob but thankfully I could see my car from the bedroom  I enjoyed the view of the city skyline  Space was very comfortable  I enjoyed my stay  I got pretty cold in the living room area due to only being able to raise the temperature to     With such large windows I was wishing to get it to at least        Bed was very comfortable and clean Shower floor was a bit dirty  Locked out at  am after getting a door code that didnt work  It took around    minutes but thankfully someone responded with a new working code  I almost left 
722588482,Okay
590423722,Location was FANTASTIC   Perfect short drive to downtown  The residence was very hip and unique  Not as clean as I would have thought and missing common things like a coffee maker Starbucks is only a block away   Overall decent experience  They were very quick to respond to the few questions I had
613996601,Great Space and area  Needs to be cleaned with more detail  Was trash underneath the bed  a lot of dust  and upon entering the building  one of the tenants questioned why I was there  so maybe it should be communicated that room is 
721985483,We enjoyed our stay at this apartment  The balcony view is the one of the best features of this space alongside the amazing sheets   pillows  We melted in them they were so comfortable  Youll enjoy a fully stocked kitchen and cocktail cart  We arrived in late hours for check in and was given the wrong passcode for the room door and customer service was not as helpful as I would have wanted as we were waiting outside the apartment for a response and help  Thank you for hosting us  we loved your space  We found the pillows and blankets to be very comforting  The view was our favorite part alongside a fully stocked kitchen and cocktail cart  A few suggestions   wipe down surfaces and walls more throughly and replace the hand soap dispensers in the kitchen and bathroom  I was also given the incorrect passcode upon check in and the customer service rep was not helpful during the frustrating check in process  We had a late check in and were given the wrong code for entering the room  We were left outside the apartment at late hours trying to communicate back and forth with customer service  The customer support was not very helpful or prompt in responding 
722601627,Excelente lugar Es importante dejar claro desde el principio las condiciones y restricciones para estacionarse
610011761,Good location conveniently located right near the red subway line   Easy check in  Thanks for the great space   There is a slow drain in the bathroom sink   Have your maintenance person fish the hair ball out and that should improve things     
608045316,Thanks Beds dirty with hair and debris  Hall way up to unit smelled extremely terrible and was filthy  Unit smelled bad  Had to leave property and get an alternative room due to unsanitary property  Requested a refund and took days to get a response which was ultimately denied  Near alot of bars and restaurants  Over a run down cleaners  Property is owned by zencity and they really dropped the ball on this one  I would advise against staying at any of their properties  A refund in my option was fair since I left the property and never returned  Their communication was slow and poor customer service  Airbnb was no help  They have no standards for customer service in these instances so dont waste your time and money with this pair 
717712132,This place gets two stars    for location and   for responsiveness of the host  We rented for a month long stay and we paid a lot of money for it  The laundry list of damaged furniture and the filth of the place was offensive  We had to have a handy man in twice to properly fix broken furniture and appliances and to scrub scum and dirt from the bathroom tiles  The couch had to be steam cleaned it was so filthy and smelly  We had to request mattress covers because the mattresses were stained and had pubic hair on them  This is definitely a place for parties and not for long terms stays  I corresponded frequently with the host and while super responsive to get issues addressed which was appreciated  a discount reflecting the extend of the disruption would have been even more appreciated  I unfortunately cannot recommend this unit  I appreciate the responsive customer service  However as I communicated early in the stay the cleanliness issues were insulting to the price we paid  Equally the resistance to offering an appropriate discount for the disruption we experienced was disappointing 
610104464,Nice clean roomy one bedroom in great location in Hyde Park and with a  view of Lake Michigan  The couch could be more comfortable but the bed was great  I recommend this place  Hi  I loved the location and nice clean apartment and roomy  Only negatives were that the couch is not comfortable   low and squishy  it is different I think than the one pictured  And the second thing may be related to the building  and that is very low shower stream and pressure  Takes a long time to rinse hair   Regarding communication  when I first looked at it before actual booking I asked some questions that were never answered  I only got auto responses unlike the prior host in Bucktown where I was for   weeks  that answered everything within hours     Overall a very good stay  just wanted you to know the above comments  Thank you 
714284025,Great location   no parking  Amazing apt studio     but needs more attention to detail broken frames hanging alot holes in the wall alot of short dark hair in bathroom floor Im blonde so there no way it was my own  need to work on cleanliness  especially now with covid around  smooth and clear check it instructions  Need to get on whom ever is cleaning your Airbnb and reporting damages to the apt      dirty floors dirty bath tub  bathroom room was decent but even then the rug was very dirty  beside apt has so much potential and great communication and smooth check in no questions 
714554975,For the price  this was an OK stay  A cleaner entered the unit with us at the beginning of our check in to bleach the mildew in the shower  so we had to endure an intense bleach smell for the first evening  An additional cleaning fee was also requested at the end of our stay  Cleaner showed up during our  pm check in to bleach the mildew mold in the shower  The entire unit was left smelling strongly of bleach for our first evening
599030772,A great place to stay  Thank you for a great stay 
608420183,This apartment was a cute place to stay  We wished we were a bit closer to the metro  but that wasnt a huge deal  I loved that the kitchen was fully equipped that allowed us to eat in  I was also very grateful there was laundry because my face wash leaked all over my suitcase   I was able to throw clothes in with no worries  The people living staying above us were a bit loud  We could hear their conversations and them walking running around later in the night  Overall  the stay was very nice  The only reason I did the   stars was because of the check in and the loud neighbors  since it was advertised as a quieter place   It was also pretty cold in certain areas of the apartment as well but we did appreciate the extra blankets in the closets  The check in instructions were not clear until I had to reach out when we got there of course I could have planned that better as well  I did specifically look in the Lincoln Park area per suggestion from a friend but I think we would have been better off closer to downtown or closer to the metro 
711687580,over all great  location  Had a frown do to cleanliness of the linens   and bathroom shower  Over all   great location   bed was comfortable   and  i was at peace during my holiday weekend  enjoyed my stay  however  i feel like i should  refunded for cleaning service   Seeing the bedding was not clean  and  ghe tub had hair inside the shower th Bedding was not fresh  i contacted  company however  they responded late  Over all the bed was comfortable  Ill  let it pass  seeing this was a holiday   Love thzt location  and building   Wouldnt  mind living there  Cleaning fee  should be refunded immediately
616019460,Overall  a good place to stay at 
711452516,I have never arrived in such a filthy apartment  Long black hair everywhere  grease splatter on the upper cabinets  and dust on baseboards  Marty offered to have the space cleaned again  but I did not want anyone in the apartment  I deep cleaned the apartment myself and requested more cleaning supplies and extra toilet paper be left outside of my door  it took   days to get my supplies which were placed inside of the apartment  After cleaning supplies were placed inside the apartment  I was locked out for an hour by the electronic lock  The apartment has damaged drywall and requires repair and painting  It appeared that a long term tenant vacated   and this was the first Airbnb hosting  The apartment is a great space in a great location  I have hosted my own Airbnb apartments and always gave my guests an elevated experience  Marty always did his best to resolve any issues  and I think the next guest will have a better experience after the above issues are resolved  Get your act together 
709498491,Disappointing  The worst   flights of stairs leading up to a decent unit  The shower handle is broken and they dont allow you to control the thermostat in this very cold unit  Very convenient street to stay on  I honestly feel as though I should be reimbursed for a portion of my trip  The cost of the stay is overpriced due to the inconvenient stairs as well as the control of the thermostat  Prior to me confirming my booking I asked if I will have complete control of the thermostat  I was told that I would but that was not the case when we arrived  They then said they unlocked it and gave us control but that was a lie because they never provided the pin to control the thermostat  Once you are inside the unit it is a comfortable stay aside from the temperature  To get to the unit are the ugliest unsafe   flights of stairs I have ever seen 
723894910,Very Small and dont have many appliances
722836069,Convenient  well located  rapid responses  Wifi is a bit slow though  I appreciate the quick responses  location and the ease to check in and out  My only issue was the slow internet connection that only slightly improved after the reboot 
607419530,This is a beautiful loft in downtown St  Louis  ample for four travelers  walking distance to the Gateway Arch  Busch Stadium  the Enterprise Center and Union Station   And reasonably priced  too   We had an HVAC problem  no functioning heat  on a day the high temp in St  Louis was   f   So the place was unlivable   They responded as best they could but could not repair the underlying problem  so we rebooked elsewhere and Zencity refunded their portion of our rental  still waiting on Airbnbs part of it       I am sure if the heating had worked I would have rated it   or   stars   And I am sure they will get it fixed  because it is unrentable without functioning HVAC  Thanks for reimbursing   The unit was beautiful and the location was great   Too bad we couldnt enjoy the weekend there   Thanks for making it right   Hope Airbnb will reimburse their take on this as well     we will see    Thanks  Bob               Management being out of town  Chicago  made it pretty much impossible for them to respond to an issue that made the otherwise beautiful  well appointed and superbly located unit unlivable   Wish theyd had on site help 
722602303,was unsatisfied with this stay i had     hello when i was about to cook i noticed that there was a dirty towel hanging from the stove like somebody used it to clean up then hung it back up  the toilet seat had brown stuff on it even when u lift the seat up    i clean for a living and the place was not cleaned properly     thanks wasnt told i had to use a specific door to enter the instructions said use the side door when i went in the restroom the shower was not cleaned or the toilet i had to clean it before i used it     in the kitchen there was a dirty towel hanging from the stove
721706819,Overall we had a great stay here  The first night we could not get into the building because our fob wouldnt work on the side door  Luckily we found another door the next day that it was compatible with  The apartment was clean overall  but the living room looked like someone had just been there before us  The shower was tilted   the doors wouldnt stay shut  we had to shove a washcloth in between the sliding doors just to keep it shut  Aside from these things  we had a great stay at this apartment  The views were amazing  especially on the rooftop  The rooftop bar wasnt open when we were there but we still went up one morning to take in the views  Great little place for the price 
720515582,TERRIBLE customer support   Its a shame that this place was so cute  I just wasnt able to get into the building  The access code they gave me was wrong  the key fob to get into the building and use the elevators was not working and on top of that Zencity did NOTHING to help  Residents had to keep letting me into the building  when contacting the host they saw that as a resolution  It was New Years Eve with Covid and not a lot of foot traffic  My boyfriend and I were stuck at the entrance for over    minutes waiting for a resident to come home  I had book this place for one night  and had way to much trouble to pay       This was a complete rip off and Im VERY disappointed on how the host has handled my situation and lack of communication  Pick wick place apartments should no longer do business with this company because they have such a nice apartment building  that I would have loved to stay there again  but most definitely WILL NOT  I am VERY displeased with the way your company handled my situation  We were locked out of the building and was told that nothing was wrong  The access code to get into the building was wrong  and our key fob was not working  When trying to get in touch with support  it was difficult  Then when trying to resolve the situation  it was even more difficult  No one actually resolved my error with the access code  or my non working fob  Residents had to keep letting me in and Zencity kept seeing that as a resolution  Couldnt get in contact when I was locked out of the building 
617038497,Beautiful place in Chicago  Parking is harsh  However  the scenery was really nice 
616403602,The place is clean an comfortable The desk for working is very small No place to sit down and eat Took   days to get Coffee plunger and kettle replaced and bathroom tap fixed
615816198,Great place and location 
614296487,Got a great deal on this apartment  it is a little tricky to find the lock box but other then that should be simple  Its located near main streets so if needed walking is possible  Super cozy and cute  Was super tricky to find lock box  Not your fault but maybe describe more  also parking was a hassle
223674767,Brians place has a lot of potential  but there are still a few kinks to work out  The beds are very comfortable and the location was great for getting a quick Lyft ride  Brian is an excellent communicator and did all he could to help us with a few issues we had  Brian  your place has great potential  but definitely some details to work out to match the level we are used to with AirBnb  For example  there is a ton of dirt under the sink in the front bathroom  It looks like construction dirt that is still there  There is no where at all to put your toiletries so that space is needed and it was pretty gross  Both bathrooms had a lot of hair and dust around the baseboards and the corners    We would highly recommend some boot racks  rugs  towels by the entrance  It was impossible to keep that area dry with nothing  Weather in Chicago will require those most of the year    More towels would also be really great  We had one large towel each and no personal hand towels or any washcloths    Last  just a reminder that the couch is broken  so we had barely anywhere to sit  We left the broken stool in the closest so no one would fall and get hurt  Your guest suggested that your space could be cleaner in the following areas  bathroom  dust 
430491764,This house is super cute and a good value  I stayed by myself but it would be great for a bit larger groups  Hosts went above and beyond to return some left behind articles while I was still in town  and I appreciate that kind of hospitality  I did enjoy my stay there and appreciated the extra hospitality in returning my electronics  That was very kind  My notes on the kitchen are for improvements  One other thing that would have been great is if porch lights could have been left on since i made it clear I would be in later after dark  Was really hard to know which house was the right one and I had to call Slavik  who was asleep on the other side of the earth  LOL  Overall I would recommend to others  the house is really cute and has some nice features  Trash can swinging lid was quite dirty  refrigerator door handle dirty  coffee pot had old grounds and coffee in it  Kitchen floor also needed swept  I felt like it should be listed as North Hyde Park  not central 
722825730,The apartment building had very bad cellular reception  I also found a huge roach which I had to kill  I also found mouse droppings in the bed  When I asked the property manager about refunding the cleaning fee they pretty much ignored my request   only refunded the days left on my reservation due to me requesting to leave early  I appreciate being allowed to shorten my reservation however I dont think its fair that a cleaning fee was charged to me due to the amount of sanitary issues I came across  I also had to use my own bug spray in the unit to make myself feel comfortable while there  We found a massive roach in our unit as well as mouse droppings in the bed When I asked for a refund for the cleaning fee I was ignored The apartment unit has horrible cellular reception  I had to leave in order to have a full phone conversation
317852673,This is a lovely restored very old home   Nice and easy to deal with owners  Fairly good location if youre going to sporting events  and outdoor concerts  We did enjoy the stay and the home was very clean and nice old style appearance  Location of home was pretty convenient to the venues of the events we were going to  Friendly attitude of home owner  The only negatives were the showers  A little hard on us to shower in the claw tub with such limited space  We found it to be a little uncomfortable  And would have been nice to have had regular tv programs on the tv and maybe at least one regular tv upstairs  We found several places to grab a meal without having to drive too far  But would have been nice if there were a few nice fast food places real close to house that were in desirable neighborhoods  All in all we enjoyed our trip  Thanks for working with us as we had one person arrive separately and a little before official check in time  Had hoped it was a little closer to some quality restaurants and maybe some fast food places that were real close and in a desirable area 
722399430,The lodging is a secure building in Hyde Park great for shorter visits to Chicago  The view was lovely and its within close distance to the lake  The building staff are also very accommodating  If you like to cook or use the kitchen Id recommend bringing your own tools since the ones provided are worn or arentprovided  The building has good and safe street parking for free and close to a train stop  Good for young adults and couples wanting to visit the city  Id recommend adding some more cooking supplies and replacing the one medium sized pan because its difficult it cook with  The walls were a bit dirty as well not sure why  Communication was good between us however and the Thai restaurant was very good thank you for the recommendation  Not enough adequate cooking supplies to make food easily 
721725761,  great location but no parking on site    there were two spots on spothero within   blocks  but nothing directly on the street after December   for overnight parking   during the day was easy       hr    they were quick to respond via messaging to issues  but the handyman was rude and failed to show up multiple times when promised     days without stove microwave and needing to be moved to another property for   nights is not a big deal   but with two kids during the winter and paying  k for   weeks     yeah  its kind of a big deal       new dishwasher and washer dryer were nice   space looks freshly remodeled  but the furniture looks second hand or worn     wobbely desk and one of the dining room chairs was so bad it wasnt usable     bowls for a  br apartment    one of the widows literally fell out onto the bed our child normally slept on   i guess it wasnt locked in place when we arrived and i never checked   could have been really bad had  somebody been in that bed  sent through text already  issues put aside  it would have been good value   however  too much went wrong for the amount we paid to give five stars
619908947,Great place to stay for a quick getaway  The only issue for me was the lack of free parking but it is in the middle of the city  Overall super clean   quaint Thank you so much for letting us stay  We had a great time  No parking
619173463,Great apartment in a great location  Problems with keypad  very quick response with help Smelly trashcan
712718937,This was a good apartment  Modern  clean  spacious with big windows  Its in a very quiet neighborhood  which I liked  but if youre looking for city life convenience and a bustling lively neighborhood  this place isnt for you  There are no restaurants within walking distance  But the location is actually quite fantastic  A couple of blocks from the Chicago el stop  super easy to access the highway  I got to the OHare airport in    minutes  Biggest draw of this place is the kitchen  There is almost nothing in terms of kitchen supplies  There is a few pans  mugs  plates and cutlery  But no coffee machine       and nothing extra  I did find  however  a bottle of iced tea underneath the bed from the previous guest that was not cleaned out  Overall  a good value for the money and a quiet  clean place to rest  Very comfortable beds  Thanks for the comfortable stay  I would recommend that you put in some more kitchen supplies  like coffee machine  pots and pans  dish towels  etc
617631180,Overall good stay  quiet location  Parking can be quite a challenge past  pm  The parking was pretty difficult to find
721708866,Great spot 
720031730,Place has a GREAT view in the stay and is well worth the price  Very nice and cute place as well as clean  Only hiccup we had was the fob not working and the host not responding anymore after check in when we had a question about parking the fob  Otherwise a great place  Thank you for having us the space has a great view and we liked the space a lot but we wouldve liked more communication when we had questions about parking after we checked in or the fob  We shouldve also asked these question before check in though and will try to remember this going forward The fob didnt work so we had to type in a long code every time  The host also didnt message back when we asked about the issue 
614542137,Best bang for your buck Thank you
614275770,Good central spot for a stay
722550803,This was the worst AirBnB experiences Ive had  I drove    hours and arrived at the AirBnB at    pm  It was self check in  and the code to get the key didnt work  I contacted the host who then self released the key box  No key inside  We try   other boxes and the key was not there  She said the cleaner did not return the key to the box and to go up to the unit to see if it was unlocked  When I went in the tv was on  furniture moved around and the bed un made w make up on the sheets  She had me drive to another unit in town   which had unclear instructions on how to arrive  I ended up not inside until      am  It was not the ladys fault who helped me  I asked for    extra minutes for check out and another person told me it was impossible for them to allow that and I needed to leave by the time they said  They ignored my message when I asked why no one had rectified or even attempted to rectify any of these issues  Strongly would not recommend any bookings w ZenCity no one rectified all my issues and were rude about check out
717891979,Very cute apartment and nice layout  Windows along one side of the apartment and a coffee shop on the first floor made for a great experience  The apartment was very clean and had all the necessary basic needs while staying there  The one drawback was that it was very cold inside of the apartment  While we were there it was about    degrees outside but the windows are old and dont seem to completely seal  We could feel large amounts of cold air coming through from the bottom of the windows   The thermostat locked at    degrees which shouldve made it toasty but it still felt like mid   s  The location was great and overall the building was quiet  We would stay again in warmer weather  We enjoyed the location of this place and the layout  The only downside which is what caused us to give it less than five stars was how absolutely COLD it was inside the apartment   The thermostat was locked at    degrees which in most places would be fine but the windows were leaking a lot of cold air  Which made the apartment feel like it was quite cold throughout the stay  The place was a great value for the price and we would stay again if it was in the summer or spring 
459619503,Brian let his place to us after mentioning that the previous group had damaged the place  He then proceeded to try and charge us       for the damages by the previous group  He also provided no brooms  mops  paper towels or cleaning supplies and then chastised us for not leaving the place spotless  Either leave supplies or use the       you charged us for the place to clean it yourself  Ruined what was a nice weekend with odd behavior after 
709625954,Zencity hosts are slow to respond these days  Ive stayed with them before without issue but now responses can take over an hour  Parking at this location can be an issue  The check in keypad at the building entrance malfunctioned and I had to yell the code several times before the door would open  I inquired about extending my stay at   on the morning of check out  No response until        Check out is     I began gathering the rest of my things and housekeeping showed up at        Zencity then sent me a    dollar bill for delaying housekeeping  I really like the places but given the communication delays then charging me for leaving less than    minutes after check out after waiting over an hour for a response from someone  I doubt Ill be booking with zencity again  Speaker at checking was not working correctly  I had to yell the code several times into the microphone before door was unlocked 
722841522,Great space  great location    We stayed in January  but would consider coming back in the summer to use the rooftop deck  Thanks for letting us stay there  And thanks so much for helping with the necklace   A quick note that there was some leaking downstairs from the tub  It was particularly concerning  because the tub was NOT overflowing   so I couldnt figure out what was going on  Im guessing maybe theres a crack in one of the pipes draining the tub   Anyway  as there was a crack in the ceiling  Im guessing it may have happened before  Something to look at   Thanks again   Eric
719785019,Nice place  Nice Location  Past reviews stated it gets cold  I inquired on that  they said I shouldnt have a problem AND  it was cold   lol  Heater works great  they dont do any winterizing and the bedrooms are frigid and the main room  close to the windows dont seem to stay warm  it wasnt terrible  but I definitely wore my winter hat a vest and a sweatshirt    Customer service was terrible  I got locked out of the building for an hour when when it was     out during a pandemic so I couldnt seek refuge anywhere  They never really responded and I resorted to emailing the rental department off of their website and finally got a response    In any event  I will NEVER rent from a COMPANY on Airbnb ONLY owners    The place was cute though  just be aware that ur on ur own if you rent from ZEN CITY  You need to review protocols on customer service as we move into winter during a pandemic  I got locked out of the building on check out  my fault  and my keys were in the car  Couldnt get any response and it was   degrees in the middle of pandemic  so I couldnt seek refuge anywhere  I ended up having to email their Rental Felt from their Website  no one EVER responded on Airbnb    only BOT responses like  PLEASE SEND REVIEWS     sy time booking an airbnb from a legit company  NEVER AGAIN  Ill only rent from owners who care about customer service 
719420415,perfect for a quick trip where you just need somewhere to lay your head   host is very friendly and helpful  thank you for hospitality  my stay was okay but I was very disappointed with the cleanliness of the apartment   the couch has many stains and crumps on it  the curtains were filthy and are in desperate need of a wash or new ones all together  the walls have stains and cracks everywhere  just because you plastered over a crack doesnt mean you shouldnt pain over it to match the rest of the wall  doing that made the apartment look old and unattractive  the whole apartment needs a deep cleaning and fresh paint  The couch in the living room had so many stains on it I didnt want to sit on it  when one of the cushions fell off there were crumps under the cushions  the curtain in both the living room and bedroom were dirty  you can they havent been cleaned in a long time  all the walls had cracks and dirt spots all over them  they could use a good wipe down  the place is very outdated and doesnt show how it really looks in person 
719203323,The communication was good but the place was unclean which raised a lot of concern especially during the current pandemic  After not being able to check in until      pm  throughout the rest of our stay we found things such as undergarments in the dryer and food left in the oven and microwave  I would suggest if you stay here to take pictures WITH time stamps of every single thing wrong  For the amount of money spent to stay there and the time wasted on getting the place cleaned and coming to some kind of reasonable resolution was not worth the money AT ALL  Will not be staying here again  I would suggest making sure the place is ready for the next guest so they wont go through the drama and filth I went through especially during COVID  For the amount of money spent to stay there and the time wasted on getting the place cleaned  obviously in a hurry since things were still left unclean  was not worth the money  Will not be staying here again  Could not check in in time due to room being unclean  Place was not cleaned by time my check in  Was ready by     pm 
714712529,This place is in a great location and the beds were comfy  Unfortunately  everything else was rather disappointing  Given that they charged a high cleaning fee  I expected it to be cleaner than it was  The shower curtain  for example had a layer of mildew at the bottom of it  last     inches   A shower curtain is pretty easy to clean and or replace  There were also hairs all over the beds and bathtub    The hallway of the building constantly smelled of smoke as another reviewer pointed out and at times we could smell the smoke coming into the apartment   One thing to note is that its an old Chicago apartment building so it does get cold unless the radiator is running and I was pretty cold a good portion of the time   a space heater would have been nice   What sent us over the edge though is that the wifi wasnt working and the property managers took half a day to get back to us when we first reached out  if this was being managed by an individual we might have been more forgiving but its a company managing this property so their response time  in my opinion should have been fast  Hosts at every other Airbnb Ive ever stayed at have responded within the hour whenever Ive reached out during a stay    Overall  I would say that if you are not going to spend much time here other than to sleep  if you dont mind paying an overpriced cleaning fee  and if you dont ever need to use wifi  this might be a good spot for you 
722418099,A cute cozy place right next to Forrest park  Very homey and so close to anything you may want to do in STL  Thank you for this cute little space  Loved it  Aside from the strong odor of cigarette upon arrival it really was a great place to stay  The kiosk was busted so I was sent to another location to get the key there was a little mix up as the cleabing ladybstill had the key but it was no ones fault  Everything was very clean for the most part  A few spots on the couch  But the biggest thing was a strong smell of cigarette smoke when we first got in the room  We opened the windows and it went away eventually  The cleaning lady also left the dust pile on the floor but that was an easy fix 
719425392,The place was great  once we got in  We were notified    minutes before check in that we would not be able to check in at  pm due to the cleaners running behind  we understood and asked for updates on when we could return    hours later we didnt hear anything and had to call them and they said it still wasnt ready  They did say they would add that time to the end of our stay but when I asked for clarification on what time check out was they said it was the original   am  I told them that we shouldve got an extension and they didnt respond until   and a half hours later saying we could check out at  pm  well it was       and we had already said forget it and checked out by   am because of the long response time   We had issues with the lock  couldnt get in to the apartment for about    minutes  we called multiple times and after waiting a little bit we got a response  the woman was friendly and helped us get into the room eventually but after a long day of exploring the city the last thing you want is to be locked out of the apartment you paid for  The comforters on the beds were still damp when we went to sleep but not soaking wet  Other than those things it was a very cute place to stay  perfect location and it worked for us  Thank you for hosting us  We loved the apartment aside from the check in issue and the problem we had with the lock  once those things get fixed for future stays I think itd be perfect We were not able to check in until   hours past our original check in time  We were not notified of the issue until    minutes before check in and we were not given very clear updates on when we would be able to get into the Airbnb  The comforters were damp wet still  Problems with the lock and having to wait for someone to call us back and help us figure out the issue  we eventually did get in but after a long day exploring the city the last thing you want to do is be locked out of the apartment you paid for 
719409919,Come for the gorgeous views  stay for the deep deep bathtub  In either arched window in the living room  you can see down the entirety of a street  Your apartment is on the corner of the building so light blasts through the windows each morning  It is difficult to get to  but once you get it  its no problem  There is a parking lot behind the building for     a night  and its close enough to walk groceries back and forth to  As far as the kitchen goes  there arent a whole lot of baking sheets to cook things on  so leave your frozen pizza at home  The cylindrical shower is cool  but can be VERY SLIPPERY  so be careful  The floor is not flat  its got an incline  The bathtub is where its at  being able to fit both me and my partner in comfortably  Overall  its very stylish but not very cozy besides the bedroom  Would be perfect for taking stylish pictures though  We tried to make a frozen pizza  but there were no cookie sheets or baking sheets to bake food on  Similarly  there is only one kind of knife  the serrated kind  to cut food with  More diverse kitchenware would have been helpful  since it is advertised as a full kitchen  the bathroom only has one rug for the shower and bathtub  I would place another so that you dont have to move it each time  There was no hand soap at the kitchen sink at all  We had to walk to the bathroom to wash our hands with hand soap  Lastly  I think it would make the place cozier  and more private  if every window had curtains  if there was simply more warmth as far as rugs or more furniture   Other than that  the views were amazing and the space was really unique 
717425042,Much better than I could have hoped  The place itself is older  I feel that this doesnt show in the photos but I dont mind  I liked the old city charm  The location is amazing  I felt safe and it was close to everything in the city  especially the zoo and the science center  two places we wanted to make sure we visited  The location and size for the price is amazing  The only two suggestions I have is please consider buying some type of coffee maker  It was one thing I missed as I have no idea how to use a coffee press and thought it was odd there wasnt a regular coffee maker  Also  please consider adding curtains  Two out of the   bedrooms face the street and the lights are bright at night and the sun was shining bright through early in the morning  The blinds are fine but dont keep much light out  Overall  we loved our stay  The beds were amazing memory form and the comforter and pillows made us feel like we were sleeping in cuddly clouds  You just cannot beat it for the price  Much better than I could have hoped  The place itself is older  I feel that this doesnt show in the photos but I dont mind  I liked the old city charm  The location is amazing  I felt safe and it was close to everything in the city  especially the zoo and the science center  two places we wanted to make sure we visited  The location and size for the price is amazing  The only two suggestions I have is please consider buying some type of coffee maker  It was one thing I missed as I have no idea how to use a coffee press and thought it was odd there wasnt a regular coffee maker  Also  please consider adding curtains  Two out of the   bedrooms face the street and the lights are bright at night and the sun was shining bright through early in the morning  The blinds are fine but dont keep much light out  Also  The television remote is really going out and we could not get it to turn off the tv when we left  Overall we really enjoyed our stay and wanted to say thank you 
715751880,The apartment has all amenities for a comfortable stay  The neighborhood is very downtown  therefore not the best area for exploring by foot  but central nonetheless  There were some minor things that needed attention in regards to cleaning  but the host was very communicative and Quick in responding  Check in had a few steps but following the instructions  was quite straightforward  Recommend for a stay where you need to be in the city Downtown with a fully functional place to stay  cooking  etc  Thank you for the good communication and quick responses  I appreciate the stay There were a couple of things that needed cleaning on the floors and rugs from previous tenants animal droppings  but the host was quick in responding and taking care of the matter A somewhat dangerous part of the city but very downtown and central
714761665,Communication with the host is AWFUL  If you try to call  youll only get an automated system asking you to leave a message  then youll never get a call back  If you message them  they are extremely slow to respond and not helpful  Dont bring anything valuable  they will have maintenance and who knows who else in and out of the apartment during your reservation without your permission or notifying you   I had a maintenance man show up in the middle of my stay to replace blinds  and he said he had been in earlier that day while I was out to lunch  I was never notified of his arrival nor did I give my permission   Great place as far as value   location  but I will never rent a place through  Zencity  again  Communication with the host is AWFUL  Dont bring anything valuable  they will have maintenance and who knows who else in and out of the apartment during your reservation without your permission or notifying you  Very poorly run business  Check in was to be anytime after  pm  I arrived at around      and there was someone inside the apartment and sounded to be playing video games  Thought this was hosted by a person  but its some sort of company  Tried to call and only got an automated message telling me to leave a message and theyd get back to me  soon   Never got a call back  Messages the host and they were extremely slow to respond  if at all   Also  in the middle of the day  a maintenance man arrived to replace blinds  I was NEVER notified that he would be there  not to mention that he said he had been there while I was out earlier in the day  also without my permission or being notified
