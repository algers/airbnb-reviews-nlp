The walls themselves were dirty and we noticed the second we walked in, but we didn’t pay much attention. When i walked into the bedroom the towels were dingy and hair hair in them. The shower curtain was yellow and orange, with hair in the shower as well. There were dirty handprints above the bed I was expected to sleep in. In The kitchen, the sponge was not replaced so I can only imagine how dirty the dishes were. In the unc leaned freezer, the ice tray was half full and look as if it was used as an ashtray or something.. the previous occupants left 3 uncased beer. And the microwave was BARELY in working condition. There was a fist print in the refrigerator and the A/C was not dusted. Immediately upon noticing all of these things, I contacted a Zencity rep through the Airbnb app and he had me send pictures and seemed as if he wanted to be helpful. It was going smooth until I was told that he “didn’t understand what was wrong from the pictures that I sent” so I called. While on hold on the FIRST call, I walked downstairs to speak with the lady that I checked in with, but she was no longer there there was a young man and he was very helpful he provided me a different number. One that I hadn’t called already. I got a little further this call, they told me they they would have a property manager call me. I ATTEMPTED to express my concerns with him.. frustrated? YES. frantic? YES because it was very hard to even get to speak with him. He immediately cut me off and said “ma’am, ma’am.. you need to calm down” and proceeded to tell me how he had complaints about me harassing and threatening door staff. (which NEVER happened. Even after everything was settled I spoke with the gentleman who only gave me a phone number and was MORE than compassionate and understanding) the Property manager that I spoke with, Gary, told me that security was notified of these false allegations and that they were going to come up and, AND I QUOTE, ‘DRAG’ me off the property. I’m not sure if that’s how they run their business but I want no parts and I don’t want anyone else to have to encounter this unprofessional business! 

Not to mention the time i was lied to; 

When speaking with the Zencity rep through the AirBNB app, he told me that the room was cleaned THE DAY that I checked in, (7/31/20) but the whiteboard posted had the date (7/29/20) on it... 

All in all AirBNB was extremely helpful in getting me my money back! he was friendly and responded to me in a very timely manner so that i wasn’t without somewhere to stay my first night in Chicago! He even gave me a voucher for my next stay. So i was satisfied in the end.",,null,,,,,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],null,261728273,Nakajah,Veal,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/15594803-f108-49a4-b1fc-f3cba9e52aa5.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,false,5f23448e9e684e51e18fe347

I was completely shocked because I use AirBNB more than the typical hotel & I've never experienced anything like this through AirBNB. For starters, check in was a little off. You had to go from one building to another just to retrieve the key. I was traveling with Uber & extra stops means more money paid. I'm sure they are able to install a similar lockbox with check in keys in the actual building where the guest will be staying. Also, this listing needs more cookware for the kitchen. Being vegan, I make my own meals & would have had to buy a set of knives & other utensils if I decided to cook. My biggest issue was dealing with the unprofesional employees that I had to communicate with during my stay. They made my stay extremely stressful. Their responses were very slow which caused me to almost be in really bad position(outside on the streets with no where to go). I had to threaten to leave a 1 star rating to get any assistance from a manager and the problems just continued even after I was gone.

My problems with this particular listing were with security (the smartlock did not have batteries in it when I arrived and therefore was useless). There were no batteries in the apartment, otherwise I would have just resolved the issue myself. So I messaged through the app, due to it being Thanksgiving night I figured that they wouldn't be able to come out that night to fix the lock (which I understood), there was a deadbolt and I was able to safely spend the night. I took my stuff with me to work the following day since I couldn't secure it in the apartment until after they fixed my lock that day, a minor inconvenience, not something that would ruin a trip. They came on Black Friday, put batteries in and I came back to a lock that was not responsive. I attempted several times to put in the code and it would not accept it. It even set off an alarm, causing it to lock me out for five minutes from the panel and then reset and accepted the passcode that I had put in the same way every time. I messaged them and let them know about the issue. I was able to get in and secure the lock, slept, woke up, went to work and was able to lock the door behind me with the keypad. Came back from work and it was a repeat of the night before. I checked out the next morning as planned and only then did they offer to talk to me about the problem with the keypad. 

Additionally, they were very upfront about the fact that the building itself was still under construction but assured me that the apartment was ready to go. This was kinda true. The lock was clearly not ready to go and additionally there was a wall mount for a television, but no television, and a lamp that sat on the kitchen counter but was meant to go somewhere else because it was not near an outlet and uplugged, just chilling. There was also a water bottle filled with used paint water from when they painted. Furthermore, there was a trashcan in the closet the night I checked in, but after they came to put batteries in the lock, the trashcan mysteriously disappeared. All of these things would have been minor inconveniences and not earned a poor review from me, I am a reasonable person. But as a cumulative experience it was not great. I am sure that once they are finished with the building, it will be a nice place to stay. The bed was comfortable, there were plenty of dishes and flatware to use and space to lounge. But it was not a finished product and should not have been listed as a place to stay until it was checked for completion.",I truly hope that you read and understand the comments that I submitted. I can tell that the furnishings are nice and that once the building is done this will be something that I am sure a lot of people will enjoy. I understood when I agreed to stay that the "common areas" were under construction but perhaps a quality check run should have been made to the apartment to ensure that the issues I mentioned were resolved. Particularly the lock. Best of luck in your future endeavors.,"""While they were upfront about the building being brand new and \""common areas\"" under construction they said that the room itself was \""ready to go.\"" A reasonable traveler would assume that the amenities listed and certainly the lock would be ready to go for someone to stay safely in their location. This was not the case. The smart lock did not even have batteries in it when I checked in - I messaged them to let them know that I was able to just walk in to the apartment and they were not able to come out (it was late on a holiday - I understood), but this should not even have been an issue to begin with. Additionally there was a lamp on the kitchen counter that was clearly meant to be placed somewhere but instead was placed on the counter not plugged in. Furthermore, the television was not in the apartment - there was the mount for it - but the television itself was not there. I understood the building itself was under construction when I agreed to stay - I did not realize however that the apartment was not truly ready.""","The directions to where this unit G8 was located were not very clear and I spent a good ten minutes walking back and forth across the downstairs to attempt to find the location of the apartment. When I got there I was pretty positive I had to be in the wrong location because the door was already opened and not locked at all. The lock would not work and upon further inspection did not even have batteries in it. There were no batteries for me to put in the lock - otherwise I would have just fixed this issue myself. I messaged to let them know that this was an issue. There was a deadbolt that I was able to use to securely lock myself in for the night. However, when I went to work the next day I had to pack everything back up because there was no way to lock the apartment when I left - even though I was staying for a longer visit. They came the next day and put batteries in the lock - when I got back from work the lock would not accept the very long code that they had set. I tried multiple times until a little alarm went off. Then after five  minutes of waiting it let me back in. I had messaged to say there was a problem but by the time they got back to me I was able to get the lockpad to finally accept the code that I had been punching in since the beginning. The next night I had the same issue when I was coming back from work with the keypad not accepting the code - blaring the alarm - then accepting the code, even though I had put in the exact same code each time. They didn't contact me until AFTER I was gone to talk to them about the experience that I had with the lock. Even though it was a multi-day issue.","When I arrived to the apartment there was a water bottle full of paint water in the sink. While I understand that the entire building is under construction this was disappointing. Furthermore, when someone came to inspect the lock and why it was not working (there were no batteries), they took away the trash can that had been in the apartment - so I had to place all trash in the tiny bathroom trash can.","I understand that my trip was over the holiday weekend, but as a nurse I cannot help that I have to work on the holidays or the day after and require a place to stay. A security issue like the lock not working should have elicited a little bit more of a response. Like I said previously I understand someone not coming out at 10PM on Thanksgiving night. But the future issues with the lock not working could have been looked into in a more timely fashion.",,,"Due to all of the issues with the listing - the lock not working, the unfinished nature of the apartment, the lack of timely communication about a security issue like the lock, I would say that it was not a great experience. This place had some very nice finishes where it was complete and it is obvious that this will be a nice place to stay once it is completely finished. But if the room wasn't ready (which it clearly was not as evidenced by the water bottle full of paint water in the sink, the random lamp on the counter, and the lack of a television and the lock not even having batteries in it) it should not have been advertised for a visit. Furthermore, when they came to install batteries in the lock - I was surprised to discover that they took the trashcan from the closet where it was stored. It was there the evening before and then randomly disappeared. I was happy I had taken my personal belongings with me in the morning. I am not a particularly picky person but all of this together was just a bit much. While it may be a nice place to stay in the future, it would take quite a bit to convince me to stay again when there are many other options in the area that have had seamless and pleasant experiences.",,[],[],[],[],[],[],null,291037291,Anaikia,Bridges,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/c7f38324-5d65-4a6b-9619-192c362e0f5f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,true,5ddc5b66a1d990570e01923b

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL! 
Misleading description of this accommodation!
This accommodation is above a pub and unbearable loud music is played till 1:00 am!
We tried to sleep as we had long business days ahead of us, but the music was so loud that the floor was vibrating from the speakers and was impossible to relax or sleep. 
It was clear for us; we cannot stay in this apartment and be fully functional for our next business day/s. Half an hour after we tried to go in the bed, around 11pm, we booked another hotel, and left the apartment with our entire luggage.
The other reasons we decided to leave this place was the cleanliness of the apartment - so unacceptable – the mid frame of the split window next to the oven was with a greasy black layer and full of black sponge pieces, looks like dead flies laying on it. I tried to sit on the coach before to go to the bed and watch TV, but it is an old piece of furniture, looks like collected from the street with unpleasant smell and broken springs. I could not sit more than 5 min before I felt the hurting pain on my bones from the broken springs.
The ventilation fan on the ceiling, greasy and dirty as well, additionally was generating loud noises like tractor, which I stopped with the hope that it will reduce the noise in the apartment. The 2nd bedroom door was with penetrated hole.
THE BREATHING AIR IN THE APARTMENT WAS HEAVY AND STALE!
I lost $715.00CAD thanks to the host’s misleading information and in spite of proving them wrong, the host refuse to reimburse me at all.
Here is the misleading description at the time of our booking that the hose word it like that:
 “ The home is just a short walk from the park and the lake and stone’s throw from number of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues”  
This  “stone’s throw” is not the same as above the bar in one wooden ceiling distance. A child can even throw a stone at least 20 yards!
Ironically at the time of our booking, the House rules #3 says: “Quiet time after 10pm”
Please read it twice before you get burned as we did with this booking and Zencity's management company.",,"Misleading description!\nIt says: \"...stone\u2019s throw from number of bars ....\" BUT does not say that is above a bar and loud music run till 1:00am.\nIronically a rule of house #3 is: \"Quiet time after 10pm\" when the floor is vibrating from the pub's music underneath.",,"Old and scratchy place.

Previous reviews mentioned noisy neighbors, which was the case, but that's not on the owner by any means. The neighbors were also smoking weed all through the night with the smell creeping into the bedroom. Again, that's not on the owner.

There was quite a bit of hair on the bathroom and kitchen floors which made it seem as if there was zero vacuuming before our arrival.

Bring a sleep mask. There's a bright light outside of the bedroom window and the window curtain is piece of paper thin and white as a ghost. Some blackout curtains need to be installed if you want a quality night of sleep.

The above issues aren't a huge deal at the end of the day. The big issue was when my girlfriend came back in the middle of the day and found phone chargers on the kitchen table which were not there when we arrived the previous night.

I’ll say the good things first: Zencity’s communication & customer service was great.  They got back to texts in about 30 minutes every time.  Also, this is (or at least could be) a beautiful apartment & location. It is right along the L train which is great for access to the city but does cause some noise and people waiting for the train can see right in the windows so there’s also it’s no privacy. (Shades that open from the bottom would be nice so you can still see the horizon but block commuters’ view.)

That said, there’s A LOT to improve at this location. It seems like it hasn’t really been up kept and really needs some love to make it better.  FOR EXAMPLE:
- there was mold growing visibly on the bathroom ceiling
-both bedside lamps were very broken and not very useable 
-half the light bulbs burnt out 
- there was hair on the floor upon arrival (very gross!)
- the throw rug under the bed was very grimy
-the garbage was broken
-not much privacy from L commuters 
-and the kitchen sink kept backing up.  

Honestly, I expected more from Zencity and was disappointed.  It ended being a good stay but could have been far better.  I hope things can be improved and to stay again if so. It is a beautiful location and I think Zencity has the potential to do better.","Hi - thanks for your quick replies.  Your communication was great.

It is questionably connected to a different apartment building on Hermitage, but NOT the one on the listing. The questionable address that it is supposedly connected to has a porta-potty in the front, with caution tape on the fence, and is in terrible shape.  

The photos do say that it is not exactly like the actual apartment because it is a new listing. Fine. But all the photos of windows show it is at an upper-level. Which is true if it were in the correct address. Instead, it is direct from the sideway into the doorway. These are the apartments that get broken into in this neighborhood because they're easy in-and-out. 

To add to the lack of safety, the door knob does not shut all the way. It was handmade drywall that didn't line up properly when they were trying to rehab the apartment. So the deadbolt works, but the door opens about an inch because the knob does not connect properly. 

It is connected to the remainder of the unfinished rehab apartments, which had THREE smoke detectors chirping. Unless the central air fan is on full blast it is every minute of that loud ""low battery"" chirp.  I went in and tried to turn one off, but it still would not stop.

They did not respond until I went to the building to see it was, in fact, a different address and wrote them to tell them the door does not close all the way.

Price gouging - We booked the space for six nights. Though the keypad was giving us issues every time we tried to enter the apartment (we once waited 30-45 minutes for Zencity to change the code since the keypad wasn't working), we wanted to extend our stay.  They refused to give us the new daily rate (which was about $20 cheaper for those same new dates that we wanted to extend into). They said that if we extended it we'd have to keep our same rate because they couldn't change it for us.  Annoyed and frustrated, we said fine because we didn't want to have to move and the place was nice enough.  After going back and forth, they finally sent a modification that actually added an additional day on top of what we requested.  We were flexible, so we didn't say anything because we were already pretty annoyed and wanted to not have a sour relationship with Zencity.

RODENT (I.E. MOUSE) and poor response - A little past the midway point of our stay, I saw a mouse in the kitchen go from under the oven to under the dishwasher, and later to the bathroom.  Now...my partner is TERRIFIED of mice. Terrified.  I immediately messaged Zencity, asked them during one call to send someone (they said they would), then asked them on a second call (three hours later) to send someone (they said they would).  About four hours after that (around 9-10 hours in total) they sent someone who said he just got word an hour before his arrival.  In the meantime, like any reasonable person, I had to find another Airbnb last minute, which ended up costing more than this location.  Despite the fact that we found large holes throughout the apartment (laundry room and bathroom) and the door doesn't have a door guard (so anything can slide right in.....), all of which we documented, we were only refunded half of the money we paid for the remaining days of our stay after Zencity ignored our messages and started only communicating with Airbnb.  

It really started out as a promising trip, but my partner is still reeling from the experience, I'm out of a few hundred bucks unexpectedly and I don't even know if I'll have a job in a month. I will NEVER rent a place managed by Zencity again.","The space was nice until I found a mouse.

Then I find a mouse....you wait over 10 hours to send someone (who told me when he got there that he had only gotten notice an hour before), and then you only give me half my money back for the remaining three days (which should've been an additional two days had you not extended my time).

Kitchen amenities are quite sparse though, so cooking isn't that easy.  Maybe they expect you to eat out a lot since you are travelling.

I was told, the check-in was in fact accessible through a door man, and was threatened if I show I won’t be able to enter and that my code to do was indeed revoked!

I was stranded, no place to sleep and slept in my rental car. I also had to find abandoned areas to use the restroom due to COVID and me not wanting to enter any stores or restaurants and infect other ppl.

This all could have been avoided had Airbnb either intervened or if the host would have canceled, seeing as I wasn’t allowed in the listing and also a health threat to everyone in the building. 

Also, I was allowed to still stay even though I was positive I was refused entry because I didn’t have any face coverings. I didn’t bother to “check-in” anyways for fear of my safety, or the police being called. With all that I experienced from having COVID, this wasn’t worth it!

There was an offer after receiving several automated messages in response to my email to have someone clean the problem areas and sweep the floors.  No one ever showed.

I explained the situation about not being able to get into the apartment, then he replied that we must not have been turning the key properly which is quite a jerk move to assume that adults are not able to place the key in the hole properly; and, it is very a ableist assumption. 

He then suggested that we go back downstairs ( which the listing does not say that you must go up three flights of stairs to access the apartment; also, not ADA compliant) to look for the back up key; alas, there was no back up key when we went back to the lockboxes.

As we, my friend and I, explained to Marty that there wasn’t any back up key in any of the lockbox that he suggested; he accusatorially asked if we were sure that there were no key in the lockbox (He was extremely frustrating to work with). 

He finally suggest that we go to the back of the building to access the apartment. We couldn’t figure out to get to the back of the apartment. So, while on the phone with Marty, we asked how to access the back of the apartment, in a very annoyed voice, he condescendingly told us that he’s trying to help us and we need to listen to him. 

He explained that we needed to go through the common area of the building through the alley to access the back of the building (this is an alarming safety issue) walk up six (6) flight of stairs and didn’t specify which back door to access; we tried the key for all of the four back doors and we were finally able to get in. 

Once, inside, I had asked Marty if we could get accommodated for another Airbnb that would be on another floor or another apartment, he stated “No.” Then, I inquired why and he explicated that’s they were fully booked, which was not true because we did not see anyone else in the building that we were in except for apartment 2A; he was able to accommodate us, but refused. 

He then asked us for video evidence of us not getting into the apartment, we felt that he was being callus because we explicitly explained that we could not get into the front door due to the lock being not sturdy. He made us feel as if we were liars and that we were exaggerating on getting into the front door of apartment 3A.

Once, we were inside from the back door, we could NOT exit from the front door (a major SAFETY ISSUE just in case of a fire or other issues that could be unforeseeable)! We highlighted to Marty that we could not exit the front door either. He then asked us again to send video proof of us not being able to exit the apartment, we took the video as well because we felt like he was accusing us of lying about not exiting the front door as well. 

It was extremely disheartening because we paid for the apartment in full and expected to have a great experience as well as good customer service without micro-aggression, condescending behavior, and callus communication from the customer service representative, Marty. 

Moreover, the toilet was broken, but due to our very hostile conversation with Marty, the representative of Zen City, we decided that we would tell onsite maintenance staff  (who were a supreme JOY) about the toilet not being functional. 

We were not compensated with a partial credit, we were not offered another place to accommodate us, nor did our initial concerns were rectified by Zen City.

1). I had to stood in freezing Chicago winter night for over half hour because the check-in instruction does not work. He did not want to give the backup option until all the efforts he told me to try failed, including to warm up the lock by rubbing, breathe and banging it. Imagining doing all these after a long flight in the a freezing night of winter Chicago.
2). Despite I told him that my phone with Airbnb app was going to battery out, please call me on the other phone. He stayed on Airbnb msg only. Luckily, my other phone just had data plan in. Otherwise, I might have to stand in the cold all night or arrange alternative. 
3). The interior room is not as clean as the picture. It is probably due to old units and poor house keeping. Some of the things on the wall, for example the intercom, is half falling. The hallway, stairway, and elevator are just unbearably dirty and scary. When I come back from work (I work late), I felt like in a horror movie. 
4). I regret booking with 2 weeks up front. He charges 50% of payment for all the rest night if I check out early, disregarding how many days ahead of the final check out date. 
5). On the last day, my meeting went longer because we need to surely wrap up some works. I missed the check out time by an hour and half. He charged additional fee right way when I arrived airport.

We didn't get a response so we waited in the car until the 3pm check in time. We went up to the unit (through a very dirty building and elevator), we arrived to the unit and followed the checkin instructions for the keypad. It didn't work. We tried multiple times and the door alarm started going off (because of too many failed attempts I'm assuming). I messaged zencity to see what was going on and we waited again. No response, so I called to see how we get in... while on hold we tried the door a couple more times and it finally allowed us in. We finally got a callback from a zencity representative 25 mins after my initial message about the entry issues. 

The first thing we noticed on entry is that there are no locks on the doors other than the keypad lock. There weren't even handle locks on the main or patio door. That didn't make us feel very safe. When zencity finally contacted me about the entry issues I asked them about the sofa bed (we were under the impression the sofa was a bed as well, as there were two of us traveling and a need for two sleeping accommodations). The rep said to remove the cushions from the couch and the area creates enough room for someone to sleep. I told him a small child could not even fit on the couch comfortably as it was maybe only 4 feet long. Then I was informed that the unit we booked was the smaller couch unit and wouldn't work. So that was disappointing.

Of course one thing piles on top of another at this point and we started noticing the cleanliness issues in the unit. We expected more cleaning practices since COVID19 has created higher cleaning standards. The floorboards had dust build up, which meant they hadn't been touched in some time. There were fingerprint smudges on the mirror and glass door to the patio. The bathroom sink had soap residue as if the the dispenser was recently used, the toilet had stains and residue on the outside of the toilet and the inside rim, and there was dirt buildup in the corners. The walkthrough closet between the main area and bathroom had a broken table chair (which means our table only had one chair) and several other items stacked up in the space. Upon our discovery of the cleanliness issues on top of the lack of locks and sofa bed issue, we decided the place was not fit for us to stay as health and safety standards were not appeasing. Upon speaking with the host (and escalating it to Airbnb for support because the host refused issues) about the issues, cancellation, and possible refunds because we even had picture evidence of our issues... the host only agreed to refund half of 1 night of a 3 night stay and Airbnb was able to get them to agree to refund the cleaning fee.

The building itself is 15 blocks from downtown, so it is not ""close"" to the touristy areas of the arch, Busch stadium, or the river and the neighborhoods between are not the best to walk, especially at night. We had asked prior to our arrival about dining places around the area as we are avid foodies and so we could get a better feel for the area, but there was never a response to that message. I'm assuming because the host is not actually onsite or possibly not even located in St Louis, they are an offsite property management company. If you do stay here, I'd recommend you drive or use a rideshare to get downtown safely as there were no dining options in the direct vicinity of the building. Which had we known prior to arriving (by means of getting a response about the dining options, which we never got) we would've cancelled well before arrival and zencity would've been required by their own cancellation policy to refund us more than $30 for 3 nights.

I hope this review will save EVERYONE from ever having to deal with what we endured on what was supposed to be a fun family getaway. I have NEVER taken the time to write a review, but this experience was so unbelievably awful, that I won’t waste the opportunity to help warn others about this terrible company. 

We purchased a unit that specifically  listed it had 3 queen beds to accommodate our family. Zen City posted a listing for a unit with exactly that in an area that was relatively close to the things we wanted to see and do in downtown St Louis, so we purchased the unit.

As soon as we get to the unit, we knew something was wrong. The first thing we noticed was that the place was absolutely filthy. Hair and dirt EVERYWHERE. So what does that hefty “cleaning fee” they charge go towards I wonder? Certainly not CLEANING THE UNIT.  So, right off the bat, that was disgusting. 

Next thing we noticed was that we didn’t have the 3 queen beds we were supposed to have. We got in late, but we contacted the host right away to tell them these things. They ended up trying to go into the listing and CHANGING THE LISTING, to the unit they had put us in! Luckily, we still had pictures of the original listing we purchased and our confirmation email showing everything we were supposed to have. 

This company repeatedly try to put the blame on us saying several times “Oh, I see how you could have been confused” and “Sorry, you must have overlooked and bought a different listing.” after we kept providing proof of what we originally purchased.

As you may have already guessed, this host refused make the situation right, hung up on us, and told us to go through AirBnB. So, we did! AirBnB immediately saw right through this deceitful company. They saw that they tried to update the listing AFTER we initially contacted them, as well as the lies they told through the messenger. We ended up receiving a FULL REFUND, and immediately got our belongings out of that nasty dump and went to a nearby hotel, where we were able to salvage the rest of our trip. 

Of course, this company will do anything other than accept responsibility and be accountable for their deceitful actions, so I’m sure we received a delusional review in response to this one (reminds me of a 12 year old child throwing a tantrum screaming “I know you are, but what am I?”). 

However, if this review can save ANYONE from having to deal with this God awful company, then taking the time to write this review will have been well worth it!

Let's start with the good: The location is awesome - Just a short uber or even walk from downtown, and there are bike rentals 2 mins away so I rented a bike and biked to the museums and around Chicago. There is also a great Thai place STEPS from the building.

Bed - The bed was quite comfy, like other reviewers say.

Price - Obviously this is a cheaper listing in the area, so that's nice.

Now for the bad....

First off, walking in to this airbnb is like walking into a pre-owned vehicle owned by a smoker... Maybe no one had recently smoked in there, but the whole place had a horrible smokey odor. Ironically there were TWO no smoking signs in the space... 

Second, there were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been cleaned for some time. Huge buildup of dust and dirt etc in the corners of the room, baseboards and cracks in the stove had food in them. These things made me question how well cleaned the rest of the space was.

Third, the tub / shower had very little water pressure and took a long time to get hot, and every time you shower the drain backs up after about 2 mins of running the water, so you have to stand with your feet in disgusting shower drain back flow while you try to clean yourself. 

Finally, the bedroom also had top sheet - Only a duvet. Since most of the time a duvet doesn't get washed every guest, this was an additional gross factor. 

Last, you should know that street cleaners and construction vehicles of various kinds might wake you up in the morning. This might be seasonal, but while I was there at about 7am every morning there was some kind of beeping construction or city vehicle that slowly drove by the building. Because the AC unit is in the window, it lets all the sound in. 

Oh and one more thing - Host says there is street parking in the listing. I attempted to park on the street and wound up with a $75 ticket. Clearly I missed a sign somewhere and so this is not the hosts fault, but I wouldn't stay here if you intend on having a car.",,null,,"There were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been cleaned for some time.

The unit itself was everything  the description gave. One issue I noticed was that it was not throughly cleaned, but overlooked it. With it being a basement/ground level pedestrians walking pass the unit can look directly inside when the blinds are opened. The mattress also felt old and sunken in, in the middle. The major issue came the last night at approx 9:45-10:00 pm when we returned from dinner. My girlfriend being pregnant had to use the restroom as soon as we entered. While using the restroom she seen a mouse run across the laundry room floor and into the bedroom. I didn't believe her until it ran from the bedroom into a closet. We immediately went outside, attempted to call the host several times, and leave voicemails. No response!!! I then emailed them, which they replied pretty quick. I advised them of the situation and that we need to stay somewhere else for the final night. They were able to get us into another unit 3 floors up. Before that we had to take all belongings into and down the hallway, checking to make sure other mice didn't get inside our things. We finally got upstairs and I did another walk through. I noticed this unit wasn't throughly cleaned either. The light switch for the kitchen and tv outlet were wired together. So the kitchen light had to be on to watch tv. The washing machine was also broken, with a full drum of  stale water inside. I contacted the host the next day about being compensated something for having to move out so late with a pregnant girlfriend for the rodent issue, then to get upstairs to a unit with broke appliances and partially cleaned and still haven't heard anything back. The cleaning woman actually came in the checkout morning promptly at 11 am to clean both units. I told her the situation and she seemed nonchalant as of this happened before.

AND READ THIS REVIEW

I don’t really know where to start with this review, I have never had a bad experience with any stay on AIR B&B till now.

 

First this place is filthy, I am talking dirty floors, dirty counters. Considering we are in an actual HEALTH PANDEMIC at the moment this is unacceptable. The “cleaners” and I say cleaners very loosely considering they did not actually clean. Tidied up…no trash yes, at first glance it looked clean. Until you touched the counters, felt the dirt under your feet, opened the fridge and get hit with an old rotten food smell. Or just look at anything for longer than a minute…. Stains everywhere (loved the big questionable stain on the master bedrooms carpet), sticky, overall, just absolutely disgusting. Not to mention the dirty BANDAID left in the master bedroom. I wish I would have brought with me cleaning supplies, but I did not expect to clean at a location with a 102-cleaning fee.

Onto the couch situation and the kitchen chair.

As soon as I step into the place, I noticed the couch. It was a bit lopsided thought this odd ...on closer inspection the couch was broken. The legs of the couch were not installed properly or installed by someone who has never put together basic furniture one even with a crack. I immediately reached out to the renters regarding both the cleanliness the couch & chair…

Received no aid in the matter just a “we know” … also they knew the kitchen chair is broken as well

I expressed my need for actually working furniture since this is a basic necessity and I mean BASIC. I even asked for tools to fix it myself. No reply. Go figure. I actually had to flip the couch myself and attempt to jimmy rig it with a knife… I actually did better then the person who put this together I’ll tell you that much.

I didn’t try to fix their kitchen chair…. Maybe I should of since they clearly don’t care…

Lastly, we have the patio…. You see that nice patio offered in the listing hell it’s even in the name... well guess what you can’t access it. The door does not open to that area. So, you can waive at it from the couch…. If you want to do some handywork first…

Honorable mention: The lack of a clean sponge or dish soap in the kitchen. I did find a dirty sponge that had actual dirt on it and dishwasher gel (guess this is better than nothing) loved the empty hand soap dispenser it really added to the ambiance of the stay

I also have pictures of all of this.

Followed by pictures of how I left the stay just as my own insurance.

Apartment was in a great location in Hyde Park. I was visiting UChicago and it was an easy walk to campus, with several restaurants, cafes, and a drug store also nearby. Accessing the apartment was easy, with clear instructions and a lockbox in place. Zencity was prompt and helpful with communication throughout the process, and was quick to answer any questions or concerns I might have. The apartment was well-stocked with amenities, including an iron, a steamer, a lint roller, extra towels, etc. It is well-sized for one or two individuals with a small gas-stove, a full-sized refrigerator, and a small breakfast nook. I enjoyed the low-key decorating style. 

The Bad: 
Water pressure in the bathroom wasn’t great—I usually ended up washing my hands in the bathtub because the waterflow in the sink was frustratingly slow. There was some hair around the bathtub and toilet, which didn’t bother me, but I can imagine other future guests may be particular about that. As other reviewers have noted, the lighting in the main room is unusual—the kitchen lights need to be on to use the outlets on the far side of the apartment, which is where the television is located. This wasn’t a problem for me, but again, I can imagine other guests wanting to be able to watch television without the lights on or wanting to watch TV right before they go to sleep. 

The Ugly: 
My phone charger and headphones inexplicably went missing on my second day here.

The room came stocked with a phone charger, and a charitable explanation would be that someone came in while I was gone to retrieve that charger and accidentally mistook my charger for that one. It is also POSSIBLE that I may have put my headphones in my pocket and subsequently lost them outside of the apartment. I think this is the most likely explanation for how both items ended up missing.

A less charitable explanation would be that someone deliberately took two items that were placed right inside the door of my room.   

I spoke with the Zencity management about this, and they assured me that no one on their crew came into my room while I was staying there. And I can understand how ridiculous this sounds from their perspective: if someone told me that his phone charger went missing, I would assume he had misplaced it and it was somewhere in his bag, or he’d left it in the bathroom, or left it at Starbucks or something. But I am clinically OCD about my stuff. I rarely misplace things, let alone lose them, and I spent several hours scouring the apartment, unpacking my luggage over and over again, and even sorting through the trash can multiple times in an effort to find these items. I am quite confident that I do not have these items, and I am genuinely perplexed as to how they went missing. It seems unlikely that anyone on a cleaning crew or a landlord with an extra key would take the time to come into my room and take these two small things. But any other possible explanations I can think of—a burglary with no signs of forced entry? A previously-unknown occasion of sleepwalking where I took these items outside the apartment?—seem even more far-fetched.

I don’t mean to be throwing around reckless accusations. I chose this apartment because it was well-reviewed, and it sounds like most guests have had a really positive time staying here. But this was my experience. I left feeling uncomfortable and unnerved that someone had gone through my stuff. This is the first time when using Airbnb in which I feel like my trust has been violated, and while I don’t think it was prompted by any personal animus—again, I think the most likely explanation is that someone came into my room and took my phone charger by mistake—I would not stay here again.",,null,,"Some hair in the shower, and around the toilet base.",,,,,,[],[],[],[],[],[],null,110086967,Jeff,Cornelius,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/6d01f15e-73bd-48c2-a3c2-fc830f0418a2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,true,

Easily the dirtiest Airbnb I’ve had to stay in. If I were at a hotel I would have requested a new room.

The sheets, extra sheets, bed spread, floors, walls, along the toilet, and bathroom floors all had hair. There were stains on bed spread. 

To make matters even better the door didn’t lock unless you pushed it from the outside. We felt very unsafe so we slept with a bar stool in front of the door. Only thing that would have done is heard if someone came in.

We stayed in one of their other places a few days prior and it was one of the nicest Airbnb’s I have stayed in so I hope they make this right.",Disgusting place would love a refund or I will be sending pictures and videos of the place to Airbnb.

In the unit that I stayed in, the window broke, and would not latch and stay closed. Thus, in temperature that dropped to 12 degrees, I was expected to sleep in said room.

Seeing that I don't smoke and it was freezing outside, I had no reason even to think about the window, yet alone opening the window.

When I complained more, I was told to turn the heat up, in the midst of 12 degree weather coming in. To make matters worse, the radiator worked when it wanted to, barely emitting any heat.

My 2 stars are for the view from the bedroom and the convenient location. Read this review until the end because any travelers looking to stay at any of the Zencity locations should beware of the stunts they tried to pull. 

The Space
This apartment looks a lot better in pictures than it does in person. Definitely in need of some updates and TLC. Paint on the bedroom walls is cracked and chipping. The hosts provide you with the bare minimum but honestly, there is nothing else special about this place. 

Checking in
Checking in was quick and easy. Front desk staff was kind and friendly.

Now, I’ll speak on my experience. I knew I’d be landing in Chicago over an hour before check in and when I asked the hosts if I’d be able to actually check in early, I was denied which wasn’t terrible but it may have saved me  a huge headache later. I finally arrived to the Airbnb at 3:06 on the dot to find that the apartment was dirty, as if someone checked out and no one came to clean after.  Bed was not made, leftover food was in the refrigerator, living room rug and the kitchen were dirty. I’m sure everyone has heard that COVID is still a thing, so walking into a dirty Airbnb during these times is the last thing you’d ever expect, right? When I messaged the hosts WITH pictures, the response I got from Stuart was “Sorry about that! It seems there might have been some miscommunication over another tenant in the building using the space or not last night. I’m checking now to see if we can get a cleaner there right away!”   Ok, so does that mean that someone else may have access to this apartment without your knowledge? Not a very settling feeling for a solo, female traveler. ( I did book this saying there were 2 guests for my own safety, and I’m glad I did because who knows what else could’ve happened ). It was now too late and a cleaner was not around so I had the option to go to their other Airbnb which luckily was only a 4 minute walk around the corner for the night and then go back to the location that i actually paid for the next day.  I was desperate and had no other options for a place to stay and agreed after going back and forth with the hosts and customer support about how much I’d be refunded for my inconvenience. Zencity didn’t want to refund me the cleaning fee for their dirty apartment but thankfully Airbnb customer support said yes along with only 50% for the first night. 
The new apartment was fine but upon reading reviews for it I found that a female solo traveler stated that a male cleaner came into the apartment while she was there, without warning and she was very uncomfortable. When I pointed this out to Zencity i was assured by Marty that the cleaners have already been notified that I’d be checking out late so it wouldn’t be a problem. Guess who knocked on the door at 11:00 a.m. on the dot the next morning...the cleaners. More miscommunication I’m guessing. They left once i explained the situation and an hour later i walked back to my original Airbnb and it was clean! Like the way it should’ve been when I first checked in.
I was not very comfortable during my stay just knowing that someone else had access to the apartment. I was nervous whenever i left out thinking someone would come in and take or go through my things. I was nervous when i went to bed at night knowing that I was alone, but there were no other problems.
Now here’s the good part. Zencity had the AUDACITY to accuse me, a non smoker, of smoking marijuana in their apartment and had the nerve to request $300 from me because of it. This is the lowest, most desperate and manipulative thing I’ve ever heard of an Airbnb host doing. Maybe they’re mad that they lost money because of their own mistakes and miscommunications. That’s not my problem.

The first thing you’ll encounter is that the check in instructions to get in aren’t accurate. You’ll have to wait for someone to eventually leave for them to open the door to the hallway you need to get in to access the elevator. Once you overcome that hurdle, you’ll be let down when you walk into your room. The unit has a prominent smell of cigarette smoke. This is strictly a non smoking until so if you have health reasons or just want a smoke free room for comfort this place is probably not for you. If you are a smoker, you won’t be the first to smoke here and will probably get away with it by the look at the response that I got when bringing up this issue. The rug had bread crumbs/trash on it. The floors felt like there was a layer of grime on them. The comforter had a yellow stain on it. Speaking of stains, the bedroom and bathroom walls have stains that appear to be from bodily fluids. The shower floor was stained where one would typically stand while showering. Had to get one my hands and knees to scrub the shower floor so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out. Horrible water pressure in the shower by the way. The thermostat was locked so I couldn’t make it colder than 75 degrees. After I contacted the host about this issue it took them two days to lower it to 72 degrees. By then I had figure out a way to make it cooler, just gotta be a little creative. Another annoying thing was that the light switch for the kitchen also controlled the outlet where the tv was connected to. So you could only watch tv with a huge glare on it. Another workout was found for this issue. Got one of the two extension cords behind the couch and connected it the outlet in the room and ran it under the door. Unplug the tv from the outlet and take the cord out of the plastic cable hider to have enough slack to connect it to the extension cord. Another inconvenience was that the key fob they provided at first didn’t allow access to the parking lot or the roof. After the second day they did provide a secondary key that worked for everything but they didn’t request permission when dropping it off and just helped themselves in. Even though we weren’t in the room at the time, it’s common courtesy to ask when entering the until like other hosts and handy men have. It felt like a violation of our privacy and made us feel uneasy. Other than that the location was good and the aesthetics of the renovations were nice.","Please get rid of that awful smoke smell and do a deep cleaning. Update the check in instructions as well as the first key fob that was given since it doesn’t give access to the parking lot or the rooftop. Change the stained comforter and clean/repaint the stains on the walls. Give better access to the thermostat, 75 degrees is horrible to sleep in.","The description states that this is a non smoking unit but the place reeked of cigarette smoke.","The instructions to get into the building were accurate but to get into the actual unit, were not. No way to get into the hallway without a key fob following the instructions provided by the host. Took 37 minutes for someone to be coming out for us the get in. Then the key fob did not open the gate to the parking lot nor to the rooftop. A second key fob was provided after the second day, which raised another concern. Someone when into the unit without authorization.

The shower floor was brown in the area where one would stand to shower. I had to get on my hands and knees and try to scrub out as much as I could so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out. The white comforter had a yellow stain on it. The walls in the bedroom and bathroom had stains that appeared to be bodily fluids when using a black light.

Those may sound like good things, and for some people maybe they are, but the result for me was that every morning I woke up drenched in sweat and with severe back pain.

I would recommend immediately purchasing a firmer mattress and a more breathable comforter. I've stayed in many hotels and Airbnbs, and this is the worst sleeping experience I can remember.

The shower barely drained. I complained the very first night of a week-long stay, they said they'd ""filed a maintenance request"", and I never heard another word about it.

The only piece of info to indicate this is a photo of the balcony which seems to be more than a story up, but it’s in fact just a couple feet off the ground. As we are not very familiar with this city we would rather have been above the first floor, so this indication would be important for future guests.

Within 30 minutes of arriving we heard noise on the room adjacent and one above us. I gave it some time, but then contacted Chris when nothing changed. He responded that he has never had problems with noise, and was regretful that we are experiencing it. Peace and quiet are extremely important to me, and I did not find that here. I understand that in the city you’ll hear people outside/police cars, but there was little of that here. Constant banging from above and beside us. We could actually listen to conversations from people in both of these apartments. I’ve honestly never been to an Air BnB, or even hotel rather, that has been this loud.

Aside from those issues the apartment was very clean. All the appliances were working except for the water and ice dispenser on the fridge which isn’t a huge deal. Plenty of hot water, and good water pressure from the shower. A small addition that l enjoyed was the automatic soap dispensers in the bathroom and kitchen!

I have hosted many guests here and have not had an odor issue before. If that is acceptable to you, I will have Airbnb cancel the remaining portion of your stay and issue the refund."" I found this odd because reviews should be honest. And I responded that I would leave an honest review. I previously emailed Chris that the key to the unit wasn't working properly to unlock the deadbolt. And guess what? I ended up getting locked out of the unit right before I checked out. In desperation, I emailed him repeatedly and asked for a number to his staff or maintenance. He would not provide any phone number and his response was to jimmy the lock. Chris did not offer any support beyond jimmying and playing with the lock. After finally finding a phone number to the building manager, two maintenance staff drilled and removed the lock from the door. Luckily, this happened during the daytime. What if this happened at night? I might've been stranded. Chris never emailed to see if I got in.

If you have any travel issue, I.e. cannot access the building, they don’t have a number to contact anyone to get it resolved immediately. 

I had reserved this particular location with two teenage girls because of a concert that was going on. 

Check in is only after 3p and the event was open at 12p, so we only were able to get to the Airbnb by after midnight.

It’s clear Chris has no concern for safety, has no sympathy, or even cares for what happened. I won’t be staying at an Airbnb ever again.

 Chris should have courtesy towards his clients. 

It’s simple business practice to take responsibility for a bad procedure, and in return, do something to make up for it.

First off, upon arriving I was told per my itinerary that the keys to the apartment would be with the doorman at the entrance to the building.

I was also told not to mention anything about Airbnb and instead say that I am staying in a corporate rental? Not sure why the secrecy is necessary but if there is some type of stipulation with the apartment building that bans Airbnb hosts from renting units out you probably shouldn’t put your paying customers in the middle of that don’t you think? Anyway, He ended up calling a maintenance worker to let us into the apartment after he verified my identification. Upon being let into the apartment at 3:07 pm (Airbnb host was not flexible whatsoever about check in time even though he knew it would result in us being basically stranded with nowhere to put our luggage for several hours) the room was occupied with several people whom I’m assuming were cleaning the apartment although there was quite the language barrier between us. They informed us the Airbnb ( that I already paid hundreds of dollars for for LESS THAN a 48 hour stay) was NOT ready for us yet and to come back later...mind you our check in itinerary told us 3pm and it was well passed 3pm by this point. So we had to leave our luggage (which my fiancé didn’t know at the time contained an extremely expensive engagement ring) with 2 complete strangers in an apartment that we still did NOT have keys to for another hour. Which as you can imagine was not a comfortable or secure feeling. When we finally returned the cleaning lady was STILL there and I basically had to ask her to leave. We both have been traveling since 5 am that morning and were exhausted and had dinner reservations( that we ended up missing because we couldn’t get ready in time due to our late check in) to get ready for.

Over a run down cleaners.,,Property is owned by zencity and they really dropped the ball on this one. I would advise against staying at any of their properties. A refund in my option was fair since I left the property and never returned. Their communication was slow and poor customer service. Airbnb was no help. They have no standards for customer service in these instances so don't waste your time and money with this pair.,,[],[],[],[],[],[],null,65826978,Eric,Harold,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/b1683e51-e053-4fc5-a33a-551b34c24284.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,true,5e488c26822f30718fbc11ef

After a 9-hour flight with a toddler, this was the last think we expected: Zencity simply forgot to clean the place. When we called, no apology was given and we had to grab sheets from another unit and do laundry of some of the existing sheets. Nobody came for an exceptional cleaning (the cleaner came the next day for a mediocre cleaning job) and we had to shower in dirty bathrooms (hairs on the floors, in bathtubs and toilets). Quite unfortunate as the place is nicely located with a great view. Also, no reply was received regarding our request on reimbursement of the cleaning aand service fees. As a result, I do not recommend Zencity’s services.",Unfortunately we cannot say we enjoyed our stay and will not be able to recommend your services to friends.,"In the kitchen many utensils were missing and not enough for 4 adults.",Nobody available to come and clean on the evening of our arrival.,Upon arrival we quickly notices the whole place had not been cleaned.,Partial apologies or reimbursement of cleaning fees.,,,Being sensitive to our reimbursement request on the cleaning fee and service fee.,,[],[],[],[],[],[],null,3594090,Vanessa,Almengor,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/747a5dd2-dbf6-48a0-ae9d-9e182a6aac1f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,true,5e3c293b1c78a5a3d828c776
