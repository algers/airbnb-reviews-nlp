453554269058855194,Couldnt get into the building for up to     minutes because they didnt think to send me it ahead of time and their costumer service didnt seem to know the code either  This was after a long drive pushing  am and a struggle to get a later check out with this company which ended with us purchasing an extra day  The purchase was fine  money talks  but you would think a business that seemingly had a tight schedule would be in order  Well just getting into the building was the beginning of my woes  Come to my room and open the door    its a mess  Dirty and lived in is the vibe this air bnb must live by as a company motto  Mind you  our check in is scheduled to be no earlier than around   ish the previous day  So they didnt even try to clean it with the extra   hrs we were driving to St Louis they had  The most they could offer me was to sleep in the filth and theyll have it clean the following day  They showed their benevolence by granting us an extra hour to stay in their bnb before leaving  At this point Im fuming and ask for a refund  didnt even stay  we just went to a best Western two towns over  Refund hasnt been pushed yet and its been   days since exposed to this joke  management must feed off the bad reviews Im sure youre aware of the quality I was exposed to  Including how long its taking you to issue a refund and its just an overall bitter experience 
449995501773233746,When we arrived to check in the door was propped open and the lock for the door has been installed backwards  with the keypad on the inside and deadbolt on the outside   I immediately contacted Zencity and they said they would escalate to their manager and report back  They did not report back and I had to call back to check on someone coming to fix it  They said no one could come that day  Our options were to relocate to another Airbnb for one night and then move back after the lock was fixed  It was not possible for us to move and then move back based on the plans we had made for our visit so we had to prop a table against the door that night since there was no lock   Zencity did not come correct the lock until the next day at  pm after I had to follow up with a call and messages  After that we had two service men visit to remove air conditioning units without warning or our permission   The health and safety concerns and lack of responsiveness from Zencity was unacceptable    The Airbnb was only partially clean  The only positive note I can share is on the location  The location was great   walkable to the arch and Cardinals game   We will never stay at an Airbnb hosted by Zencity again 
449200908082774156,Very disappointed in my stay with zen city  I ve stayed with zen city before   I also used to live in the building so I was anticipating a similar experience  However that was not the case at the start of our stay  You d think that using digital locks is a good idea  when it works  But when it doesn t work  it can be a catastrophe  The reliance on technology without a clear contingency is not a smart way of doing business    It was   am and we had arrived at the apartment only to find that the digital lock had malfunctioned  inhibiting us from using the code to enter  We called customer service and they attempted to help us get in using new codes and digital codes but to no avail  I appreciate all the help Oshane provided however this was unacceptable  We were informed that there was no other way into the apartment and that there were no keys to enter the apartment  We were told that we had to travel to a different building  Mind you it was   am  As we were leaving  we were stopped by the front desk who ultimately found a way for us to enter    The next morning we were unable to leave our apartment without a way to re enter due to the broken digital lock  The locks were eventually fixed hours later    The apartment was ok  There was construction every morning and from time to time the bathroom sink would gargle and backup with old water  smelled unpleasant   A few stains on the couch  Furthermore the internet that services the apartment was not equipped to handle working from home     I requested compensation from management but my calls have done unheard  This is most frustrating as our experience getting their affected our trip thereafter and we ve been ignored by management  I demand compensation  Very disappointed in my stay with zen city  I ve stayed with zen city before   I also used to live in the building so I was anticipating a similar experience  However that was not the case at the start of our stay  You d think that using digital locks is a good idea  when it works  But when it doesn t work  it can be a catastrophe  The reliance on technology without a clear contingency is not a smart way of doing business    It was   am and we had arrived at the apartment only to find that the digital lock had malfunctioned  inhibiting us from using the code to enter  We called customer service and they attempted to help us get in using new codes and digital codes but to no avail  I appreciate all the help Oshane provided however this was unacceptable  We were informed that there was no other way into the apartment and that there were no keys to enter the apartment  We were told that we had to travel to a different building  Mind you it was   am  As we were leaving  we were stopped by the front desk who ultimately found a way for us to enter    The next morning we were unable to leave our apartment without a way to re enter due to the broken digital lock  The locks were eventually fixed hours later    The apartment was ok  There was construction every morning and from time to time the bathroom sink would gargle and backup with old water  smelled unpleasant   A few stains on the couch  Furthermore the internet that services the apartment was not equipped to handle working from home     I requested compensation from management but my calls have done unheard  This is most frustrating as our experience getting their affected our trip thereafter and we ve been ignored by management  I demand compensation 
431808837862449605,Very unprofessional and in person know when the situation arises and they think by switching you to another room that they rectify the issue but they don t and their system is very automated so you only get to talk to him and if you press the right selections when you call the host number  Stay with a private house do not use in city they are running more like a business than a personable ran Airbnb The fact that I was not reached prior to me arriving to the unit even though you say you tried she still mean something in regards to me being compensated for the inconvenience and poor communication by the same city staff the reps on the phone we re very nice but it seems like they were not given the correct information to even let me check in timely and the new unit that they try to move me to and I asked for compensation by a partial refund and didn t get it the second unit that they move me to was a smoking unit so it smelled like smoke and it was much smaller the bathroom was very small and didn t have much room for me to move around and I m definitely not pleased I will not be using Sin City again unless they resolve this issue they try to say that they would not give me a refund and I do not think that is fair because I waited almost an hour before I could get in the new new room The fact that I was not reached prior to me arriving to the unit even though you say you tried she still mean something in regards to me being compensated for the inconvenience and poor communication by the same city staff the reps on the phone we re very nice but it seems like they were not given the correct information to even let me check in timely and the new unit that they try to move me to and I asked for compensation by a partial refund and didn t get it the second unit that they move me to was a smoking unit so it smelled like smoke and it was much smaller the bathroom was very small and didn t have much room for me to move around and I m definitely not pleased I will not be using Zen City again unless they resolve this issue they try to say that they would not give me a refund and I do not think that is fair because I waited almost an hour before I could get in the new new room Due to the rep not knowing the access codes and giving me the wrong access code which lock the door
427448767978231621,Everything was nice   Just like the pictures    The only negative things we found was the apartment smelled like smoke     really the whole building did   We found ashes on top of the fridge   Lastly  there was a book on the table in the living room and it had nude pictures in it   which I felt was disgusting if someone was staying there with children   Overall it was a decent place to stay   Beds were amazing and it was great pricing for the stay  Everything was real nice   The only negative that I found was that the building smelled like smoke especially inside the apartment that we had  We actually found ashes on top of the fridge   lastly  there was a book on the table in the living room that had nude pictures in it that I found inappropriate if children had been staying there   Other than that  everything els was nice  
426039602752521685,We were very dissatisfied with our unit  We had to call to get a code for the outer door  The apartment was unlocked  The trash cans had not been emptied  A water bottle and trash was on a windowsill  The trash cans had not been emptied  Dirty towels were left in the laundry hamper  There were no hand towels and wash clothes or towels for the kitchen  There was no coffee or filters  I called the hostess and she seemed rather uncaring  She offered a one bedroom unit for the three of us  That obviously would not work  She wanted pictures so I sent them  We clean the washer which smelled horrible because it stays closed all the time   The lint filter in the dryer was stuffed  We stayed up till midnight washing linens so we could sleep  The sheets on one bed were on sideways  The next day someone changed all the sheets and left clean linens for the bath and kitchen  They emptied the trash but did not sweep  Hair is in every corner  It was advertised as three bedroom and two baths  The shower in one bath did not work   I cannot believe this unit can be charged for  I will never rent from Zencity again  
421730432257979730,This place was not kept up and kind of dirty  The pictures made it look much better than it actually was  There were things hanging off screws in the walls  dirt coming out of the bathroom vent  a red and brown stained tub and shower curtain  black marks all over the walls  the place just didnt feel kept up  It definitely seems like a place that a corporation owns and no individual actually sees it  Some more upkeep of the property would be beneficial  It just didnt feel like it was in good shape    and it felt very dirty 
416588299992540836,No free parking        great location The bathtub backs up and needs to be snaked or plunged  filter in AC needs changed  When you advertise     night and it ends up being       thats very misleading  And the parking situation needs to be said Up Front  not after Ive already paid for it  because that added more  
410795323784027518,We had to call literally    times but we finally got a hold of someone on the   th try  the original passcode given was wrong and we were giving so many wrong pass codes after before getting a correct one which kind of made us hesitant to leave afraid we would get locked out and not be able to get a hold of someone  Outside of the actual room we stayed in the building smells horrible  like urine 
405060395372112854,Trust these reviews  Just dont book here  The unit was FILTHY  Hair on the bathroom walls  Toilette had a dirty ring  Dirty rags in the bathroom  Rug was FILTHY  Wall were filthy  Obvious ceiling leakage in the kitchen  The unit you see here is NOT the unit you get  The only plus is the location  Yall are dead wrong that place is filthy and those pictures are not of that unit 
402892969172254325,Not sure exactly what level of quality is expected in this market however where I m from this would be a   on a scale of     On the second day of stay some type of construction work opened up with a miniature jackhammer lasted for about an hour had to leave the room for a period of time  I Couldn t even hear myself think   Tiles in the bathroom dont have any grout   Water in the sink in the bathroom has virtually zero pressure and scarcely adjusts from scalding hot   Gnats       am  Tuesday  let the fights begin on and off in the hallway for the next couple hours  I was genuinely  concerned  for my personal safety   This was my first experience with Airbnb and maybe my last   The elevators  one working one not  the one that works defaults to the penthouse  so if you re in the basement you have to watch it go round trip before it comes and get you in about five minutes   The only saving grace for this location is that there is a Straub s Fine Grocers within walking distance you can skip the Whole Foods and the Starbucks there s a bunch of weird people over there   The carpet in the living was very dirty  I rolled it up for the stay and unrolled when I left   The couch was pretty dirty so I covered it with a comforter  Not sure exactly what level of quality is expected in this market however where I m from this would be a   on a scale of     On the second day of stay some type of construction work opened up with a miniature jackhammer lasted for about an hour had to leave the room for a period of time  I Couldn t even hear myself think   Tiles in the bathroom dont have any grout   Water in the sink in the bathroom has virtually zero pressure and scarcely adjusts from scalding hot   Gnats       am  Tuesday  let the fights begin on and off in the hallway for the next couple hours  I was genuinely  concerned  for my personal safety   This was my first experience with Airbnb and maybe my last   The elevators  one working one not  the one that works defaults to the penthouse  so if you re in the basement you have to watch it go round trip before it comes and get you in about five minutes   The only saving grace for this location is that there is a Straub s Fine Grocers within walking distance you can skip the Whole Foods and the Starbucks there s a bunch of weird people over there   The carpet in the living was very dirty  I rolled it up for the stay and unrolled when I left   The couch was pretty dirty so I covered it with a comforter 
401348577714519732,My bf and I booked this during our drive to St  Louis  roadtripped east to west   nd stop  so excited to stay based on location and since it was labeled super host  When we arrived it was around       and the check in app didn t work door man had to give us a key  When we got up there it was absolutely gross  Stuff on the bed and floors  black hairs   Had taken pics and sent to zen city in which they only would refund me     of the clean fee which was literally only       I messaged regarding my concern again hence we didn t even stay there that night  And no response not even the small refund  Moral of the story I had to reach out to Airbnb directly  Poor communication I appreciate the efforts however your communication was awful and required me to go through air bnb directly  Very disappointed with what you considered clean and a fair refund 
397084702670784592,I had a terrible experience    Problems      The  smart  lock on the door was unable to lock itself  This left us with no way to lock the door from the outside  ZenCity had no solutions for this  no interest in helping us  and after an unbelievably Kafkaesque conversation with ZenCity we gave up  We had to take everything with us in our car the when we weren t in the apartment and just leave the apartment sitting unlocked the entire day       The washer was broken  In the midst of our   hour attempt to get ZenCity to do ANYTHING about the lock  we decided to wash some clothes  The washer filled with water and then promptly stopped  The dryer wouldn t turn on either  Now  we are sitting in an apartment we cannot lock with a washer full of soaked  dirty clothes  It was around this time that ZenCity stopped responding entirely  We had to wring our clothes out in the sink and go to the laundromat at the crack of dawn the next day    The short of it  the apartment is fine if everything works  But if it doesn t  no one will help you  And you will drive yourself crazy trying to get even a response from ZenCity  And after hours of sending messages  ruined clothes scattered around you  you will get a two sentence response like     Sorry to hear you are having trouble  Just know that this is not the usual experience of ZenCity guests    Well good for those other guests  Maybe they can come over and help me wring my dirty clothes into the sink 
394161655659142143,The elevators in the building can be expected not to work  The entire building is old and unmanaged  The trash by all other residents gets piled up by the only exterior door that works and you have to walk over it to get in the building  There is no parking that is offered by the tenant  The room is hot  one ac unit is not enough  It is close to everything in the central west end  but at the price point  I would have spent a significant amount more to have something nicer or I wouldve been happier in a hotel  I would highly suggest a better clean method  The amount of dirt and dust was outrageous  If you arent going to add an AC unit  I would suggest mentioning that the room can get quite hot  If its going to be the bare apartment that it is  at least have a luxury item so people have some things to overlook  Coffee  coffee pot  some decently comfortable seating  ect 
392749197746024366,Ive been using airbnb for years and this the worst experience Ive had this far   Zencity was absolutely awful at communication   The wifi didnt work and when I asked about it I got multiple different wifi networks with a different passwords every time they responded  none of them worked   I was never able to connect to wifi and missed out on work and money due to this   When I notified them of this and the fact I was filing a complaint they stopped responding completely until they gave me checkout directions   The place smelled like rotten eggs  there was throw up on the wall in the kitchen  and there werent any towels left to shower with   I had to go purchase towels to shower   Awful experience  do not stay here 
560144868992035380,he will charge your account for EVERYTHING   still havekey fob becauseIm too uncomfortable to return it    HATED IT   
767272683,We were extremely disappointed by the apartment   It was very dirty and in a substandard condition   The amount of dust and dirt indicated that the apartment had not been properly clean for a substantial period of time   There was a large hole in a bathroom wall where there had been a plumbing repair  but no effort had been made to patch the wall   The blinds were broken and filthy  many of the mirrors are so old that you cannot properly see in them  the carpet is filthy and needs to be replaced  and much of the furniture is extremely worn and dirty   In addition  the pictures posted in the advertising by Zencity are of a different apartment and not this one    The apartment does not have cable as advertised but only offers Roku   The Wifi is problematic as it is often goes out   The only positive is the location of the apartment but this is of little solace  given its condition 
766674561,Awful service  Had to wait over an hour in the lobby as their check in instructions were incorrect  only to get a call back that there was a key at reception to which no one at front desk knew about  Lock didn t work properly for the rest of our stay despite advising Zencity 
764836595,All I can say is the furniture was what was in the picture  The place was filthy and in need of proper maintenance   They said they were sending maids  they didnt  The mgmt company is in California and hard to reach  does not flow up like they said  Listing is wrong with amenities  parking  etc  Im wondering who wrote the ad  if they have ever even visited the place    it was just the worst AirBnB 
763826154,for three nights it rained while I was in this Airbnb and because of the rain I really couldnt get out and enjoy the attractions around the city  the Airbnb television did not work the first night had to text and ask for someone to fix the television which wasnt fixed till the next day  and that really wouldnt be a problem if this wasnt portrayed as a five star establishment type Airbnb       for three nights not worth it  not worth it at all  then when I finally did get the television to work the next day at      in the afternoon I get a call from ZinCity telling me that someone was complaining about the music being too loud LOL now there is no external speakers in this hotel room I was only listening to the music on the television that was broken the day before  and due to the fact that I cant get out the apartment and enjoy the attractions Im listening to music in the apartment at      in the afternoon and someone complain       for three nights  again definitely not worth it stay away from this place unless youre an old couple coming to see a Cardinals game LOL for you guys to be charging as much as you do to stay in this Airbnb you need to accommodate a little more and be a little bit more open to people listening to music at      in the afternoon  we thought this was an Airbnb not a nursing home
762863724,I had a terrible experience with Zencity  Our shower was clogged for days and my family wasn t able to shower  They took forever to respond and had the audacity to try to charge me an extra      at the end of my stay  DO NOT stay here  You are so inconsiderate having the audacity to charge me      even when our shower was clogged for days and you didn t respond in a prompt manner 
762621025,Living space itself was well kept  Unfortunately when we went the neighbor was being evicted and had apparently left things in their apt  next door to rot   The smell was horrible and seeped into this Airbnb as well  Location is on the rough side of town  even when I asked for directions we were warned away and while waiting to use the entrance call box we were told by other residents not to stay out late in the area  This in conjunction with the parking space being at the other end of the block led us to cancel our stay 
755891372,Didnt check in until    pm    A M  before able to retire for the night  Only to be rudely woken by a representative of Zencity  asking me to confirm a   A M  check out at      the next morning  Calling back to back until I answered   i did not leave the room after entering the apartment  I paid for a room to shelter and rest after an   hour drive and a    a m  photo shoot that i needed to be well rested for in a room I purchased the until    A M   Please consider another BnB service if rest  respect and  appreciation for yourself and traveling companions is a priority   Didnt check in until    pm    A M  before able to retire for the night  Only to be rudely woken by a representative of Zencity  asking me to confirm a   A M  check out at      the next morning  Calling back to back until I answered   i did not leave the room after entering the apartment  I paid for a room to shelter and rest after an   hour drive and a    a m  photo shoot that i needed to be well rested for in a room I purchased the until    A M   Please consider another BnB service if rest  respect and  appreciation for yourself and traveling companions is a priority    id like compensation for the inconsiderate treatment as a guest of Zencity  
428887659327831464,It is a clean place but it is very confusing on how to enter the building to get the key fob  Luckily  there was another dude from Minnesota there to help out  Also  they claim that we are being too noisy which we are clearly not  There must be a sensor or something in the room  Last  there isn t any good onsite parking so you have to park far away or find a spot on the side of the street where you won t get towed  We will just get a motel next time with good parking 
422968065983512439,We arrived at night and the checkin was easy  the place was nice and clean  We were happy with it  We were woken up early on the loud noise from the construction site right across from the apartment s windows  Contacted zencity and after many phone calls and messages they provided a list of their other apartments that I can relocate too  The problem is all we re booked and not available  After many calls and chat messages on the second day  I was told to cancel which I did and got back      out       Note   zincity knew about the construction site and noice  the are building a building next to the apartment and it has been going on for a while and will go on for a while too  I had to rent another apartment from Airbnb for an additional       Zincity is my black list and will not rent from them even if it is free  You are by far the worst host I ever had  You are money hungry and you do not care about your guests  You failed to report the the noise coming from the construction site right across from window  This is something you new about 
746128699,Garbage place  garbage communication  Pictures are misleading  It s essentially a tenement apartment building with garbage all over it  someone had peed in the elevator  which was also covered in garbage   After our parking pass turned out to have no spot with the number on it and the landlord hadn t replied to and maybe hung up on several of our calls  we gave up and got a hotel elsewhere  I want a refund Area s gross  building s worse  We walked in  took one look  said this is gonna suck but we ll get through it  and then after our parking pass turned out to be to a nonexistent spot and the renter wouldn t respond  we got a hotel room in a better part of town  Again  front door broken open  no parking space with our number on it  no response to our calls  Very sketch  Lots of codes involved in the instructions but the door had been wrenched open and didn t require them  Lots of druggy looking folks coming and going  Elevator seemed to have been recently urinated in and was covered in trash  So disgusting I ate the hundred plus bucks they charged  ironically mostly in clean fees  and found a better place 
745656122,I would not stay here ever   It was very dirty   No parking   if there is it is very expense   Not what the picture looks like on site  Need to get a new clean team and do some maintenance   I well never stay there again   I well stay in a hotel  Parking was a nightmare    There was nothing said about the parking  There was a parking for the condo   Why dont you let renter use the card so many numbers to remember It was very dirty    I clean airbnb homes and I would not be able to leave it like it was   I took picture but they well not load on here    the stove would not work  we had to unplug and clean plug every time we used it   it would not stay on  need to do some maintenance on it   Showers where not good either need to work on them   Hardly anything to cook with but got by with what there was   The whole place need some TLC Just did not like For the cost it should of looked like the picture and let people know how much parking was and that a lot of the parking spots you could not go in and out and stay overnight
745412731,Honestly a nightmare experience  We arrived in the evening for a relaxing weekend getaway only to realize the apartment was not clean  Though it appeared tidy at first  we discovered that the bedding was covered in hair the floors had lots of dirt  dust  and hair  As we arrived in the evening and had no other accommodations  I spent over an hour stripping the bedding and picking hairs off the  clean  sets in the closet  The hosts couldnt be reached by phone  only by email  The next morning they emailed me saying someone would be by to clean  likely before  pm  we packed up all our stuff to make it easier for them to clean and went about our day  We arrived back that night only to find that no one had been by to clean  No explanation or response from the hosts  Even now  no one has responded about the situation nor the lack of follow through on their part  I am extremely disappointed and aggravated at my experience in this listing  The apartment was not clean and I spent more than an hour picking pubic hairs off of the  clean  sets of bedding in the closet  because the set already on the bed was disgusting and COVERED in hair   The sheets were wrinkled in a certain way that almost seems like they hadnt been changed at all after the previous guest  The floors and carpets had dirt and hairballs  I was told by Zencity that someone would come clean  likely before  pm   We gave them all day  No one came  Once again  we arrived  for the  nd night in a row  to a dirty apartment during what was supposed to be a relaxing getaway  I reached out to explain that no one showed up to clean and recieved no response  no explanation  nor an apology  I still have yet to get any response  The host said they would send someone to clean and they did not  The actual apartment inside the building was a bit difficult to find based on the instructions  The place was tidy  but the floors were visibly dirty  dirt and hair  and the bedding was a nightmare  The bedroom carpet had numerous large hairballs  There were     hairs  mainly pubic hairs  all over the sheets  comforter  and pillows  In combination with this  the sheets were very wrinkly in areas where they would be if someone had slept there and not changed the sheets  I spent at least an hour late at night when we arrived picking a strangers pubic hair off of the  clean  sets of bedding that were in the closet  Very difficult to reach host  Slow responses  if any  Promised to send cleaners and did not  Plenty of ovenware but no potholders  Bathroom sink was very difficult to use as the faucet was way too close to the counter 
742657189,Strong discourage anyone from renting this unit  The unit stinks of stale cigarettes and marijuana smoke  Nothing felt clean  The walls are paper thin and the neighbors party and fight constantly  There was a dog that wouldn t stop barking  The door lock is improperly installed  The floor sounded like you were walking on a sound generator from a horror flick  The bathroom looked like it was designed for hospice and the toilet seat was broken  We tried cancelling our stay the moment we walked in  fully prepared to drive the   hours back home we had just driven  but Airbnb could not reach the host  We left the next day and cancelled the rest of our   day holiday  No one should ever rent this unit again  Entire unit felt  grimey   Smoke smell was on everything in the unit  Unit is neighbored by awful neighbors 
741078738,This is an affordable apt building  there were trash bags and trash in front of the apt door  Also the apt has a strong cigar smell  Loud neighbors  I ended up not staying there  host didnt give me full refund  in times of Covid this building is not prepared for health safety  this is an affordable complex for elderly people it was difficult to find and the code plus speaking didnt work the common areas had trash bags and trash in front of the apt door  it is too expensive for the type of building
399994271853046732,Run away from Zencity    This management company is a joke  The apartment required use of a call box in the foyer to gain access to the building  It was broken  so entry was impossible  They suggested having a resident let us in  that works great if you can find one  and whos going to do that at      in the morning after an evening out  They made zero effort to fix the issue throughout the weekend and we ended up on the floor of my daughters tiny apartment  They were very slow to refund a partial amount  then sent a checkout message with an attached bill for an additional       Airbnb has done very little to advocate for my wife and I throughout this mess  Very disappointed as a consumer and shareholder  Sell sell sell     This is a disaster  The call box that is required tho gain entrance to the building does not work  I used the Airbnb chat function without reply  so I called the commercial number  Fortunately  after being on hold for a bit  Francis  picked up  His suggestion was to find a resident of the building to let us in and that they have been having issues with this call box for several weeks  Yet no one tried to communicate that beforehand  It was a complete disaster  We had to sleep in the floor of my kids tiny apartment  No effort was made to correct the issue throughout the weekend  Then the icing on the cake is that I got an email saying it was time to check out and there was another      charge   I NEVER SET FOOT IN THE APARTMENT         Your  service  is terrible  thank you for the stiff neck from sleeping on the floor 
399926417169251130,Let me start by saing checking in was a nightmare  It took us literally two hours to find a key they  placed  in a keybox  in the end there was no key in the key box  So they asked us to go to the room and check if ths door was open  we went up to the room and the door was open  the room was not clean there was trash all over the place  bedroom was a mess as well  so they told us all they could do for this ome night is relocate us to another building  so they relocated us to another building  We HAD TO WALK through kc to another location not only that they seemed to give me attitude about the fact that they had to relocate me and on top of that the relocation was only for that one night since i was going to return to the original room I booked once they actually clean it  The next day when i return to the room i dealt with the same issues again  and it was about half an hour until i was able to retrieve a key from this ridiculous key box  when we finally made it up to the rolm realize the door was not even capable of locking I sent them a message and they never got back to me about it  so I spent the whole trip taking my bags with me in and out so that i was sure they were not stolen  they also never got back to me about the door never locking  literally was ths worst booking experiance of my life  I highly do not recommend  on top of that small things like Old dirty dishes  no air filter on the ac that bothered me quite a bit  Never use zen city  thank you for communicating me the first night but I felt I could not trust you after I told you the door cannot even lock and you guys never contacted me back about it 
392023302329709668,I would be cautious to stay here  I arrived and never received the appropriate key card to enter the building and the gym  I was able to get a code for the exterior door  but was never able to access the amenities  even after communicating this issue to the renter several times on multiple days  The apartment had not successfully been clean and was dusty with dead flies in the window sills and the floor dirty  The toilet did not work appropriately and was never fixed during my stay   I had to go to the lobby to use the bathroom  There was also no hot water for the shower  which was also never fixed  I communicated all of this to the renter via Airbnb messaging and phone calls multiple times and they never fixed any of the issues  When you make commitments to communicate with guests  please keep them  You told me you would communicate to me what my refund would be  then never responded
391242754663117274,Cleaning staff returned the key   min after check in to the lockbox  was not masked  unit did not look like it was actually clean  air conditioner for room and living area was not adjustable  sofa back looked like it was broken and was not properly fixed assembled  no coffee pot or basic hotel Airbnb amenities  fob did not consistently work for the door  booked for a week stayed one night and cancelled and left the following day  first bad experience with an Airbnb after using for years 
389779075129777751,the bed is all messed up cheep frame pretty much slept on the floor there was literally no remote to the tvs I told support they no remote untill I left pretty didnt even stay my last night because i was uncomfortable nosy up rooftop party the bed is all messed up cheep frame pretty much slept on the floor there was literally no remote to the tvs I told support they no remote untill I left pretty didnt even stay my last night because i was uncomfortable
769272129,Not recommended  Check in is horrible  The machine does not work  And the code to get the key is invalid  Response is so slow  It took    minutes for them to confirm that the code is invalid because of the key is not there for pickup  And another     minutes for them to figure out a way to get me the backup key  I think this should be all set before the check in and they definitely can notice this issue earlier and fix it  Parking is also not easy and they did not mention it in the listing  instead they said free parking is available  And they will message you a picture with only     free street parking spots which is a few minutes away  And it is first come first served  So you probably have to pay for the street parking yourself  What s worse  the street parking usually has     hours limit  Host usually reply the message after   day or just ignore your message  You can expect your questions to be answered only if you call them and wait for a few minutes for them to answer the phone  Or keep asking the same question for a few times and wait for at least a day to get answered 
768951166,Beautiful place clouded by inaccurate  information and urine soaked sheets    I booked a month long stay in this Airbnb  Prior to arrival  I messaged the host and asked if parking and the gym would be included  They assured me that both would be free for my stay  Upon arrival I was disappointed to find that in reality  neither of these amenities we re available  I had to spend an additional      lining up separate parking and finding a comparable gym   Additionally  the place was not clean  There was hair all over the ground and in the carpet  If you do decide to stay at this Airbnb  look at the mattress and comforter that they give you  Both are covered in urine  I took some pictures but I do not believe that I m able to post them here on Airbnb  I would highly consider staying somewhere else  I have friends staying in other Airbnb s in the power and light district  These places are just as nice and quite a bit cheaper  For the price you pay this place simply is not worth it 
768686849,It was a nice room  but I couldn t access it without the assistance of other people  which is frustrating during a night check in  We never got a key and scheduled to stay for   days   There was food crumbs under a coach pillow  a fork in the disposal  and we ran out of hot water once  I m not picky  but anyone reading this may want to know this if they have high expectations   I was not happy with my stay because I couldn t access the room I paid for without doing something strange  The problem was never corrected because they probably manage multiple properties and I am one person with one problem  Room should have a keycard Ran out of hot water on day   at night  but it wasn t a big issue  May be to someone else  There was food or something behind the coach seats  There was a fork in the disposal for some reason  The room is pretty nice  I wouldve stayed there if I could ve accessed the room without assistance from someone else
760688724,This place is terrible they charge you allot for clean fees and the place is clean half fast with hair on pillos and foot prints on coffee table etc  I don recommend this guys at all  This  guys need to do something about the cleanness of their apartments  So far I love the locations and the buildings but the  quality on customer service and clean place  is very poor even though We pay a very large amount as a clean fee when the places is clean half fast  Also I m a repeat customer and a business man that have use their properties many times and I got back no respect so they  have lost a loyal customer and I ll make sure my colleagues don t use their properties  You guys need to do something about the cleanness of your apartments  So far I love the location and the building but your quality on customer service and clean please is very poor even though I pay a very large amount as a clean fee when the places a clean half fast  Also I m a repeat customer and a business man that have use your properties many times and I got back no respect so you have lost a loyal customer and I ll make sure my colleagues don use your properties 
755366642,Was the absolute worst AirBNB experiencE I ve ever had  I couldn t gain entrance to the building because the apartment number wasn t in the call box  Then couldn t get to my floor due to no key fob  Had to take the stairs to the  th floor  Once in the room I was informed that the key fob was in the room but it wasn t  When I contacted customer service they took forever to respond which led me to not be able to go to work that night because I wouldn t have had any way back in the building  So I was stuck in the building all day and night because they didn t get back to until the next day  After asking for a refund things started happening but still not in a timely fashion  After  pm the next day I finally got a key fob  Never again will AirBNB with this company  Make issues a priority  Call box didn t have apt number in it so I couldn t get in the building until someone let me in  Took forever to respond to my immediate issues 
753498953,I wish I could give an accurate description of this stay but I was not able to access the apartment and therefore didnt stay  The codes that Zencity sends in the instructions for access to the apartment did not work  After contacting a Zencity representative  she was not able to to get the access to work either and promised a full return from Zencity  I am still awaiting return from Zencity and response from Airbnb  I am still waiting for a full refund from Zencity for inability to stay at the Airbnb because I wasnt able to gain access as the codes were invalid and when talking with a representative  she was unable to help and therefore we were not able to stay at the Airbnb  Unable to access I was given instructions to access apartment that were invalid and spoke with a member of Zencity that was unable to help as well Didnt get to assess because I wasnt allowed into the apartment
753354758,broken bed frame refused to fix properly the cleaners are rude and not good at their job broken bed refused to fix and only one key with SOOOO MANY DOORS TO GET THROUGH I was locked out so many times unable to get in for hours
750763350,Key fob was not in the room as promised and we were given an incorrect access code for the building  otherwise it was a decent place  The key fob for the front door  gym and elevator was not present in the room upon arrival  That alone prevented us from utilizing most of the perks of the place  and we couldnt really leave our room because the access code to the front door and elevator did not work  It would have been fine of we had the key fob  We were given the wrong code for the door  They did not get back to us until   in the morning with a potentially correct code 
750584625,I do not recommend staying here  I could not access my own unit until another resident of the apartments helped me in and used their fob to use the elevator  They took forever to respond  And then there was supposed to be a fob in my room so I could leave and come back as I wanted  There was no fob and they never got me one  My pregnant girlfriend and I were unable to leave because we would not have been able to get back in    I also talked to   other groups of visitors that were coming through zencity and they were also experiencing just as many frustrations  I was unable to get into my unit because their instructions on getting in did not work  The intercom and code did not work  After over an hour of not being able to get in  they set up another code for me to get in and that still didn t work  The floor was sticky and there were dirty utensils in the drawer 
748943237,We had a total of   people with no music getting noise complaints  We kept volume to a minimum  Left the same day in case of additional charges for noise because we wanted to be respectful  Overall disappointed we couldn t stay at the place I purchased  We had a total of   people with no music getting noise complaints  We kept volume to a minimum  Left the same day in case of additional charges for noise because we wanted to be respectful  Overall disappointed we couldn t stay at the place I purchased

747966333,Waited an hour upon arrival for the apartment to be clean from the previous guest  The host said he would make a few adjustments to the trip to accommodate but there was no follow through after that  I spoke to   different  managers  of the property and they were responsive but not helpful  I do NOT recommend staying here  Host Cleaning lady was an hour late  The host was responsive but unhelpful 
744076658,No communication at all   Wrong key code delayed my check in about a hour and the worst part I was woken up by pest control at    am on my second day there and they came in and sprayed while I was there in a studio   Messaged the host and told him what happen he responded asking if they sprayed I told him yes and also let him know that me and my guest left and he never responded I even messaged again later that day after I had to go check in at a hotel and he never responded  Then finally on my check out day he sent me a message saying he hoped I enjoyed my stay  No communication at all Wrong information waited about    minutes till I actually got the key Old soap marks in bath tub left Did not respond Second day I was woken up to pest control at    am and they sprayed pest control while I was there

555066079611721310,This unit looks good in pictures but the building it is located in is really not nice  There was trash all over the grounds including the entryway and elevators  The hallways smelled horrible and the smell leaks through the door into the unit    Zencity staff are very responsive via messaging but there s no way to tell via this listing how rough the location of this unit is  We will not stay here again  We were really disappointed with how much worse this unit was compared to the photos and description on air bnb    The apartment grounds had trash spread all over the grass outside  entryway and elevators  The hallways smelled awful and the smell leaked through the door to our unit    When we arrived  half the lights in the building didn t work  The sheets had stains on them and the unit was clearly very old    We didn t feel very safe in this location either    The listing doesn t address the roughness of the building or the area and we would not recommend this unit to anyone else 
554381501648889646,The bed was really comfortable and it was very close to where I needed to be but they charged me     for a dirty sink that was there before I got there The bed was really comfortable and it was very close to where I needed to be but they charged me     for a dirty sink that was there before I got there

742364970,Wouldn t recommend Bad door man Door man at building was a creep 
742151737,I would not stay here ever again  Terrible communication  cold water in the mornings  they towed our rental car from the garage for no reason  refused to put us in touch with the on site property management to problem solve the situation  the common areas and elevators were disgusting  there was a constant cloud of weed and cigarette smoke  and the building was routinely left unsecured  I sincerely hope someone with some decision making capability reaches out to me soon so we can rectify this situation before I need to take it further  Every time I messaged the host to voice a concern I was connected with a different person who was not up to speed on any of the issues that we were dealing with  It was even more difficult to get someone on the phone  Texting is not the most effective or efficient means of communication especially when you are working      days teaching and presenting to several hundred attendees   With regard to the hot water issues  we had very early mornings because of the conference we were presenting at across the park at the St  Louis Union Station Hotel  The second or third time that we notified Zencity about the issue we had explained that the water was cold early in the morning and would be fine later in the day  They sent another person to our rental while we were AWAY without notifying us that they would be there  and our personal items and equipment were un secured   Zencity REFUSED to put me in touch with the on site building manager so we could problem solve the issue of them towing our rental vehicle   The fact of the matter is  there is ZERO guidance in the rental or in the house rules manual with regard to a specific parking space within the parking garage  There was zero signage or warning about having your vehicle towed if it was in the wrong parking spot  The parking pass was visible on our vehicle and it had several numbers on it  not to mention that the garage is a key card key fob secured structure with garage doors  By the way  the key fob also had a number on it that did not correspond with the apparently  assigned  space either   In fact none of the numbers visible on the pass  fob  or apt  appeared to correspond with any of the parking spaces in the garage  The garage was never full and it did not appear that spaces were specific to the cars in the garage as every time I parked there I observed different cars parked in different spaces   Here is how the situation should have been handled   If I was parked in someones space then when that person contacts the building manager and let them know someone is in their space   The building manager would then see that the pass hanging in the mirror shows that the vehicle does belong in the garage  and furthermore  the driver must have had a key fob to gain access   They would then cross reference the pass number to find the Apt    that it belongs to and then Zencity would have reached out to us to say   Please move your vehicle to the assigned spot  XXX    Instead  someone gave the tow company access to private property and towed our rental car  We have been incurring late fees  towing fees  and daily rates since then  even though we have been gone since the   th  Budget still has not been able to recover their car from the tow yard  We also were unable to rent another vehicle because of this so we had to pay additional money to get an Uber Lyft to make our flights when we checked out   So now here is how I am rectifying the situation  Airbnb   Zencity owe my business SLC Squared for time lost  we missed meetings the day we had our car towed  so that will be at our normal hourly consulting fee   Budget Rental Cost  Tow Fees  Budget Administrative Fees  and Uber Lyft fees  Also  we are disputing the charges for our stay as it was not what we thought we were paying for   I will be providing invoices for the substantiation of those costs incurred from Airbnb Zencitys negligence and I will be sending a bill to be paid Net     Late fees will be assessed as necessary as we will be having late fees assessed to us until the bill to Budget is paid  If necessary we will pursue civil action  I would prefer not to do that The access points to the complex were supposed to be secure but it was hit or miss if the doors were actually secured  There were several instances where they would be propped open  The outside and common areas of the location was gross  The elevators would have trash bags stacked against them for hours on our floor  Whenever you were in the lobby or on our floor it smelled like cigarette and marijuana smoke  One morning there was a whole to go box of food that was strewn all over the elevator and it was not clean up until the next day and even then there was food that still remained from it  Also  smoke and smells would come into the listing through the vent in the kitchen  Every time I messaged the host to voice a concern I was connected with a different person who was not up to

455748720919576389,STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNIT   WATCH OUT FOR FAKE REVIEWS    This place was a dump and the photos of the unit are from years ago  The unit came with   less sofa then pictured in the description  It also came with a dog bed that was supposed to pass as a place for a human to sleep    Be careful coming up the stairs as the handrail is loose and some of the wall anchors are coming out of the drywall   Theres was dried blood on a few of the walls of the unit when we checked in  There is no WiFi as advertised with the unit  The place comes with the minimal amount of bedding blankets  pillows  many without covers   and towels    I made multiple requests to management and to improve our stay  Management usually took over a day  sometimes    to respond to any of my requests  I was told I could go out and buy the things I requested    The outdoor heater is broken  the record player is broken  the outdoor furniture is filthy and most of the pillows in the living room are stained  I could go on and on  stay away from this sh t hole  This was hands down the worst Air B   B Ive ever booked 
510157780015856521,This was   without a doubt   the worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had    Zencity provided an incorrect door code and thus I was left stranded in a hallway that smelled of garbage masked with weed at midnight  After reaching out to ask for a new code  radio silence  I heard back from them at     am  which was just someone asking  If I had gotten in alright   without even including a new door code or any acknowledgement that their failure to provide the correct door code had left me locked out  I found a hotel with an available room  booked it  and when I woke up wrote to Zencity to request a refund and a cancellation of my two day reservation  which they refused to provide  They then said that they hoped to be able to provide me with a better Zencity experience  which clearly they did not want to provide or they would have answered my requests  I had to elevate the issue to Airbnb to get a full refund for my trip  Zencity has continued to refuse to provide a refund or compensate me in any way for the expense of the nearest hotel  I had a lovely trip  thanks to the Hoxton and the Ace hotels  I cannot stress enough how much I recommend avoiding Zencity when looking for your next Airbnb stay  Hello  I just wanted to   yet again   reiterate how terrible of an Airbnb experience this was  After you failed to respond to me as I was checking in  the response  at     am  did not even include the correct door code  And you ve continued to refuse to provide a refund  despite my requesting several times  AND I continued to receive messages from you as if everything was fine and I was able to check in  That is just terrible customer service  especially in hospitality  This is not to mention that getting into the apartment building felt unsafe and the hallway smelled like rotting garbage masked by the smell of weed

394900622998807163,I ll start by saying that I booked this Airbnb by mistake  My partner and I were traveling for a family member s funeral  and I thought I was simply sending a message  I had a question about parking  but the interface actually was a  Reserve  button instead of a  Send  button    I was on hold with Airbnb for over an hour before a senior representative said that it would be up to the host to refund me in full due to the mistake  Zencity is a company with no remorse for my situation  so they stood by their cancellation policy  I was going to lose out on a significant amount of money if I had cancelled so we decided it would be best to just go ahead with the reservation  The neighborhood  it s location to where we needed to be  and fairly easy street parking were the ONLY positives of this listing   We checked in around   pm because we were driving from NYC  We were tired from the road trip  and grieving being back in my partner s hometown  To say we needed comfortable accommodations is an understatement  We could not afford to find another place to stay given the circumstances of our visit   The apartment and building is dirty  dingy  and dilapidated  The chair in the studio is absolutely disgusting and looks to be covered in what were human fluids  I m assuming this was not checked by someone from Zencity after it was set up by whatever housekeeping company is used  The linens were not soiled and had been washed  but we still found hair  a giant ant  and light stains in the bed  dust and dirt on tables  headboard  windowsills  hair in the bathroom  the main rug is absolutely dirty and dingy  dust caked onto the ceiling fan  grease oil and food stains on the walls  The trash can in the kitchen won t close all the way  Dirty eating utensils in dusty kitchen drawers  I wish I could upload photos  We decided to sleep on top of the comforter because of how uncomfortable the mattress is and after finding a second bug  silver bug  the second night  The bed squeaks at the slightest movement and feels terrible    When notifying them about the condition of the apartment  their initial suggestion was to send a cleaner when we were not there  Were we supposed to repack our personal belongings  and lug it out and lug it back  In the middle of our visit  Or did they expect us to leave our personal things there while cleaners worked around it  Either thought is ludicrous    I requested a refund of some of the fees  and they refunded only the clean fee        I ended up buying a few sanitizing clean supplies to wipe down the surfaces that our stuff came in direct contact with  There are some clean supplies  but I barely wanted to touch anything in the room  The mop swiffer thing was as dingy and dirty as the apartment   Some of the hallway lights leading up to the room were broken  and the light sign right outside our door is broken flickering  The hallways and lobby smelled  Throughout our stay there were random pieces of trash throughout the hallways and stairway  The listing also said that this unit includes a washer and dryer  which it does not  There are communal W D on the basement ground level  When walking through the basement ground level to use the staircase by the apartment  the floor was littered with dead cockroaches  You can t make this up    On our last day night  we came back to the unit with the light switched on and we were POSITIVE that we had turned off every light  We think that someone at Zencity must have notified the cleaners to come that day thinking it was our checkout day  and they arrived  turned on the light  and quickly shut the door seeing that it was still inhabited  I don t know if this actually happened  but we KNOW we turned every light off    Please save your money  Zencity does not care about hospitality and comfort  They just want to get paid  We should have been given a more significant refund due to the condition of the apartment and building  It s absolutely disgusting  and makes it feel like you are really scamming people   On our last day night  we came back to the unit with the light switched on and we were POSITIVE that we had turned off every light  We think that someone must have notified the cleaners to come that day thinking it was our checkout day  and they arrived  turned on the light  and quickly shut the door seeing that it was still inhabited  I don t know if this actually happened  but we KNOW we turned every light off 
476832446329971748,Good things     Apartment and building looked like the photos   This is an old hotel that has been converted to residences and it had a charm about it   It was clean and well maintained         Security measures included card or fob to select your floor  so no one entering the building who wasn t supposed to be there could get to your floor        My floor was quiet during sleeping hours        If you do get through to customer service on a phone  they were very pleasant and they maintain a      operation for concerns   However  their ability to resolve most situations appears limited        One security guard was on rounds during early morning hours    am      Barriers to an excellent stay     Ghost host   There is no onsite or  in the area  host   Any issues one faces must be managed via text message on the AirBNB text platform   Further  there was no telephone contact provided for customer service   I had to look this up online and it took a while to find   They are based in Palm Springs CA  which was nearly      miles away from my site   And  it s clear the messages sent out prior to and after the visit are auto generated   There really is no  Ava  at Zencity  someone just copy pasted a message or pushed the  before  and  after  messages through   Low marks for impersonal service        Host does not know the property   For the conglomerate of Zencity  which apparently runs properties in Chicago  St  Louis  and Kansas City  they do not keep up with any changes to the property unless they hear about it from customers or residents   In my case      the pool had been closed by the health department   I had hoped to use the pool  as I had seen it on the photos   A kind update would have been appreciated     the original call box I was supposed to use for entering the building  at a side entrance  was disconnected and not operational   Signs had been posted directing people to go to the front entrance   Zencity customer service staff were clueless about this and asked me to text them photos    the address for the side entrance  where I was originally supposed to enter  was just plain wrong  promoting added confusion     the other call box screen at the front entrance required different codes  which I did not receive until the next day     of the two lobby elevators  one was broken down   Permanent residents did not know when the other elevator would be repaired     the area is frequented by a transient population pressing for handouts  presenting some safety concerns        Rough first day   Because of their lack of awareness  see      I was given the wrong entrance codes for the building   I spent  h upon arrival trying to contact someone  the mysterious  Ava   by text message on the AirBNB platform   I got in via a resident  who used their elevator key card to help me access my floor   The codes for my room were accurate  so at least I could get that far   However  the HID key fob they left in my room that was supposed to operate the HID panel at the building entrance  to release the door lock  was non functional   With neither a working key fob or working building entrance door codes  and no one getting back to me  I had to find other lodging that night   I eventually talked to a customer service agent by phone  but my issue was not resolved until the next day  after a    minute session over the phone    I only used   of my   prepaid nights there   A resolution for a partial refund is still pending on this matter         Residents and guests bad mouth Zencity overall   Every resident I met said Zencity was worthless and should not be running apartments there at all   Other guests using the space said the same thing   lack of response to concerns  no way to meet with or talk to a human about a problem onsite  bad key cards or fobs  inattention to building concerns  and other issues     Only   star for this property  because there are no zero stars  and because all the good things I listed above  I could get somewhere else routinely     Run away from  don t walk towards  a Zencity property   Regrettable experience  I had a very difficult experience  which can be re read on the AirBNB text platform as well as in my public review  While customer service reps were as helpful as possible over the phone  the business model you have as a remote host is not a suitable match under AirBNB  largely because you are reliant on text and email conversation  not in person communication   You are missing the point of hospitality   building relationships    I have requested a refund for the one night I was denied  as I did not receive a resolution for entering until the next morning   For the      apt at     McGee I noted the towel bar was coming loose at one end and the soap dispenser was too tall for easy use at the bathroom sink   Also  the tub did not drain well at all   Soap scum from bathing showering adhered to the tub floor and made the surface very slippery  a distinct hazard   You would do well to install an ADA bar to help with careful entering and exiting the tub  even if you clear up the slow drain   But  you would do best overall to discontinue your connection to AirBNB and pull this property off their site 
530722229389477117,expect the shittiest stay of your life  Ive stayed with you guys before and had no problems  The second time I made a reservation with you guys literally every part of it was fucked up  I was able to get through the front door of the apartment building but after that everything went to shit  Yall gave me the wrong code for the keycafe so I couldnt get my key to go any further than the lobby because you need a key fob for literally every door and the elevator  it took about   hours to get ahold of someone and finally get a key for me to use  So me and my girlfriend made our way up to the apartment  When we got to the apartment door the door wasnt locked  Instead it was open and when we walked in it was fucking disgusting there were used bandaids on the floor  the bathroom had someones hair all over the sink and toilet and shower  dirty towels on the floor  used wash rag in the shower  there was trash all over the apartment  and the bed was dirty and had obviously been slept in by someone  its was just disgusting and a horrible new years eve and experience all together

541375283953661277,Unfortunately this was not the experience that we were hoping for  I waited TWO HOURS after check in time waiting for a key to get into the air bnb  I was never able to get a key  and to top it off the building was being evacuated after the fire alarms were activated  We had to rearrange our plans for the night due to the inconvenience of not being able to get into the air bnb  After waiting so long and STILL no promise of even getting a key for the night I cancelled our reservation  I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to staying in this air bnb  Even though customer service was not able to help  I will say they responded in a timely manner  If you decide to stay here  I would be cautious and have them verify a key is there and available before you check in 
495646468480600577,DO NOT STAY HERE   From the photos this place looks like a steal  but once you arrive you will soon realize how poorly maintained the place is     My wife and I arrived around      and were immediately hit with smells of weed and cigarettes in the hallway   Not pleasant  but we can t expect management to be able to control the neighbors   Once we walked into the apartment we were wishing for the hallway smell as the entire apartment had a stench of rotting garbage   It felt like some didn t take the trash out for months  and showed of right before we arrived to remove it   As we walked around the place we noticed unclean floors and countertops  area rugs that should be trashed  and to top it off sheets that smelled like the previous guests   As we were debating on whether or not to stay or find a hotel  we noticed human nails in rugs next to the bed as well as pieces of glass near the coach    Clearly this was not the place for us to stay the night  and we left for a nearby hotel   I brought this up to the management group and their response was  ohh well   and  we will refund the clean fee    It was so dirty that we couldn t stay there a refund of the clean fee was an insult   I highly recommend that you keep scrolling to the next option

465216896642263648,This air bnb was awful    The instructions to enter the building did not work  We did not even get a key fob to access the building once we got to the room  Zencity was impossible to contact and when they answered they could not even offer any help  I would not stay here  The instructions to enter the building did not work  We ran into another couple trying to check in to their air BnB who had similar issues not being able to access their room  A resident of the complex was kind enough to let us in  but once we got into our room we were promised a fob that gets us inside the building and up the elevator  After not being able to locate the fob  it was nearly impossible to contact Zencity for help  Once they finally answered they had no way of helping us with our problems so we were scared we would have to sleep in our car if we did not catch a resident entering the building when we were coming back  They did not help us all weekend or offer any sort of refund for the lack of communication and not being able to access our room ourselves 
465135616008079051,The irony of calling their company  ZenCity  is not lost on me  We were not only highly annoyed but we were also then late for our engagement  also needing to find a new place to stay for both nights where we could guarantee re entry into the building  and also on the phone with ZenCity staff who by no fault of their own  are in no way helpful  Just entering the building is the most stressful thing  I generally enjoy Airbnb experiences  but I have now learned my lesson to only do Airbnb from actual individual owners and not these ill named corporations who run Airbnb properties  What an embrasement for Airbnb   First of all  do not book this  But if you do  do not follow any instructions they send you about getting into the place  Even if you call them and ask them to clarify because you read the reviews about it being hard to get in  it wont matter  They will say its easy to get in  They will say instructions are forthcoming  And you believe them because  what self respecting company gets multiple reviews saying theyve made it difficult to get into the building without remedying the situation  But Im not entirely convinced that anyone at ZenCity visits this apartment to know how to actually enter the building  On the keypad  you need to dial your apartment number in the directory  not the other number they give you  From there  the code they send you MAY work  IF you get in that way  they then recommend you walk around a desk and through a mailroom to find a key fob at a kiosk that does not exist  Meanwhile  the elevator to get you upstairs only stays unlocked for you for about two minutes  So while youre looking for the unicorn key kiosk  you get blocked from getting up the elevator  Fortunately  if you get there before the leasing office closes  the kind worker  who is embarrassed to have ZenCity in their building  offers to let you up the elevator to the apartment but is  of course  unable to provide access to the apartment  So you will stand there with all of your things while you wait for  Zen City to answer the phone and feign shock that you cannot get into their place  saying   We at ZenCity are not known for this   all while providing no real solutions  When they finally found a code to get us in the room  we asked how we would get back into the building  and they suggested we wait outside for someone from the  front desk  to let us in  This is NOT true  The desk  like the kiosk  is fake news  And how is that a solution for trying to re enter a building at midnight in downtown KC anyway  Why would they find this an acceptable solution regardless  Were supposed to just HOPE someone arrives and lets us into the building  No  Fortunately  we found a place to stay  The actual apartment is small with water dripping from the toilet  Its otherwise modest but cute I guess  and absolutely NOT WORTH IT  I dont know who you are reading this much of my review  but I do know that you  lovely human  deserve much much better  I suggest you send someone to the building to actually create instructions on how to get into the building and rooms  NOTHING about your instructions to enter the building are correct 
493477500949152498,Those staff who had contact with me through the chat and phone call were nice and had good communications   But the door stuff at the Parc Frontenac Apartments had so bad communication issue   She just kept ignoring me  and I was not able to get in my room  That was the worst customer service ever I had experienced  After I called the call service  I could have a room at different apartment after about an hour from I got there  Never book with them 
742739512,The apartment was clean and well located  but none of the doors locked and the outer doors were propped open when we came in  The host failed to respond to these concerns  The apartment was also incredibly loud  the neighbors were playing music until   am and we did not sleep at all I do not recommend  It is not acceptable to stop responding when a guest tells you they feel unsafe because none of the locks work no locks  unsafe stopped responding when i reported a concern
741923953,Do not spend your money here  Very unclean and disappointing 
740533048,Did not receive full refund  Did not get to stay here  Could not get into building  Bad experience  Did not receive full refund  Did not get to stay here  Could not get into building  Bad experience 
500023650970845177,You don t have any privacy there isn t any curtains in the house downstairs so everybody going up and down the streets can see right in and the furniture is so outdated The furniture is very outdated and then you need to put some type of blinds or curtains up so people can see inside their isn t any privacy  There wasn t even a blind or curtain in the bathroom on the third floor why can t people have privacy if your so worried about people having a gathering where you have it open for people to watch maybe you need to take it off of Airbnb don t nobody want everybody looking at them what if someone wants to walk around naked then tell your cll lol eating service yo clean right the floor was sticky by the kitchen nook area I was just disappointed with not having any privacy
453624977586905850,Make sure to have a good  CLEAR line of communication  Need better communication  I wasnt able to even make it into the building or talk to someone who couldve helped 
515969189491651541,Ok place the parking pass was missing the first day so struggled with wondering if I would get towed from parking in lot   They told me it was fine but still a nerve wrecking experience as I kept doing downstairs checking to make sure I was ok to park there   It was also cold in the home and the heat would not go past      needed a code for the thermostat to get any warmer   I also requested for late check out   hours early  They did not respond until    checkout saying they could not honor late checkout because other guest requested early check in   But what about your current guest that asked   hours ago   Poor communication and a big inconvenience as my flight was delayed  
452117307942695422,This property should not be an option for anyone  The central air doesnt work and they expect that a portable air conditioner will cool the entire apartment unit  On top of that the smell of cigarette smoke is over powering  The finishing touches to this ordeal are the sub par maintenance and lack of cleanliness throughout  Please see past messages between myself and Zencity 
455733831262448844,This unit is extremely well located   close to lots of restaurants and bars  in walking distance to many things  Unfortunately  the key fob did not work for us so we were unable to come and go as we pleased as we could not get back into the building unless an actual tenant happened to come out and let us in  It made for a stressful trip and felt unsafe  Also unfortunately  the unit was not very clean     Other than the location  the two best parts were the rooftop hangout space  theres a hammock  grills  seating areas and a TV as well as hot tubs  So bring your suits   and the bed  This is probably the most comfortable bed and pillows Ive ever experienced at an AirBnb  Unfortunately  we did not enjoy our stay with Zencity  Here are a few reasons why   First major reason  The key fob we were given to enter the building DID NOT WORK  We could not get access INTO the building and had to rely on waiting for other people to come and go and hope they would let us in  I contacted this listing   times during our stay to see if someone could fix this emergency issue and I did not get a response  It impacted our ability to enjoy our trip and come and go as we pleased needed  It felt unsafe to not be able to access the premises when we needed to and I did not like having to rely on strangers to let me in   The unit was not very clean  No one marked the  Cleaned By  sign to indicate that it was clean before we arrived  There was toothpaste running down the front of the bathroom vanity and pooled on the floor  The living room rug and bedroom carpet were not vacuumed  The walls are HORRIBLY dinged up  scratched  and they look blotchy and filthy throughout the entire unit  It did not make us feel comfortable  clean  or like we were getting the value for what we paid  Also  the bathroom faucet barely hangs over the sink so water pools all over the counter  The faucet is lined with mold and mildew from the constant mess  And the apartment smelled bad   The light fixtures in the bedroom dont work  One was broken and the other one didnt even have a lightbulb in it   Someone elses clothes were still in the dryer   We could not adjust the temperature   There was no mention of the rooftop hot tub on the listing so we didnt bring our bathing suits  Such a disappointment 
451408141860641682,DO NOT STAY HERE     Impossible to get into the building and I was approached inside the entryway by a street person and had to decide whether I was gonna have to fight with my bags on me  The entry instructions DO NOT WORK  It was  am and after    minutes a security guard let me in and said he has to let ABB people in all of the time  When I got up to the apartment  it smelled horrible  I had no choice but to stay after the fight to get in  I had   nights booked but left the next morning  I doubt I will get a refund  Read the other reviews  I tried to be proactive after reading how it was impossible to get into the building  Only got canned answers with no way to contact Zencity except for the app  which they responded to hours and hours later only to ask   Do you still have a problem   This is not a safe place and whatever you do DO NOT STAY HERE  You need to not be on Air B B as your instructions and customer service are the worst 
450657092141655905,The host posted the wrong address on the website  I messaged them when we took off and they replied two hours after we arrived  I called customer service to tell them we were lost because of the wrong address and she hung up on me  What was suppose to the a    min drive turned into over an hour and cost      on Lyft  The microwave in the apartment was broken and the bathrooms were filthy  I messaged them and no one came out to fix it  Customer service is unacceptable  I will not be booking with them again  The only great thing was the location of the apartment and the views  Power and light district is pretty cool  Everything is in walking distance  The host posted the wrong address on the website  I messaged them when we took off and they replied two hours after we arrived  I called customer service to tell them we were lost because of the wrong address and she hung up on me  What was suppose to the a    min drive turned into over an hour and cost      on Lyft  The microwave in the apartment was broken and the bathrooms were filthy  I messaged them and no one came out to fix it  Customer service is unacceptable  I will not be booking with them again  The only great thing was the location of the apartment and the views  Power and light district is pretty cool  Everything is in walking distance 
544173182154468326,This place looks nice on paper but beware that I caught a huge rat on the premises  I also saw a second rat on the last night and heard the scratching in the walls throughout our stay  If you think that I m lying  I have pictures and videos to prove my case  Check in was delayed by a hour and I had to start online teaching in my car   Lastly  I was informed this less than an hour prior to checking in and it was a huge inconvenience  The place looks nice but a rat infestation  is more than enough to turn a nice place into a complete dump  I would hope that Zencity has eradicated these issues by now but I cannot recommend anyone staying here until they are fixed  Also  please process my full and complete refund  RATS RATS  Rats  I hope that you have called an exterminator because catching one but seeing   rats is too much for any guest  I don t want to mention the hearing rats scrape inside of the walls of this place  I would like a full refund for my trip due to this inconvenience    Sincerely   Christopher Davis
443666030235721227,NIGHTMARE  This was an entirely fraudulent airbnb  Showed up at    PM with instructions to look for a lockbox with key in it  There was no such lock box  Got Zencity on the phone  talked to someone at length who could not reach anyone in charge  said they were all  remote    and we got  disconnected   Called back and was told there was no way to get me into that place but they were looking for someplace else  Periodically they said they didnt have anything until the next evening  but sometimes they said maybe they could find a place with only one bed for the night  But an hour went by  and there was no solution  I got a hold of the property manager for the actual building  and was told that the lease on the unit I was supposed to be in had ended more than a month earlier  and no one had a right to rent it on airbnb  Had to take a     uber to a hotel  Zencity then asked me to cancel the reservation and take the dispute for refund up with airbnb  I did not do that  instead I contacted Airbnb  Airbnb  to their credit  took care of it  cancelled the reservation  refunded me  gave me a discount for my next rental  and offered me a little gift  Zencity is not to be trusted unless you want to risk arriving in a strange city  in the dark  and having no place to stay 
481179784441823796,The main reason I decided to book this place is because I was told there would be garage parking on Pine St  The key fob for the garage did not open the gate and I was forced to park on the street  I was on a cross country trip with valuables in my car and did not feel comfortable leaving my car outside of the parking garage  As I approached my car the next morning I saw I was given a     parking ticket as well  I am extremely unhappy with everything that has transpired  Who ever runs this spot needs to check in and make sure the key fob actually works because it did not for me  The main reason I decided to book this place is because I was told there would be garage parking on Pine St  The key fob for the garage did not open the gate and I was forced to park on the street  I am on a cross country trip with many valuables in my car and did not feel comfortable leaving my car outside of the parking garage  As I approached my car this morning I saw I was given a     parking ticket as well  I am extremely unhappy with everything that has transpired and am requesting a refund  Who ever runs this spot needs to check in and make sure the key fob actually works because it did not for me  I am lucky no one decided to break into my car as I have been told not to park on the street at night in this area 
481163132444792456,No heat made the stay VERY uncomfortable  The heat was not turned until we were leaving  The thermostat was locked and could not be adjusted by us  Either give the tenant control or respond to their requests  I called every day and I received promises with no results  This is totally unacceptable  We had to wear our winter coats inside the unit   There were a couple of other items   The toilet seat was very loose  I hand tightened it but someone needs a screwdriver and a wrench   Coffee pods and a Keurig would be a nice touch   A set of measuring coups would be helpful   The lack of heat made the stay VERY unpleasant  
480001887874228616,Let me start off by saying I NEVER write long reviews  However  if I could give this property zero stars  I would  I had high hopes  even though this property had no reviews  because I ve booked with Zencity before  But NEVER AGAIN  The photos listed are of a totally different property  I have proof   The place was FILTHY  There was urine in the toilet  dirt and grime in the shower  and the sofa had stains on it  Not to mention there was a crackhead on the steps in the lobby  The host s communication is terrible  It took hours for them to respond  They only offered to send a housekeeper the next day and did not even acknowledge the fact that the photos on the listing did not match the property in person  I ve never had a problem with AirBnB until now  Even they were hesitant to refund my money  My trip to STL was RUINED because of Zencity and AirBnB  Do yourself a favor and don t book  I am extremely disappointed with my St  Louis stay  The property was inaccurate and not clean  Do better 
479221355011536269,Unit was not clean  Found cockroaches  Left and rebooked elsewhere  Will not book with this company again  I did not think they handled the situation appropriately 
445828741737742806,I was told we would get refunded for   nights because our entryway was blocked because of parties happening throughout the night  We couldn t get in or out of our room without going through people hosting an admissions table  I was told I would be able to cancel my last nights stay with no charge   We were told it could sleep    But it could barely sleep     There was mold on the shower curtain   A hole in the bathroom door  The floors were sticky   No check out instructions  were given    There were no extra blankets and the couch was a loveseat instead of a normal couch as the picture showed    I shared with them that I would go through ZenCity first before contacting airbnb if they could accommodate the issues we were having  They said they would accommodate  They didn t  so here I am  Im so disappointed in this stay and the dishonesty  I was told we would get refunded for   nights because our entryway was blocked because of parties happening throughout the night  We couldn t get in or out of our room without going through people hosting an admissions table  I was told I would be able to cancel my last nights stay with no charge   We were told it could sleep    But it could barely sleep     There was mold on the shower curtain    No check out instructions  were given    There were no extra blankets and the couch was a loveseat instead of a normal couch as the picture showed    I shared with them that I would go through ZenCity first before contacting airbnb if they could accommodate the issues we were having  They didn t so here I am  Im so disappointed in this stay and the dishonesty 
495669923213027413,Spacious  sparsely decorated apartment in a Good location   Be prepared to live out of your suitcase as there are no clothes dressers to place your garments during your stay   Hopefully Zencity will have replaced the missing blinds in the bedroom so you will have a modicum of privacy   With  luck  the furnace will be working your entire stay  it only operated for the last day of our four day rental   We froze and complained for three days and Zencity did nothing   Oh  and keep your fingers crossed that the sinks in the bathroom drains   We didn t have use of one bathroom for three days because our repeated  respectful requests to have it repaired  and to get the heat turned on  were ignored   I ve heard that Zen is a path towards happiness  but the road Zencity will put you on is a rocky  unpleasant path to frustration  Furnace did not work  sink did not drain and it took you three days to fix those significant problems   You never did repair the missing blinds in the bedroom   Your failure to act showed disdain for your customers 
442718038979971606,DONT GO TO THIS PLACE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT  The most stupidest place I ve ever been to please go somewhere else even a motel would be a easier stay  Got to the freaking place the code on the lock box didn t work called and the lady was like are you sure you re at the right place yes I was at the right damn place  Are you sure you re at the right lock box there s only one lock box  Are you sure it s number    Yes  She gave us like     codes to try none of them worked  Was asked this for a damn hour  Ended up telling us to walk a couple blocks to the other Airbnb that they also have at like midnight  Would of drove but I already payed for my parking  Ended up there code didn t work for the entrance to the apt  Someone finally let us in get to our room the code for the door doesn t work  Had to call for the  RD TIME  Had to wait for another    mins finally got the right code  The place was on the  th floor not the   st like the place I wanted  The place was awful compared to what I wanted to stay at  Honestly want a reimbursement  But Foreal don t go       Sorry if I don t make since still so pissed on what happen Worst stay I ve ever had  Had better at     motels  Honestly want a reimbursement  I got to the right place couldn t get in because the codes weren t working for the box  I kept being asked the same freaking question when I told the person on the phone what was happening  You sure it s number    Yes told her it was    times was on that phone forever  Ended up having to go to a another Airbnb that you guys had that was not even as nice as the one I payed for  Code didn t work for the door had to call again for the  rd time  Finally got around   am than got woken up at    am could of let us stay longer since you guys messed it all up on your end 
490547294045883612,Disappointed in our stay  Unit is a great location  clean  and had towels  dishes    Those are literally the only good things about the trip  Where do I begin  Upon check in  it was    degrees  We attempted to adjust the thermostat  It was only blowing cold air  We notified the host immediately and did not receive a timely response  When they did respond  their advice was to use the extra blanket  which was a sheet   I was freezing so we left to meet up with friends thinking surely the host would be over soon to take a look  Nope   Upon our return  the temperature was    degrees  I called the host  He said he would call back in   minutes  At   AM I received a response  We had an absolutely awful night  No one ever came to look at the place  We found a service slip that said the thermostat was  broken and unable to cycle dated a few months ago  The unit needs repaired    We did not have time to find another place to stay so we made it work  Upon checkout  the clean people came before we had even vacated  Not impressed and we will never use Zencity again    The complete lack of communication and lack of basic temperature control was completely unacceptable  Terrible communication  We needed assistance for a comfortable stay and got literally no help 
456695657214884495,I was really looking forward to staying here for a few days  Check in was at    they didn t send check in instructions until    pm  To which i found out address on the listing was wrong  I could not get in the building because the code box was broken  they had no alternative except have someone let you in  Their keyfob did not work either  I was left on hold for over    mins and then the rep hung up  Defeated i decided to stay at a hotel instead  They never called or messaged me back  If you re able avoid this company at all cost  This isn t my first mishap with Zencity Terrible communication

536997305275825932,My group and I chose this AirBnB for the location and value  and while it is in a nice part of town  we could not have been more disappointed with the apartment and our experience with ZenCity   On the day that we arrived  we found folded towels with lipsticks stains  a folded comforter with a stain  and dirt between the sheets and comforter on one bed  Between that and the dirt visible on the rug  it was clear that this location was not clean hardly at all before our arrival  We ended up having to do laundry for all of the beds before we felt truly comfortable sleeping in them  There were also a couple of cracked glasses and countless scratches on the walls  but there was nothing we could do about that   The biggest issue we had was how dang COLD the apartment was  The window in the front window didnt seal properly  and so it was     degrees colder than the rest of the unit  The Nest Thermostat could be adjusted in a reasonable range  but after only about an hour or two  the heat would turn off  I assume to save money   This was at all times  not just at night  and so when we woke up or came back from a day of sightseeing  wed find a    degree apartment  I have pictures   with    hours until it reached our selected    degrees  This meant that our space was never comfortable enough to enjoy in the morning and evenings when we would WANT to use it   All of these issues went partially or fully unresolved  as ZenCity was absolutely impossible to reach out to  Every time a message came in or out  it was sent received by a new person after some time at ZenCity  which dragged   message conversations into hours long communications that would still leave the issue unresolved  It took   days for them to answer a question regarding where to dispose of garbage bags  and that was only after bringing up an additional issue on the  th  Regarding the temperature  they said that they adjusted settings on their end  only for the apartment to get slightly colder while we were asleep away   This stay and experience was honestly the only thing keeping us from having the perfect Chicago vacation  I would recommend staying as far away as possible from any unit managed by ZenCity

434782617314006258,Beware   this company is extremely difficult to work with    I came here to stay the weekend with a friend of mine  We wanted two separate sleeping spaces  this listing says it sleeps   people  Sounds great  When the trip got closer  I looked through the pictures and saw there s a double bed and a small couch  I messaged the AirBnB owners to make sure the couch is a pull out  confirming we ll have enough space    They said NO  this isn t a pull out  The couch looks like a loveseat  so I ask them if it s a big enough couch for an adult to sleep on  They refuse to answer my question and instead ask why I need to know if only   people are staying  Valid question  I respond that we aren t planning to share the bed  that s why we chose a place that fits   people  so we can spread out    I ask how they accommodate   people  They refuse to answer  I remind them that this is false advertising  and ask them to explain how they accommodate   people again  Eventually  they ignore me because I m asking for a refund    Is that allowed  To just ignore your client   Here s where it gets weirder when we show up  the couch IS a couch bed  This whole thing could ve been alleviated  It was so strange    The place is fine  the company is super difficult and does not treat its customers with respect  I d stay elsewhere to avoid a scam  I asked repeatedly how you could claim   people slept here  You ignored all my questions  Extremely inappropriate behavior for a business  That s a very valid question

518069187015067317,The apartment wasnt clean properly  The floors were dusty and there were roaches  There were roaches even in the dishwasher  I dealt with the roach issue since I didnt have time to pack my stuff and move to a new location since I was there for work  I also had already paid for a months stay and they were not giving me a refund  When I addressed the issue the company offered a  courtesy tidy up  mid month  I emphasized that clean the apartment wasnt going to solve the issue and that they needed pest control  I requested to be moved to another building but they could not accommodate me  On my last day at the apartment  someone tried to break in  The only reason they could not enter is that I had an anti burglary lock on the door  After the attempted break into the apartment  I decided to leave  I wasnt issued a refund not even for the remaining weeks I already paid for  This was my first experience using an airb b and it was a terrible experience

507105934490869512,This property is not as expected   Though they advertise exceptional clean there was still hair in the shower drain   There were holes in the walls where the blinds had been pulled out of the wall  There were tiles missing off the bathroom walls  The worst part is the room is right next to the elevator  an elevator that  squeaks    So every time the right elevator goes up or down  day or night  you hear it   The room is so hot you have to turn on the room unit which goes on and off constantly and is in the living space so you will need to constantly adjust the TV volume  the air unit also has a terrible oder for the first day   I contacted Them within the first   hours of checking in with concerns   they did offer many other options in the near area  Now they want me to pay      fee for a missing key fob  that opened the main door and elevators  
480413420847547131,DO NOT STAY WITH ZENCITY   We were never able to actually access the apartment  the key was missing   After we messaged them about the problem  Zencity apparently knew that it had been missing since October  th and didnt do anything about it   They didnt have anywhere for us to stay so we ended up sleeping in our car   Thanks for nothing  assholes

539848184352805552,I highly recommend NOT staying here  The owners are corporate  the walls are thin as paper thin and efficient  communication is challenging to say the least  ZERO stars  Look up the definition of empathy 
542094722739784568,Avoid at all costs   The company is shady as hell and looking to milk you for every dime  Beyond that  the unit has no end of problems  I signed for an extended   month stay and regretted every second of it     Leaky upstairs neighbor pipe caused damage to the ceiling that now constantly drops powdered drywall an the counters   A heating system that you cant controle  Runs full blast while its in the   s  but turns off for days when its    outside   Barely stocked kitchen makes cooking nearly impossible   No parking at all  Youll have to try your luck with street parking   Internet down roughly half the time    Wall a c units that can barely keep you cool when its in the high   s  and cant outpace the radiator that is always running   If you need somewhere to stay then do yourself a favor  Sleep outside  Itll be nicer 
519629430482373855,Not so Zen w  Zencity  I stayed here one     night  maybe      hours  Upon arrival the hallway on the way to the unit was very smoky  no problem no complaint  I enter the unit and while doing my usual walkthrough I notice the clean job is not so clean  again no problem no complaint  I search Airbnb to see if maybe I could find another place but nothing was available with such short notice  I run to the store and buy clean supplies etc then return to scrub down the kitchen  bathroom and whatever those stains were on the couch  Again no problem no complaint  I put a sheet over the couch so I could watch some tv and order dinner  After all that I was finally able to relax and go to sleep  I never once messaged or called the host and I certainly had no intention of doing a negative review  I woke up  wiped the bathroom back down after showering and placed all of my towels in the hamper they provided  After check out I then receive a request for      from Zencity saying I busted a hole in the closet door  With   picture showing a hole in the interior of a closet  I decline the charge because I did not nor have I ever caused any damage to any Airbnb  and I ve stayed in plenty   Furthermore  I didn t even use it at all being that my visit was so short  I have never had a host try to blame or charge me for any damages  Especially after I clean etc just to be able to stay the night there  This host has presented themselves as very dishonest in practice and is trying to pull one over on me 
519613259964058632,Terrible check in process Terrible check in process
459367597725299060,The original confirmation code did not work and had to call for a new one  The room was subpar clean and most importantly  did not include a fob key  This is a major issue because you need the fob key to access the elevator  After addressing the information and asking for a full refund  Zencity has yet to respond to me    Would NOT recommend 
495714905389925398,Let s start off with THE PICTURES ARE NOT THE APARTMENT YOU STAY IN  The place wasn t dirty but the walls were dirty  It does not have a fire place  it smelt like kitty litter but that could be do to the water damage in the kitchen  the water in the shower was Luke warm  you have to pay to park on the block Mon   Saturday between  am    pm after that it s free  The building is out dated  The windows are drafty so we had to cut the heat up to    while sitting in the living room   THE PICTURES ARE NOT ACCURATE  Let s start off with THE PICTURES ARE NOT THE APARTMENT YOU STAY IN  The place wasn t dirty but the walls were dirty  It does not have a fire place  it smelt like kitty litter but that could be do to the water damage in the kitchen  the water in the shower was Luke warm  you have to pay to park on the block Mon   Saturday between  am    pm after that it s free  The building is out dated  The windows are drafty so we had to cut the heat up to    while sitting in the living room   THE PICTURES ARE NOT ACCURATE 
513834683561658827,I left my hat at the location which I understand is totally my fault  I reached out in hopes they would be able to return it to me and provide me with a way to retrieve it  It was a very expensive hat  They told me they would send me a shipping label when they find it  They ignored all messages after that and I never got a shipping label  You all are terrible at responding to messages 
510896136481122923,There were so many issues with this unit and building   To start we got to the building to retrieve the key   fob  The code didn t work to get the key   After calling they had to see if there was any other way to get a key  Finally got one out    We got to the unit  it was clean  The bed only had a sheet on it  KC in December you need a comforter    After going to dinner and coming back  the fob didn t grant access to the building  I called the host  Their solutions were calling other units in the building to let in  that didn t work so we were told they many need to put us up in another place  Finally after an hour we got in  Again cold outside December KC    The next day  went to lunch and came back  Again the fob didn t work  I called again and they reached to maintenance   I was told I would get a call back  After   hours of no call back  I called them back so we could leave the building  Their solutions   they would be able to get a replacement fob the next day  they day I check out  Then to get in find someone s else entering the building and sneak in behind them    I told them that I have medication I need access to  All I got was sorry that s the only solution we can offer    Finally I asked if there was any spare fobs at all that I could have access to after an hour on the phone  They had to call maintenance again  Finally worked  I ve still not received a call back on the poor experience  Not having access to the unit I rented is such a big disappointment  It s something you pay for  On top of it  they told me the comforter was missing when it was never there    I expected much better from ZenCity  I really need a call back from someone  This has been the worst experience I ve had  I didn t have access to the unit multiple times in the cold  The solution you gave was for me to sneak in when someone else buzzes in  Then you were going to give me a new fob the day we checked out  Someone needs to contact me
546349262488271362,Zen needs to have a better logistic when it comes to paying attention to clients  I waited   hour and    minutes unable to access the building  Tried contacting the host several times and the only response that I got   several hour later  was to remember my check out  disregarding my inconvenience 
500765823175764405,Sent a private message to this owner about our experience  After   days  They finally reached out with a saved message sent to all their disappointed customers   Thanks but no thanks    Move on to the next    when searching Already sent and it took you   days to respond
520875919630513180,Still waiting for refund  Zencity  the host company  provided several options for check in time when I made my reservation  I chose  am  The night before my reservation  Zencity wrote to me with the check in instructions and told me I could not check in until  pm  When I explained that my reservation was for a  am check in  they just said  Airbnb made an error  and would not let me check in 
507287104230923961,Ok  here we go  first  the cost was supposed to be       yet I was charged        And second your heating cooling system is crazy  According to maintenance floors     are controlled by the single apartment on the floor whole wants it warmest when the heat is running or coldest when the air conditioning is running  There were six night when I had to stay with a friend  Finally I had to purchase a       BTU inside A C unit because the heat was set at    degrees  According to the Mayo Clinic the most healthy temperature to sleep at in between    and     I am demanding a credit of       over charge            days unable to sleep there          Price of A C  Totaling          Ok  here we go  first  the cost was supposed to be       yet I was charged        And second your heating cooling system is crazy   According to maintenance floors     are controlled by the single apartment on the floor whole wants it warmest when the heat is running or coldest when the air conditioning is running   There were six night when I had to stay with a friend   Finally I had to purchase a       BTU inside A C unit because the heat was set at    degrees   According to the Mayo Clinic the most healthy temperature to sleep at in between    and      I am demanding a credit of       over charge            days unable to sleep there          Price of A C   Totaling           Should this Demand not be met  I as an attorney will not only file for damages   I will simultaneously send out Press Releases  For Immediate Release 
460693093614231101,This is ran by a company  not an individual  They could provide a working key fob for me to get into the apartment  After speaking with a rep on the phone  and being locked out of the apartment  they couldn t call me back to let me know about a replacement key fob  They still tried to charge me to stay in this apartment after they couldn t provide a working key fob  and after they couldn t return a phone call to let me know whether or not they had a replacement fob  I would not recommend renting from them  Not trust worthy 
526722183716743234,I booked this place and requested a early check in on the form in two locations  I explained I was a  rd shift worker and travelled four hours straight from work  I needed to check in early to sleep  They accepted my reservation request and never gave me check in instructions   They also never informed me until I arrived that my request wasn t approved  Had they told me  I would have gone somewhere else that could accommodate me  They refused to refund all my money  They ad also says free parking but if you look harder within the ad  it also says no parking on site  This place is also in a very dangerous park of down and looks nothing like the pictures  There is no one on site to help you  I booked this place and requested a early check in on the form in two locations  I explained I was a  rd shift worker and travelled four hours straight from work  I needed to check in early to sleep  They accepted my reservation request and never gave me check in instructions   They also never informed me until I arrived that my request wasn t approved  Had they told me  I would have gone somewhere else that could accommodate me  They refused to refund all my money  The ad also says free parking but if you look harder within the ad  it also says no parking on site  This place is also in a very dangerous park of down and looks nothing like the pictures  There is no one on site to help you 
473887879528816877,Awesome clean location just not good communication as am still awaiting replies for things left behind  Left my camera there have contacted the host and no reply as of yet  Have filed police report and will be reviewing footage  Please contact             Jordan  Thank you
505097591620204319,The only good part about this property was it s location  There was no parking except paid parking on the street  Apartment had roaches in the kitchen  only   blinds worked properly  so place was dark  only one of three light bulbs in bathroom worked  shower and tubs paint was peeling badly  apartment was cold and drafty especially at the window AC units radiators wake you up every morning  about   am sounding like someone hammering the pipes in your room  Management sounds like they re calling you from China with an oatmeal box and a string  This place was AWFUL 
461578127434512063,DO NOT STAY HERE    They were supposed to leave me a fob keycard to be able to get in and out of the building  in and out of the parking and to be able to use the elevator and stairwell  I rented this Airbnb as I was driving    hours for a concert  I ended up missing the concert because it took   hours to sign in due to having to have the front desk escort me around the building that way I could get into the apartment  When I called the phone number I was rudely hung up by a customer service agent of this company  It s not a apartment owner renting out there property it s a business that has multiple units and after speaking with the front desk all the other people who rented there units also had the same issue  So I ended up wasting      plus    hours and   days due to me not being able to leave the apartment  I called numerous times but they would not respond to me and when they would answer the phone I would have to explain my whole issue again for them to say we will call you back shortly and them never calling me back  Worst Airbnb experience ever  I will never be staying with you again this was a horrible experience  I still can t believe the fact that I lost my concert that I drove    hours to go just because your company forgot to leave me the keycards for the building  elevator  stairwell and parking 
547127311655412837,After our   week stay  I would recommend that you please do NOT stay here or in any Zen City owned property  Especially if considering this unit for a long term stay  I preface this by saying I travel year round for work and rent often from AirBnb  I have never left a poor review before this    During our   week stay  we encountered issues that have been mentioned in previous reviews  which shows they have never been successfully resolved  as well as new issues not mentioned in previous reviews    When we arrived  the unit smelled very strongly of sewage and or a dead animal  We notified the hosts  who sent maintenance out  Maintenance was only ever able to give trouble shooting ideas  none of which resolved the issue  and then the hosts never had maintenance come assess or try to resolve the issue again    There is also a clear issue with water in this apartment  The water would only run hot sometimes  and when it did  it only lasted between      minutes total per day depending on the day  The hosts sent someone out to address the issue  and when that repair did not resolve the issue  they never sent maintenance back to address it and it went unresolved    The city maintenance also had to shut down the water for an hour  which caused one of the toilets to stop working  We had an unusable  broken  clogged toilet for an entire week before it was fixed  as maintenance had to order and wait for a part to arrive  and we were paying for a two bed two bath the entire time  Thankfully  AirBnb support was able to process a     refund of affected nights    On top of all these individual issues  communication with Zen City the entire time was extremely vague and lacking  When I mentioned issues  I was often told they were passing it along to the corresponding team  and rarely or never received information with solid details on when or even if maintenance was going to show up  When I would check back in  not having heard anything  I was often speaking with someone entirely different than before and had to re explain issues as if they were brand new  I even communicated that no one was to knock or enter the apartment before   am  and that boundary was either not communicated from Zen City to corresponding teams or completely disregarded    as maintenance showed up at     am  We spent our entire stay waiting for issues to be addressed or resolved  and it was clear by the end of our stay Zen City was not addressing issues  but it felt they were rather waiting for us to leave  After the initial troubleshooting attempts for both the terrible sewage smell and hot water issues  no one ever came to address the issues before we left    I will never stay with Zen City again  and strongly advise anyone considering staying here not to  It s unfortunate  because the unit is gorgeous from its appearance  but entirely unlivable due to unresolved issues and horrendous communication and customer service  Our stay here was an absolute nightmare  Ive never left a poor review before this  and it makes me sad this was the case  as    solely from appearances    this unit if beautiful  However with the extreme inconvenience caused from unresolved maintenance issues including the horrid sewage smell  the hot water issues  and the broken toilet which wasnt fixed for a week  as well as with the clear gaps in communication  I am left with no choice  I highly recommend establishing better communication between your Zen City staff and your maintenance teams 
465286178909503039,I d like to preface this review by saying that I never actually write reviews  Only in cases where the experience is very good or very bad do I think it s worth the effort  My wife and I have stayed at a number of Airbnb s  and  our experiences have generally been great  Our stay with Zencity was anything but   We were staying for a week in Chicago for my work  with my wife planning to work full time from the Airbnb for the week  My wife is also pregnant  By the second day of our stay with Zencity  the unit began to reek of cigarette smoke  and was at its worst during the day for the hours that my wife was working from the unit  Secondhand smoke is a terrible risk to a developing fetus  The next morning I reached out to the host to resolve the issue  We requested either to be moved to a comparable unit or be refunded the remainder of our stay  It took multiple messages for them to respond  and even once we were in the middle of the conversation  the average response time to a message took hours  The resolution that they offered was either to move us halfway across the city to a much cheaper unit or to request that my wife find somewhere else to work for a day while they used an ozone unit to temporarily reduce the smell  even getting to this point in the conversation took over    hours   Not wanting to endanger my wife our baby  we moved to a hotel and alerted the host so that we could be refunded the remainder of our stay  The host claimed to be considering the refund repeatedly over multiple days  but on the last night of our stay  requested that we cancel the reservation  After cancelling  they alerted us that they were denying our refund request because they couldn t confirm that we weren t in the unit because we hadn t hit the  cancel  button in the Airbnb app despite informing them that we had vacated partway through the stay  Taken together  it seems as though they were just delaying responding so that they wouldn t even have to offer the     refund in their cancellation policy  Also  the TV does not work and unsurprisingly  Zencity never responded to our message at the beginning of the week asking them to fix it   This experience was all around terrible  We will never be staying with Zencity again and we recommend that you do not either 
572451857330439521,Terrible
462293454402892691,UNPROFESSIONAL UNORGANIZED AND DISRESPECTFUL  I DON T UNDERSTAND HOW A COMPANY CAN OPERATE LIKE THIS  SAT ON HOLD FOR OVER TWO HOURS AND THEY STILL HAVEN T MESSAGED BACK WHEN I REACHED OUT about the problems The floors  counter tops  and tables were ALL crumby  The company has   communication skills AT ALL  The check in process was   out of   stars because i didn t get correct check in info until   hours past the time i arrived  I was paying to extend the reservation after all these inconveniences and sat on hold AT     AM FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS  UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE TO EXTEND BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAD ENDED MY RESERVATION  BUT IM IN TOWN ON BUSINESS AND IT WAS TOO LATE NOTICe ti find anywhere else to go
546387287789542831,Appartment was dirty   Other peoples hair all over the bed  floor  and linen   To top it all off  someone cut the catalytic converter off my truck   All around horrible stay   I will not stay with zencity again  what can I say     stays with your business     times I wish I would have gone elsewhere 
547126325921980470,Room was not accurate and very very dirty  Would not recommend  Wouldn t even respond after I sent pictures of dirty room upon checking in Horrible dirty room nothing was done about it
521706263800926042,this place is ridiculous this company is ridiculous I will never choose one of their properties ever again they have horrible customer service they leave you on hold just to disconnect you their key fobs dont work so we have to wait for hours to get into your apartment even after I extend my stay because I had no other choice I had to wait outside the apartment   hours to get a new code  after spending three hours the first night trying to get a code because their key fob didnt work  all they wanted to do is give me an hour late check out which which they ended up locking me out of the building half an hour before that time was up so I couldnt even get my phone this place is ridiculous this company is ridiculous I will never choose one of their properties ever again they have horrible customer service they leave you on hold just to disconnect you their key fobs dont work so we have to wait for hours to get into your apartment even after I extend my stay because I had no other choice I had to wait outside the apartment   hours to get a new code  after spending three hours the first night trying to get a code because their key fob didnt work  all they wanted to do is give me an hour late check out which which they ended up locking me out of the building half an hour before that time was up so I couldnt even get my phone
547071512009528082,Filthy disgusting place wasn t clean at all   I found dirty used underwear on the bed   The place was cold it had air coming through the windows  When I say everything in the place was dirty down to bathroom to walls everything about the place was horrible The place was filthy disgusting it s was not clean at all   I found used underwear  When I say nothing was clean in the unit Down to covers on the bed
486940955971834301,I do not recommend  the place smelled rotten flesh and they gave me the runaround about getting it taken care of  when a guest tells you the place smells really badly you should definitely get it taken care of 
483363627233999800,Seems hit or miss on cleanliness  my stay was definitely not clean   clumps of hair on the bathroom floor  old sandwich in the fridge  and no soap in the bathroom soap dispenser  Ive reported this in several different ways but no one has responded to my request to refund my clean fee   The unit is very nice  however  and the front desk staff was very kind  Please refund my clean fee   I paid more than the price to stay in clean but there was hair on the bathroom floor  an old sandwich in the fridge  and no soap in the bathroom soap dispenser 
465124225853245363,I originally booked a room                 in The Netherlands      Main Street Kansas City Mo       through ZenCity  I was forced to check out early on            Upon check in ZenCity failed to send my access code to the key retrieval box so they had to open the box remotely  Once receiving my key and attempting several times to enter my room I discovered the key did not work  I contacted ZenCity again and they assigned me       When I enter the room the room had not been clean since the last guests stay  I contacted ZenCity again and was relocated to       The room did not have the amenities promised  The washer and dryer was not hooked up and operational as well as the refrigerator and the wifi was non existent  After waiting for the key and each room assignment I was forced to wait   hours in between call backs  I did not enter the  rd room until     pm on my check in date due to ZenCity s lapse  I woke up the next morning           with a call from ZenCity stating that I had to leave the unit and they would find me another  I was forced to cut my trip short and cancel due to the unit and area that ZenCity chose to relocate me to  It was not in the area that I had time to research and read reviews about and I was a woman traveling alone   My staycation was a nightmare 
460149608672120421,Rented one location   Got there  keypad didnt work and no property manager on site to let us in   Moved us to a  comparable  location across town   Gave us the wrong keycode to get in   Finally was able to access location which in no way  shape  or form was comparable to what we booked originally and included a backed up tub   Communication was very slow   took    hours for them to address the tub issue by text   In fairness  they were kind enough to return the difference in price between the two facilities  but I will not use this company again  When you cant get your customer in the place they booked  it would be nice if you  put them in a comparable location   Additionally  it may be wise to have a property manager in the city you are booking rooms in 
568811427041154957,The condo needs a lot of repairs and clean  The pictures seem to have a filter  everything is much older and not as nice The condo needs a lot of repairs and clean The entrance was so dirty with dirty cloths and old plastic bottles on the stairs  The windows needs to be sealed   really cold wind coming through  The bath as tapes on the tiles and the ceiling needs repair The living room window is ripped  One of rooms has a terrible mattress on an assemble bed  The furnace noise is too too loud  The pictures seem to have a filter over  Everything is much older and not as nice  I can send you the pictures if you like
534792007603115364,Lots of inconveniences out of owners control but unfortunately made our experience pretty rough  Thankful for the good communication though 
567412730606448986,I am never staying with Zencity again they promote    hr check in so when I arrive after a snowstorm at  am they tell me I can t check in so I m forced to get a hotel but while on my way their I had a representative tell me I d be okay to check in even gave me the door code but the code didn t work on arrival the TV didn t work either so for the     days no TV and its also been broken into before back door is all busted up and you can see damage as if forcible entry was used I did not like the people running this I think companies taking over this app is the worst thing that has happened on here I am not staying with y all again don t promote    hr check in and then have one employee tell me I can check in then can t and need a hotel y all are so whack
568184390046866442,I would not recommend this place  The place was in disrepair and dirty  Maintenance was required so the shower would work  They stopped by while I was out of the unit  the host did not communicate well and proceeded to injure themselves while doing the repair  They tracked their blood all over unit including on the towels  They gave me the false impression that they would award my requested refund amount  equivalent to      and instead then changed the offer to a paltry amount equivalent to a night s clean fee    Do yourself a favor  stay somewhere else  If I could award zero stars I would   I arrived to a dirty  run down apartment with broken cabinets  dirty counters  and dirty towels  However I wanted to give the host the benefit of the doubt  so I told them they didn t need to come clean  just be aware   Then I noticed the shower wouldn t drain  I communicated to them that this had to be addressed ASAP  They told me that as it was the weekend  it would take two days to repair the shower  I replied that this was unacceptable and that they would need to resolve the issue that day  They then stopped replying to me    I left the unit for several hours  When I returned I noticed they had fixed the shower and injured themselves in the process  I knew because their blood was tracked all over the floor and the towels set out for my use    I then contacted the host again and demanded a discount based on my experience  They gave me the false impression that the refund amount I requested  approx      had been approved  For this reason I did not bother to follow up w AirBnB   Once I returned home from the trip I followed up with the host to inquire when my refund would be awarded  Only then was I told the host was considering IF my experience warranted a refund  Angry  I contacted AirBnB to be told because I had not contacted them sooner  it was outside their control  Even though I refrained from contacting AirBnB as the host had lied to me  implying initially the refund would be issued   The host now claims I am due a paltry refund of less than one night s clean fee  I highly doubt I will ever see even that pitiful sum  When I called AirBnB today  an agent informed me that someone else will have to call me back regarding processing the refund 
472436706948559776,I couldnt even get into the building of the place I was supposed to be staying and for over   hours I tried to get in finally having to leave because I was cold and tired  zencity was no help at all  at one point they actually told me just to try to find security or wait for someone to come out of the building to let me in which I did and was not let in by security or whoever was in the building that I asked so I finally left and had to go and pay for another place for my two day stay and now its in City wont even let me know anything about giving me a refund I would not recommend staying here  I dont understand how its been   days and nobody has even contacted me to let me know if or when Im  even getting my refund 
465873118853613150,This was the worst experience I have ever had while traveling  The Zencity canceled my reservation right at check in time   They did not have the curtesy to call me and let me know the reservation was canceled  They did it via that app  When I call the owner  I was give no other option   I will never stay at a Zencity apartment and I would be very worried if you select them the next time you travel

746395741,The place was dirty and reeked like cigarettes  It s carpeted and it was as if someone had been smoking in there for years  I complained to zen city and they told me to crack a window and spray febreze  I don t think I ve ever written a bad review in my life

748119216,I m five months pregnant and this place was advertised as smoke free  Definitely not true and the entire complex filled with smoke  People down the hall were smoking weed as well  My husband and my eyes were bloodshot and we had to leave not even twenty minutes after we checked in  DO NOT stay here if you prefer a smoke free environment  ALSO they have cameras IN the apartment  Make sure you read the fine print  You know what happened
516640817798806646,  Check in was terrible everything else was good
747364406,The shower was broken and they never came to fix it  I had to make a hotel reservation to shower and getting in touch with the host was difficult  The shower was never fixed and I still had to book a hotel to take a shower 
748678984,You can expect many delays with their customer service and the intercom system not working  If you dont want a headache I would chose a different building of theirs  I am sharing with you the message I sent to AIRBNB  I tried to resolve with you the issues that i expierenced during my stay on multiple conversations with your customer service and I am incredibly disappointed in your response  We have stayed with you many times and I would of hoped that you would do more to keep our business  But since you did not I had no choice but to reach out to AIRBNB and  the message I sent is below                                                                     I am contacting you about the above stay with Zencity from April  th to the   th  When I arrived they said there would be a fob to easily gain access into the building  There was no said fob and i had to use the code provided to enter the building every single time  using an intercom system  On saturday  one day after our stay  i messaged zencity twice about the fob and did not recieve a response  There were zero issues with the intercom system so i just went about my stay  On Monday the   th I tried to gain access into the building around      pm that night and I could not  I immediatly called Zencity and was on hold for a total of    minutes between two phone calls  All while im waiting in the foyer of this apartment building because i had to have a fob or key to even get into the lobby  For the next     HOURS i was stuck in the foyer speaking with zencity     mins into being in the foyer a woman came that was also staying with zencity and she was stuck with me  at the end of     HOURS there was a total of   of us that were staying with zencity that could not gain access into the apartments that they rented  While i was on the phone with the woman from customer service we tried everything  different codes  she tried calling management and they would not come  they said that they do not have a master fob in one of the lock boxes of this foyer bc they were getting new ones  I had no water  food  and no charger  my phone ended up on     so the customer service lady took down Kats  one of the other people stuck in the foyer with me  phone number so that she could call us back and she never called us back  At this time two more people joined us and they called zencity and basically the only solution was to BEG a resident to let us in and use there fob in the elevator  When i got back in my room zencity said that they could not fix the problem until at least   am in the morning     i got into my room a few minutes after   pm      so they said i had two choices        I could not leave the apartment until   am bc i would have zero access into the apartment due to the intercom system or    I could go get a hotel or a different AIRBNB  The guy on the phone said he could give me a refund of          and i basically told him that wasnt good enough because it was not going to make me whole  I had to take a     uber to my hotel that cost      for the remaining two nights of my stay  When we tried to get the refund the next morning through the message they sent it said it was expired and i could not collect  I called zencity and basically they pulled back the refund and she said that her manager would call me the following day  We are now at Thursday and no call from the manager and no partial refund  I called them again on friday and nothing  This morning i called them and he said he had to get managers approval but would be sending a refund today  We recieved a refund of      this afternoon  It wasnt even the      they first sent us   We paid zencity      for the stay and only recieved       I asked today to speak with a supervisor  i have never spoke with one as of yet even though the supervisor was suppose to call me the other day   I understand that things happen but i expected them to make us whole since it was their issue that the intercom system didnt work and it was the apartment buildings issue  I am also highly disappointed in their customer service  I would like you to please review our stay and let me know if there is anything you can do with zencity to get a more comparable refund  They did not provide us with a fob as stated and we could not get into the building for half of our stay and had to relocate and had to relocate to a hotel Customer service did not find a solution to there problem about their system not working with the intercom system  Also I was told a supervisore would call me back and never did and I was told a specific amount of a refund and i only got the partial amount that they said they would give 
748748757,Ended up canceling my stay the day of after the trouble I had and after seeing the room  Check in information was late  Bed had stains on the comforter and some blinds were broken  We also were told last minute the parking pass and parking fob were missing  thus we couldn t park there for the first night  This was a huge issue because we were from out of town and we didn t know any overnight parking areas  I understand things happen but we chose this Airbnb for its parking  We were supposed to be able to check in at  pm  I had to reach out and contact multiple people to at least get in by  pm There was a stain on the comforter right in the middle of the bed  The furniture was also a little beat up  Some breakage in the blinds Slow to respond  I had to call the help line a few times for immediate help 
750431271,Our stay in this apt was a nightmare  Stay away from ZenCity they are very clause to what can be easily defined a fraud  The apt is far away from what they advertise and even if they are promoting the Anti covid clean policy they have no idea on what is  clean   If you intend to go there this is what you should know      an house which is at the limits of safety  Screw and spikes all around which are putting at the risk the kid s safety    dirtiness allover the house and furniture fully dirty and stinky  food left inside the fridge and hairs allover   We had to clean up everything and sanitise all the furniture  Far away from the COVID policy    no blinders or curtains which are making the sleeping very difficult  I have requested several time no answers    linen and towels full dirty and full of dust  We had to go to laundry to get them clean  Most of them were used and not washed      services advertised  such as laundry machine  which are not present in the house but in a dirty and stinky basement    windows fully dirty and with sliding guides full  of dirtiness in such a way to prevent any closing creating a serious safety issue  I had to repair by myself  I have contacted ZENCITY several time to solve the issues and they haven t done a single step to resolve the issues  We were there just because close to the hospital and need to stay there but i strongly recommend all the people who want to stay in CWE to stay far from ZenCity host  also other families we met had the same problema in other apartments  Look at my pics to see the reality on how this people are managing their properties 
750976397,None I already told them everything   But the main issues were noisy all night   No towels for a four night stay and again no contact via phone   We left one day early  No phone contact in St  Louis   Only messaging notes No phone contact whatsoever   You left a note and waited 
750351756,Where do I begin   I guess by saying PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE  SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE    Ive never has a worser experience with a stay in my life  In a nutshell     There were NO lightbulbs in the bedside lamps so I had to use the closet light for lighting in the living room  They told me they would send maintenance the next day  so I stayed in my room the entire next day waiting and they never came    The microwave AND stove BOTH DID NOT WORK  so I was unable to cook    There was LOUD construction pretty much all day   am  pm   except on Saturday and Sunday  The noise was head pounding and woke me up everyday  I was also unable to use the room as a quiet place to study     WORST COMMUNICATION EVER  If you want them to answer the phone be prepared to wait  and also pray that they actually answer and not just hang up on you after a while  The messaging was a bit faster  but they did a good job of not responding to what I was asking of them  Some instances they would completely not respond at all  or say they would get back to me and I would never hear from them again  It was very aggravating working with them    I complained about all these things and do you know what all they actually resolved  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  They couldnt even compensate me for the things that didnt work  On the  rd day I actually reached out and said I would like to cancel to receive the     refund for the days that I stayed and they didnt even get back to me  so I felt like I had to stay so it wasnt just a gigantic waste of money   I still cannot believe this place would allow themselves to provide this poor of a service to guests smh  Please do not stay here  you will regret it  Will never be booking with you all again  You all should take a great deal of more pride in the business that youre offering to people  I was overcharged for what I went through and no one helped  Ive also told people to never book here and will continue to do so  Non working amenities  no light bulbs in the displayed bedside lamps  and the  view  was just a window with another building completely in front of it  They did not send my instructions prior to check in  This made moving in a long  drawn out  and a hassle  WORST COMMUNICATION EVER  If you want them to answer the phone be prepared to wait  and also pray that they actually answer and not just hang up on you after a while  The messaging was a bit faster  but they did a good job of not responding to what I was asking of them  Some instances they would completely not respond at all  or say they would get back to me and I would never hear from them again Other than the fake view  I liked the location overall Construction in the neighboring units all day everyday  the view was not quite the  view  and very important things in the room were not working nor were they fixed 
750973765,This was my worst Airbnb experience to date and Im furious with this company    Im in St Louis visiting family but was looking for an airbnb for two nights because I had a major presentation for work and wifi was spotty where I was staying  So I reached out to Zencity before booking to ensure that wifi could reliably support zoom calls  I was assured the average wifi speed at the unit was    MPBS  So I went ahead and booked  As soon as I checked in  I tested the wifi  which hovered between   MBPs and   MBPS  never even reaching above  MBPs  I immediately reached out to Zencicty via Airbnb  told them the situation  and underscored how I needed this fixed urgently  When they hadnt responded in several hours  I found the Zencity website and found a contact email  I sent that address an email and it immediately bounced back    the email address was no longer valid  They were not contcatable    I ended up leaving the unit and taking my dispute to Airbnb  Believe it or not  in the dispute with Airbnb  Zencity has refused to give me any of my money back  I still have not heard back from my original message  which included screenshots of the abysmal wifi speed     The rates are low for a reason  avoid this scammy company  Get your act together   this is no way to run a company I specifically asked about wifi before booking  I was booking this spot because I  NEEDED wifi for a very important meeting  and where I was staying didnt have wifi  I was told wifi would be   MPs  In reality it hovered between     MBPs  I tested the wifi right when I checked in  reached out to ask for help and never heard back   I also reachedd out via the contact email address on Zencitys website  The email address was defunct and my email bounced back  Then  in disputes with Airbnb  Zencity declined to give us any kind of refund  Long story short  this company is a fraud with no care for customer service  Hair on rug I  never  heard from Zencity after reporting the wifi issues  I also reached out via their contact email address on their website  The address was defunct and the email bounced back  I ultimately had to turn to Airbnb 
751629051,When I arrived at the location I followed the building entry instructions  to the letter literally speaking the codes out loud as told to do in the booking details  However  the doors would not unlock  Much to my surprise  there was another couple who had booked a Zencity listing on Airbnb who also could not get in    We had to wait in the entry until a tenant let us in the building as they exited  Now  even though we were now in the foyer of the building  we could not use the elevator as the access code at the door activated the sensor allowing us to go to our floor  but since the access code at the door didnt work  we could not get the elevators to function without a key fob  We had been told that the key fob was waiting for us upstairs so this would not be an issue moving forward  We tried calling Zencity from the phone number listed but couldnt get through  After    minutes of waiting  still unable to reach them a family arrived and graciously allowed us to ride up in the elevator to our floor  At that point another couple joined us who also was struggling with Zencity their code for the door did not work either   When we all got off at the same floor  we went to our rooms  only to discover that the key fobs were not in any of our apartments  I was finally able to reach them on the phone  but was told that the fobs had been lost previously and there was no way for us to get a new one  When I explained that that made it nearly impossible for us to enter or get upstairs due to our access codes not working  the woman on the phone insisted that the codes did in fact work  I kept her on the phone  went back downstairs  and with her still listening to me out loud tried all three codes  Not a single code for any of the rooms rented worked  I once again found myself locked out of the building unable to use the elevator  I had to wait for someone else to let me in and take me upstairs  Promptly at      p m  California time  where theyre located  the woman hung up on me despite the fact that we were still having a conversation  When I tried to call back at      PST  the phone rang and rang and rang  I attempted calling five times  They never picked up   At that point no one had responded to my pleas for support over the Airbnb messaging platform  Given that I was in town for work  and would be leaving the building frequently  the inability to safely access and use any of the entries made it such that it was impossible for me to stay  Before the woman unceremoniously hung up on me  I had requested to speak to management to get my money back because I would be checking out she informed me that was not possible    I had to go through Airbnb  who were incredibly helpful and handled the situation beautifully  in order to cancel the room and get my money back    By the time I had booked a new place and checked in  Zencity finally responded to my messages on the Airbnb platform  Reiterating they could not refund me and that they had called for maintenance to see if they could let me in the building  Their service is the worst I have ever experienced booking through Airbnb   I wish I could say I was exaggerating  but it is simply a terrible company to deal with  they say misery loves company  but there was nothing gratifying about knowing that four other individuals were dealing with the same issues  We all spoke with one another and confirmed that none of us were able to get help from them  and none of us received working access codes or fobs    If you are considering booking at this building  do not and I mean do not choose a Zencity listing  The building itself was lovely and all its tenants exceedingly helpful  but Zencity made it impossible to safely stay at the location 
752278410,Pictures do not match  the place  Was very unclean and we ended up canceling our reservation  The whole apartment was dirty  Dig said it hadn t been clean since      and it showed  Yellow stains in towels and sheets  Holes and markings on walls throughout Bathroom fixtures and flooring were dirty  Window shades in the first bedroom were broken  and a chair had a white stain on it  Overall we did not feel comfortable  I have many pictures I can share upon request  Pictures from the listing did not match what the actual apartment looked like  Parking was very confusing Dirty throughout the apartment  Holes and marking all over walls  Yellow marks on towels and bed sheets  Spider webs in corners  Card in apartment said it hadn t been clean since       two whole months  Dirty floors especially in bathroom  Shower walls and shower has were filthy  I took pictures so they ar available upon request  Late responses
751229697,We stayed   nights  We were told there would be a key fob once we got initial entry  Well there wasnt a fob and there was no access to laundry facility or anything else  Very disappointed  Wont use again  stuck outside for over    minutes Being stuck at front entrance multiple times with it being between    to over    minutes was very irritating  no access to laundry facilities also frustrating  Dont feel you advertise correctly with washer dryer mentioned in headline but there isnt   in apartment   with no key fob I didnt have access to other floors  So what was supposed to be a relaxing little weekend get away turned out to be   frustration after another  Very disappointed  
751946101,Arrive early enough that theres someone to help when you cant get in because of a bad code for the door or keyholder  Prepare to brush your teeth in the kitchen sink  Please check your own codes to make sure they work  Check in was the worst experience Ive ever had  And there is NO sink in the bathroom  Had to use kitchen sink and they did put a mirror over it but just not usable  I had to call twice as neither the door code would work  someone from the building saw me struggling with it and let me in when I explained  then the key code would not release the door to get the key  I did call host again and got a really nice lady who worked with me to get the key to get in  it was cold and rainy and was standing outside in it trying to resolve the issue  no sink in the bathroom 
753332546,hidden camera s in bathroom
751499635,We were trapped in our room  The key wasn t there to get into the building and the intercom to get into the building was broken  They gave us a refund but we were trapped in the room all evening and night  The only way to get into the building and elevator was to ask a resident of the apartment building to let us in  There was no one near enough to bring us a key  This place is a corporation and didn t have any way to accommodate us  The workers we talked to on the phone were nice but took    minutes to answer every time and couldn t help us 
752428271,We Were unable to enter property via intercom  there was no access fob in location  While likely just taken by last guest unintentionally  there was no communication or resolution  We had another stranger let us in the building hours later to collect our bags and ended up paying for a hotel  Cute place though  When we had to be let in and searched the entire place for the fob it started as funny and expected  With    hours and no resolution ever offered I had to get a hotel just so we could have someplace to stay we didn t need to rely on a stranger letting us in the building  Unable to use intercom to access  no fob for access in room after another person let me in  It took    hours for them to respond and I ended up paying for a hotel
755561807,The unit was not clean  The fridge had dried up juice at the bottom and sticky drippings on the floor  The ventilation system did not work also the ceiling had mold from what looked to be water damage  The bedroom door had a whole in it the bed was full of hair and the bedroom closet had dried gum in the wedges  The bathtub had not been clean it had dried up soap residue and hair all over it    guess the clean fee is money well spent  Not to mention this was a totally different unit than advertised in the photos when I booked  This stay was totally unacceptable  I sent in photos  messaged in dozens of times and was only offered for someone to come tidy up and on top of that I was still charged full price  This was a totally different unit from what I requested and booked and when I reached out to the host  I was told that it was when the whole decor  furniture and floorplan layout was different from the pictures  Upon arrival the stove had  crumbs on it  the fridge had red dried juice in the door shelves and at the bottom  their were also sticky drippings on the floor  The ceiling had mold from what looked to be water damage  There was a hole in the bedroom door  The bed was full of hair  as well as the bath tub and floor  The tub also had dried up soap residue  The bedroom closet door had dried gum in the wedges  Which makes me question why your company is charging a clean fee   The host replied but was not much help  The dirty unit and the host being unwilling to assist  also the A c unit didnt work
755580215,We weren t able to get in the place wasn t as clean as expected and while they were responsive on some issues they could use some adjustment on how you get in and get out Do you know the glitch which is two things number one place was not very clean it smelled funny seconds him we couldn t get in and out and that system you have for the door code does not work you need to come up with a different method for letting people in because that one that doesn t work
758558310,The Airbnb was filthy  The host had good customer service 
767289813,This property did not live up to our expectations  The lights did not work in the kitchen  TV only got limited stations  washer machine did not work and we were missing a towel and had to go purchase one   Even the carpet in the hallway was disgusting dirty  The whole experience was not good  Excellent location but that was it  This property has not met our expectations and lacked attention  Lights in kitchen did not work  were missing a towel and had to go buy one because after calling and seeking help yet no towel showed up and yes we have permission to enter the unit 
768339233,The pictures are of the unit  The unit has a very strong urine smell  The toilet is not safely secured to the wall or the floor so it rocks  The room was NOT clean  The location was great 
757080580,I stay in a lot of Airbnbs for work and travel and this was one if the worst  The carpet in one of the bedrooms was dirty and when we arrived the window was open  letting in the cold and rain  The latches on the window did not lock  and when I tried to report it  I was given no help  The place was minimal to the point of soullessness  Dont stay here  just get a hotel  Its not worth it for the price   I will never stay here again  It was a horrible place with dirty carpet and a broken and open window  The place had no amenities and was completely soulless  The carpets were dirty and the window was open   broken
423099369875169945,SO GROSS  This apartment had toe nail clippings all over the living room floor  black hair balls all over the bedroom and bathroom  dusty  nasty    The shower doesn t drain  YUCK   Also  it s directly on the Blue Line Train line SO LOUD right outside the living and bedroom window  Over     trains pass by everyday  Keeps you up at night  Finally  it s    stairs up to the apartment  on  th floor  no elevator    ZENCITY is not local and was completely unresponsive  We begged them to move us from the moment we arrived to the  toe nail stairs palace   Sent    photos of the GROSS APARTMENT  After   days of asking to move  they gave us     refund for the unclean apartment  Wait what  We had to get Airbnb involved and after   nights in this NASTY PLACE  they reluctantly moved us to a new apartment  BEWARE   ZENCITY did call us   times on the  th day at the apartment because the owner realtor wanted to come in during our stay  THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON THEY URGENTLY CALLED US  Not one time did they call to discuss the DISGUSTING floors  Not one time did they call to explain why their description states  single level home  no stairs   Every message from ZENCITY was from a different person  so you basically start the whole discussion over and over again    If your dream is to vacation above a Taco Bell in Wicker Park  then this is your spot Please make sure that apartment description is HONEST do not describe as  single level home  in amenities  there are    stairs  and make sure future guests know that the apartment is directly on the blue line train tracks  It s SO LOUD  And this apartment needs a DEEP CLEAN  The toe nail clippings and hair balls were SO GROSS  It needs a serious dusting and make sure that earrings and personal items from previous guests are removed  DISGUSTING
767290469,DO NOT BOOK HERE They failed to provide me with extra towels after multiple requests not to mention I was forced to stay here without any air conditioning in the heat  There was no one who came out and checked this issue nor tried to compensate me in any way  This stay was horrible and I was doing anything not to have to be stuck melting in this apartment  It was not thouroughly clean everywhere but enough for me to be able to still stay  The windows are broken  shower curtains inside out  and mix matched curtains just to name a few  The Zencity staff offered nothing but excuses during the whole stay  Good luck if you do decide to stay here  I am very i pleased after my stay of having to sleep in uncomfortable temperatures with no help or compensation  I will not be returning and I still deserve some of my money back for the lack of performance of air throughout the facility and my sweat and tears

420921739439209097,Horrible host  I requested an early check in  which had to be approved by the host before I was charged   They immediately accepted my booking but DID NOT provide early checkin  I m VERY disappointed with this travel experience    The space on the other hand  was in a great location and we were very happy with the actual place  Terrible check in  Requested a partial refund and you ignored it  You should be ashamed of accepting my early checkin request and not accommodating it  Tells me you are money grabbing 
573193842811049075,You have to park in a parking   a block away and the assigned parking spot is on the  rd floor of the parking garage  Location is really close to the arch  But their was long stands of hair everywhere from the living room to both bedrooms  The bed closest to the living room fell apart when I sat on it  When I reached out to the host nothing was done  The shower was dirty  There is only one tv in the unit located in the living room  Paint was chipping in living room wall  Check in was hectic  I would not stay again You have to park in a parking   a block away and the assigned parking spot is on the  rd floor of the parking garage  Location is really close to the arch  But their was long stands of hair everywhere from the living room to both bedrooms  The bed closest to the living room fell apart when I sat on it  When I reached out to the host nothing was done  The shower was dirty  There is only one tv in the unit located in the living room  Paint was chipping in living room wall  Check in was hectic  I would not stay again

766265472,The pictures looked extremely beautiful which is what attracted us to the place to begin with  The location seemed ok  but the building over all was nice with the convenience of the restaurant  gym  and rooftop patio all in one  My complaints came when you enter the apartment and there was a smell almost like take out curry  which made me nauseous every single day   the dishes were still dirty  like they had never been washed  and to the point that we were forced to eat out every night  even the cutting board still had food left on it  There were missing light bulbs  shower curtain was broken  the chairs were broken  my   year old actually had fallen backwards in the chair and nearly busted her head  the couch was ripped  don t expect to sit on it without laying another blanket down because you will itch  If you re looking for cable or to watch the news  forget about thst  They only had Netflix  internet went in and out so much that the tv was constantly on buffer  After we left  they actually tried to accuse us of smoking in the unit and not clean up after ourselves even tho we paid the clean fee  So if you are planning to stay  make sure you take pics of the place the first day  And the last  And keep it in better condition than they left it for you or else they will try to get you on for an extra         moral of the story  dont stay here

405891644285470630,This was our worst Airbnb experience we have ever had  Upon arrival to the apartment  it was apparent that this had not been clean whatsoever  beyond setting some clean towels out on the bed  There was mold in the toilet bowl and shower  Every surface was hairy  dusty  and or dirty   There was dirty linen in the closet  Although we appreciated that the host immediately responded to us with an offer to  retouch these spots   we had to demand that it happen immediately  not the next morning  Unfortunately  even after that was done  it was still unacceptable and disgusting  It was not in line with what the pictures in the listing or description depicted at all  This consumed an entire day of our trip   involving extensive communication with the host and ultimately Airbnb   and we ended up relocating to a hotel for the remainder of our stay in Lincoln Park 
489104248064977990,Not clean  Host was nonresponsive about many issues  including lack of water  heat and laundry 
769100837,Getting into the building was difficult due to the inaccurate codes we were given and the TV was left on by whomever was there last  which made it concerning that we were entering an already occupied apartment   Never saw the inside  we cancelled our stay  since I was traveling with small children and felt uncomfortable  Staff has been fairly communicative and helpful with a refund  Though it has been    business days and I still have yet to receive the full portion that  Also  it was inconvenient if you re traveling with a lot of luggage  there s several stairs you need to walk up in order to get to the entrance of the building  I was appreciative of the attentiveness of the staff once we had decided we weren t staying there related to the difficulties we had getting into the building due to the inaccurate codes and concerns that we were entering an already occupied apartment  since we heard voices on the other side of the door  I was also appreciative of the assurances of the full refund  However  it has now been more than    business days since I was guaranteed this from Zencity and I still have yet to receive it   I have only received         when I was told I would be getting back         total  I would really appreciate some follow up related to this issue  Thank you

763057038,I was unable to access the unit because the key code that was given to me didn t work the keypad was missing numbers   symbols so I couldn t gain access   The front deskman was very rude and invasive and even followed me up to the unit and quizzed me for several minutes  treating me as if i didnt belong   I will give Zen City this  they did answer me promptly after I had to call the number though   i was not giving a resolution and was left without accommodations for the night   I was told I get a call back within    minutes after waiting an hour after speaking I was told I d get a call back within    minutes after waiting an hour after speaking to someone from the hosts office and I didn t hear back anything until     the next morning   mind you I was depending on that stay for my accommodations so I guess they didn t care whether I had a place to stay or not since I didn t hear from them throughout the night  I m not sure who dropped the ball when the ball was dropped or how the ball was dropped but it was dropped so someone needs to contact me ASAP to get this rectified or do I need to call Airbnb directly I don t know please advise
543466511256363162,DO NOT STAY HERE  The unit was DISGUSTING upon my arrival  It was so GROSS  The city sidewalk is probably cleaner or an alley  I didnt even stay there  I had to stay at a friends house during my entire trip all while trying to conduct business meetings  via zoom  Im currently working with my bank and LAWYER to get my money back for services not rendered  Zen you have the pictures Ive sent regarding the matter    I  also have video evidence of the unit that backs up my claim  Do yourself a favor and do the right thing  REFUND my money  You need to make sure your clean staff is clean the unit after every guest  Shame on you for charging a clean fee when no clean is done  This is why I didnt stay at your bnb  It was disgusting  With covid cases on the rise  you should be on top of keeping things in and around the bnb sanitary  Instead of letting germs and filth fester

763469307,The location is very nice  The apartment was NO ZEN   the smoke detector battery beeped EVERY NIGHT for  weeks  Finally the battery died  The company stopped answering my emails and calls  and said  don t worry we have our top team working on in    It wasn t complex   I needed a    foot ladder to change the battery   The manager for the building wouldn t answer my requests and airB B actually sent me texts telling me to stop making noise   This was a work assignment at a hospital   I was forced to move the mattress to the floor in the living room   only feet away from the bedroom  but with the kitchen exhaust fan I slept some   The shower has ZERO water pressure  seriously around   inches and warm but not hot   The Only plus was the neighborhood   I give both Zencity and AirB B a big fat F  my simple request was never met   I spent close to          and got a      refund  SHAME on you AirB B  for allowing this company to rip off a nurse at a hospital  Shame on you Zencity for your lies and complete ineptitude     So heads up if you have a problem with your space from the many places this company owns   you will not be helped by them or AirB B   Your response to my Valid and HUGE request was pitiful and completely unnecessary  The simple request to stop a smoke detector from beeping  but I had to wait until the battery actually died in two weeks    I was forced to move the mattress to the floor in the living room    and all you did was give me      off  I should have received   weeks free  The water pressure in the shower was ZERO   I decided your actual offices must be in China or somewhere  as your email responses were grammar wise inaccurate  I give your company a complete F  a FAIL for response and sincerity

386189057133434982,I was unable to access the apartment so contacted Zencity from the lockbox area   They had a back up key but chose that moment to ask if the apartment had been clean   the person on the phone admitted that they KNEW the clean team had been unable to clean   They did not call to inform me that I would be walking into a place with dirty bed   bath lines  trash in the trash cans and dirty dishes   They suggested I clean and change the dirty bed linens with spares in the apartment   I was told the place would be clean by       the next morning  I booked a hotel for the night   Next day  again  not clean with no answer as to when it would be clean   Then they had the audacity to argue about a full refund as I had to book a hotel due to their inefficiency  Once I notified and spoke with Airbnb  I was refunded but only after   days and countless emails   Zencity should have contacted me beforehand as they knew the place was dirty     all in all the worst experience with a host  If you know you will not have a clean apartment unit  call the customer in advance   You knew the clean staff was unable to service the apartment   Secondly  if you have a service failure  which you did  for two days in your inability to clean the unit  dont make your  very upset customer have to spend time asking for a refund   I only received a positive result after contacting Airbnb to tell them about the abysmal service    Such a poor experience with Zencity   Never again

764310429,If you book this  make sure you read plenty of the reviews  and ask questions about the entry problems beforehand  First negative experience I have had with an airbnb and it was miserable  The key code that we were provided to get into the building did not work and my wife and I were stranded outside in the middle of the night trying to get a hold of someone from ZenCity with no success  When we finally got an answer from Zencity  the person we talked to was unable to help us  After   hours of trying   we finally ended up booking a hotel room which was overpriced and scarce due to the holiday weekend  The next day we were finally able to reach someone with zencity support who told us that we would be buzzed in when we arrived back to the building   When we arrived back at the building we called zencity to have a manager buzz us in  but they couldnt get ahold of the manager  After a bit a passing resident finally let us in  The unit was a good place to stay once we were finally in  and the location was very nice  but this was a terrible first night experience for us  We are already unhappy that the person we spoke with said we would not be reimbursed for the full expense of the emergency   am hotel option we had to go with  but we were told that at least some of what we paid would be coming back to us for the check in instructions stranding us and this still has not happened  We know this is not our error on the building entry  as there are tons of reviews having the same problem  Please do something to try and make this right  We have made airbnb aware of our issues as well and are waiting to hear back from support

766316192,The blinds in the apt were blinds were opaque blinds meant for living rooms or to accompany another blind that would actually block out sun  As the windows were huge it meant at night all the lights from city shone in and at crack of dawn sun came in  I did not sleep the time I stayed to the point I left early  Still trying to chase a refund  You didn t fix the blinds which made apt unlivable
767335770,I would not recommend renting from Zincity at all  We stayed at a zincity owned Airbnb in St  Louis   The apartment was much larger than the photos led us to be and it s in a great spot in the city  Security there is also amazing so we were very excited   We noticed the AC wasn t working at all so it was very hot in the room  We contacted zincity through the Airbnb chat section  They spent the first day trying to get me to check the thermostat  like I didn t know how to work one   Long story short we stayed there for   nights and it was hot the entire time  They never fixed the AC  They would try to get me to fix it but I told them I m not a AC repair guy  They suggested I just open the windows  which are   stories up and did not have protective screens  I told them that was too dangerous with my young kids    They never offered to relocate us  even though I asked numerous times   they did bring up portable ACs but they worked like box fans  so they wouldn t cool any rooms down at all   they only offered us our clean fee back for compensation  and they promised a supervisor would contact us a few days ago and he never did  I explained to zincity that I was a disabled combat veteran with a wife and four kids and being in this heat would make my disabilities worsen and my kids and wife uncomfortable but zincity still didn t resolve the issue at all   I will not be renting from them ever again  I understand stuff happens  such as an AC breaking  but not resolving a problem and taking care of your customers should always be number one and we weren t number one that week  We stayed here   nights and we noticed the AC wasn t working  It was very hot in the room  I am a disabled combat veteran and if I get to hit them I can get very sick  I also have four children and a wife who were with me  who were also very uncomfortable   I notified y all of this that night and it was never fixed  It would take hours to hear back from y all on chat and at first it was just y all trying to make sure I had the air on properly  No attempts to move us or offer us a refund occurred and I didn t have the money to just leave and get a new place  so we had to stay in a hot apartment for   days  making the evenings of our vacation miserable   Finally I was told portable AC units would be brought up but what we eventually got did absolutely nothing to cool the rooms   Y all told me a supervisor would contact me a few days ago and no one did  I asked numerous times to be relocated and was either ignored or was told ok y all would and no one got back with me   Y all gave me the     clean fee back but that in no way compensates us for   days of misery in the rooms   I asked for half my money back to compensate us and no one has got back with us   On top of all that y all also had left books inside the room  probably for decoration  and one of em was filled with male and female pornographic imagery  I have no Idea why this would be left in an apartment that rents to families  My kids could have looked through it I d I didn t happen to first    This was an absolute awful way we were treated and we are still waiting to hear back from y all to see if your going to make it right

571512367033458897,BOOK WITH CAUTION   I never write reviews but this time I had to  I ve used Airbnb for many years and this has to be the worse experience ever    We arrived at  pm to the building   Check in time   The doorman for the building was helpful but they do not work for Zencity  Other tenants live there  not Airbnb related units   Anyways  we arrive and we go up to the unit  This unit only opens with a digital keycode  There is no physical key  We spent     hours on call with customer support at Zencity trying to get in  All the codes they gave us did not work  We tried over     times probably  The building doorman  not associated with Zencity  offered to help but they also could not get in  Zencity customer support was so unhelpful and they were acting with no urgency  They kept asking us if we were entering the code right  it s not rocket science to enter a code   They never sent an actual person to help physically  Never  No one    After this  it s been   week and they still have not refunded me  I keep messaging them but they regurgitate the same message    we are waiting for manager approval    Huh   Why would this require   week   There s clear evidence between messages and phone calls that we were never able to get in     In short  terrible experience  Horrible customer support  I would never want to book with Zencity again  You ve been warned  Please focus on making sure the customer is first 
496650623550623781,I was never able to check into the unit  The call box number to use to gain entry was not working it seems based on other online reviews of Zen City  that this is a common issue with their short term rentals    They are pretty good in communicating their pre check in instructions  but post check in they are very spotty with communication and don t seem to be able to resolve anything  they only message to ask if anyone was able to help  isn t the person I m messaging supposed to  know this    Furthermore  when you try to contact them by phone it goes straight to voicemail with a voicemail box that is full    Not sure how often this happens  but I know I m not the only one  Your instructions for entry do not work  because the call box number     Zen City  does not work and just returns a busy signal  This was an ongoing issue  Also  your pre check in communication and instructions is great  but your ability to resolve and communicate after the check in time is very spotty 
389060554952174489,Horrible customer service  I run my own air bnb and would never treat my guests the way Zencity treated me  Zero help  no one lives in the city that works for this property management company so I was left to sit in the hallway till I left to go rented a hotel for the weekend  ZERO STARS Horrible customer service  I run my own air bnb and never would treat my guests the way you treated me  Zero help  I couldn t gain access into the the apartment and you  left me to sit there in the hallway  ZERO STARS
451414078125021740,The ac never worked they never came out to fix it or clean up the room it was a horrible experience When we got there bed was not made up clothes in washer it needed a full detail just sad the way they treat you after you spend your money
421661979857123673,This unit is NOT market ready  It needs a major deep clean  the unit was filthy when I arrived  The blind doesnt work and the outdoor furniture is in terr vel condition  Customer service from Zenicity terrible  renter beware  Your clean standards are below grade  Terrible maintenance of the unit  it was filthy 
389859598207304983,The lock to the room was broken when I tried to check in  and the door was wide open when I first got there  It was unsafe for me to stay so I wasted      on this Air BnB and had to get a hotel room downtown so I could have a place to stay where I wouldn t have to worry about someone breaking in 
547122672758233004,By far the worst Airbnb experience we ve had  all because of management  There were a plethora of shortcomings with the apartment during our   week stay  but the worst was when our thermostat stopped working and the heat turned off when it was    degrees outside  After multiple attempts to work with Zencity to rectify the situation  days of them lying and telling me that maintenance was  on their way    someone finally came on day    only after I contacted Airbnb directly  We literally had to turn on the oven to heat the unit in the middle of winter  I travel for work and use Airbnb monthly  and have never been so frustrated than I was staying here  Do yourself a favor and keep scrolling 
435476420588526967,Do not book with Zencity  They took my reservation and never sent me check in details  I waited around for   hours only to have to contact Airbnb for a refund  This occurred while sitting outside of the property 
390570685068544943,You get what you pay for  There are SO many reasons this place is significantly cheaper than places around St  Louis  The floor was so sticky it was hard to walk in the room and it reeked   When we got there  there was no fob for access to the building  and no one answering the calls for the access code  We never received a replacement fob which impacted our access into the building as well as the parking garage  This meant we had to pay for parking every    hours in a public lot  The floor was so sticky it was hard to walk in the room  We never received a fob which impacted our access into the building as well as the parking garage  This meant we had to pay for parking every    hours in a public lot 
386192505966786962,The check in process was awful  there was no intercom for us to enter the building like the check in instructions described  We had to wait for someone who lived there to let us in  Furthermore  they did not leave us a key for us to get in and out of the building and did not provide one until a day later so we could not leave the building  Also  was later contacted by the host that there was evidence of BEDBUGS in the couch so we needed to leave immediately  We tried many times to contact the host for these problems but would always be on hold  given an inconclusive answer  and no help  In the end we had to hound down a security guard to help us 
420343931689659561,Great location  and once we saw the place it would have been perfect  However they didn t send check in Information  once they finally did send Information it was wrong  Once we finally got ahold of them after   hours of going back and forth they still were not able to give us keys to access the building fully the way we needed to  We ended up cancelling after       hours of back and forth and had to last minute book a hotel instead  which wasn t the easiest to find for the same price  They were easy to work either after to get a full refund which we greatly appreciated but definitely not something I will deal with again nor will I ever book with Zencity  I have always loved Airbnb and this was my first terrible experience  but it definitely makes me hesitant about ever booking one in the future  Hopefully this place can figure it out because it really was a great location and would have been perfect for my family  but after reading reviews seems like there is something always wrong  Wish I Would have read Into that more 
381788702820404737,The smoke smell was unbearable  so we left early  As mentioned in a previous review  messages from Zencity were automated and did not acknowledge our complaints  The previous problems around check in and wifi code have not been addressed  so you will need to read the previous review to know how to open the door and connect to wifi  Additionally  the A C unit could not keep up  so the apartment never got under    degrees while we were there  I received no acknowledgement about the smoke smell being unbearable  You should not be renting this place on Airbnb until you remediate it 
569636472581587551,Customer service is the worst  Once I pay an extra night they did not generate a new code for me  so once I went to eat  they kicked me out from the Aparment and then I had to be outside for   hours while it was snowing waiting for a new access code   There is not a phone number and if you chat they take   hour to answer back  It is not a good idea to stay here  Customer service is the worst  Once I pay an extra night they did not generate a new code for me  so once I went to eat  they kicked me out from the Aparment and then I had to be outside for   hours while it was snowing waiting for a new access code 
465969887169699503,To start off with the pros the location is close to lakeshore restaurants and stores  Getting in the rental was easy             The cons we finally made it through the two front doors and once we got to the Airbnb the room was completely dirty  Bed wasn t made garbage in the kitchen  tub had a bunch of dirty towels sitting in it  Ants were on the floor and I had to sweep to keep them away and it is a basement studio  Called zen and they said someone would come and clean the room and for us to come back in an hour after we had to wait until  pm and our flight got in at   am and was told no early check in and to have to wait another hour was a complete inconvenience on top of the room being dirty  Other than the location I would not recommend staying here  you would be better off paying for a hotel room  You told me I would be given a refund of   night and a clean fee and I haven t received neither yet  I called and messaged you and there was no answer  I just called and the phone just keep ringing  I will be taking this further if a refund is not given back as we discussed 
762560665,This property was filthy  Stains on the couch and bedding  dirt grime on all of the walls as well as in the tub shower  dirty appliances  debris on the floors  etc  I left immediately  booked a hotel  and am making other arrangements for my stay in Chicago  I travel for work  staying in Airbnbs for    months out of the year and will never book with zencity again  as they clearly do not manage or maintain their properties well 
451408866695550470,THE GOOD  BAD AND UGLY GOOD   AC  washer and dryer worked well   Unit was well supplied with paper products   Customer service rep  Andrea and maintenance man  Jeremiah were very good in responding to problems  See below  BAD   Property was very dirty  kitchen floor and AC vent were black with dirt   smudges on the walls  drapes were falling off the wall and blind were missing slats and draw strings resulting lack of privacy and security issues  repair took two weeks   Sections of flooring in the hallway were missing which could cause a stumble and fall  UGLY   We had a    day pre paid lease and were illegally locked of our unit for more than    hours   We had to go to a hotel without fresh clothing  sundries and medications  After returning to the apartment we could not leave the unit because the access key pad had be improperly installed and would not lock    Another call to have something fixed 
539112855103479472,NOT a Zen experience  ZenCity does not comply with the Chicago Heat Ordinance which require landlords to keep daytime temps a minimum of    degrees  As a result when I arrived the pipes were frozen   it was in the single digits during my trip  No water in the apartment until the middle of the next day   And I was unable to stay warm in the apartment  I was denied my request to control the temperature  they control the Nest thermostat  And my requests to speak with a manager went unfulfilled   I do not recommend staying here  Need to align your policies with the City of Chicago Heating Ordinance  Your lack of compliance with the law made my trip miserable 
563734922431799404,Host was not honest about the Airbnb  They knew the building would not have power during my stay before I booked the room and did not share that  When the power went out and I tried to contact them they were extremely slow response and were not honest about the problem  Refusing any refund but offered     off my next stay with them when I made it clear I will not be using there company ever again  Host was not honest about the Airbnb  They knew the building would not have power during my stay before I booked the room and did not share that  When the power went out and I tried to contact them they were extremely slow response and were not honest about the problem  Refusing any refund but offered     off my next stay with them when I made it clear I will not be using there company ever again 
531182884843389393,We picked this unit thinking it would be nice and in a nice area  the area was not bad  However  the unit it s self was run down  You could tell they tried to give  luxury  upgrades to the unit  We arrived on       the unit was not clean pass first glance looking  In fact the last time the unit had been clean was       and the property manager forgot to wipe it fully off the wifi board when he did the walk through  The sad part is he knew the unit wasn t clean and tried to comment that he was checking behind the cleaners  Not only was the unit not clean there was bugs flying around in the bathroom and on the ceiling in the bathroom  the walls in the unit are thin so the neighbors walking and continuously barking dog are heard all night long  Literally the dog was barking from the time we arrived till the time we left  The windows also need to be resealed as they let in quite the dead as one on us now has a cold  We would turn the heat on and the rest of the unit would be warm but the bedroom freezing  To top that off on our second day we came back to the unit only to be staring at an eviction notice from the building owner stating they were evicting zencity and all occupants in the zencity unit from the building  This was the Worst Airbnb experience the host was not communicative at all and we were very uncomfortable leaving our things there upon receiving the eviction notice  We dealt with an eviction notice and an unclean unit  The floors were gross  there were bugs flying around in and on the ceiling of the shower and the window seals let in a bunch of cold air making one of us get a cold  The walls are super thin in the unit and we constantly heard noice from those above us  The neighbors dog barks a majority of the day 
754800731,We were disappointed that the apartment was not as clean as we had expected  The front bedroom bed sheets had not been changed  There was no top sheet  creases that looked like someone had just slept on them and there was hair on the pillow case  I was going to put fresh sheets on the bed  but the ones I found in the little freestanding bedroom cabinet were in a ball on the shelf and also had hair on them  The bathroom door was filthy  and there was toothpaste on the wall   The entry to the building was filthy as well  I wouldnt rent this airbnb again  They dont post photos of the tiny bathroom  most likely because they couldnt get a decent angle for the camera lense due to the size  It wasnt as clean as I would have liked  not terrible  but definitely not as clean as a bathroom should be  The grout is filthy  the door had splash marks of some kind down it  there was toothpaste on the wall  and the paint around mirror that acts as a door of the  medicine cabinet   where the extra shampoo is kept  is completely worn off where you open it  It wouldnt take much to touch up the paint every once in awhile to make it more presentable  Its obvious the owners have no pride in the place  It was easy to get the key out of the lock box that is attached to the door of the building  That being said  the tiny entry to the building was not only filthy  it was full of old mailers and boxes  Its actually a hazard  If I could post the pictures of the tiny entry and the narrow  dirty staircase that runs at an angle  I would  The bedroom that looks over Belmont was not clean before we arrived  There was no top sheet and there was hair in the bed and on one of the pillow cases  There were creases on the fitted sheet which looked like a sheet after someone has slept on them   I looked under the fitted sheet at the mattress pad and it had disgusting stains  I found extra sheets in the little freestanding closet  but they were dirty as well  It truly was disgusting  Needless to say we didnt use that bed  When I complained to Zencity regarding the dirty sheets and mouse poop in the kitchen cabinet  they kindly offered a  touch up   However  I truly didnt want one of their cleaners back in the unit when we were not there  and since we were not going to use the dirty bedroom  or any of the kitchen amenities  we decided it best to turn down their offer of sending someone in to clean   They did offer a refund of our clean fee  which we accepted   That was very generous of them  Location is good  and street parking was easy and plentiful  but noisy at night due to it being directly on Belmont 
754720654,Worst experience traveling ever with Zencity   Never going to use Air BnB again   st time last time  Never will I use Air BnB again  Chicago is a dump 
411535612816934968,horrible  dont do it  horrible customer service
411504373879130889,ok place
390483435013961892,Check in directions were not accurate   Place was dirty and worn   Smelled terrible in the entry way  Bed linens has stains on them  microwave was dirty and the floor was dirty  Couch is cheap and uncomfortable  No pillow protectors  so gross  My son didn t stay with us for it was gross and we left unsafe    Overall  the listing description and pictures do not reflect what you really get   Don t believe the listing  I contacted the company and they do not care about making us feel better about our experience    Hostile neighbors left us feeling unsafe    THIS PLACE IS A BIG NO  I have shared our experience and you don t care
752801382,This is above a bar and VERY loud   Do NOT book this place unless you are cool with no sleep till well after  am   The host never responded and only gave me back    bucks when I canceled my reservation after the first sleepless night  I had booked for   nights    It was awful   And  there was a nasty hair folded into my towel   AWFUL experience   It is above the bar and very loud I had a huge hair in my bath towel Host never responded when I complained about the noise It is above a Bar It was above a bar and I had paid for   days and only got    bucks back after cancelling when I had no sleep the first night
391309981900164694,Make sure key work before
749232037,the property was not clean at all  Zencity offered me an immediate refund  Outside of being disappointed with the room  and having to find a new place same day  I received good service from Zencity  Absolutely filthy  Didn t match the pictures online at all  The art on the wall in the main online picture isn t even there in real life  I don t understand how that was clean  and how someone is expected to comfortably stay there  Should drop the price to     bucks a night 
412226036693028039,Just be prepared to haul your luggage a long distance  possibly up   flights of stairs  The elevators to the garage  the garage your advised to park in  were broken and had been for months according to staff  The roof top that is advertised is for  residents  only not Airbnb guests  All in all this was a disappointment  Not recommended for older individuals or anyone with knee issues 
424735266569927297,Though the location of this unit is perfect and had potential to be a wonderful stay the unit was not clean and we needed to move to a hotel   Immediately upon entering the unit  we were hit by a strong cigarette smell  After walking around in     degree weather waiting for check  in we needed to shower  One of us hopped in the shower and we soon found out they there were no towels in the unit  Not even a hand towel  The  shower was filthy and was covered in the last guest s purple shampoo  The purple shampoo was in the tub and the shower curtain  The shower curtain was covered in mold and extremely dirty   We needed to dry our selves off with back up sheets which were in a closet that unfortunately also had stains    Gross   In between the sink vanity and the cabinet there is black mold which is a health hazard   The bedsheets had hair on them and appeared as though they had not been washed  The carpet was covered in crumbs  and the floors were covered with dust and debris in some sections    The couch pillows were stained   The kicker is that there was a  last clean  sticker by the wifi code  The date on it was over   weeks before our stay   Though the bed was made and the trash had been taken out it was very clear that the unit had not been thoroughly clean in between guests  Which is shocking as it is listed as  enhanced clean    We immediately tried to get in touch with the host and they did not get back to us for hours  until air bnb cancelled our booking   and processed a refund   When that happened  they immediately contacted us   What was extremely frustrating was that all of the other comparable units in the area had been booked and we were unable to relocate with another unit in the central west end with a kitchen or access to a washer dryer  We wound up getting the very last room at a hotel in the area  Needless to say  we reshowered    On a positive note  the doorman was fantastic  Our plane landed at    and they watched our bags for us until check in  The building staff were extremely lovely as well    Air Bnb also support was easy to work with and made it clear from the beginning that we were protected in this situation   I would avoid booking with this company 
431819302523250702,Just didn t meet my standards  Property is old and the clean crew sucks  I got to one unit it was dirty  Communication suck and once I got in touch with somebody I was told I couldn t get a refund so they moved to another unit in a different building cleaner but old and the shower curtain was nasty dirty
438333860454118131,BEWARE  READ AND BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS      I have rented many Airbnb s  This is by far the worst experience I have had  I wished I believed the negative reviews and steered clear   to note for everyone  the host ZenCity is a large property management company that specializes in marketing and AirBnB and drives their costs down by offering terrible management services   here are the Key issues I ran into  They are all common themes amongst reviews     the digital locks malfunction OFTEN  we were locked out of the property for an entire evening  We called the host  a call center in the Philippines is who answers  and we were on the phone with them for   hours  in the rain  with my   and    year old daughters  to argue with them about the problem and they never sent anyone to help us  We gave up and got a hotel for the night   We made videos and provided to the host on how their new wifi   digital only locks were not accepting input     service is terrible  if you have an emergency  liked a family of   with young kids being locked out for the entire night due to a wifi lock not working   there is no actual owner   people available  ZenCity  the host  is a large property manager and you only talk to call center representatives in the Philippines   When we eventually had to get a hotel for the night  the host even argued   declined to reimburse us for the hotel  Luckily Airbnb is handling this for us      the property is filthy  Crumbs on counter tops  sticky floors and hand railings  hair on rugs  stains on towels etc  even trash left on the rooftop patio    the property is run down  The clothes dryer doesn t work  the toilets run  the outdoor furniture is moldy  literally     the property stinks  like cigarette smoke and dust   All in all  it is house is a run down dump with worn out trendy furniture that is run by a large company who don t really care about the property  their service  or you   It s better suited as a party house for a beer pong match and not a place any family  especially with younger children should consider   And to the host  shame on you  Your business model puts the end consumer dead last  We were locked out ALL NIGHT because of malfunctioning digital locks and you had no contingency plan for emergencies  What if one of my children had medication  What if we had an infant and needed formula  diapers etc   It disgusts me how little you think about the peoples lives who rent your homes  This is a terrible business model offering fully outsourced services with no real ownership  and one of the reasons AirBnb has a bad name amongst homeowners  You should be thrown off this platform  As discussed  the property was very dirty  the clothes dryer did not work  and the lock malfunctioned and there was no physical key available   you were unable to have anyone help us while locked out
394927800831001657,We spent an hour trying to enter the apartment because the lock was broken  so we just sat outside on hold with all of our luggage after traveling in July  then when we finally got inside  they hasn t clean from the last guests
745552250,if it wasnt for how dirty the place was    it was a close location to university chicago medical center and walking distance to the lake    to bad the place was filthy bed was full of hair  fridge was gross  definitely not covid    clean
745466347,Nice places but very poor communication  They have no thermostat so hopefully they get this worked out  I would love a return phone call  And some customer service to deal with these issues   I ve been trying to reach someone about my stay for   days  Supposedly booked two studios bc they didn t have anything to sleep two people   Even was told they couldn t offer one w a couch  One place ended up being a full apartment w couch and bedroom and could have slept    Also had no thermostat in hmeither room and the place was insanely hot over a warm Chicago weekend  Also no lights in master bedroom  Key pad code did not work  Got a return call hours later w a new code Absolutely impossible to reach  Miscommunication about the rooms  Very unhappy  Still have yet to get a return phone call  I paid for two rooms when I didn t need to  Was told both were studios and one was a full apartment that could have accommodated   people
745074287,The condo was grossly misrepresented  The condo was not professionally clean  carpet was not vacuumed and kitchen floors were not mopped   stove and vent for the stove was dorty  dead bugs on the floor  bug trap with a lot of dead bugs inside of it  horrible smell of smoke and other orders  extra pillow had blood stains  stains on comforter  urine stains on the bed skirt that looked like a small animal urinated on it  and more  I have pics and video to prove  The claims show up much better in the video  The location was great but the place was too nasty to stay  It was my first airbnb stay and it was horrible  Left and stayed at a Marriott hotel instead  The location was grossly misrepresented  I have video evidence to prove and I want to share with you  Could you please provide an email so I can do so 
744371708,I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone  The fob wasnt given to me  I was given the wrong access code to enter the building  I had to stand outside for a while to wait for someone to enter  exit the building so I can get in  I couldnt use the gym because I didnt have the fob   The shower was disgusting  The water wasnt going down the drain and it kept getting higher and higher  I contacted the host and they wanted maintenance to come fix it but I didnt sign up for This  The sheets were dirty with black hair on them     My hair isnt black        stars  Still waiting for my refund I would like a refund The photos are a little different I didnt get the key  I was locked outside and had to wait for someone to enter exit the building for me to enter  The bed was dirty with black hair on the sheets  The water in the shower wouldnt go down 
392214637291954530,The unit was absolutely filthy  When we checked in there was hair in the shower  a filthy stove  shockingly dirty glasses  dish ware and cutlery  dusty vents  and a pungent smell of cat litter  There is also a neighbor who smokes on the deck and you can smell the cigarette smoke in the kitchen  The entrance foyer is filthy as well    We reported the issues to Zencity but they were not very helpful in resolving these issues  When we decided to cancel the reservation and request a refund  Zencity was not helpful at all and we have taken the matter up with Airbnb    Avoid this place and the management company    Do not book with Zencity  They will take your money and not refund you  The unit was absolutely filthy  The stove had grease marks  the was hair in the shower and on the sink  the neighbors smoke and the smell infiltrates into the unit  the carpets were stained  the walls were stained  the building entrance was filthy  I wouldnt recommend the unit or Zencity to any one 
434750213198412092,So I really thought this was going to be a great stay  and if Zencity has responded to me I think it would have been  Starting with check in  they should tell you to park out front with your hazards on while you get the key and ask for a cart to load your things  I never figured out how to use the parking pass  so every time I went in the garage I used the call button and told them I didn t understand  and the garage let me out  Check out is also confusing  so I would again park out front with your hazards    Next  the smell  I failed to read other reviews and only looked at the star rating when I booked  but this place smells like rotten egg  I m not sure if it s a gas leak or just smells like that  but looking at other reviews  it s a persistent problem  That alone really didn t bother me  after a few minutes you get used to it  and the place is so nice  It looks super clean  has a cute view  nice people in the halls  and the location is just amazing    But  then I went to bed  And as soon as I laid down  it smelled like pee  So of course I finally message Zencity  They said they would send some one in to check if I allowed  I agreed if they let me know when because I have my dog with me  and they didn t reply for over    hours  I told them that was ridiculous  so they never responded and never came to look at it  I stayed here for   nights in a pee bed and never heard back from them OR AIRBNB    If they had come and made things right I really wouldn t care or be writing this review  because mistakes happen  But the lack of care on there part and on Airbnb s blows my mind  So yeah  I would highly advise not staying with Zencity  It s confusing  gross  and they won t respond to your problems 
410154686534955315,This host is VERY unprofessional    This place was very dirty  no clean service what so ever  I sent in pictures  spoke with   different people  they emailed and said they started a refund but ever contacted me or Airbnb  it has been weeks   I have yet to receive a refund  I called Airbnb and they told me that this host didn t even create a case to be refund  I have NEVER left a review on anything before that s how horrible my experience has been  Cleaning service horrible
394934424250866490,I would not recommend renting this property  It was not clean  The tub and sink in the bathroom were slow draining   There was no coffee pot and very sparse kitchen utensils  It was a very nice large space but very poorly maintained  There was a large living room and dining room but no dining room furniture  Our check in process was very disconcerting  There was no key in the primary box and no key in the back up box  The key finally found was in the clean service box  This whole process took     hours  The check in process was very difficult  You have that info in your records  The unit was not clean  The bathroom sink and tub were slow draining  There was no coffee pot in the kitchen and there were very sparse other kitchen utensils  no hot pads and more  The dining room had a very small cafe table and   very small chairs  There was no dining room furniture  The most worrisome thing however was the condition of the door lock  It was a dead bolt but the space the dead bolt went into was larger than the bolt  The bolt did lock deeper into the door but the door was very loose and we believe it could have been kicked in easily 
741312577,This place was filthy   Whoever clean it prior to our arrive did an awful job  Had to demand a refund from Airbnb  because the owners stopped answering my calls after I requested a refund  which lead to several other issues   There is only one tv in the entire apartment  The bedrooms were small and crammed   Parking was horrible   Not the best location  Dogs were barking non stop 
397045690415138179,The only real issue here is the lack of free parking but if youre willing to pay a few bucks a day or not needing to park most of the day  its a decent walkable area to be in  Unit itself was fine as a place to sleep  Better off just getting a hotel probably The lack of free parking should have been highlighted more up front in my opinion and the front door code for the building didnt always work   The space was fine generally  Mostly just issues with parking and getting in a few times along with a  broken dryer
396338559509505990,Not accommodating I know you are a big company and it would have been really appreciated had you helped us out with our incident and at least considered a partial refund 
410005905448481302,Arrived and the unit had not been clean after previous guests  It threw a massive wrench in our vacation plans as they would not respond for hours  We had to get a last minute hotel  cancel our reservation and seek a refund through Airbnb because they just left me hanging for over five hours saying they were  looking into it     Im sure the experience would have been smooth if the place was clean  And it probably is     of the time  But in a pinch  they are not on site and their support communication was absolutely horrible 
425264745742039598,Worse air bnb ever  Location was horrible  customer service was even worse  Could not talk to anyone for a while  room and gate key fob was lost  Will never come back again    Worse customer service ever  
485526235041436828,This was my first AirBNB experience  I was really unsatisfied with the service  The code they gave me to get in the building did not work  The second one did  That issue was solved fairly quickly  The second day the sink in the kitchen backed up from the drain  I didnt even use the sink  Nasty water was spilling all over the floor  I called them and maintenance came the next day but did nothing to fix it while I was staying there  He said he did not have the correct tools and they would be sending someone else  I never saw them  The last night of my stay the keypad on my door to the room stopped working  This was the real mess of this trip  First  I had to walk to a convenience store to buy a  V battery to try and get it to work in case the batteries were low  This was after midnight  so it was tough to find one open  My phone was running low because I had no access to my charger in the room  The guy on the phone had me download an app to try and work the keypad over Blue Tooth  This did not work either   He told me to go down to the front desk and ask for a key  but there is no front desk  After an hour and a half of trying to get in  I asked it there was anyone he could call that had a key to the second door in the unit that just had a key lock  I guess there wasnt because no one ever came  He said he would try and contact someone but never did  Four hours later he called to see if I had gotten in  I felt like he just left me with no room  bathroom  or my belongings  I would not stay at another ZenCity location  Here are a few suggestions  On check in  make sure you send the correct Front Door code  This one did not take too long to fix  so that was good  Two  make sure maintenance is kept up on in the apartment  The kitchen sink backed up through the drain twice while I was there  Maintenance came but did nothing about it during my stay  Nasty water was pouring all over the floor with no way to stop it  Maybe if you provided an emergency maintenance number or something  Third  make sure the door key pad works to the room  I saw a couple of reviews that said they had an issue and the person I called for my issue also mentioned that it had happened  If it is already a known issue  why hasnt this been fixed  I got back from a concert and the door would not open  The person I called did try to help me at first  We tried downloading an app for Blutooth access and I had to walk a mile to a store to buy a battery to try to make the pad work  Both did not work  The person I called eventually stopped taking my calls for hours and left me waiting in the lobby without my things  a room to stay in  or a bathroom  He was supposed to be trying to contact someone who could come with a key but he did not  My phone was running out of battery because my charger was in the apartment  If that had happed  I dont know what I would have done   I was eventually able to get the door open after physically moving the pad on the door   Four hours later he called me back and asked if I had gotten in  I said I finally did but no one ever came to help  I had to be at the train station early to come back home and if I had waited on him I would not have made it  I did not get to use my last night in the room because of this mess 
394881744221459174,Check in was listed for  am  When I arrived at      am was told I couldnt check in until  pm  Wasted my day waiting around in a thunderstorm  Customer support was useless didnt have the ability to check me in or fix any problems its all automated  Others had the same issue  Stay somewhere else avoid Zencity properties  booking was listed for  am check in I showed up at      am was told couldnt check in until  pm  Waited   hours when Zencity called me back said I could check in it didnt work they finally canceled the reservation after I wasted my day hanging out in a thunderstorm  I will never use a Zencity property again  Their support staff is useless  They didnt have the ability or knowledge to fix the problem 
423904127806481655,Disappointing  To start with  their  parking options  are expensive  Finding the key was like something out of an Indiana Jones movie  Once we finally figured out how to even get in  the apartment is lack luster  The bedrooms have no TV  the living room has a small TV  WiFi is spotty  the shower faucet in the small room was nearly falling out of the wall  the light switch in that same small room was cracked  the chair in the living room had a broken leg    To finish off my stay  the host accused myself and my guest  both    year old sober men  off  peeing the bed  and claimed after our stay a  noise sensor  was missing  It was like they put lipstick on a pig  Do not recommend 
412224857651781824,Buyer beware   My airbnb had no hotwater and I had no response from ZenCity  There was never any hot water and no response from ZenCity on the issue 
440600198977244229,This is my first and only bad review I ve written on Airbnb   The AC did not work  which on its own isn t the end of the world  What happened next though is unacceptable   I called on night   and was told someone would be out the next morning  They also said they would call me with updates  Neither happened   Called on night    exact same conversation on the phone  They said they would call me back with updates and that someone would be out that afternoon  No call  and no one came   Same thing the third night     I m pretty sure every person I spoke to was informed not to call me back since it was   different people and they all seemed sincere  so very likely the owner manager told them to leave me hanging for whatever reason   It was pushing    degrees outside and I was sweating the entire stay    A part of traveling is feel safe and secure and I don t think these owners take their tenants security seriously  If you say you are going to call someone back  then call them back   You ignored me on   occasions
395429878561905968,They double booked and never notified about it  I couldn t get inside the apt bucause somebody else was in there already They double booked the apartment and i had to find out while trying to open the door while the other renters were in the property
440589354111739794,Would not recommend
441273632819315003,Inaccurate listing  Unclean shower  No pool  No parking  No front staff   All floors had the trash overflowing  Apartment looked nothing like the pictures  Construction was going on in the neighboring apartments and it felt as off they were hammering for    hours of the day  I ve stayed in about    Airbnb s in my life  friends or mine  and this was by far the worst I have had  No thank you
399214111520463670,i will never stay with Zencity again 
392753545543977280,Cockroaches  filthy stained couch  wobbly furniture  shower in first floor leaks  gnats insects were present daily in the basement bathroom  code was changed twice by Zencity without notice to me and I got locked out twice   One of the two washing machines was  not operational and both dryers were out of order during my one week stay   I reported everything to Zencity and they offered me a partial refund of the clean fee for all my troubles  I paid over        for one week    Ridiculous and worst experience Ive ever had with an AirBNB rental   In the grand scheme of things  the fact that there is no coffeemaker is not a huge deal  but pointing it out in case  any of you consider that an important part of a rental   It was more of an annoyance that there wasnt a coffee maker given all my family and I dealt with  but some people are serious about their coffee so throwing this in for good measure   Other than the location of this rental  this was really the worst apartment rental ever  and I never give bad reviews  I just dont return to products or services that Ive not been happy with but this one seriously needed to be reported   Please review the many messages I sent during my stay regarding all the issues I reported   getting locked out because the code was changed more than once without telling me  cockroaches in the apartment that I reported and no one sent to address until the day before my departure  broken  wobbly  filthy furniture  etc   Its all in my messages and in the refund request I submitted along with a detailed explanation of what I reported during my stay 
464963391778048606,I could not gain door buzzer access to the apartment building to even check in to my Airbnb this company rented out  They then told me They refunded my money  But it s currently being investigated by the Airbnb resolution center as a scam  I have course have yet to see my       I have yet to get the refund for the room that I could not gain access to  The resolution center with Airbnb is currently investigating it as a scam 
428909576474329750,There as no hot water in the shower and they did not send anyone to check until mid afternoon the day before I checked out  There was someone else s hair smeared on the side of the shower  I had to call them to get the door passwords because they didn t email me anything in a conformation  Literally a borderline scam  Don t go here
454389446662874766,I would not stay with zen city if given another choice  As other reviewers noted  it s impossible to get into the building without asking for help from a resident  When we finally made it to the unit  there was no fob  We cancelled the stay at that point since we couldn t leave and reenter the building or unit easily  The check In system makes it impossible to have a relaxing stay 
396389720826695251,Unless they fix what they are saying  Don t trust this company  Place was dirty  no pillow cases  just not a place or company I would use again      Coming from someone who was born in       raised in Hyde Park  Father a huge professor head of the foreign language department at U High laboratory schools  I have the email from zen city showing I was to leave the keys on the table  Since there were only Two tables in the entire  what use to be a one bedroom turned two  Normal logic would say put keys on coffee table  Which was what we did  Until that is resolved  I will not give a good  or bad review 
400659522955631200,Shower drain did not work as well as toilet flushing  Brought it up with the owner and they ignored me  Also window AC couldn t keep up with the heat

400669361732048761,N A I m writing to you regarding our recent visit to your property at     W Belmont on          Although the room was clean and as expected upon arrival  we were very quickly disappointed and upset for the remainder of our stay  We ran into a huge issue when we realized that the AC was broken  No matter what approach we took to turn it on  it remained completely shut off  This made our nights virtually unbearable  It was in the   s in Chicago and we had to try and sleep in an     degree room throughout the evening  Opening windows only made the problem worse as it didn t cool anything down and the train noises woke us up just as we were able to fall asleep    I reached out to your company to come and check out the AC unit on     in preparation for our second night  I received a response asking if someone was allowed to come in and take a look  I responded that we d be out of the room for most of the day and we re expecting someone to come take a look while we were out  However  after returning home we realized no one had been in the room and it was just as we left it  AC unit still broken   We were most upset that we were told someone would come fix the issue and no one did    This situation is unacceptable and we are planning to write about our experiences in an online review  We would consider not posting anything if you can give us some sort of refund for our stay  It s not fair for us to pay      for a room where we were only able to sleep   hours each night at the properties expense    I look forward to hearing back 
423945244996413243,Not the best check in procedure and they were not able to find a solution  It took them over   hrs to try and get us in  We were never able to check in because the keys were not in the location we were told  It took them over   hrs to figure out a solution and by then we had already made arrangements to stay elsewhere 
412495207845666813,Fuck this place they will still your money  They will purposely leave you in pending status for review  the minute you book another airbnb   pay for it  they will ignore your withdraw or cancellation request for booking   charge your account then send you checkin instructions   the address to the property  Key word the host here will do this directly after you cancel withdraw your booking request also   I believe airbnb helps them because there waz no withdrawal option for this host but I was able to withdraw with no problem with another host who took to long to respond    leaving me with no other option but the cancellation request   I sent a message because I thought it was odd that the withdraw request was not available   note this was all done before any acceptance  address of property   check  in information  They still took my money told me I dont get a dime back  so I paid      for two airbnb   only stayed in one of them for two days  I could have stayed home   paid my mortgage for that amount  my husband   I just had left his step dads funeral   we were sad   flustered   decided to get a airbnb for a couple of nights because we didnt want to bring that energy home to our kids  this host will fuck you with no vaselune   airbnb will help them In order to leave a review I had to enter atleast   star bur this airbnb did not deserve that  I never stayed at this property didnt go nowhere near it  They left me in pending approval status   waited until I booked   paid for another airbnb   withdrew   canceled my request to book with them to accept me   send me checkin instructions and stole my money out of my account  Airbnb helped them steal the money   the said a host has    hrs to respond to a request   thats fine but if a customer cancels or withdraws before a location or checkin instructions is provided   airbnb   the host knows that another airbnb has accepted   you are using their airbnb instead  A FULL REFUND IS A NO BRAINER   So fuck this host   airbnb the fraudulently scheme to still potential customers money   they refuse to give it back  I know I am not the only person this has happened to I can see a class action suit coming for Airbnb in the near future   I promise to be the first in line
395645893702887245,No room number posted outside of door  hard to find room  Also  the code to get in the building didn t work  Security guard had to let me in  Code to get into building didn t work  Called and messaged about issue with no communication  Security guard had to let me in  Also  room didn t have room number listed outside of door so it was hard to find 
400731467030343198,DON T DO IT  We booked an apartment with Zencity for our    year anniversary  When we checked in  there was no fob left in the unit which allows access to the building enables the elevator  After messaging through the app  calling and waiting on hold and messaging calling through Instagram  We finally got someone to answer and we re told they would call us back  Got no call back when we were supposed to and we re forced to get a hotel room for the first night  We were told the second day at around noon that a fob was left at the front desk but when we asked the front desk  no one had been given anything  After that Zencity refused to communicate with us despite multiple phone calls and messages  The apartment was what we expected but if your trip is important  don t book with Zencity  I can t believe after leaving us without a place to stay the first night that you would continue to ignore communication attempts until after the trip was over  Terrible customer service and really surprised that you conduct business this way 
446961481308115528,This apartment needed a lot of repair  I d call it a fixer upper   It was very disappointing and we did not stay  not even one night   The cleanliness of this apt was very bad  Grime on doors and shelving  hair along the hall floor and baseboards  crumbs and dirt on the kitchen floor  fingerprints and smudges on the mirrored side table and glass coffee table  The large rug looked worn and stained and the venting in the bedroom was thick with dust  lint and sticky grime   No pride in this apartment   The walls showed wear and tear  ceiling was damaged  had stress cracks and the paint was sloppy  thick  gunky  caked on and chipped in places   Ceiling  light over table had three of  five working bulbs  Entrance way and another light fixture also had missing or non working bulbs  Electric light switch in hall did not completely covered the hole housing the electrical wiring   a gap between plaster and hole   The inside front door knob and lock also was ill fitted  and did not make one feel secure  In addition  there were three different doors gate to enter the apt  This was very cumbersome and would require two hands  The directions to entry gate did not include the first code at all   The instructions also directed guest to walk  up  the steps which was on east side of building  when they should have said walk  down  the steps   the west side of the building    The balcony looked appealing but the doors to access were so heavy making it difficult to open  Also there was a bad smell ruminating from below the pool looked to be the color green   algae   I sent many pictures to the the host in hopes of receiving a total refund  To this date I have only received about a third of it   My husband would have preferred to sleep in our car rather than to stay at this Airbnb  We checked into a holiday inn and the next day found another Airbnb  Very disappointing  Unable to stay at this Airbnb   The apt needed a lot of attention  Cleanliness was very poor  grime  hair along floor and baseboards  crumbs on kitchen floor  stains on surfaces  dust  noticeable finger marks and prints on side and coffee table  soiled carpet  venting in bedroom  thick with dust  lint  sticky grime   This apt needed a lot of repair  No pride in this apt  Walls were damaged  ceiling had stress cracks  paint was gunky and sloppy   many places were marred and chipped   Ceiling lights had missing bulbs or light bulbs were burned out    Three codes for three different doors gate required to get into this apt  Very cumbersome  Host had to troubleshoot problems over the phone to guide us into entry  Instructions to access apt were not accurate  no code for gate  directions to first gate were incorrect   The balcony looked appealing but the patio door was heavy and difficult to push open  There was a bad smell from the pool directly under the balcony and the pool looked to be green  maybe algae   I sent many pictures to the host in hopes to obtain a total refund   We simply could not stay at this Airbnb  My husband and would have preferred to have slept in our car  instead  we found a hotel room and then another Airbnb  This place needs a lot of attention and repair 
401459322736006025,This was by far the worst experience I have ever had when trying to book a property  I have actually booked with Zencity several times and have had great experiences  There properties are normally in great areas  clean  well designed  and the staff is normally nice  professional  and responsive  But this time was nothing like that  I can t say much about the property itself except that the parking situation is horrible  I can t speak about the unit because I never saw it  I booked the property the same morning as check in  I requested an early check in  This request was ignored  Around   o clock when I still had not heard anything about my booking  I called them  I spoke with Andrea  she should honestly find a different profession because hospitality is not her thing  she advised that my booking was just then being reviewed and approved my stay  I received a confirmation email  my card was charged  Upon reviewing the confrontation email I found that there was not any check in instructions  I called back and spoke with Andrea again and she advised that check in instructions are computer generated and that I would have to just wait until that happened  Mind you it is after   o clock  When I expressed my displeasure with having to wait and not being provided a proper time expectation  she told me that the delay was my fault for waiting so late to book  as tho the booking I made that morning never happened  not one time during my interaction with her did I get an apology for anything  I then wait an hr in     degree weather with no response or check in instructions  I then call back and I m advised that the property has been double booked and there were no other properties available for me  I then tell Andra that this posses a huge problem for me because I used my last bit of available money to book this property and did not have the means to book another property while waiting on a refund from them  She offers no solution other than assuring that I will get a full refund  At this point communication between her and I completely breaks down  Which is then followed up with a note from her expressing how upset she was by my word choice and tone during our last conversation  Again  no empathy  apology  or real solution to my problem  I get a lecture  Fortunately  I was able to speak with Airbnb and they provided excellent service  I was issued a coupon to cover that nights stay at a different property  So around   that evening I was able to check in  relax  and forget about the anything but Zen experience  Andrea needs better training  She lacks empathy and comes across as robotic

427454081251080479,I will never book w  Zencity again after this TERRIBLE experience  FIRST OFF  was given wrong check in instructions so I was not able to gain access to the building  Called customer support which then they told me to ask someone nearby to let us in   already looking sketch  The man who let us in was a  maintenance man  with no badge or uniform  This same  maintenance man  was ironically going to OUR room   His purpose was unclear b c we were told the room would be accessible after   and this was after       He said it was  just to checkout the room  and his English was hard to understand   Meanwhile he was speaking Spanish on the phone with someone else the entire time  We approached the room to find that it was NOT Securely locked and cracked open      We knocked  I closed it and then put in our code to make sure this was our right room     It was and when we entered  IT WAS NOT EVEN THE ROOM PICTURED  the soap was knocked over on the island  sunglasses on the table  NO KEY FOB for building and garage access  The  maintenance man  just did a lap  flushed the toilet    and asked us if we were good with it all while still speaking Spanish and what seemed to be reporting to someone on the phone  I was not okay with what was going on and my girlfriend and I were pretty sketched out at the whole situation  We went back to the lobby   played phone message tag with a Zencity rep for about    min and they had no explanation for really anything  The concierge at the front office of the apartment was not surprised that we were having such trouble w  Zencity   their building  After being told that they had no other rooms available  AKA the room we originally booked  and after I figured out the room lock malfunction that was causing the door to not completely lock unless held tightly while lock was automatically locking  I felt safe enough to stay here but later regretted this choice after discovering how dirty the place actually was   Hair   debris all over the carpet and dirty surfaces   BUT WAIT THERE S MORE   Next day they also tried to charge me     for a WASHCLOTH that WE left behind because it had makeup stains on it       this whole company is a joke and everyone who had anything to do with our room should be fired 
452367761874978508,I wish I could leave   stars  You can t get into the building without someone walking out  The place wasn t clean when I got there and it honestly looked like someone else was staying there  Dirty tampons in the trash can  beds very recently slept in  wet dirty towels on the floor  there was even a knife out on the counter  The host didn t keep in touch with me and was very unhelpful with my problems  Do not book here   If I could leave   stars I would  Instructions to get into the building weren t accurate  The place was a mess and disgusting  And the communication with the host was terrible  Thanks for making it a terrible experience
402155113644125072,Good location but terrible communication
445601114864919653,first and last time I will ever stay at any Air BnB  To be   we couldnt even have dinner and have a conversation in our unit with out getting a noise complaint   mind you  we didnt even have the T V on nor the Radio     cant have guest come up to the unit   What kind of rules is that  what are we kids 
441271798531504837,Do not recommend this company for anyone  The customer service is absolutely AWFUL  We were locked out of our Airbnb for two days without given any alternate to access the building  When trying to reach out to the host  it took several phone calls which led to being told I would get a call back which never happened  When requested a refund  I was ignored  No surprise since I was also ignored while I was locked out of the Airbnb building during a thunderstorm  Terrible customer service  Terrible communication with guests  Terrible all around and will never use as a host again 
530457002209117018,Heads up for those looking for a long term stay  Do not rent from Zencity  More suited for short term stays  This is my honest review    Cons    The building is very old and was not clean very well  The hallways constantly smell like sewage  and the walls are thin  so you can everyone around you     The washer and dryer listed is actually in the basement  and is for all residents in the building   They do not have reserved parking for Airbnb guests here  It s     night for      month for the closest garage       minutes walk  and street parking is rarely available    Their is no central heating and cooling  just a window unit that doesn t have heating capabilities   The host did not provide a space heater  so it got very cold in the apartment     The microwave did not work and they never sent anyone to fix it    Communication was poor  and they would always say  we ll send someone to fix it    There are two very yappy dogs next door  which I know they can t do anything about    The gym was also under construction  They recommended another building that was a   minute walk    Pros    The location is about a       minute walk to Barnes    The view from the apartment was great   The guys at the front desk were awesome    I was supposed to stay for   months  but left after    days due to my experience 
505797739159547762,Do not recommend booking with Zencity    if you need anything from them  they will not help you  We    couples  booked this place for a Friendsgiving trip  We arrived in the evening  and the next morning  I immediately notified Zencity of an issue in the kitchen  clogged insinkerator and rotting fish smell from the sink  presumably from a previous guest that cooked fish and tried to put it down the insinkerator   Zencity said they would send out a technician to fix the issue  but never did  They then  escalated  the issue  but again there was no resolution  Nevermind the fact that they never fixed the issue in the first place which negatively affected our stay  now that weve checked out they try to charge us for  unexpected clean  in the kitchen    A  How is it  unexpected  given that I alerted you immediately  we corresponded about it B  How is it our fault that your team failed to come and fix the issue promptly  when I clearly stated in my messages  have all the screenshots to prove it  that  you should send someone out ASAP to avoid further damage   I am beyond angry and frustrated  I have been a stellar airbnb guest throughout my   years of joining Airbnb  go read the    positive reviews that other hosts have left about my stay   and have never had trouble with hosts  Zencity  I am sorely disappointed by our stay  The morning after our check in  I immediately notified you of an issue in the kitchen  clogged insinkerator and rotting fish smell from the sink  presumably from a previous guest that cooked fish and tried to put it down the insinkerator   You said you would send out a technician to fix the issue  but never did  You then  escalated  the issue  but again there was no resolution  Nevermind the fact that you never fixed the issue in the first place which negatively affected our stay  now that weve checked out you try you try to charge us for  unexpected clean  in the kitchen    I am beyond angry and frustrated 
430339516025826032,This was far and away the worst experience I have ever had with an AirBNB  Zencity provided us with an incorrect code to get into the building  We proceeded to have to stand in the rain for    minutes while they got us another code  Once that was resolved  we went to the room to find that there was no fob for us to access the amenities in the building including the pool and parking garage  We called to ask that we get one so we could access these things and we were told it would be delivered to the front desk in the morning  They proceeded to not have one delivered and subsequently told us they would not be able to provide one  We were staying for four days and that is unacceptable  We filed a complaint and they did not respond within the    hour window  They had every opportunity to make it right and they told us they would not even make the effort to deliver on the things promised in the listing  We will not be staying with them again  You should resolve the issue with the fob  We should not have to stay for   days with no access to the amenities in the building  You also need to review your email being sent to ensure it is correct  We stood out front in the rain for    minutes because the entry code for the building we received was incorrect 
486157634827850347,The worst Airbnb experience I have ever had from start the finish  DO NOT BOOK WITH ZENACITY  We had issues with every part of the check in process which caused us to miss reservations and added stress to the entire trip  When we arrived  the voice box wasn t working but luckily a postal worker was able to let us into the building  We didn t have the key fob to get into the elevator  and zenacity wasn t responding to help so we were able to find a random person to let us up to our floor  THEN the key pad into our unit wasn t working  which took zenacity over an hour to figure out until we could finally get in  Our problems were supposed to end here  as there was supposed to be a key fob in our unit which would allow us to get back into the building  but low and behold no key fob  I contacted zenacity several times throughout the weekend but we were never provided with a key fob so we had to rely on other people coming and going to get us into the building and up to our floor  Following the stay  we had reached out to zenacity to give a chance for them to rightfully compensate for the entire experience  but they have stopped responding altogether now that they have our money  I will never book with zenacity again and you shouldn t either 
424546214837995692,The location was great upon arrival first impressions of the apartment was great until night fall there was no air of course I communicated this to the host and they reassured me they would set the air to cool off the unit  Well day two still no air also we noticed the washer and dryer set washing working only because there was a smell in the kitchen and that came from water sitting in the washer for a while which caused it to stink and I communicated this with the host as well and they sent a bogus nose complaint automated email which did make sense because at the time they sent it everyone was trying to sleep so the whole stay just became a headache the air didn t work at all not did the washer and dryer and we got no help with any of our issues so I don t not recommend anyone booking this location communication is horrible  Well it s horrible when you have complaints  Communication is key I was being communicated with up until I had issues
404259227689354248,Horrible experience  After driving a whole   hours  we arrived and our entrance code didn t work  We messaged and after a whole   hours we ended up having to get a hotel room  When we messaged this company for a refund they didn t even bother to reply  DO NOT BOOK HERE  We arrived and our entrance code did not work  We drove over   hours and we didn t receive a response till a whole   hours after we messaged y all  We were tired and had already had to get a hotel for us to rest  Horrible experience experience and we requested a refund and no response was made 
455806907067233772,This experience was the worst   From accessing the building  Instructions are not clear and confusing   I was let in by guest s    Having    seconds to make it to the elevator  because you don t have the fob yet in room     To arriving to your room only to finding out that your suite doesn t have a fob key   Because of all of this  I was left in a building where fob keys are used to operate the elevator and even the stairwell if you needed to move from floor to floor    I called and called all three days to not only receive little to no help but I was offered     off my stay  UNACCEPTABLE     Day    Friday    I arrived late in the evening and didn t make a call to Zencity  The next day  I did   Day     Saturday    I made   calls to Zencity about this issue  I was told the same thing over and over  They ll call management to get this resolved  When I had to leave the building  I could take the elevator to the  rd floor but couldn t come back up to my suite  Which  was on the  th floor  I had to either ask strangers to let me in  Or  ask the security that was his post to help me  I eventually had to cancel all my plans  I called additional   more times from the lack of call backs to only receive a message saying  we re moving you to the third floor  However  without a key fob  that was impossible  No staff  no random people were moving around the building in the late evening  I was then told to stay where I was   th floor  until staff arrived in the morning    Day    Sunday    I called multiple times  The issue was still not resolved  I could not move up and down the building with the fob key   Check out day  Monday    I was told there s no staff over the weekend so there was nothing they could do about it  My issue was basically brushed off by everyone the entire weekend stating the same thing   I ll call upper management to get this resolved   At the time I was ready to depart  I went to their  staff office  to find out that because this company is based out of California they had to call in and report issues  There was nothing I could request on site  They would have to approve it  At this point  I ve talked to   reps on this day and I would think they should ve placed a call immediately   The ONLY reason why I had so much communication with them is because I KEPT CALLING    The company AirBnb stated that after I was having issues  I should ve called them directly for a refund  I never seen this posted anyway  Supposedly  guests that experiences issues only have    hours to report directly with them  Or  you stuck only requesting a refund with the host    Out of       they decided to refund me     from an issue that caused me anxiety  lack of movement  no accessible to my suite  and prepaid cancellations of plans    Do not book this lockbox    With having no staff to assist guest that arrives to a room with no fob key is a NIGHTMARE    The worst experience ever 
415921011973905353,BEWARE  Our check in instructions for the lockbox were inaccurate and we were unable to get in  I sent multiple messages with no response  When we called  we were given a completely different set of instructions to open a lockbox that was supposed to have several key fobs I side  The lockbox was completely empty  When we called a second time  the person we spoke to didnt know how to help us and promised another person would call us right back  We never heard back and had to find and pay for a hotel at       pm 
444184441599275558,This is a horrible place to stay  The place smelled like smoke it had cigarette burns on the carpet  the paint was chipping in the window panes   The elevators and hallways were dirty and smelled like pee   It s not a loft it s a community apartment living  This is a horrible place to stay  The place smelled like smoke it had cigarette burns on the carpet  the paint was chipping in the window panes   The elevators and hallways were dirty and smelled like pee   It s not a loft it s a community apartment living 
424646315950082642,There were no keys to get in as described by the host  We were allowed into the building by a neighbor and the apartment door was unlocked  That is when we found out about the scam and called the police  The host did not respond to any of our messages the day of the arrival  We got scammed  The place was unfurnished  The furniture you see is virtual  We had to find another place to stay and completed a police report  Watch out for scams 
399952451731489102,WE DONT RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY  We had several issues with the apartment      The apartment is not kept well  It was dirty mainly in  the kitchen area and the rugs    The racks in the oven can t be pulled out which almost caused a fire in the apartment      The garbage disposal did not work   and the phone number they provided to use during our stay never responded      The kitchen does not have enough utensils and kitchen rags  The pots are old and dirty  the silverware was dirty  They do not provide you with soap in the showers there is only hand soap in the sinks and one of the dispensers did not work   The garbage can was dirty abs broken  The bathroom s trash cans did not have bags to help with hygiene      The  areas in the deck are for private use only and not open for airbandb customers as advertised   We were told to leave the area by upset  residents     A few outlets did not work    The overall feel is of an unkept apartment   it was not a pleasant stay   WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APARTMENT We had several issues with the apartment      It was not clean  mainly the kitchen area and the rugs    The racks in the oven can t be pulled out which caused the gravy of my meat to spill catching the oven in flames    a very dangerous experience      The garbage disposal did not work   we called the number you gave us several times only once someone answered who said somebody from management will call is back but this never happened  We spent the weekend with the sink full of dirty water    One kitchen rag is not enough    You should be embarrassed to have those old pots and pans in a rental apartment    The silverware was dirty      The description of the apartment said that the roof top was available yo is but when we used it a resident came upstairs and said that the area was theirs and was private and we could not use it  You misinformed us     There was no soap to shower 
428193659753155920,Don t reserve an early check in  they will accept it to have your business and once you arrive they will give you the run around until   pm  the normal check in  The place is nice but that s the end of my compliments  The place smelled like smoke after I had to wait   hours into my reservation to even get in  They never gave me a parking pass yet they charged me afterwards for the missing parking pass even though I told them there was none when I showed up  I literally had to write a note and leave it on my dashboard to stop my car from being towed  This is a company not a person and if anything is incorrect don t worry about them fixing it because they respond once or twice per day  and if you call they will get off the phone and say they will call you back and frankly it s       that they call back  Worst   day stay I ve had anywhere in saint louis 
416802803247894691,Host doesn t respond when there are issues   the patio is not usable Since you had to refund me because host didn t respond to Air not working   patio can t be use with garbage   lawn not kept up  Directions to get in were not easy to follow
489866381103582691,unclean bed sheets  thin pillows  low quality mattress  promised three times to send cleaners fix problems and nothing  dirty stove  no trims in kitchen or bath  basic unit that feels like a mattress on the floor of an abandoned unit  you all are a scam 
443457097762548255,Very creepy building  Pretty sure it s haunted  And I didn t even think I believed in that kind of stuff 
444201988306916251,The area did not feel safe  and the apartment smelled like weed  I was unable to stay  Unfortunately I was unable to stay here due to the smell of weed and having a history of lung issues  The place really needed vacuumed  the window was open   broken  and I was stopped by two people in the dark just trying to get into the building  I ended up having to pay for a hotel for my stay and am hoping this money will be refunded to me  Thank you 
414486240550508289,RUN   Not only is this listing not COVID clean  it s not even a half step above  enter at your own risk   There were hair clippings in the toilet  yep  those hairs   some sort of dried crust on the kitchen countertop  a dirty towel on the bathroom floor  HAIRS AND STAINS on the bedsheets  used tissue in the bathroom trashcan  and a filthy area rug in the living room  After hustling for a different rental  I left the same night as I checked in  I immediately communicated with Zencity   They offered a  touch up clean  and     off future stays  Bless their hearts   I ve been an Airbnb guest since       staying in a variety of rental types   extra bedrooms  basement  apartments   guest houses with multiple private bedrooms but shared bathrooms  This is the first time I ve straight up vacated and requested a refund   I also sought support from Airbnb but they ve got zero cares   If it were possible  I d post photos in my review because there are plenty and they are gross   At this point   I m out       and for real  Airbnb has provided nothing but ghosting   Maybe they own Zencity  Zencity has made it clear that accountability and veracity are at the bottom of their priority list   The  review  that some unknown respondent stated my refund request was currently under has lasted much longer than the promised  we will update you as soon as possible   That was sent to me on July      If someone that hasn t communicated with me is reading this and would like photos  I m happy to send them   Refund my fee  I did not stay in the apt 
400776904164588975,This is my first and last attempt with an air BNB  I had to waste nearly four hours of my time and skip out on plans due to the fact I was trapped in the building  No intercoms systems worked and a tenant was nice enough to get us in and to the room where a key fob was supposed to be  When we arrived there was no key fob and when I called the for the second time about issues getting in and not having a key fob I was argued with u til I provided a picture showing no fob  Without having the fob I couldnt leave the building because I wouldnt be able to get back in  I was told I would relieve a call back and instead waited an hour and had to call back myself  I restated the issues as we had no key fob and was told that someone would be working on it again  After another hour of wasting my time I have asked for a full refund 
445630373350599797,This place was grossly misrepresented in the photos and description  When we arrived the place looked like it was barely  if at all  clean  The surfaces were dusty and dirty  the couch cushions and pillows were stained  the blankets smelled terrible and musty  and the kitchen counter and floor had multiple fragments of broken glass   not something you expect to deal with when you re spending over      night  We spent the morning of our first full day clean and throwing things in the wash to feel comfortable in what was supposed to be our home for the weekend   thank god there was a laundry setup in the unit     On our second night my partner and I went out to celebrate our anniversary and returned to our hallway floor covered in water and disgusting brown water leaking from the ceiling  right outside of our bathroom  We alerted the host immediately and were told by one of the Zencity reps to take whatever extra towels and sheets we had and place them underneath the leak to absorb the water until it could be fixed  We spent the rest of that night livid because we kept hearing a steady drip of the water from the ceiling and had to pass this mess and have water drip on our heads each time we wanted to use the bathroom    By morning the leaking had stopped thankfully  but our experience was already ruined  I of course requested a refund from Zencity and was told they could only refund the clean fees and     for the ceiling leak  which felt like a major downplay of the issues and a lack of taking responsibility for the state of their unit    I would absolutely NOT RECOMMEND this Airbnb rental based on my personal experience and will avoid the Zencity company at all costs    The only positive to this unit was the location  which was walking distance to food  shopping and public transportation and felt safe at night  Otherwise I would suggest looking elsewhere  The Airbnb unit was grossly misrepresented and quality control was lacking  Management took little responsibility for the fact that the unit was filthy  had broken items  couch cushions  toilet seat  kitchen drawers  broken glass and dish   and sprung a leak halfway through our stay 
457155926758331953,The unit was DISGUSTING and Very Dirty  Not at all like pictured  Very disappointed
402148936204590236,Entry instructions did not work and assistance never came  Multiple noise complaints for normal TV volume  Great location  As I mentioned I could get into building for    minutes in the hot sun  Multiple sound compliant for TV volume  Unacceptable 
447051506806371227,Place was clean  Only suggestion to add is a coffee maker and to fix the dishwasher  it didnt seem to be secured so it would rock back and forth when open  I was nervous the bottom shelf was going to roll out and the dishes would break    Parking is on the other end of the block with assigned spots   Customer service was fine up until Sunday  which it quickly went downhill  I had extended my stay an extra   days a few days into my stay and because of that the code on my door changed between Sat Sun  I was emailed this Thursday but did not see it until Sunday when I was already locked out  more so  the code expired    hours after it was sent so I couldnt use it regardless  If you plan on extending your stay  make sure you keep an eye out for your new code and use it ASAP so it doesnt expire    I was not able to get into my unit for   hours on Sunday  I called  the number listed for Zencity       times without any answer and unable to leave a voice message  I also left multiple messages with my phone number to please call me ASAP for Zencity via the Airbnb messenger without response  I then reached out to Airbnb directly  who also tried to contact Zencity via phone  email  and messenger and then instructed me to stay at a hotel for the night  Zencity called around   PM  which at that time I was already in my hotel for the night  I was told they were incredibly busy all day and thats why I was  not contacted sooner  which I find difficult to believe that if they are that busy they dont ask for more help or have some sort of emergency line   Furthermore  the days following I asked to speak to a manger multiple times and have not received a phone call or message from them to discuss any type of reimbursement  Im here for work  so the inconveniences on Sunday morning were after having worked night shift  I felt very stranded without anyone to get help from and by the time they called Sunday evening  I had been up for more than    hours  Luckily  I did not have to work that night as well  Very disappointing customer service  would not recommend this place  Place was very clean  Only suggestion to add is a coffee maker and to fix the dishwasher  it didnt seem to be secured so it would rock back and forth when open  The bottom shelf might roll out and cause damage to dishes    Customer service was fine up until Sunday  which it quickly went downhill  I had extended my stay and because of that the code on my door changed between Sat Sun  I was emailed this Thursday but did not see it until Sunday when I was already locked out  moreso  the code expired    hours after it was sent so I couldnt use it regardless   I think if a door code is going to be changed  that should be something that is verified with the tenant to ensure they have access via phone call or ensuring that they respond back to the email   I was not able to get into my unit for   hours on Sunday  I called  the number listed for Zencity       times without any answer and unable to leave a message  I also left multiple messages for Zencity via the Airbnb messenger without response  I then reached out to Airbnb directly  who also tied to contact Zencity via phone  email  and messenger and then instructed me to stay at a hotel for the night  Zencity called around   PM  which at that time I was already in my hotel for the night  I was told they were incredibly busy all day and thats why I was  not contacted sooner  which I find difficult to believe that if they are that busy they dont ask for more help or have some sort of emergency line for those locked out of their unit   Furthermore  the days following I asked to speak to a manger multiple times and have not received a phone call or message from them to discuss any type of reimbursement 
401456948073724638,The place is nice   the area was great  but whoever does the clean doesn t properly keep the place up  There was hair in the shower  old urine stains that even I couldn t remove with clean product   The place didn t look properly swept or mopped   Also  upon checkin communication was horrible and the entry code didn t work  Zencity replied with another code that didn t work as well  Once I let them know the issue I never got a reply back until after I was already in the building  I waiting until someone finally walked out and then entered the building   Zencity did offer an extra hour before check out which was appreciated   but I didn t like standing outside with a little one and pregnant late at night  Communication and cleanliness needs to be better   The place needs to be deep clean    the rugs also need to be switched out  The place is nice  but not properly kept up  Whoever is doing the clean isn t doing a good job  Also  Communication should be better for your guest upon checkin  Thanks a lot 
447106087974283936,DONT BOOK HERE  They made me feel totally unsafe by cha going the locks in the middle of my reservation and not communicating with me  I came back from the store to a new lock on the door and they never told me they were going to change it and all they offered was an apology  They literally changed the locks in the middle of my reservation  Totally unprofessional
426797369048113249,DO NOT BOOK  For starters  there were NO TOWELS in the entire unit  The closest thing was a single  un absorbent dish towel in the kitchen and a roll of paper towels  Naturally  I messaged Zencity  a company that  hosts  this listing and many others  about this problem  very matter of factly and simply requesting they provide towels  I received no response  The only other message I got after the initial check in was a stock message stating they hope I enjoyed my stay and to leave a positive review  Laughable    To name a few other problems the unit itself smelled bad when we walked in  I sensed mustiness cigarettes and my husband sensed the smell of a dead animal  Take your pick  The rug in the living area was filthy and had visible debris on it  The bathroom sink was chipped  the shower liner had a disgusting brown film  and there was what I can only imagine were dirty linens left in the bedroom hamper  There were half used individual sized bottles of shampoo and body wash left in the shower  It was appalling and by far the worst Airbnb experience we have ever had   Despite the good location by the park  the listing  and presumably any listing hosted by Zencity  is NOT WORTH IT  It is completely unacceptable that there were no towels in the apartment and I did not receive a response from anyone about my inquiry  I will be spreading the word that Zencity is unreliable and awful 
569595726551460120,I would be worried to rent from them their impossible to deal with over the phone they are also very quick to assess fines for matters with her for an excess of any damage they also have piss poor security and allow people in your room that you don t want Allowed unwanted guests to answer the apartment and cause damage and then try pin me for those damages when I price them of the person and if they were not supposed to be on the premises   Company days is an unlawful merchandising business practices and is due for a good lawsuit
420993082504940697,Was notified a couple of hours before check in that my stay was canceled due to a lost key fob  When asked about my refund they said I had to cancel the reservation myself  So   Iwent to the cancellation page and clicked the tab for host needs to cancel   which a request is sent to the host   I noticed a day later that the request hadnt been taken care of so I messaged them and they said they never got a cancellation   I them what process I used and they said they couldnt cancel I had to    there was no option that wouldnt have taken all of mypayment so I told them I sent another request and they still refused   Air bnb had to be contacted to settle the matter unfortunately with this whole process wasting multiple hours of my time that I should have been operating my business   Shady Practices

409413247369622278,My girlfriend and I recently went on a trip to KC and decided to try an Air B B  This is something that her and I have done before and have always had positive experiences with  After looking at a few different places  we landed on this posting and decided to book it since it was close to some bars and not far from the venue  The pictures looked amazing of the place and even though there was a review of it smelling like cigarette smoke  we still decided to give it a shot  Let me just say  the pictures were taken at the right angle with the right lighting because it looks NOTHING that in person    As soon as you open the door to the building  you are blasted with a strong odor of cigarette smoke  Once in the apartment  the smell is not as strong  but almost everything is filthy  The floors are stained and look like haven t been clean  The couch is completely stained  and she would not sit on it  There is a very small hallway that leads to the bedroom and doors on both sides  However  both doors are off their hinges and just hanging there  There is also burn marks on the wall next to the stove  I wish I could say that this was the only thing wrong with this listing  but nothing compared to what we found    While looking throughout the apartment  she came across a used needle sitting on top of the trashcan in the bathroom  My girlfriend and I decided to leave the place immediately as we now felt unsafe there  but not before she also found a dead cockroach in the air vent  We ended up finding a nearby hotel and calling the people who run the listing  At first  they promised as a full refund over the phone and that the place was unacceptable  however  the next day they messaged us and asked if they could send a clean company over as recompense  We told them that after only spending about    minutes there and finding everything we did   that there was no way we would stay and had already booked a hotel  They then proceeded to tell us that since we denied the clean company  they would not be able to give us a refund  Thankfully Airbnb customer service was able to help us and we eventually got the refund   My best advice I could give you is to stay clear of this listing  Spend the extra cash on a hotel so you do not have to deal with what we did 
401403694185843052,Customer service with Zencity was terrible  The listing is the opposite of what the apartment actually is  This apartment is not equipped for long term stays  The kitchen was not a full kitchen  It had a limited amount of cutlery  barely any cooking pots  the dishwasher didnt work  and the bed was immensely uncomfortable   enough to give us back pain for the remainder of our stay  When we first walked in  it smelled like gas in the apartment  The HDMI cable didnt work and kept glitching and popping  When we tried to watch TV shows in the living room  we couldnt sit on the couch for any time because it was so uncomfortable and very disgusting   along with the carpets   Overall   the price does not make it worth the stay here  Hello   a couple of points that we think you can improve on   We felt like you werent very flexible or communicative with us  Initially when we wanted to cancel due to flight issues related to COVID  and there was no flexibility  Later on  we reached out about issues the lock code and never received a response  but luckily that issue was resolved quickly  Lastly  we reached out about forgetting something in the apartment  and we received no word back  even after we suggested going back and grabbing it ourselves   You had listed that it was a full kitchen  comfortable bed  equipped for long term stay  The kitchen was not a full kitchen  It had a limited amount of cutlery  barely any cooking pots  the dishwasher didnt work  and the bed was immensely uncomfortable   enough to give us back pain for the remainder of our stay  When we first walked in  it smelled like gas in the apartment which got us nervous the first few days  The HDMI cable didnt work and kept glitching and popping  When we tried to watch TV shows in the living room  we couldnt sit on the couch for any time because it was so uncomfortable and very disgusting   along with the carpets   We dont think that this airbnb was valued at the     K we paid  We will be reaching out for a refund of some sorts because of how deceptive the listing was 
450630025494810931,  Apartment is fine   Area feels unsafe at night   Not very smooth checkin process   Strong weed smell in building   Lift was filthy like a bathroom   Parking space was far from the building and kinda unsafe   host was responsive though
404357670517825263,When we arrived at  pm  the temperature in the apartment was    degrees Fahrenheit  only   of the windows had screens  and Chicago in the summer has tons of flies   mosquitoes  so we couldnt do anything but turn on the AC and wait  at   pm  it was still     we eventually had to restart the furnace to kickstart it     An hour after we arrived  a maintenance person arrived to fix the dishwasher without warning   at  pm  FWIW  the dishwasher mostly did work for us as long as we ran it on normal  not express  but the lower rack was missing some wheels   The back yard shown in the photos as a nice place to hang out was filled with weeds and construction debris and completely impassable  The back stairs hadnt been swept in months or maybe years  there was serious grime on the side of the bathroom sink  cracks and peeling plaster in the walls and ceiling of the bathroom and living room  a tile in the bathroom was held in place with electrical tape  the floor was too dirty to walk barefoot  and when I lifted a couch cushion to retrieve a pen I had dropped  it was clear that it had been a looong time since that was vacuumed   And oh yeah   there was no back to the building  just tyvek paper waiting to have siding replaced   Sheets were thin   dingy polyester and pillows mattress were not even ikea quality   We tried multiple times to contact both Zencity and Airbnb support  The hosts were quick to reply before our stay  but rarely replied before     hours while we were there  even in the middle of the day    I have stayed in Airbnbs around the world and never had an experience like this  On the plus side  the location really is great   close to the      transit and restaurants  We tried several times to report issues during our stay and got only late responses and zero resolution  You need to do some serious work on this apartment before renting it 
427452189132891098,My girlfriend and I arrived at the air bnb around   pm and saw a man carrying a weapon directly outside of the building  After he left we tried to get inside which was very confusing and took us roughly    minutes  We weren t aware that the parking was located off site and was a good      minute drive away from the apartment lined with bars and groups of men  We decided after driving to the parking garage that the safest decision for us  as two woman alone at night  would be to park in front of the building and move it in the morning because of the parking meters  When we got inside it wasn t messy but it wasn t clean  It smelled like weed  there were stains on the couch and bed bugs  We contacted the hostess immediately  who was very professional every time we communicated  and informed them that we would not be staying the two nights that we had previously reserved  They did an inspection on the room and claimed there were no bed bugs despite the bites we had both received  We made it clear that we had already booked a hotel and would not be returning  They refused to give us a refund but told us we were safe to stay there  Essentially we paid      to walk into a building where we felt incredibly unsafe the entire time  use the bathroom once and leave with bed bug bites 
471708111414102288,I got there  they don t have on site parking which is stated  so parking was interesting  The guard wasn t very helpful on getting upstairs  It isn t clearly stated how to get upstairs  there s multiple elevators but only   for the lofts  which I only found out by a nice bystander  I get upstairs only to be greeted by feces in the toilet  and hair all over the apartment  In the sinks  the counters  on the floor s   and of course when I had to check the beds  it was there  I contacted  Zencity  and they responded quite quickly saying they d send a clean crew  So I left for dinner in hopes by the time I walked back it would be solved  However  this was not the case and when I attempted to contact them  they were not as responsive  No clean crew arrived so I was left to wash the sheets myself after driving     hours  Took me til     pm to finally sleep  They charge     for clean fee and when I asked for a refund they initially declined and then resulted in giving me     wish has not yet been given back    weeks later  Nice location but disgusting attempt to sell an apartment  Highly do not recommend  Maybe under new management  Zencity is terrible 
531221790034969989,Zencity   was the absolute worst experience ever  I have so many complaints where do I begin  My initial   p m  check in  didnt happen until after   p m  due to the fact that I never received instructions as they indicated after two attemptsof contacting  Zencity   they sent the information at      p m  I was charged almost       when found out later that the price was     per night  Guests arent allowed to control the heat  and that weekend iKC was inclement weather   so it was freezing   Excessive dog barking throughout the night  dog feces in the hallway all weekend   the elevator had trash in it  the downstairs foyer was filfthy with cigarette butts and leaves lying around   All which I have photos and shared with Zencity and AirBnB  The mist disturbing   was when we tried to lay down and found hairs in the bed  and decided to change linen  When changing the linen  we noticedmultiple stains on pillows andmattress cover   The mattress was in fact flipped upside down   to hide the portion that was the most soiled  I immediately contacted Zencity support   with my concern and he instructed me to send photos   I  sent photos of the pillows   mattress cover   hairs in the shower  the wall  damaged blinds and nose matter that was on the shower curtain   He offered to send someone up in the a m  to clean  but it was already after   a m  and we were beyond tired  Seeing my frustration   he offered to move us after a hour of going back and forth and also stayed how he would request a full refund  The unit he moved us too  was cleaner  but freezing as we can not control the heat  I have complained to Zencity and AirBnB   multiple times and sent over a dozen photos   multiple times  Even though I was subject to a dirty unit  I still clean and took photos   so they are dated and times stamped  so no one can ever say that I was a poor guest   I have requested a refund  in which the offer was     off next stay  I will never stay in Zencity properties again  So declining that offer they told me a     refundis all they can do for     dollars After all the BS we were subjected to  that was the ultimate disrespect   Zencity   was a horrible host  that only cares about their accounts and not the guests       I  suggest anything other than Zencity Out of all my years of traveling   this was by far the worst experience ever  My initial reservation was booked for another unit  but the dates conflicted  so I requested to cancel  Zencity   mentioned that I would be penalized     for a cancelation so I did request for another unit  that could accommodate those dates  The new unit was more expensive  yet smaller  but once again I would be charged a     cancelation fee  so I had no choice but to accept   The day of checkin was scheduled for          at   p m  in which upon check in  I would receive instructions   I didnt receive those instructions until almost   p m  and that was after two attempts of contacting Zencity staff   The late check in was the first issue  Secondly   after arriving back to the unit after our New Years Eve plans  we were prepared to lay down for the night  but when the sheets were turned down  we saw multiple hairs in the bed  Seeing that therewas spare linen in the closet   we attempted to change the sheets in which the pillows and mattress cover was heavily stained  In fact the top of the mattress was flipped upside down  because of how soiled the cover was  I instantly called Zencity support in which he asked to send photos  I not only sent photos of the soil mattress cover and pillows but the extremely long hairs in the shower  and on the wall  The most disturbing photo was the snot that someone blew on the shower curtain   I made my complaint and frustration known to the support and told him that this was totally unacceptable  He did mention that he received the photos and how apologetic that he was  He did mention that he could send a member to clean the unit in the morning   but it was already after   a m   and we wanted to turn in for the night  so he offered to switch us units  due to the fact that it was so late  I only accepted because I already had so much invested into this unit  and being New Years weekend hotels were almost obsolete   After changing units we didnt lay down until almost   a m  Third complaint came from me searching for the Zencity customer support   I noticed that the unit we were staying in  was advertised at     per night  when I was charged almost          for a weekend and was told that the unit was more expensive that the original      per night unit  I had booked  So that was a whole other issue  The list of complaints can go on and on  Guests arent allowed to adjust heat  and need a access code  to use  The entire building was filfhty  from trash in the elevator all weekend   dog feces in the hallway  excessive dog barking all times of day  the downstairs foyer was dirty  cigarette butts  lying and around   and the place was just nasty  I took photos of everything that I mentioned and sent to the support team  making complaints and asking for some compensation   for such a horrible stay  They had the nerve to offer me     discount on a future stay  I will never stay or recommend Zencity to anyone   by the way I stayed in the KC location on Main Street  I did request the help of AirBnB  and displayed all photos of everything mentioned   So I am still waiting on a resolution   Final response fro  Zencity was a offer for      which is around     of what I paid for the entire weekend        I had the worst experience through Zencity and I recommend everyone to consider all other possible options  before booking with Zencity  to avoid the disrespect that I received

558764856430454863,horrible it was the horrible stay it was rats the heat did not work very disappointed
557281026477534964,This is a scam    Then you won t be able to get your money back or they will take half of your money     I arrived at this property and followed the check in instructions to a T once I got in the building every thing started to get sketchy the elevator didn t work I had to walk up nine flights of stairs with all my luggage then get to the door they claimed was the property and couldn t even get in it looked nothing like the pictures and there wasn t an keypad entry as described then when the host contacted me back after like an hour of me waiting til I jus had to drive around to find the nearest hotel they still wasn t very helpful not they claim we were at wrong address when that isn t true because the codes they gave us let us access the building   DO NOT BOO THIS IS A SCAM   
492823353341692555,Do not book here  They are at the point where they have so much success that they don t care to make sure their guest are heard  I booked this last minute because i needed a trip back to my hometown for a family emergency  I had forgotten my ID  I didn t need my ID since my husband is the one driving  Not to mention I contacted them saying if the application itself was all I needed to present at the door and they said yes   I have photo evidence of this chat  I made the mistake to not bring it but my husband could present his ID  They did not let me in the room  I was left without a place to stay and the did not refund my money  I filed a refund and still no one has reached out to me  Do not book here  They are at the point where they have so much success that they don t care to make sure their guest are heard  I booked this last minute because i needed a trip back to my hometown for a family emergency  I had forgotten my ID  I didn t need my ID since my husband is the one driving  Not to mention I contacted them saying if the application itself was all I needed to present at the door and they said yes   I have photo evidence of this chat  I made the mistake to not bring it but my husband could present his ID  They did not let me in the room  I was left without a place to stay and the did not refund my money  I filed a refund and still no one has reached out to me 
550768658228486429,AVOID AT ALL COST    the place was filthy when we arrived  It was superficially clean but the whole flat needs a deep clean  The bathroom was dirty  the soap dispenser was not working  how expensive is a replacement     the blinds in rooms were covered in thick dust  the dishes  pots and cutlery were grimy  the dishwasher dirty  the vacuum cleaner clogged  the bedsheets had hairs on them and looked used   general TLC needed  the ceiling tiles were broken and looked like they were about to fall down  It s an old building and a flat and really needs some easy fixes     the central heating was loud and one bedroom and the living space did not get any heat  no extra heater available  awful in winter    there was ice in front of the main entrance  so it was a struggle each time to go in and out without falling and breaking your necks   the communication with Zencity was half decent  they replied when they wanted to  not when you needed them to communicate with you   frustrating checkout  in the end we were lied to  told there was another booking when there wasn t  and told no late checkout was available even though they offered it first in an email  Then basically kicked us out without any reason other than  instructions from higher levels  even though we repeatedly requested some assistance  Felt like this was vindication for complaining about the filth and coldness from the start of our stay    An absolute disgrace of a company to deal with  it s really not worth the hassle    I will give credit where the credit is due     the flat was pretty and nicely furnished if you don t consider the layer of muck on top of every surface and the general state of being worn out and things not working  eg the record player    great location for public transport to city centre and not far from the O Hare airport     great location for some local caf s  food places  even vegan food  and a Target I was happy enough after the apologies and a partial refund for giving us the flat in a filthy state and having it cold   Got really frustrated after being spoken to like a total idiot for asking for a late checkout  First you offered the option  Then denied it to us  Then lied for the reasons  Then said you didn t need a reason  just instructions from  higher levels   didn t help us out with storing our luggage for a couple of hours  then threatened me with a bad review and charging more money   An absolute disgrace of a company  you should not be in business for how you treat your paying customers 
474602095889029913,The apartment was nice and well appointed  However  the host failed to provide us with a fob to enter the main building after hours  We requested one multiple times and he never provided one and in the end did not even respond to our requests  I would not recommend zencity to anyone  The first night we were able to get in the building only because one of the tenants let us in  We were very disappointed with tour lack of response  We communicated with you that the fob was missing and you never provided one  We also told you we couldn t get into the building without a fob after hours because the code you gave us didn t work and the main door was closed  You never responded or provided us with one  This is not how you treat a guest or get good reviews 
499290295548671582,They should do a better job at communication  I wouldn t recommend this location to anyone  It s hard getting in contact with your host if you have any problems  They are very rude and when I did have a problem they did not provide me with the help I needed neither care about my time or accommodate me for my stay  The temperature would not change because they have a control system on it so the whole stay I froze  It was an unhappy experience and rude customer service  Customer service was horrible  Do better at communication when dealing with your paying customers  I wouldn t recommend this location to anyone 
565989256240370895,I didn t enjoy my stay  Had to cancel and go to a hotel nearby  Beds wasn t clean  No heat  No WiFi  Cold air was coming in by the AC unit because it wasn t properly sealed  Can have cleaner bed sheets  WiFi that works  Working heat  Sealed off area around the AC unit so cold air doesn t come in 
531138285564340357,So many things wrong with this place beginning with the host  Zencity consistently takes over    mins to answer phones and even longer to answer text  The entry code was wrong as I saw other ppl have stated but I assumed that they had cleared things up  Took an hour to check in  The place Itself is decent enough but several issues  The bathroom has no sink  The only sink in the unit is in the kitchen  The door to the bathroom is a sliding door that doesn t want to stay closed and even when closed leaves Little privacy as there are huge gaps on the sides  The ice maker in the fridge doesn t work  This unit does not have controllable ac or heat  I informed Zencity that it was hot and asked them how to turn the heat down they told me to open a window  Temperature outside was     degrees btw  The thermostat said that it was being controlled at a central location so apparently they don t allow guests the option of changing the temperature  Also parking is across the street which isn t a huge deal when it s warm outside I suppose but in   degree weather with snow on the ground it s a huge hassle  The front door locks automatically but it is fickle and sometimes you have to reopening it and hold it closed until it locks  The fridge is so close to the wall that it is really akward to open the door  Also didn t smell great when first walking issue All this aside it s a decent place if u catch it for cheap 
564533096663115201,The code were were given to access the unit was incorrect and we didn t hear back from Zencity when we reached out to resolve the issue  We had to cancel the reservation and find other accommodations at the last minute  The code we were given to access the unit was incorrect and we never heard back from Zencity  We had to cancel the reservation and find other accommodations at the last minute

561751477559912722,This was a nightmare  The access code did not work  and I didn t get a new one until an hour   half after checkin time  after I finally got in we noticed it was freezing and NONE of the radiators worked  It is the middle of winter and freezing outside  so I reached out about it and they informed me that Maintance would come in and fix it that day but then hours later after no show from maintenance  they said that they would drop off a space heater the following day  the Wi Fi router did not have a power cord so no Wi Fi or apps on the tv  THEN we notice someone trying to get into the room  it s   people and they say they booked the same place for the same dates we booked it was unacceptable so we left

553617816658526423,The worst experience I ve had using Airbnb  Stayed in the unit for    plus days  it smelled very bad from sewer gas for the first   days without resolution  it s in a poor location  next to the trash room  poor communication from host  charged extra fee without explanation or resolution  STAY AWAY The unit smelled very bad for over a week without resolution  poor communication with very long response time  asked to speak to a manager I was told that would happen and it did not  a     charge was charged against my credit card without explanation  and I still don t know what the charge is for  This was the worst experience I have had with AirBnB

555821201434739689,I do not recommend this Airbnb  I wish I could  The Host is just simply bad  The location was decent  These are some of the issues we encountered during our stay  a shower that didn t give much more than a trickle  A smoke detector that beeped at night when lights were turned off  A dryer that did not dry its contents  And a strange electrical wiring arrangement that turns off all of lights  lamps  TV  speaker  and apparently the smoke detector too with the flip of a switch  So no mood lighting  When I reached out to the host the morning after our first night about the shower and noise  we got a response that they couldn t be fixed until the next day due to a snowstorm  I said this wouldn t work for us because these were not small issues we could work around  No response  After some back and forth with various people from Zencity  but mostly me being totally ignored every time I reached out for an update  over our   night stay NOTHING was fixed while we were there  A complete lack of care  I didn t feel like I got my moneys worth  that s for sure  To top all of it off  I reached out an asked for a later checkout and no one ever replied after multiple messages  I received an email the night prior asking if we wanted to extend checkout to  pm  Instead of replying  they sent their clean team they failed to communicate with  I did finally get a reply when they asked why were still in the unit  And they even went through the effort of trying to charge us     for late checkout with Airbnb  This is what they do instead of addressing their guest needs  Zencity needs a lot of help on what it takes to be a good host  Most definitely not a legitimate SuperHost  Communicate with guests and promptly fix issues without excuses  Your guests are what keep you in business and you need to do everything you can to ensure you resolve inquiries in a timely manner  You were overall not a good host  not because of the issues but because your lack of communication and compassion  If our issues continue to go unresolved we feel like we aren t important as guests

550773476213881398,The building management along with the people at the front desk have nothing to do with zencity  so that whenever there is an issue  e g  with getting into the apartment  you can call and leave a message and hope that zencity would reply  Also their code generation system is messed up
