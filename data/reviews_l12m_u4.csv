743294378,Excellent location and beautiful historic building  but the unit was not clean to level expected of a typical motel  let alone COVID    clean expectations  Also  repairs needed were never addressed  wall mounted bedside table had been dislodged  and tilted downward  so items slid off  You couldnt put a glass of water on it   The management company is not particularly responsive  They reply quickly  but dont actually address the issue   just ask for more info  I sent photos  on their request  and after many days still did not receive a response addressing the clean concerns  Pretty accurate  but not in good repair  E g  wall mounted bedside table had been pulled out of the wall   was hanging at tilt  needs repair  Kitchen with minimal supplies  e g  a french press coffee maker only  which is fine  but the hot water kettle provided had no cord  so not usable  Needed to boil water in a small pot  Floors not clean  hairs in the bathroom  handles on drawers   cabinets with crumbs and stains had clearly not been wiped down  carpet with stains including gum  drawer in bath unclean The unit is managed by a company  A different person responded each time  Responses only addressed on of multiple points raised in my message  and essentially kicked it down the road  requiring multiple correspondences and ultimately not addressing the concerns raised  Good price  but frustrating to pay a clean fee for an apt  that was not clean to basic motel standards  let alone COVID    standards 
450017413476823414,Stayed here for a comedy show  I think it was a little overpriced  but I think this thought was fueled by seeing a different rate a few weeks later  It was about half of the price that I had booked it for    Apart from that  it was a cool place to show up and sleep  Parking is about a block away  and for the most part  was exactly as described  If you are going to a show at Stifel Theater  it s across the street  The host provides good instructions on how to get into the building  The door to the apartment doesn t lock properly  but a smart lock was added to help with this issue    Overall  it was a good experience 
453554269058855194,Couldnt get into the building for up to     minutes because they didnt think to send me it ahead of time and their costumer service didnt seem to know the code either  This was after a long drive pushing  am and a struggle to get a later check out with this company which ended with us purchasing an extra day  The purchase was fine  money talks  but you would think a business that seemingly had a tight schedule would be in order  Well just getting into the building was the beginning of my woes  Come to my room and open the door    its a mess  Dirty and lived in is the vibe this air bnb must live by as a company motto  Mind you  our check in is scheduled to be no earlier than around   ish the previous day  So they didnt even try to clean it with the extra   hrs we were driving to St Louis they had  The most they could offer me was to sleep in the filth and theyll have it clean the following day  They showed their benevolence by granting us an extra hour to stay in their bnb before leaving  At this point Im fuming and ask for a refund  didnt even stay  we just went to a best Western two towns over  Refund hasnt been pushed yet and its been   days since exposed to this joke  management must feed off the bad reviews Im sure youre aware of the quality I was exposed to  Including how long its taking you to issue a refund and its just an overall bitter experience 
449995501773233746,When we arrived to check in the door was propped open and the lock for the door has been installed backwards  with the keypad on the inside and deadbolt on the outside   I immediately contacted Zencity and they said they would escalate to their manager and report back  They did not report back and I had to call back to check on someone coming to fix it  They said no one could come that day  Our options were to relocate to another Airbnb for one night and then move back after the lock was fixed  It was not possible for us to move and then move back based on the plans we had made for our visit so we had to prop a table against the door that night since there was no lock   Zencity did not come correct the lock until the next day at  pm after I had to follow up with a call and messages  After that we had two service men visit to remove air conditioning units without warning or our permission   The health and safety concerns and lack of responsiveness from Zencity was unacceptable    The Airbnb was only partially clean  The only positive note I can share is on the location  The location was great   walkable to the arch and Cardinals game   We will never stay at an Airbnb hosted by Zencity again 
449293641601574565,The communication with ZenCity staff was terrible  The unit I rented in St  Louis at The Bordeaux had a malfunctioning central air unit  This is a top floor unit with no shade  the temperature was in the upper   s on the first day    two windows could not be left open because their screens were missing    From the moment I checked in  the thermostat read    degress  when I turned it down to    degress  it said it would take    hours to achieve that temperature  After waiting    hours with no change to the temperature  I started looking for the HVAC unit   found it in a closet  The fan was blowing air in the apartment  but it was not cooling the air  I noticed that the unit had no filter   then I noticed that the filter was sitting on the floor  between the unit   the wall of the closet   it was completely packed full of dirt  Id estimate that it had not been changed in more than a year  so the maintenance of the building may have been weak for quite a while   There were plastic wrappers   spare parts sitting on top of the water heater that appeared to have been used to repair the HVAC system    it appeared that someone may have abandoned a repair job mid way through the process   then the unit was rented before the repair was finished    In my case  it was late August  extremely hot in St  Louis   although I did sleep in the unit for one night  with no a c  with the windows open   sweated all night on the sheets  I was not willing to do it two nights in a row  I was left so frustrated by the complete lack of assistance  I didnt even want to be there   Three ZenCity staff responded  late  to my texts or calls  all asking about the nature of the problem  None ever followed up to ask me what I wanted done about it  or to tell me what was happening  One employee suggested that he could control the temperature remotely  asked me what temperature I would like it set at   then never followed up  The temperature never changed   neither did the thermostat  There was no obvious indication anywhere that the thermostat could be managed remotely  If so  that feature also did not work    The ZenCity staff communicated through text   email  outside of AirBnBs messaging app  despite AirBnBs guidance to only use the messaging app  so they would have a trail of evidence to troubleshoot any bad experiences  I sent multiple messages through the app  as well as directly to ZenCity employees  who ultimately never did anything to help me  After the fact  they never followed up to apologize   After receiving no assistance the following morning  I checked out early  with temperatures forecast in the mid   s  AirBnB quickly issued a refund for the second day   a partial refund for the first     Although ZenCitys reviews on the AirBnB site were ok  their reviews for the same property on other websites were generally worse  This was probably the worst vacation experience Ive had anywhere in the last    years   The paint in the unit was badly chipped   scraped by furniture  inconsistent with the photos  The check in process is complicated  The nature of the lock system is such that you could easily be locked out of the unit    reliant on ZenCity to help you regain access to your things   The HVAC was obviously not operational  The worst thing  though  was the customer service   lack of responsiveness when I had a serious problem  which made it impossible to stay   finish my trip  Ive never left a negative review before  but this was truly a  very bad experience  As I repeatedly said in my messages to ZenCity representatives  the temperature in this apartment was miserably hot     degrees     the a c unit was not working   had obviously not been maintained  But the problem was  after    hours  no one had sent maintenance staff to check out the problem  offered to accommodate us elsewhere  or anything else  I was repeatedly asked what was wrong   then I never received responses about what would be done   nothing ever changed 
449200908082774156,Very disappointed in my stay with zen city  I ve stayed with zen city before   I also used to live in the building so I was anticipating a similar experience  However that was not the case at the start of our stay  You d think that using digital locks is a good idea  when it works  But when it doesn t work  it can be a catastrophe  The reliance on technology without a clear contingency is not a smart way of doing business    It was   am and we had arrived at the apartment only to find that the digital lock had malfunctioned  inhibiting us from using the code to enter  We called customer service and they attempted to help us get in using new codes and digital codes but to no avail  I appreciate all the help Oshane provided however this was unacceptable  We were informed that there was no other way into the apartment and that there were no keys to enter the apartment  We were told that we had to travel to a different building  Mind you it was   am  As we were leaving  we were stopped by the front desk who ultimately found a way for us to enter    The next morning we were unable to leave our apartment without a way to re enter due to the broken digital lock  The locks were eventually fixed hours later    The apartment was ok  There was construction every morning and from time to time the bathroom sink would gargle and backup with old water  smelled unpleasant   A few stains on the couch  Furthermore the internet that services the apartment was not equipped to handle working from home     I requested compensation from management but my calls have done unheard  This is most frustrating as our experience getting their affected our trip thereafter and we ve been ignored by management  I demand compensation  Very disappointed in my stay with zen city  I ve stayed with zen city before   I also used to live in the building so I was anticipating a similar experience  However that was not the case at the start of our stay  You d think that using digital locks is a good idea  when it works  But when it doesn t work  it can be a catastrophe  The reliance on technology without a clear contingency is not a smart way of doing business    It was   am and we had arrived at the apartment only to find that the digital lock had malfunctioned  inhibiting us from using the code to enter  We called customer service and they attempted to help us get in using new codes and digital codes but to no avail  I appreciate all the help Oshane provided however this was unacceptable  We were informed that there was no other way into the apartment and that there were no keys to enter the apartment  We were told that we had to travel to a different building  Mind you it was   am  As we were leaving  we were stopped by the front desk who ultimately found a way for us to enter    The next morning we were unable to leave our apartment without a way to re enter due to the broken digital lock  The locks were eventually fixed hours later    The apartment was ok  There was construction every morning and from time to time the bathroom sink would gargle and backup with old water  smelled unpleasant   A few stains on the couch  Furthermore the internet that services the apartment was not equipped to handle working from home     I requested compensation from management but my calls have done unheard  This is most frustrating as our experience getting their affected our trip thereafter and we ve been ignored by management  I demand compensation 
445641560513643608,Great location  decently clean  although some repairs were needed to the bathroom tiles  A member of my group left a suit in the closet and they have not been very communicative as we ve tried to locate it  The tiles in one of the bathroom floors needs to be fixed  Main door to the apartment is very difficult to open

441993811701557684,Not responsive  passcode was not sent until I stand by the door and make a phone call and test code and change the code and test it again  It was    outside  I have to wait for them set the passcode instead of they set it up before I arrive   In the morning I make up my mind and prepared to go to school for my first class in new semester  the door of the building is broken  and it is broken for a long while  which they did not mention at all  My Uber cancelled my trip to school and charged me    dollars for waiting  The only way out seems to be the path through the dumpster and yes  it is    outside  I did not go to my first class due to it  Assuredly I asked help from host  not body replied to me  I have to walk all the way through that dumpster and detour to the door of the building and enter the passcode and the people inside of the building can get out   Nobody will help you when you were in trouble there  And room is old I can accept that as the price is relatively low  For cleanliness  you can tell the hair of others in the towel  etc  And people lives in upstairs is quite active   Location is ok  but I would recommend some else to live if you need food and water 
438423169762077719,This Airbnb was located in a very safe neighborhood  Parking was a bit difficult and do keep in mind that there are     flights of stairs you must go up to the apartment  no elevator   The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable  It is in an old apartment building like most of them in the area  Upon arrival the air was    degrees in the apartment  The first night was miserable but by our second night stay it had finally cooled down to    degrees  It never did reach the    degrees that we sat the thermostat at  There was a strong marijuana scent in the evenings coming from other apartments throughout the building  The smell was a bit overpowering and unpleasant  keep in mind also 
431808837862449605,Very unprofessional and in person know when the situation arises and they think by switching you to another room that they rectify the issue but they don t and their system is very automated so you only get to talk to him and if you press the right selections when you call the host number  Stay with a private house do not use in city they are running more like a business than a personable ran Airbnb The fact that I was not reached prior to me arriving to the unit even though you say you tried she still mean something in regards to me being compensated for the inconvenience and poor communication by the same city staff the reps on the phone we re very nice but it seems like they were not given the correct information to even let me check in timely and the new unit that they try to move me to and I asked for compensation by a partial refund and didn t get it the second unit that they move me to was a smoking unit so it smelled like smoke and it was much smaller the bathroom was very small and didn t have much room for me to move around and I m definitely not pleased I will not be using Sin City again unless they resolve this issue they try to say that they would not give me a refund and I do not think that is fair because I waited almost an hour before I could get in the new new room The fact that I was not reached prior to me arriving to the unit even though you say you tried she still mean something in regards to me being compensated for the inconvenience and poor communication by the same city staff the reps on the phone we re very nice but it seems like they were not given the correct information to even let me check in timely and the new unit that they try to move me to and I asked for compensation by a partial refund and didn t get it the second unit that they move me to was a smoking unit so it smelled like smoke and it was much smaller the bathroom was very small and didn t have much room for me to move around and I m definitely not pleased I will not be using Zen City again unless they resolve this issue they try to say that they would not give me a refund and I do not think that is fair because I waited almost an hour before I could get in the new new room Due to the rep not knowing the access codes and giving me the wrong access code which lock the door
427448767978231621,Everything was nice   Just like the pictures    The only negative things we found was the apartment smelled like smoke     really the whole building did   We found ashes on top of the fridge   Lastly  there was a book on the table in the living room and it had nude pictures in it   which I felt was disgusting if someone was staying there with children   Overall it was a decent place to stay   Beds were amazing and it was great pricing for the stay  Everything was real nice   The only negative that I found was that the building smelled like smoke especially inside the apartment that we had  We actually found ashes on top of the fridge   lastly  there was a book on the table in the living room that had nude pictures in it that I found inappropriate if children had been staying there   Other than that  everything els was nice  
741552182,The apartment was nice and clean  Bedding was very comfortable  Great location  But the stove and dryer did not work  I told them and nothing was done about it 
426082917545708712,I was disappointed with my stay here  The unit had a bad smell as soon as we checked in and I immediately alerted the host  however while their communication was good  it was not followed up by action  They offered ozone treatment etc  but did not actually do it even after I told them to go ahead to schedule it  All the window AC s were terribly dirty and had the red light on requiring clean  Walking on the floor bare feet left you with black soles  All this also I told the host but nothing was done about it  Cleanliness is a big thing with me and this unit failed completely in meeting my standards  The sofa was dirty with stains on it   and the whole place looked tired and shabby  This unit is not worth the price we paid 
426039602752521685,We were very dissatisfied with our unit  We had to call to get a code for the outer door  The apartment was unlocked  The trash cans had not been emptied  A water bottle and trash was on a windowsill  The trash cans had not been emptied  Dirty towels were left in the laundry hamper  There were no hand towels and wash clothes or towels for the kitchen  There was no coffee or filters  I called the hostess and she seemed rather uncaring  She offered a one bedroom unit for the three of us  That obviously would not work  She wanted pictures so I sent them  We clean the washer which smelled horrible because it stays closed all the time   The lint filter in the dryer was stuffed  We stayed up till midnight washing linens so we could sleep  The sheets on one bed were on sideways  The next day someone changed all the sheets and left clean linens for the bath and kitchen  They emptied the trash but did not sweep  Hair is in every corner  It was advertised as three bedroom and two baths  The shower in one bath did not work   I cannot believe this unit can be charged for  I will never rent from Zencity again  
423134700978528812,Accommodation clean  comfortable  well equipped  and in a nice location in STL   I wasnt happy with the customer service from Zencity  The accommodation was clean and comfortable and VERY well equipped   My ONLY reason for marking my evaluation as low as I did was that I was disappointed in the service   I was in STL on business and was unable to access Wifi in my apartment   Zencity corresponded by email about this  but the issue was never resolved  NOR was there an offer to provide assistance in person   I never did find the router to which they referred   In exchange for this inconvenience  I requested   night reimbursement when I checked out a day early  this was just   night out of total   night stay    This request was denied citing  contract agreement    That is poor customer service in my opinion   I wont stay at another B B operated by Zencity 
423101884162981364,I feel like the space has a lot of potential but missed the mark  I also feel that     for a clean fee should mean that the place was spotless and well cared for but that wasn t the case  crumbs on the stove  dusty and the toilet wasn t clean  We were on the   th floor and would have had a great view but the blinds were broken so we couldn t open them to see out  Combined with the cold shower in the morning  we were fairly disappointed  I feel like the space has a lot of potential but missed the mark  I also feel that     for a clean fee should mean that the place was spotless and well cared for but that wasn t the case  crumbs on the stove  dusty and the toilet wasn t clean  We were on the   th floor and would have had a great view but the blinds were broken so we couldn t open them to see out  Combined with the cold shower  we were fairly disappointed 
423088068788305173,Nice enough place  but it is not what it looks like online  The building has a strong smell of marijuana and walls are really thin so that you hear neighbors a lot  Didn t feel very clean to me  Location is about all this place has going for it  Wouldn t stay here again 
421730432257979730,This place was not kept up and kind of dirty  The pictures made it look much better than it actually was  There were things hanging off screws in the walls  dirt coming out of the bathroom vent  a red and brown stained tub and shower curtain  black marks all over the walls  the place just didnt feel kept up  It definitely seems like a place that a corporation owns and no individual actually sees it  Some more upkeep of the property would be beneficial  It just didnt feel like it was in good shape    and it felt very dirty 
419508958412733068,The building has significant challenges including urine and feces in the lobby  elevator and hallways   This happened each day we were there   The lobby was clean but the elevator and the area outside the elevator on floor    were never clean  they would just partially dry then new urine feces would be present the next day   Main entrance security door not functional   Little or no security or housekeeping staff   Several barking and snarling dogs   Garbage chute and dumpster not maintained and garbage all over   Parking lot pedestrian entrance security not functional  No parking pass or fob in unit at check in and took     minutes to get one   This is exacerbated by further complicating the multi step process of getting in the unit and getting ones car parked   Window coverings on all three windows were damaged and non functional   In one bedroom half of the window covering was missing   The beds were nice and clean   The main area rug and furniture were grungy  i e  it was vacuumed and dusted but also stained and worn  The building has significant challenges including urine and feces in the lobby  elevator and hallways   This happened each day we were there   The lobby was clean but the elevator and the area outside the elevator on floor    were never clean  they would just partially dry then new urine feces would be present the next day   Main entrance security door not functional   Little or no security or housekeeping staff   Several barking and snarling dogs   Garbage chute and dumpster not maintained and garbage all over   Parking lot pedestrian entrance security not functional  No parking pass or fob in unit at check in and took     minutes to get one   This is exacerbated by further complicating the multi step process of getting in the unit and getting ones car parked   Window coverings on all three windows were damaged and non functional   In one bedroom half of the window covering was missing   The beds were nice and clean   The main area rug and furniture were grungy  i e  it was vacuumed and dusted but also stained and worn

416588299992540836,No free parking        great location The bathtub backs up and needs to be snaked or plunged  filter in AC needs changed  When you advertise     night and it ends up being       thats very misleading  And the parking situation needs to be said Up Front  not after Ive already paid for it  because that added more  
758047618,A good base of operations for a stay in Hyde Park   this lovely pedestrian friendly neighborhood is loaded with parks and pocket gardens   The apartment was nicely laid out and easy to access   Appliances and furnishings were all up to date and clean  It was terrific to see a full length mirror   I think the blinds should be replaced with something that blocks out the outdoor lighting better   We are southerners and the heat seemed too hot at night   We did not open windows b c of outside noise   Also  the living room couch could be longer so occupants can sleep nap separately if desired   But  the proximity to travel and shopping and my daughters apartment was the main selling point of this apartment for us   We would stay here again 
744142585,Nice studio right on the university of chicago campus  plenty of places nearby for coffee or food  I enjoyed my stay and it was in a nice part of town but i wish it was cleaner  When i walked in on the first day i noticed change on the ground  then i noticed that there was also loose hairs on the sheets that were clearly visible  There were also hairs in the towels and there was hair in the shower and there was urine underneath the toilet seat  Then on the second day of my stay i found an open box of condoms in the drawer next to the bed so that was cool 
410838608733917054,The apartment was not as clean as we thought it should be  The side bed tables had food particles on both of them  The remotes did not look clean  The floors were sticky  My husband and I we re here for his oncology treatment so he has a compromised immune system  I went to the store to buy disinfectant wipes and wiped things done  The bathroom was clean though  The apartment was close to the hospital so that was very nice and convenient  We wish there was better parking as I had to park   blocks away to find free parking as we were there   days  Other than that  we enjoyed our stay   Thank you again  
410795323784027518,We had to call literally    times but we finally got a hold of someone on the   th try  the original passcode given was wrong and we were giving so many wrong pass codes after before getting a correct one which kind of made us hesitant to leave afraid we would get locked out and not be able to get a hold of someone  Outside of the actual room we stayed in the building smells horrible  like urine 
409416308001109015,This was a bad stay for me  I expected to fully enjoy my weekend vacation  but yet found out that I would end up dealing with clear procedural failures of the property owners    On the Positive    the place was clean and welcoming  On the negative  Be prepared to find somewhere else to sleep if any situation happens to your room key  and you get to the facility during the off hours of the front desk attendant   After a night out on the town  my key FOB fell out of my pocket in the uber during the ride home  Shortly there after  my cell phone died  Thus I was limited to contacting the Zencity through the buildings call box  However  come to find out  the building has no front desk support  nor anyone available to let guest gain entry into the building  Therefore  using the call box  transfers you to other front desk attendants located in the apartment buildings near by  I attempted to call Zencity      times using the call box and received no reply  Finally I tried the front desk and was able to reach the   other nearby front desk workers  Who again noted  that they would be unable to  provide me access  One attendant was able to reach a Zencity representive on the hotel landline after I walked over there to meet him  Although  the rep was  sympathetic and understanding to my situation  he still could not provide me access to the building nor the room  The      on call building technician was called repeatable and never answered the phone  Thus  the only result for me to gain access to the building would be waiting until      am until the front desk representative got to work  This resulted in me sleeping on the sofa of the adjacent building for several hours until  am    When  am came  I approached the front desk which was able to open the lobby doors for me  but had no idea who can or how to access the spare room key   SN  I was finally able to charge my phone and confirmed the FOB was left in the Uber at this time  However  the driver would not be available until the afternoon to bring the key   The attendant contacted the      tech who finally picked up and came  However  for some reason he forgot to bring the key himself and I was told that he wont be back for an hour  Now its closing in on  am  and I was finally able to reach a Zencity rep over the phone who can provide me a solution  The rep was able to remotely open a lock box that for some magically reason no one else knew excised  and contained a secondary master key that would open my guest suite   Ultimately  this was a horrible stay for me  I will never stay with this provider  or do I recommend anyone else making that choice  Not negating my responsibility of losing the  key FOB temporarily  However  I did not foresee the only solution would be to sleep in a neighboring buildings sofa as the solution  It was one of the most embarrassing feelings watching people walk by possibility thinking who is this bum on the couch  knowing I paid a considerable amount for a bed  Furthermore  I happy that i attended this vacation by myself and not with my family  I cant even imagine paying for an AirBNB only to watch my kids sleep on a couch for hours because Zencity does not have a plan in place for lost keys   Lets be real  you can purchase a cheaper hotel and ensure at least they have a procedure in place to make accommodations for entry  at the minimum  unto the property    Like I said earlier the place was clean  but the service was beyond poorly planned and executed  Develop a process that allows people the ability to enter the facility and access the property
407168311948281126,Was a great location and a beautiful apartment  Easy check in and great restaurant on the main floor  We did have issues with noise  thin walls and ceiling  we heard upstairs walking around and at about  AM were startled awake by yelling in the hallway  It was a great spot and a lovely location  Accommodated my last minute booking which I appreciated  I did ask and request an earlier check in and it said it was approved but then was told not tell    We just had issues with loud yelling in the hallways at  AM 
406433787735196337,Always a pretty good stay with Zencity   clear instructions good unit from time to time theres a small issue but thats going to happen  The door knob on one bedroom is broken and there was a lot of gnats in kitchen 
405060395372112854,Trust these reviews  Just dont book here  The unit was FILTHY  Hair on the bathroom walls  Toilette had a dirty ring  Dirty rags in the bathroom  Rug was FILTHY  Wall were filthy  Obvious ceiling leakage in the kitchen  The unit you see here is NOT the unit you get  The only plus is the location  Yall are dead wrong that place is filthy and those pictures are not of that unit 
402892969172254325,Not sure exactly what level of quality is expected in this market however where I m from this would be a   on a scale of     On the second day of stay some type of construction work opened up with a miniature jackhammer lasted for about an hour had to leave the room for a period of time  I Couldn t even hear myself think   Tiles in the bathroom dont have any grout   Water in the sink in the bathroom has virtually zero pressure and scarcely adjusts from scalding hot   Gnats       am  Tuesday  let the fights begin on and off in the hallway for the next couple hours  I was genuinely  concerned  for my personal safety   This was my first experience with Airbnb and maybe my last   The elevators  one working one not  the one that works defaults to the penthouse  so if you re in the basement you have to watch it go round trip before it comes and get you in about five minutes   The only saving grace for this location is that there is a Straub s Fine Grocers within walking distance you can skip the Whole Foods and the Starbucks there s a bunch of weird people over there   The carpet in the living was very dirty  I rolled it up for the stay and unrolled when I left   The couch was pretty dirty so I covered it with a comforter  Not sure exactly what level of quality is expected in this market however where I m from this would be a   on a scale of     On the second day of stay some type of construction work opened up with a miniature jackhammer lasted for about an hour had to leave the room for a period of time  I Couldn t even hear myself think   Tiles in the bathroom dont have any grout   Water in the sink in the bathroom has virtually zero pressure and scarcely adjusts from scalding hot   Gnats       am  Tuesday  let the fights begin on and off in the hallway for the next couple hours  I was genuinely  concerned  for my personal safety   This was my first experience with Airbnb and maybe my last   The elevators  one working one not  the one that works defaults to the penthouse  so if you re in the basement you have to watch it go round trip before it comes and get you in about five minutes   The only saving grace for this location is that there is a Straub s Fine Grocers within walking distance you can skip the Whole Foods and the Starbucks there s a bunch of weird people over there   The carpet in the living was very dirty  I rolled it up for the stay and unrolled when I left   The couch was pretty dirty so I covered it with a comforter 
401414424379579121,The apartment appeared very similar to the photos posted   It was tidy and professional   However  it hadnt been properly clean   There was a significant amount of dirt  food scraps  crumbs  etc  on the main carpet and entry way  empty bottles of shampoo conditioner in the shower  and a lot of hair in the bathroom     I wasnt happy   I emailed management and they said they would send someone over to clean   Nobody ever came   To make matters worse  management sent me an email asking if I would like to pay      extra to have the space  freshened up    I expected it to be fresh in the first place   I shouldnt have to pay extra to have a clean space     The building is located right next to a hospital and extremely loud ambulances and sirens drove by all night long   I was shocked at how loud it was and had to wear ear plugs and keep the AC running to sleep through the night     Parking near the building was also a nightmare and added an additional headache and cost to the stay   I wouldnt stay there again or recommend it to a friend 
401348577714519732,My bf and I booked this during our drive to St  Louis  roadtripped east to west   nd stop  so excited to stay based on location and since it was labeled super host  When we arrived it was around       and the check in app didn t work door man had to give us a key  When we got up there it was absolutely gross  Stuff on the bed and floors  black hairs   Had taken pics and sent to zen city in which they only would refund me     of the clean fee which was literally only       I messaged regarding my concern again hence we didn t even stay there that night  And no response not even the small refund  Moral of the story I had to reach out to Airbnb directly  Poor communication I appreciate the efforts however your communication was awful and required me to go through air bnb directly  Very disappointed with what you considered clean and a fair refund 
399962045938654133,We did not enjoy our stay here  The bed was extremely uncomfortable and bedroom was very hot and customer service refused to help the AC issue  The building smells of smoke constantly  although a  non smoking  community  Appliances were not working and the window shades offered no privacy or light darkening  The d cor and location were nice  but not worth the other downfalls  We had an awful experience here  The bed was extremely uncomfortable   especially since the bedroom was not cooling properly  No one helped me when I complained regarding the cooling issue  Also  the washing machine and dishwasher were not working  The washing machine would start to run water then quit  the dishwasher would not close the compartment that the pod goes in  The hallways smelled bad of cigarette and marijuana smoke in the building  The blinds in the apartment do not provide privacy or block the light 
399958589028962863,The location of this AirBnB was excellent  as it was close to Forest Park and great local restaurants   Unfortunately  I cannot recommend this listing due to two main issues  lack of communication from the host concerning check in and the cleanliness of the apartment   With respect to check in  the hosts initial message upon booking stated that they would send check in information a few days in advance   They did not   I messaged the host when I was about an hour away from St  Louis to ask for check in information   They did not respond   It was not until about three hours later  when my family was standing outside the apartment building and calling the number  that we finally got the code to the building and apartment   It was getting to be late at night at that point  and we were concerned we would have to cancel the booking and secure a last minute hotel room   Second  although the apartment was architecturally interesting  it was not clean   The wood floors were sticky  the carpets and furniture were stained  and there was visible dirt hair dust along the trim  baseboards  and in the corners   The kitchen sink faucet was also broken   I wanted to like the apartment  but these issues would cause me not to stay here again 
397752031143151683,The unit was spacious and was within walking distance to the Arch  The unit was not very clean  The laminate floors were dirty and the carpet had a lot of hair in it  Also  I had a few issues with my stay and the time it took for Zencity to respond and resolve the issues was not appropriate  I have been home   days and am still waiting for a response  I am disappointed about my experience with Zencity 
397108227618219405,This place was unclean 
397084702670784592,I had a terrible experience    Problems      The  smart  lock on the door was unable to lock itself  This left us with no way to lock the door from the outside  ZenCity had no solutions for this  no interest in helping us  and after an unbelievably Kafkaesque conversation with ZenCity we gave up  We had to take everything with us in our car the when we weren t in the apartment and just leave the apartment sitting unlocked the entire day       The washer was broken  In the midst of our   hour attempt to get ZenCity to do ANYTHING about the lock  we decided to wash some clothes  The washer filled with water and then promptly stopped  The dryer wouldn t turn on either  Now  we are sitting in an apartment we cannot lock with a washer full of soaked  dirty clothes  It was around this time that ZenCity stopped responding entirely  We had to wring our clothes out in the sink and go to the laundromat at the crack of dawn the next day    The short of it  the apartment is fine if everything works  But if it doesn t  no one will help you  And you will drive yourself crazy trying to get even a response from ZenCity  And after hours of sending messages  ruined clothes scattered around you  you will get a two sentence response like     Sorry to hear you are having trouble  Just know that this is not the usual experience of ZenCity guests    Well good for those other guests  Maybe they can come over and help me wring my dirty clothes into the sink 
395596908058192483,My wife and I took a family trip with our two small children to St  Louis  The place itself is not bad at all and its in a great location  However  it wasnt clean well and we had a particularly negative experience to mention  Our first night there as we were going to bed  I noticed a wet spot on my side  It was not wet on top where the comforter was  it was deep in the mattress and fitted sheet  I smelled it and it was definitely urine  Thankfully  I found a waterproof mattress cover in the closet and put it on  otherwise I would have been on the floor  My wife emailed the rental company that night and they got back with us the following day  They said they would clean the issue and have it taken care of that day  We came back that evening after being gone all day to find new sheets on the bed  However  the urine stain in the mattress had not been clean and was still wet and seeping through the new sheets  We called them back and asked for them to address the issue asap  They told us we could leave and get half off the second night  and still have to pay for the clean fee  but with two little kids and it being late  this was not an option for us  I put the mattress cover back on and we left the next day  I subsequently called their company at least   times and could never get through to a manager  They kept saying they were reviewing our complaints and after about   weeks  they were willing to give us a discount on our stay  The whole experience was quite unpleasant  I do appreciate them ultimately making things right but their communication with guests and ability to address problems is quite terrible 
395592082470553448,My stay would have been great if I was a ale to conduct business as usual during my stay  Not only did I not have Wifi  as listed   but I had to jump through hoops to contact customer service and when I did  they couldn t help  I didn t get a follow up until   am the following morning after sending a message at   pm    Elevator also didn t work so I had to climb up and down   flights of stairs with my luggage My stay would have been great if I was a ale to conduct business as usual during my stay  Not only did I not have Wifi  but I had to jump through hoops to contact customer service and when I did  they couldn t help  I didn t get a follow up until   am the following morning after sending a message at   pm 
394905988166545966,Really easy to contact host  Location is great for visiting downtown for a ballgame  the arch  the Dome  etc  Apartment and building had an odor of smoke  We bought a candle and lit it during our stay and that helped  Kitchen is not fully stocked to be able to really cook a meal  No skillets  cutting board  cutting knives  Just not what we have been used to with Airbnb s  Location was perfect for our needs  Host was easy to contact when we had a problem with check in 
394197845081551002,Biggest frustration is being charged full price after having a delayed check in  when I d asked to get in a bit early  months in advance     Otherwise the place was where it said it d be  relatively clean  Had some broken blinds and a cheap couch  but not a big deal  Value wasn t great   but needed a place to stay in the area and it worked well enough  Biggest frustration is being charged full price after having a delayed check in  when I d asked to get in a bit early  months in advance  
394161655659142143,The elevators in the building can be expected not to work  The entire building is old and unmanaged  The trash by all other residents gets piled up by the only exterior door that works and you have to walk over it to get in the building  There is no parking that is offered by the tenant  The room is hot  one ac unit is not enough  It is close to everything in the central west end  but at the price point  I would have spent a significant amount more to have something nicer or I wouldve been happier in a hotel  I would highly suggest a better clean method  The amount of dirt and dust was outrageous  If you arent going to add an AC unit  I would suggest mentioning that the room can get quite hot  If its going to be the bare apartment that it is  at least have a luxury item so people have some things to overlook  Coffee  coffee pot  some decently comfortable seating  ect 
392749197746024366,Ive been using airbnb for years and this the worst experience Ive had this far   Zencity was absolutely awful at communication   The wifi didnt work and when I asked about it I got multiple different wifi networks with a different passwords every time they responded  none of them worked   I was never able to connect to wifi and missed out on work and money due to this   When I notified them of this and the fact I was filing a complaint they stopped responding completely until they gave me checkout directions   The place smelled like rotten eggs  there was throw up on the wall in the kitchen  and there werent any towels left to shower with   I had to go purchase towels to shower   Awful experience  do not stay here 
505019253142348627,Great location  The tub wasn t clean   lots of hair left in it  Also  there was no mattress pad  We eventually found it folded up in the closet on the last day  but it really needs to be on the bed before guests come 
560144868992035380,he will charge your account for EVERYTHING   still havekey fob becauseIm too uncomfortable to return it    HATED IT   
560137753833391184,I wasn t very happy here  There s a smell in the building and lots of drug deals in the elevators and will take place regardless if you are there or not  The parking location is down a couple blocks and hard to access  There were roaches on the walls and on the cabinets  I sent pictures but no actions were taken and they weren t addressed via phone text or in the app until I followed up  I always have a good reviews so this is a first for me but wanted to let others know  Pretty disappointing overall   The shower head is not secure  there are roaches  I sent pictures  Lots of drug deals and smoking  The door to the patio doesn t have a lock  Seems like someone could drop climb the balcony but maybe that s just me  It was an odd feeling to know it was unlocked though  This was my second multi day stay with Zencity just this month 
770810041,The room was great to stay in  though I had a hard time getting in contact with the host  The front door is currently under construction  not sure for how much longer  so I had to find a side door on my own  The room itself had everything I needed for a single nights stay in St  Louis though  and the location is great for traveling around the city without a car  Hi  I was overall happy with my stay  but a few things stood out to me  It was difficult getting in touch with the host  Ava  I had messaged a couple of times  and received no response   And still havent   The wifi password written in the room and in Avas instructions were incorrect  and I only got the correct password when I received an automated response after messaging Ava about it  Also  there was no mention that the front door to the building was being renovated  so it took me a long time to find the side door entrance  I was glad that the passcode was the same for the side door  but I was frustrated that it took so long 
770556033,Spacious and great location to things to see and do  Parking is super secure  Instructions for parking and the door lock weren t very clear  The parking was not explained to me in a way that I understood  It s free if you know how it works  You ll literally be stuck inside the parking garage if you lose the paper ticket that you never even needed if you knew how the parking worked  Instructions could have been provided as the front desk lady was new  The door lock on the door to the unit was confusing when you ve never seen one like that before  The elevators had to be explained by a tenant  The furniture is cheaply made and a couch leg broke off on the first day there  The towel holder in the master bath was already broken out of the wall   Overall very clean but there was some spots on the furniture that I could tell had stuff on them  body fluids idk   Good location and the unit was spacious  The beds and linens were very nice and comfortable  The washer and dryer were convenient and handy 
559417839531919963,my car window was smashed n broken into at       in the morning  be careful  my car window was smashed and my car was broken into  so maybe consider having on site parking 
770156625,This place is walking distance to some pretty dope food spots  Pretty central location  not too far from the things you would want to do while in town  Cool place to stay for a short stay in St  Louis  You should really change the air filter in the air conditioner in the room  the air hardly worked and had the room pretty hot  Also pour some draino down the tub because it floods badly while showering  Also fix the lock on the door  using the key was alright in its place but for check in the code not working was a pain 
768349281,Overall  our stay was a mixed experience  There are many great things about the unit  It is clean  well decorated  and well stocked with amenities  The location is central and there is great access to street parking  Further  the rooftop patio is wonderful   we ate many meals up there and admired the views of the city and the park  However  there was a very serious issue with our stay  When we turned on the oven  the apartment filled with gas  This not only meant that we were unable to cook  but it was also dangerous  Despite bringing the issue to the host s attention on the first night  it was not resolved at any point during our week long stay  Further  much of the communication we received from the host was irrelevant or unhelpful to solving the issue  We were disappointed with the inability to cook and concerned about safety  but had the issues been resolved we would have recommended the unit with enthusiasm  We really wanted to like this apartment  However  the broken and dangerous oven  alongside the lack of helpful communication and especially the lack of resolution of the issue meant that our stay was significantly negatively impacted  In the future  it is important to test and make sure that the appliances function prior to people coming to stay 
767272683,We were extremely disappointed by the apartment   It was very dirty and in a substandard condition   The amount of dust and dirt indicated that the apartment had not been properly clean for a substantial period of time   There was a large hole in a bathroom wall where there had been a plumbing repair  but no effort had been made to patch the wall   The blinds were broken and filthy  many of the mirrors are so old that you cannot properly see in them  the carpet is filthy and needs to be replaced  and much of the furniture is extremely worn and dirty   In addition  the pictures posted in the advertising by Zencity are of a different apartment and not this one    The apartment does not have cable as advertised but only offers Roku   The Wifi is problematic as it is often goes out   The only positive is the location of the apartment but this is of little solace  given its condition 
766674561,Awful service  Had to wait over an hour in the lobby as their check in instructions were incorrect  only to get a call back that there was a key at reception to which no one at front desk knew about  Lock didn t work properly for the rest of our stay despite advising Zencity 
766319397,When I came to this location there was a  Condemned Building  sign on the front door   After a little investigation I found out that the unit I was in had been condemned be cause a portion of the buildings exterior fell off   It had since been deemed safe for habitation but the unit right next to mine was condemned and there was construction next to and above my unit   It would have been nice to know this in advance from the host but I got no warning this is the situation I was walking into   I work remote and the sound of construction was loud and not conductive to working and video conferencing     The sign in the unit that said when it was last clean said it had been a few months since it was last clean   Also  when I went to take a shower the water in the bathtub first came out brown  the water would not drain and there was hair from a previous person in the tub   I did not take a shower   I also killed a roach that was crawling near the bed when I woke up in the morning   I communicated this to the host and they relocated and upgraded me to a different location    The upgrade and new location was very nice   However  when I checked in one of the door key codes did not work but the door was open so I assumed it was just an oversight   Unfortunately one day I came back to find that the door was locked and the code that I was given by Zencity was not correct and I had to wait for over an hour to get the proper code from a tenant of the building  Zencity was not able to give me the correct code or send any one out to assist me     Overall this was the worst experience I have had with AirBnB   I would not recommend staying with Zencity   Although they do eventually communicate  it takes too long to get the answers you are asking for to make the trip enjoyable  Both locations were not a clean as I would have liked and the amount of runaround I had to deal with really made this trip more stressful than it should have been 
765126443,The location and room was awesome for   people  The biggest hit to the review is that the front door is currently having maintenance and we cannot use it  if it wasnt for two random people  we wouldnt have figured out that you can use the back gate to get in  At       am  that is not fun in St  Louis  Cleanliness was okay  was a lot of dust on floor but nothing bad  The location and room was awesome for   people  The biggest hit to the review is that the front door is currently having maintenance and we cannot use it  if it wasnt for two random people  we wouldnt have figured out that you can use the back gate to get in  At       am  that is not fun in St  Louis  Cleanliness was okay  was a lot of dust on floor but nothing bad 
764836595,All I can say is the furniture was what was in the picture  The place was filthy and in need of proper maintenance   They said they were sending maids  they didnt  The mgmt company is in California and hard to reach  does not flow up like they said  Listing is wrong with amenities  parking  etc  Im wondering who wrote the ad  if they have ever even visited the place    it was just the worst AirBnB 
763826154,for three nights it rained while I was in this Airbnb and because of the rain I really couldnt get out and enjoy the attractions around the city  the Airbnb television did not work the first night had to text and ask for someone to fix the television which wasnt fixed till the next day  and that really wouldnt be a problem if this wasnt portrayed as a five star establishment type Airbnb       for three nights not worth it  not worth it at all  then when I finally did get the television to work the next day at      in the afternoon I get a call from ZinCity telling me that someone was complaining about the music being too loud LOL now there is no external speakers in this hotel room I was only listening to the music on the television that was broken the day before  and due to the fact that I cant get out the apartment and enjoy the attractions Im listening to music in the apartment at      in the afternoon and someone complain       for three nights  again definitely not worth it stay away from this place unless youre an old couple coming to see a Cardinals game LOL for you guys to be charging as much as you do to stay in this Airbnb you need to accommodate a little more and be a little bit more open to people listening to music at      in the afternoon  we thought this was an Airbnb not a nursing home
762863724,I had a terrible experience with Zencity  Our shower was clogged for days and my family wasn t able to shower  They took forever to respond and had the audacity to try to charge me an extra      at the end of my stay  DO NOT stay here  You are so inconsiderate having the audacity to charge me      even when our shower was clogged for days and you didn t respond in a prompt manner 
762621025,Living space itself was well kept  Unfortunately when we went the neighbor was being evicted and had apparently left things in their apt  next door to rot   The smell was horrible and seeped into this Airbnb as well  Location is on the rough side of town  even when I asked for directions we were warned away and while waiting to use the entrance call box we were told by other residents not to stay out late in the area  This in conjunction with the parking space being at the other end of the block led us to cancel our stay 
761570837,Expect only a bed to sleep in and cool coffee table books   No customer service  no salt  pepper  coffee  inadequate soaps   Dont do it  The customer service with Zencity was vastly inconsistent with the usual customer service of AirBnBs  it was absent   I could not reach a person by phone and when using the phone prompts was cut off   There was no response to email messaging  When we entered until we left   days later the place held a mysterious sickly sweet odor  even with the window open all day   There were none of the amenities which would make the kitchen or bathroom really liveable   No salt and pepper  no coffee or tea  and only enough soap and shampoo for one shower   The coffee table books belied the quality and usual  but lacking  warmth of an AirBnB   I would not consider staying there again   BTW   after many dozens of stays globally  Ive never been so disappointed 
761535250,Good location  good communication however the shortcomings were that the a c was very loud  sounded like a plane taking off  and we were disappointed to see soap scum on the inside shower curtain which made us suspect to the cleanliness of the flat  And  the      night attracted me but with all the fees added it turned out to be      night which is comparable to many of the nice hotels in the area the future I will probably just stay at a hotel  The shortcomings were that the a c was very loud  sounded like a plane taking off and we were disappointed to see soap scum on the inside shower curtain which made us suspect to the cleanliness of the flat 
760652666,If you are looking for an easy  quick check in  THIS IS NOT THE PLACE  We got in late  were met with a code that did not work  and were unable to reach anyone through the number listed  The parking a is a   minute walk from the apartment building and the address is not accurate  In addition  bathroom and kitchen floors were sticky  However  if you don t care about any of that it is a convenient location  Some suggestions     Make the check in process less complex  We had difficulty with one of the codes working and therefore had to call  twice  with no response   In addition  the address of the entrance is not clear   address was on Olive St but actual entrance was not     Improve communication  We were unable to reach anyone when we had difficulty with check in  The number given brought us to an automated machine which was extremely unhelpful  especially at       at night      Provide a very explicit warning that the parking is a   minute walk from the place     improve clean  Shower floor and kitchen floor felt sticky
760154441,It was ok  Place had somewhat of a musty smell 
757539015,Positives   Great location  walking distance to many restaurants and barnes jewish hospital  for those who work there   Blackout curtains  comfortable bed   Negatives    Only street parking is available and you can only pay for two hours at a time so I received several parking tickets   Unit was dusty when I arrived but I also checked in a day late and the AC was on so it could ve just been the air filter   Almost halfway through my stay my washer broke and when I reached out to the host  my initial message went unread ignored so I had to follow up few more times to finally get a response  The maintenance request took a few days to be addressed  but then it broke again  The second time the maintenance guy came by  he said there was a major leak so I should not use it  This is extremely inconvenient bc I stayed a little over two weeks and I was unable to do laundry at all including my work scrubs  So by the time I checked out  I had to travel with a bag of dirty laundry to my new destination
757335244,It was hard getting in   out of this place   Oh   they only gave us one key card for   ppl  by the way it was super cold   Only have access to one tv   Well at least it was really clean Only one tv in living room   one key card for multiple guests  It s hard to get in   out of the parking area as well     it was really cold
756628815,Beautiful apartment building and great location  We loved everything about our stay other than lack of communication when something went wrong  A very beautiful apartment to stay in while visiting St Louis  However  the lack of communication on the hosts part is the reason for   stars  We didn t sleep at all the first night due to the fire alarm going off and no one came to fix it or even attempted to  When we asked for a discount or free stay for our uncomfortable first night we never got a response  I find that quite unprofessional especially seeing as how it was an apartment complex 
756595826,Please read  If you like beautiful  neat and clean surroundings  this unit will disappoint  I could never recommend this place to anyone at the price I was charged for three nights  I stayed Thursday  th Sunday  th  so I got the weekend rate at      night in addition to the other three fees which brought my total to nearly       Allow me to tell you what I received for        There is no parking  so you have to park on street  We are fine with this  You have to enter three codes to get into the apartment  The second door requires a bit of force to get open   all the while it s buzzing annoyingly loudly    Upon entering  there is an awful stench  In the living room  the couch is horribly stained and the pillows flat and lifeless  My sister was going to sleep there but I wouldn t allow it  so I slept with my mom and let my sister take my room we were four total   This was not the plan for sleeping arrangements and was a major inconvenience to me  The blinds are almost all bent and broken   something we have never allowed in our homes  There are also no curtains  on any of the windows  There was tissue inside the second toilet and a jacket hanging on the chair in the first room  The back room door is broken and you can see inside the door  There is no lock and the door does not shut   The oven is so dirty and black with burnt food that wasn t scrubbed away for months  The kitchen trash can  fridge door  and stove tops were not wiped down properly  The floors were not properly clean  There were ants all over the apartment and mainly were seen in the kitchen around the sink and behind the toaster    The shower curtains were not clean  Both were stained and one of them had a spot of what appeared to be blood  The master bath soap dish in the shower had soap residue in it  the tub drained slowly and the sink drained even more slowly    The paint job on the walls is unacceptable  It bleeds onto the baseboards  The walls are also very dirty  Like someone with dirty hands touched them and no one bothered to wipe it off  There is also an uneven texture to the walls  It s not aesthetically pleasing in the least bit  Where the wall meets the floor  there is another lining that is not true base boarding  and it s falling apart and full of what appears to be wood dust    I have taken pictures of everything and will be in touch with the Resolution Center about the lack of cleanliness and poor condition of the apartment  I was mainly in communication with Alejandro and he gave me the runaround for three days and I was completely ignored for an entire day  He offered to send a cleaner over on Saturday at  pm and we were scheduled to leave the next morning at  am  We also had already clean and there was no point  I am pursuing a partial refund  which the  team of managers  has so far agreed to refund the     clean fee  We left the apartment clean and used our own sheets  Hopefully the apartment gets more than a ten minute clean job before the next guest  Please refer to past messages and read my full review  I ll put everything there  I m disappointed in the communication  I was clear and asked to have a productive discussion so we can handle matters in private  You all are well aware of what the unit looks like  so I was hoping for an honest discussion  but here we are   I complained because your unit is sloppily painted  the only couch is stained with God knows what  and your broken blinds have not been replaced  etc  Barely anything has been done to keep this unit aesthetically appealing for guests    My family and I all live in very beautifully decorated homes and the furniture is always clean  dusted and we would never leave up broken or bent blinds  This was upsetting and embarrassing to walk into  I ve lived in a historic home before and I ve visited dozens upon dozens as I am from Charleston  SC and many homes downtown are very old  but they are charming and beautifully renovated and kept up  so there is just no excuse    I feel you re attempting to get away with doing as little work as possible and it shows  It s carelessness  I will be sending in all pictures and pursuing the refund I requested 
755891372,Didnt check in until    pm    A M  before able to retire for the night  Only to be rudely woken by a representative of Zencity  asking me to confirm a   A M  check out at      the next morning  Calling back to back until I answered   i did not leave the room after entering the apartment  I paid for a room to shelter and rest after an   hour drive and a    a m  photo shoot that i needed to be well rested for in a room I purchased the until    A M   Please consider another BnB service if rest  respect and  appreciation for yourself and traveling companions is a priority   Didnt check in until    pm    A M  before able to retire for the night  Only to be rudely woken by a representative of Zencity  asking me to confirm a   A M  check out at      the next morning  Calling back to back until I answered   i did not leave the room after entering the apartment  I paid for a room to shelter and rest after an   hour drive and a    a m  photo shoot that i needed to be well rested for in a room I purchased the until    A M   Please consider another BnB service if rest  respect and  appreciation for yourself and traveling companions is a priority    id like compensation for the inconsiderate treatment as a guest of Zencity  
755628143,Very dirty found blood  and pee stains on beds  Blood spots on all sheets   the  new  sheets in the closet There was a hole in the wall and owner asked for permission to have the maintenance guy in the room and I said no but came back to the room and the hole in the wall was patched 
755096202,I m usually pretty flexible with Airbnb s and understand and don t rate very harshly  But I found this place disappointing  There was no hot water  and I was on a work trip for one night and needed a shower  that s pretty unacceptable     the floors were all super sticky  and just dingy overall    I shot them a message asking a question  and they didn t respond until after I had already checked out  After all fees this place wasn t worth       it s like a hotel room  but worse and the same price  Sorry
442677700977502888,I have stayed at a few units by Zencity in this building  From time to time I work in KC  The units themselves are nice  The number one grievance is the check in process  They will tell you to type a code into an intercom  The system has never worked in my past three stays over several months  Other guests have also had issues  You have to wait for the kindness of a resident at the building to get you into the building and up the elevator    Once you are in the apartment  you get a keycard or fob and that gets you where you need to go for the rest of your trip 
435489463626337890,A great value  Good  clean spot for a good rate  BUT communication is nonexistent  Check in was enabled by a resident who let us into the building  Without a random passerby  you will NOT be able to enter the building    The sink faucet in the bathroom aggressively sprays water and the sink doesn t drain  We used the kitchen sink to wash our faces  No reason to contact the host  though  as I m pretty certain the inbox is unmonitored 
434802452466556430,There were A LOT of stains on surfaces  i e  the curtains   one of the sconces in the bedroom was broken  the blinds in the bedroom were broken  the kitchen faucet handle was broken  there was NO cold water  closet doors were off their track  we could not change the thermostat for the whole apartment  only able to control a window unit  and ended up having to have the bedroom window open just to keep at a decent temperature  There were A LOT of stains on surfaces  i e  the curtains   one of the sconces was broken  the blinds in the bedroom were broken  the kitchen faucet handle was broken  closet doors were off their track  and the fact that we could not change the thermostat for the whole apartment was absolutely ridiculous  We had to have the bedroom window open just to keep at a decent temperature  FIX YOUR PROPERTY
752392313,First I was a bit upset after I had rented this place for      a night and then see after I had rented it that the price had dropped down to     a night  i have screen shots     The location of the building was not in the location of the map provided  Was in a bad part of town which lots of gun shots were heard  If there was not a private parking lot I probably would not have stayed there   Building reeked of pot smoke all the time  I thought it was a non smoking building  People who had dogs allowed them to go to bathroom on the roof top patio  Nice seeing dog turds on the fake grass   The last night we stayed there which was a Monday night  Young folks had a party on the roof right above us that went until     am   Blaring music and screaming  In the morning the patio was littered with beer cans and wine bottles   The place was clean as advertised 
751951119,Honestly wont book with Zencity again   The room was not clean very well  especially to be up to regulation during a pandemic   There was visible dirty and stickiness on the kitchen floor and garbage can  the whole place just seemed  dingy    I also tried to contact Zencity regarding the key pad at the main entrance because it was open and the electrical part of it was exposed and had a VERY hard time getting a hold on some directly  Honestly wont book with Zencity again   The room was not clean very well  especially to be up to regulation during a pandemic   There was visible dirty and stickiness on the kitchen floor and garbage can  the whole place just seemed  dingy    I also tried to contact Zencity regarding the key pad at the main entrance because it was open and the electrical part of it was exposed and had a VERY hard time getting a hold on some directly 
428887659327831464,It is a clean place but it is very confusing on how to enter the building to get the key fob  Luckily  there was another dude from Minnesota there to help out  Also  they claim that we are being too noisy which we are clearly not  There must be a sensor or something in the room  Last  there isn t any good onsite parking so you have to park far away or find a spot on the side of the street where you won t get towed  We will just get a motel next time with good parking 
750630791,Please read the reviews before you book     As other guests have noted  this home  unfortunately  falls quite short of it s price and how it s depicted here in the listing  Definitely won t stay again 
750377504,By staying here  you run the risk of not being able to get into the room because you either do not receive check in instructions or the instructions you receive are incorrect  You also risk not having a safe place to park if the parking lot is full despite being promised a parking spot  We were told we would have one unassigned parking space  There were not enough parking spaces for all of the cars in the lot  We were instructed not to park on the street because we could get towed  We ended up parking in the parking lot in the driving lane  which was not a parking spot and put our car at risk of being hit by other cars  Someone else pulled into the parking lot after us and had to park in a handicap spot because there was no other option   The person was not handicapped  Door code provided didn t work  We had to stand around until someone left the building  which is not exactly safe to have people coming into the building though an open door I didn t realize this was a corporate run Airbnb  It was apparent once we arrived I had to ask for check in instructions  I didn t receive them until almost two hours after my check in time The price was listed reasonably but then with all the added fees  it was much more expensive than we had planned on paying
422968065983512439,We arrived at night and the checkin was easy  the place was nice and clean  We were happy with it  We were woken up early on the loud noise from the construction site right across from the apartment s windows  Contacted zencity and after many phone calls and messages they provided a list of their other apartments that I can relocate too  The problem is all we re booked and not available  After many calls and chat messages on the second day  I was told to cancel which I did and got back      out       Note   zincity knew about the construction site and noice  the are building a building next to the apartment and it has been going on for a while and will go on for a while too  I had to rent another apartment from Airbnb for an additional       Zincity is my black list and will not rent from them even if it is free  You are by far the worst host I ever had  You are money hungry and you do not care about your guests  You failed to report the the noise coming from the construction site right across from window  This is something you new about 
421031191441706794,Nice Stay  Just Need A Few Improvements and Better Communication Thank You Kindly For Allowing Us To Borrow Your Space   The Overall Room Was Okay  The Comforter Was Stained And The Under Sheets  The Room Has A slight Odor  First Night   Workers Were Talking Really Loud Outside The Door Around  am  Second Night Someone Was Up From The Hours Of  am  am Slamming Doors Back And Forth  No Communication From Ava  Not My Best Experience With AirBnb
748324227,The location is convenient if you re interested in spending a day walking around or eating at the many restaurants  However  this stay was too expensive for what it was  The clean fee was     to fit the host s  obsessive standards  but there was plumbing issues with the bathroom sink and shower that could have been fixed with clean the drains  The Wifi was very laggy  and I felt the host wasn t considerate leaving only one towel for two adults  both registered for the stay   It may be beneficial to add either a filter on the facet or even just a cheap pitcher in the fridge for drinkable water  Too expensive of a clean fee for bathroom sink and shower drains to not work properly  WIFI lagged tremendously  Only one towel was provided for two adults 
419559942855390211,The pros  Location is very convenient  in the middle of the city with easy access to most tourist attractions  Building is modern with sleek and stylist d cor   Unit does have nice open layout feel with full kitchen  Neighboring units are quiet  Check in was relatively simple to access key to unit   The cons  Unit doesnt have the best view itself  you have a view of another brick apartment building and parking lot and garage  Parking pass was not provided as stated  management team communicated quickly that this would resolve issue and I would receive the parking pass the next day but this issue was never resolved so I ended up paying for parking myself through my stay  management team still has not resolved this issue one week after my stay ended   There was an off putting smell in the unit  this smell was not noticeable in the building  only the unit  I had to buy multiple air fresheners but it could not cover the smell  Im not sure of the source as the unit looked clean but it smelled like a toilet most of my stay    Overall  I give this stay   stars  I would recommend staying in a different unit if possible  Waiting to hear from management team to resolve not having parking pass during stay and having to pay for parking myself in the garage 
416568604026592976,I didnt mind the apartment so much it was a little bit ran down compared to what the pictures look like and the building was a little sketchy I mean the people in it but it was pretty nice experience except for the fact that they hadnt clean it I couldnt get a hold of any property manager to fix it and it wouldnt refund my money so I had to take all the bedding and everything and wash it myself it was ridiculous I was up here for a funeral You need to really check your property managers I had to do my own sheets I had to clean my own room I couldnt get a hold of nobody I couldnt find nobody to tell anything to neither could Airbnb  its ridiculous  The master key was laying on the counter in my room somebody been sleeping in the bed the bathroom was a mess and its covid season
747819996,This unit needs more attention to detail  The sofa is stained  the microwave didn t work  there was no coffee pot  there were dirty towels and tub ring in the shower  The clean tag showed it hadn t been tended to in a month and you can t adjust the air conditioning  which would be a problem in warmer weather  Otherwise  the location was nice and if the other issues were addressed  we d stay again  This unit needs more attention to detail  The sofa is stained  the microwave didn t work  there was no coffee pot there were dirty towels and tub ring in the shower  The clean tag showed it hadn t been tended to in a month  Microwave didn t work and there was no coffee pot  I have photos that show that apparently someone took a shower in one bathroom and left their wash towels and a ring in the tub  In the kitchen  the floor wasn t clean  The sofa cushions need a steam clean there are stains  According to the clean tag  the unit had not been clean for a month  Only communication was us being asked to turn the tv down  I can t imagine residents being asked to turn their tv s down  The microwave didn t work and there was no coffee pot  One bedroom door is  hollow  and open  you can see inside it  I have a photo that illustrates this 
746865398,The apt is beautiful and located within walking distance to sights  restaurants  and the Arch  There is only one parking spot provided so if you have multiple cars  you will need metered parking  It is a very secure place  you need a key card to go anyway  but only one is provided so we needed to coordinate meeting up if my group split for the day  The apt has the bare minimum amenities provided  no coffee or condiments   There are sensors inside the apt that will alert Zencity if the noise is too loud  I received a text message from watching a movie too loudly   I think it is more sensitive after      pm   There was a hiccup of getting locked out and it took over an hour to resolve this  the door has a numeric code that somehow was deactivated   It took some time between messaging on the AirBnb app and sitting on hold when I called the host to finally have access back into the apt  I dont think I will select this host again just for the slow response time in a urgent situation  The customer service response needs to be quicker in the event of an urgent situation  We were locked out and I had to call twice even after messaging through the app  I think this warrants a call from you guys to fix this  Im not sure what happened with the code not working in the door  but I suspect someone forgot to update the code after we were granted the request to extend our reservation  When I called the provided number  it took a while for a response when it was rather urgent to get resolved  I was disconnected from a call and the agent didnt all me back  it took   mins of sitting on hold to finish the resolution  There is the bare minimum of amenities there 
746822332,The instructions to enter weren t correct  which caused some confusion  Building address is different than listed and locked doors prohibited direct entry   Host said to go up the stairs after the building entrance  This lead to a locked door  which you could enter if you had the fob  It took some exploring to find the unlocked entrance  requiring backtracking   I informed the host  so this may be resolved already    Although the building smelled normal  the apartment itself faintly smelled of cigarette smoke for a few minutes upon returning each time  Maybe neighbors smoke   I had some air conditioning problems the first day  but no problems after contacting the host  Not sure what they did  though    The blinds weren t effective in keeping out the sun in the morning  making it difficult to sleep in past dawn    Great security and safety features  Great tv and kitchen  Great bedroom and bathroom  The instructions to enter the home weren t accurate  I informed the host  though  I also messaged about the air conditioning  and they responded but I didn t feel they followed up well enough  Fortunately  the problem was fixed  The street address says       not what is listed  Added security made it more difficult to enter the building  which wasn t included in the instructions  Business like responses  without seeking a full satisfactory experience  Problem solving instead of experience improving 
746459050,I read reviews prior to booking so I had a sense of how the overall experiences have been prior  There were some small uncleanliness issues  the main restroom had what looked like salt or white residue on the tiles and the shower did not seem the cleanest  We noticed handprints all over the walls and oddly above the master bedroom doorway  Check in was delayed and I had to reach out to find out how to check in since the host did not send information prior  The apartment overall was quiet outside was nosy but didn t bother our stay  We did like the overall apartment and location was great for our stay and activities while visiting St  Louis  I read reviews prior to booking so I had a sense of how the overall experiences have been prior  There were some small uncleanliness issues  the main restroom had what looked like salt or white residue on the tiles and the shower did not seem the cleanest  We noticed handprints all over the walls and oddly above the master bedroom doorway  Check in was delayed and I had to reach out to find out how to check in since the host did not send information prior  The apartment overall was quiet outside was nosy but didn t bother our stay  We did like the overall apartment and location was great for our stay 
746128699,Garbage place  garbage communication  Pictures are misleading  It s essentially a tenement apartment building with garbage all over it  someone had peed in the elevator  which was also covered in garbage   After our parking pass turned out to have no spot with the number on it and the landlord hadn t replied to and maybe hung up on several of our calls  we gave up and got a hotel elsewhere  I want a refund Area s gross  building s worse  We walked in  took one look  said this is gonna suck but we ll get through it  and then after our parking pass turned out to be to a nonexistent spot and the renter wouldn t respond  we got a hotel room in a better part of town  Again  front door broken open  no parking space with our number on it  no response to our calls  Very sketch  Lots of codes involved in the instructions but the door had been wrenched open and didn t require them  Lots of druggy looking folks coming and going  Elevator seemed to have been recently urinated in and was covered in trash  So disgusting I ate the hundred plus bucks they charged  ironically mostly in clean fees  and found a better place 
745656122,I would not stay here ever   It was very dirty   No parking   if there is it is very expense   Not what the picture looks like on site  Need to get a new clean team and do some maintenance   I well never stay there again   I well stay in a hotel  Parking was a nightmare    There was nothing said about the parking  There was a parking for the condo   Why dont you let renter use the card so many numbers to remember It was very dirty    I clean airbnb homes and I would not be able to leave it like it was   I took picture but they well not load on here    the stove would not work  we had to unplug and clean plug every time we used it   it would not stay on  need to do some maintenance on it   Showers where not good either need to work on them   Hardly anything to cook with but got by with what there was   The whole place need some TLC Just did not like For the cost it should of looked like the picture and let people know how much parking was and that a lot of the parking spots you could not go in and out and stay overnight
415213836244288877,while the place was as expected based on photos  we were disappointed with several factors  first the smell  which I imagine is impossible to remove since the whole floor smells like a mixture of pot and attempts to cover the smell  The appt itself smelt a bit better than that but still not good  the whole first evening I was uneasy feeling like the place was dirty since there were several areas that were obviously unclean   Several of the lights throughout the place did not work  making night time a bit more difficult   the bed was pretty comfortable though and water pressure was nice  there were several amenities in the kitchen but was disappointed to find the water boiler was broken  stay was fine but I prob wont stay with zencity again we were disappointed with the cleanliness when we arrived  there were obvious dirty spots on the stove and table and on the floors    we also were incredibly disappointed to find that all the main lights in the apt did not work  first the main light in kitchen which made arriving in during early evening extra difficult and the light beside the sink in the bathroom  making it pretty impossible to see well in there
413047435553143562,The location  and apartment itself were pretty nice  Parking was a breeze    Check in was an entire mess  I ve stayed at similar places where there are just a lot of steps and it s confusing  no  This wasn t confusing  the instructions were inaccurate  The steps to get into the building  fail  A nice person let us in the building  into the elevator and onto the floor  bc you need a key fob to do all that  which we didn t have   Get into the room  no key fob as promised in the directions  Getting one later was a HASSLE  This seems like an easily preventable situation  yet there are repeated reviews saying the same thing  This absolutely tainted my experience  The check in process was a mess  I followed the instructions and from the very beginning could not access the building  I couldn t get into the front doors  there was no key fob in the room  the lockbox by the door was unlabeled and also empty  so the backup plan didn t work   and then it took a few hours for it to be rectified  I was only able to get in and out of the building bc of the help of other nice people  This seriously would deter me from booking with you again 
410857878910085119,Great room once inside  The check in process was horrible  We lucked out and met somebody who is staying on our floor that could let us in to the elevator and get us to our floor before getting our key   If we wouldn t have found them we would not have been able to get into the room  She also had a ZenCity Airbnb  She said it took her about two hours to check in  If they fix the check in process this would have been a five star review  We loved the room and the experience after the check in process  The directions to get into the room were unclear and also in accurate  The code we were given did not work  The only way we were able to successfully get into the room is because we happened to find somebody staying on the same floor as us since we needed a key fob to access the elevator  We got lucky bumping into another person staying there  If it wasn t for that person we would have never gotten to the room since there is no attendant in the lobby 
745412731,Honestly a nightmare experience  We arrived in the evening for a relaxing weekend getaway only to realize the apartment was not clean  Though it appeared tidy at first  we discovered that the bedding was covered in hair the floors had lots of dirt  dust  and hair  As we arrived in the evening and had no other accommodations  I spent over an hour stripping the bedding and picking hairs off the  clean  sets in the closet  The hosts couldnt be reached by phone  only by email  The next morning they emailed me saying someone would be by to clean  likely before  pm  we packed up all our stuff to make it easier for them to clean and went about our day  We arrived back that night only to find that no one had been by to clean  No explanation or response from the hosts  Even now  no one has responded about the situation nor the lack of follow through on their part  I am extremely disappointed and aggravated at my experience in this listing  The apartment was not clean and I spent more than an hour picking pubic hairs off of the  clean  sets of bedding in the closet  because the set already on the bed was disgusting and COVERED in hair   The sheets were wrinkled in a certain way that almost seems like they hadnt been changed at all after the previous guest  The floors and carpets had dirt and hairballs  I was told by Zencity that someone would come clean  likely before  pm   We gave them all day  No one came  Once again  we arrived  for the  nd night in a row  to a dirty apartment during what was supposed to be a relaxing getaway  I reached out to explain that no one showed up to clean and recieved no response  no explanation  nor an apology  I still have yet to get any response  The host said they would send someone to clean and they did not  The actual apartment inside the building was a bit difficult to find based on the instructions  The place was tidy  but the floors were visibly dirty  dirt and hair  and the bedding was a nightmare  The bedroom carpet had numerous large hairballs  There were     hairs  mainly pubic hairs  all over the sheets  comforter  and pillows  In combination with this  the sheets were very wrinkly in areas where they would be if someone had slept there and not changed the sheets  I spent at least an hour late at night when we arrived picking a strangers pubic hair off of the  clean  sets of bedding that were in the closet  Very difficult to reach host  Slow responses  if any  Promised to send cleaners and did not  Plenty of ovenware but no potholders  Bathroom sink was very difficult to use as the faucet was way too close to the counter 
745055464,Improvements needed Dishes were dirty and tub needed to be refinished   whenever we showered we had paint chips on our feet Place wasn t clean   cleaners was just getting started at the time we supposed to check in and dishes still were dirty
744132789,It would have been ok if I would have had a place to park  if I had been able to enjoy music with my adult grandchildren  only   of them  and movies instead of getting messages about loudness when it was normal and when I arrived there was music blasting but when I entered my space I could barely hear it and that wasn t a problem  It just wasn t what I was use to  I meet them twice a year and this was my first at this place and I won t be returning  Couldn t enter upon arrival  No parking at night  Couldn t play tv loud enough to hear or music  I m in my   s hearing is not superb  Got a message to not park in handicap and I have handicap plates and a sticker
742657189,Strong discourage anyone from renting this unit  The unit stinks of stale cigarettes and marijuana smoke  Nothing felt clean  The walls are paper thin and the neighbors party and fight constantly  There was a dog that wouldn t stop barking  The door lock is improperly installed  The floor sounded like you were walking on a sound generator from a horror flick  The bathroom looked like it was designed for hospice and the toilet seat was broken  We tried cancelling our stay the moment we walked in  fully prepared to drive the   hours back home we had just driven  but Airbnb could not reach the host  We left the next day and cancelled the rest of our   day holiday  No one should ever rent this unit again  Entire unit felt  grimey   Smoke smell was on everything in the unit  Unit is neighbored by awful neighbors 
406517775690203602,This unit is in a great location downtown  and in a very secure apartment building  However  I was somewhat disappointed with how many cleanliness issues I found  especially considering how small the place is  I noted the specific issues with the host  I did also have issues with check in  as some of the codes provided did not work  The host usually responded to my messages and questions in a timely manner  which I appreciated  The place was fine for what I needed  but sadly I m not sure I would stay here again due to the issues I had  I was a little disappointed by the amount of cleanliness issues that I found  for it being such a small space  I just wanted to note those things so you are aware for the future  Perhaps there s just an issue with the clean service utilized    Several utensils and dishes that I pulled out of the cabinet drawers were clearly not clean   The fridge and freezer had a strong odor to them   There was a couple pieces of trash left in the bathroom trash can    The electric kettle was dirty  and contained a sour smelling dark liquid in it    It looked like all the clean towels were folded and sitting on the bed when I got there  However  I found one on its own still hanging on the bathroom door  which makes me think it was a dirty one that was missed  Perhaps I m wrong  I also had several issues checking in  as some of the codes did not work  Again  I appreciate that you all responded to every message in a timely manner  My main issue was the cleanliness 
405729764834413959,This location is in a good spot  My issue with it was the entry process wasn t smooth  I had to wait until someone was exiting and I had to ask someone to grant me access to use the elevator  for entering the first time and the room s floor was pretty dirty  Please make sure the intercom system works  I had to wait until someone tell me in the building and they had to swipe me into the elevator    The room s floor was dirty and needed to be clean 
402181751369410737,Cons  Older building which has people living in the units  so management does not like people staying there through AirBnb  No direct communication through ZenCity before arriving  Questions were not answered  The check in process given was faulty and incorrect   A security guard had to let us in after some time of waiting in the vestibule  No toaster or kitchen towels  Few eating utensils  Horrible smell permeated the unit and building because on ongoing construction in adjacent building    Pros   Older building    was a hotel with Art Deco style  which was very cool  Bed and pillows were comfortable Towels were fluffy and soft  Would not recommend Hello   I am requesting that half of our stay be reimbursed  Please respond that you have received this message  From the very start  I had no direct communication with Zencity about the rental  I had asked questions through the app after booking before arriving that were never answered  The only responses were about check in and rules  My questions were never answered  The check in procedures were not correct and we were stuck in the vestibule with no way to enter the building or the unit  I tried calling but no one answered  We were about ready to spend the night on the ground in the vestibule   it was after midnight when checking in as our flights had been delayed   and we were rescued by a security guard who happened to be walking by and was able to allow us access  Once we got in and were able to use the key card  all seemed fine  You do need to know that the directions in using the keypad DO NOT WORK    The security guard even told us that the keypad is faulty  Even he tried the keypad and it would not work with the sent directions   On the day before check out  a strange and horrible smell started to enter the unit  It smelled like nail polish remover times     It started to burn our nose and throats  The hall did not smell  but the lobby and and elevators did  Our next door neighbor  who lives in the building  was also experiencing this smell  We were told that there was construction going on in the connected building and that the smell would dissipate  I called ZenCity and spoke to Karen  who seemed to want to help but didnt seem to really know what to do except call her manager supervisor  She never followed up with me about these calls  even though she said she would  We left the unit for several hours hoping it would be better when we returned for the last night in the unit  When we got back  the smell was even worse and the lobby seemed filled with a haze  It was intolerable  There was no way we could sleep in such a situation  I called ZenCity again  asked to speak to Karen  who had left and the person on the phone was able to offer money back for one night   We are still waiting to see if this happens  I have had refunds from AirBnb before  and they are very quick  if not instant  I was told      days  which seems suspect given my experience at other times  We had the inconvenience of needing to find a hotel for one night  which was more expensive and very inconvenient as we had to pack up  move locations  and unpack for only one night  At added expense  which was not counted upon for this trip  This inconvenience needs to be compensated  I am requesting that half of our stay be reimbursed  Please respond that you have received this message 
402144634257794923,Please be careful about booking your stay at this place  The listing states that there is a rooftop but that is a complete lie  My friends and I booked this place in order to have an outdoor space to enjoy and meet friends that are nervous about being in doors with COVID and we felt very let down by this listing  Prior to the booking we contacted the host company and I was told there was a roof top area for the building  Upon arrival and further communication with the host we were informed that this information was not true  Also the way in which the guest acquires the keys to the unit is very confusing and takes time to figure out  It is not user friendly at all  AirnBnB management will be notified about your false advertising 
741078738,This is an affordable apt building  there were trash bags and trash in front of the apt door  Also the apt has a strong cigar smell  Loud neighbors  I ended up not staying there  host didnt give me full refund  in times of Covid this building is not prepared for health safety  this is an affordable complex for elderly people it was difficult to find and the code plus speaking didnt work the common areas had trash bags and trash in front of the apt door  it is too expensive for the type of building
400714053609429884,Arrived and followed instructions for check in  but the apartment FOB was not in the apartment  This is a problem because without the FOB you cannot use the private parking  you can only enter and exit the apartment building from the front door by entering a code  and you can only enter the apartment by using a different and much longer code  Having a small child with us made all of this much more inconvenient  Plus  who knows where the FOB was  It didnt make me feel confident in our security that the last users may be walking around the city with the FOB to our rental   Communication about the missing FOB was extremely poor  First message went unanswered  after a second message hours later  we were told the FOB would be delivered  as soon as possible   That was the last we heard about the FOB  we checked out five days later without ever receiving it  or ever receiving an update   The whole thing was a pretty bad experience  and I would never book from this group again 
399994271853046732,Run away from Zencity    This management company is a joke  The apartment required use of a call box in the foyer to gain access to the building  It was broken  so entry was impossible  They suggested having a resident let us in  that works great if you can find one  and whos going to do that at      in the morning after an evening out  They made zero effort to fix the issue throughout the weekend and we ended up on the floor of my daughters tiny apartment  They were very slow to refund a partial amount  then sent a checkout message with an attached bill for an additional       Airbnb has done very little to advocate for my wife and I throughout this mess  Very disappointed as a consumer and shareholder  Sell sell sell     This is a disaster  The call box that is required tho gain entrance to the building does not work  I used the Airbnb chat function without reply  so I called the commercial number  Fortunately  after being on hold for a bit  Francis  picked up  His suggestion was to find a resident of the building to let us in and that they have been having issues with this call box for several weeks  Yet no one tried to communicate that beforehand  It was a complete disaster  We had to sleep in the floor of my kids tiny apartment  No effort was made to correct the issue throughout the weekend  Then the icing on the cake is that I got an email saying it was time to check out and there was another      charge   I NEVER SET FOOT IN THE APARTMENT         Your  service  is terrible  thank you for the stiff neck from sleeping on the floor 
399926417169251130,Let me start by saing checking in was a nightmare  It took us literally two hours to find a key they  placed  in a keybox  in the end there was no key in the key box  So they asked us to go to the room and check if ths door was open  we went up to the room and the door was open  the room was not clean there was trash all over the place  bedroom was a mess as well  so they told us all they could do for this ome night is relocate us to another building  so they relocated us to another building  We HAD TO WALK through kc to another location not only that they seemed to give me attitude about the fact that they had to relocate me and on top of that the relocation was only for that one night since i was going to return to the original room I booked once they actually clean it  The next day when i return to the room i dealt with the same issues again  and it was about half an hour until i was able to retrieve a key from this ridiculous key box  when we finally made it up to the rolm realize the door was not even capable of locking I sent them a message and they never got back to me about it  so I spent the whole trip taking my bags with me in and out so that i was sure they were not stolen  they also never got back to me about the door never locking  literally was ths worst booking experiance of my life  I highly do not recommend  on top of that small things like Old dirty dishes  no air filter on the ac that bothered me quite a bit  Never use zen city  thank you for communicating me the first night but I felt I could not trust you after I told you the door cannot even lock and you guys never contacted me back about it 
399275727425333832,Thank you for the use of your apartment   The location was great   Thank you I would have given   stars if the things in my private emails to you didn t happen and my safety concerns were met   Thank you
396325721431662106,Great location and great communication  The kitchen and bathroom were very clean but the rest of the apartment was not up to par   Overall a good value  all things considered Hi   everything was pretty good about the listing it the biggest issue for us was that the apartment was not very clean  The bathroom and kitchen were clean which was great but the rest of the place was not very clean  There were marks and stains on the walls and the apartment smells like a febreezed carpet rather than actually clean
392023302329709668,I would be cautious to stay here  I arrived and never received the appropriate key card to enter the building and the gym  I was able to get a code for the exterior door  but was never able to access the amenities  even after communicating this issue to the renter several times on multiple days  The apartment had not successfully been clean and was dusty with dead flies in the window sills and the floor dirty  The toilet did not work appropriately and was never fixed during my stay   I had to go to the lobby to use the bathroom  There was also no hot water for the shower  which was also never fixed  I communicated all of this to the renter via Airbnb messaging and phone calls multiple times and they never fixed any of the issues  When you make commitments to communicate with guests  please keep them  You told me you would communicate to me what my refund would be  then never responded
391305241129192377,This was a cool modern apartment with concrete floors that I didn t expect but that my kids loved  There were great views of the downtown area and overall it was a great stay  My kids enjoyed the amenities  rock wall  basketball  video arcade machine and ping ping table   Unfortunately the equipment needed for some of the amenities wasn t readily available and only able to be checked out at certain hours  Thank you for the info and helping on check in and out procedures  We had a great stay  There are a few things I would like to bring to your attention however    The apartment was not swept vacuumed when we arrived  Also some of the dishes were unclean and had food residue in them  The wi fi signal was not very strong and so there were a lot of interruptions while trying to stream shows 
391242754663117274,Cleaning staff returned the key   min after check in to the lockbox  was not masked  unit did not look like it was actually clean  air conditioner for room and living area was not adjustable  sofa back looked like it was broken and was not properly fixed assembled  no coffee pot or basic hotel Airbnb amenities  fob did not consistently work for the door  booked for a week stayed one night and cancelled and left the following day  first bad experience with an Airbnb after using for years 
389779075129777751,the bed is all messed up cheep frame pretty much slept on the floor there was literally no remote to the tvs I told support they no remote untill I left pretty didnt even stay my last night because i was uncomfortable nosy up rooftop party the bed is all messed up cheep frame pretty much slept on the floor there was literally no remote to the tvs I told support they no remote untill I left pretty didnt even stay my last night because i was uncomfortable
769935427,Apartment was dirty   food in the sink  hair in the shower  stained sheets  cupboards drawers open  I m not typically too picky about those things  but for the additional clean fee  I was disappointed the space wasn t clean  I love downtown KC and this is a quick walk to so many things  The lobby of the apartment is absolutely beautiful 
769272129,Not recommended  Check in is horrible  The machine does not work  And the code to get the key is invalid  Response is so slow  It took    minutes for them to confirm that the code is invalid because of the key is not there for pickup  And another     minutes for them to figure out a way to get me the backup key  I think this should be all set before the check in and they definitely can notice this issue earlier and fix it  Parking is also not easy and they did not mention it in the listing  instead they said free parking is available  And they will message you a picture with only     free street parking spots which is a few minutes away  And it is first come first served  So you probably have to pay for the street parking yourself  What s worse  the street parking usually has     hours limit  Host usually reply the message after   day or just ignore your message  You can expect your questions to be answered only if you call them and wait for a few minutes for them to answer the phone  Or keep asking the same question for a few times and wait for at least a day to get answered 
769032685,Zencity provides  terrible  customer service   The electronic lock of my apartment door would not lock  and after repeated  unanswered requests for assistance  I gave up and found other lodging     No refund  no assistance  no communication  no help  no apology  nothing  I have repeatedly tried to communicate with you  with no response from you   I had to vacate my apartment early because the front door electronic lock did not work   I have requested a refund of the last two nights of my stay  because I had left  and yet again no response    Youll be happy to learn that I am now traveling to the cities where you operate on a weekly basis   I used your apartment as a trial to decide if you would be my housing provider   You wont be 
768951166,Beautiful place clouded by inaccurate  information and urine soaked sheets    I booked a month long stay in this Airbnb  Prior to arrival  I messaged the host and asked if parking and the gym would be included  They assured me that both would be free for my stay  Upon arrival I was disappointed to find that in reality  neither of these amenities we re available  I had to spend an additional      lining up separate parking and finding a comparable gym   Additionally  the place was not clean  There was hair all over the ground and in the carpet  If you do decide to stay at this Airbnb  look at the mattress and comforter that they give you  Both are covered in urine  I took some pictures but I do not believe that I m able to post them here on Airbnb  I would highly consider staying somewhere else  I have friends staying in other Airbnb s in the power and light district  These places are just as nice and quite a bit cheaper  For the price you pay this place simply is not worth it 
768686849,It was a nice room  but I couldn t access it without the assistance of other people  which is frustrating during a night check in  We never got a key and scheduled to stay for   days   There was food crumbs under a coach pillow  a fork in the disposal  and we ran out of hot water once  I m not picky  but anyone reading this may want to know this if they have high expectations   I was not happy with my stay because I couldn t access the room I paid for without doing something strange  The problem was never corrected because they probably manage multiple properties and I am one person with one problem  Room should have a keycard Ran out of hot water on day   at night  but it wasn t a big issue  May be to someone else  There was food or something behind the coach seats  There was a fork in the disposal for some reason  The room is pretty nice  I wouldve stayed there if I could ve accessed the room without assistance from someone else
767841112,The apartment was nice and had perfect space for two people  It also had a fully working kitchen  including stove  oven  refrigerator and dishwasher  which was great  But overall we ended up having a bad experience  One of the main reasons we picked this listing was because it offered access to a washer and dryer  The key fob we got did not work on the door to the washer and dryer  Neither did it work on the door to the gym  We reached out to Zencity and they said they tried to reach out to the apartment management but got no response  They were not able to get us fresh sheets  towels  etc  despite this inconvenience either  Sometimes it was hard to reach them as responding to messages sent on Airbnb was slow and calling them resulted in long wait times  Also looks like calls are not well documented on their end because we first talked to one of the agents on the phone who said she will look into providing a reimbursement for the inconvenience caused  But next day  another agent said that they have no record of such a conversation  The space itself is fine  but I would not recommend this listing due to the poor customer service  I believe all the issues experienced are already documented over the messages that were sent on Airbnb  But basically it was the lack of access to the washer and dryer and lack of or slow response to questions 
764916412,This rental is owned by a very large company  reducing this to sort of a Residence Inn  but without any phone or on site support  not to mention an Escape Room like check in      Got a problem with check in   Stand there in the hall and email them     Now beyond that the clean was hot and miss   Candy wrappers on the floor  crumbs in fridge  personal lubricant in bedroom  etc    The TV remote did not work   The Internet would not stay connected   no fix it was a weekend    The neighborhood is rather iffy at night   And noisy   The unit is across the street from a night club that blasted music with the door open  And all guests there were frisked on the way in  Yeah that kind of place    The unit itself was actually pretty decent  Nice view  well laid out and nicely decorated    It is about an easy   mile walk from Westport  the Plaza and the museum   And close to     so good location to get in and out of town    But no off street parking and during the week that is an issue with parking rules in effect    Zen City as an organization is clearly highly dysfunctional  A shame  This unit has potential  For the love of God  make it easy to make a phone call to you 
763472996,At first  Zencity was just fine  I was able to check in easily  I was a little frustrated that there wasnt a key to use for the door  just a   digit code  but I got over that  What I couldnt get over was the long curly hair that was all over the bathroom floor  For reference  I have short straight hair  I sent them a picture of it the first night I was there and requested a credit for the clean fee  They questioned whether or not it was from me and eventually offered me a       credit  Customer service  while responsive  was a different person every time  They just dont have the same human touch that you get from someone who cares  I didnt leave scarred or anything  but I will avoid them in the future  The property was not clean and Ive been ignored in my requests for a refund of the clean fee 
761758411,Go here for the great location and easy check in out process  but nothing else  The apartments here are very poorly made  Here are some things we found in our AirBnB  a missing refrigerator handle  A hole in the bathroom door  as if someone had punched it   Walls so thin you can hear conversations and smell weed smoke from the neighboring unit  It all just felt cheap  The apartment served our purpose for our brief stay in Kansas City  but I cannot recommend this to someone else  Thank you so much for organizing our stay  but there is a lot of room for improvement  Yes  the location is excellent  and yes  the check in out process was simple  But the apartment itself was so janky and poorly put together  A missing handle on the refrigerator  A hole in the bathroom door as if someone had punched it  A wobbly toilet seat  Walls so thin you can hear conversations and smell weed smoke from neighboring units  A luxury apartment this was not  The whole thing felt very impersonal and unprofessional  especially considering it cost over       The apartment served its purpose for our brief  lovely  stay in Kansas City  but we will not be using Zencity again in the future 
761574435,I ve never written a negative review for an Airbnb before but my experience with Zencity was poor   When using Airbnb I expect small mishaps to occur  check in problems  something missing  etc   as it s part of travel and it s never materially affected my experience til I rented from Zencity  My fianc e and I were working from the building during the week and the WiFi was unusable  readings at several times were     mps download and    upload   It occasionally did work at a rate of roughly   MPs download and    upload but these times were unpredictable and lasted for under an hour and communication with Zencity was incredibly poor  I reached out several times to Zencity during the week regarding the WiFi problems and only occasionally received a response and no solution  The WiFi they gave us was the lobby WiFi which has its password posted in the lobby  There s a separate WiFi for residents that Zencity was not able to provide us  Upon leaving we mentioned our WiFi issues to one of the small restaurants in the building  all of which are great and I would recommend  and they said it was a known issue  The actual apartment was fine  the restaurants in walking distance were good  however having no internet connectivity is a deal breaker for me  and I would guess many others  at an Airbnb that mentions having WiFi 
761045312,Check in was difficult and not well explained  Great location and plenty of street parking  Apartment was decent but definitely not sparkling clean  The code we were given to get into the building and access the elevators didn t work  A key box would be      times more reliable 
760692954,Very nice location near the free streetcar  The apartment building is pretty fancy   However  this studio apartment had a distinct smell of cigarette smoke that was pretty strong inside the room  which was a bummer  The check in instructions provided did not work to get into the building  Luckily  a person working with a different Airbnb host company was nice enough to let us into the building and scan his keycard on the elevator to allow us to access our floor  Without this lucky timing  I dont know how long we would have been waiting to get in  Once we had access to the room  there was a keycard provided that allowed us into the building and elevator  so that worked out okay   The room was clean and very modern  sleek d cor  It is a cozy  th floor space with expansive windows  natural light and almost no drawers nor dressers in which to organize  Laundry pods had just run out and the bathroom soap needed refilling when we arrived  There were fresh towels provided and the bed and sheets were very nice  Was also very nice to watch a movie on the TV   if you have trouble getting it to work  try unplugging and resetting 
760688724,This place is terrible they charge you allot for clean fees and the place is clean half fast with hair on pillos and foot prints on coffee table etc  I don recommend this guys at all  This  guys need to do something about the cleanness of their apartments  So far I love the locations and the buildings but the  quality on customer service and clean place  is very poor even though We pay a very large amount as a clean fee when the places is clean half fast  Also I m a repeat customer and a business man that have use their properties many times and I got back no respect so they  have lost a loyal customer and I ll make sure my colleagues don t use their properties  You guys need to do something about the cleanness of your apartments  So far I love the location and the building but your quality on customer service and clean please is very poor even though I pay a very large amount as a clean fee when the places a clean half fast  Also I m a repeat customer and a business man that have use your properties many times and I got back no respect so you have lost a loyal customer and I ll make sure my colleagues don use your properties 
759882016,Zencity is a helpful company with good customer service  The location of this Airbnb was great  I enjoyed being in downtown KC  I appreciated Zencity being willing to help me change my reservation  However  the checkin process was difficult  The code to get into the building didnt work  It took me    minutes before another resident of the building let me in  The man on the phone who helped me was trying but it would be helpful for the company to have a lockbox with the key downstairs at the entry  The room also smelt like smoke when I walked in the door 
759118899,Check in was chaotic because the intercom was broken so everything in the building was locked  including elevator access  Zencity  couldnt get a hold of the building manager  so we pretty much fended for ourselves for an hour to even reach our apartment  There was also no assigned or reserved parking for guests  The intercom was disabled so we couldnt even buzz in or use the elevator until a tenant just happened to walk by Said they would call back but only communicated with me through texts No parking provided by building
756668690,The location and building are amazing   The apartment is in great shape and great   The host is awful at communication   It can take an hour to get a response and took me    minutes to get them to let me in the building     Do not schedule anything the day you arrive  it can take a long time to get checked in  Although the listing says there is a washer and dryer both of them are a paid for service in the building   These also require you to download an app and then the app charges you extra to use it   Be warned    Also the messages from the host tend to be canned messages and are not completely accurate  OK  checking in was a nightmare   First  I requested an early check in     am  and the host accepted the request   When I arrived at that time the current renter was still in the building and not leaving till    am   I left and came back at      pm   Then I could not gain access to the floor of the apartment   The instructions for using the intercom did not work   I had to wait an    minutes for them to get someone to me to let me in  The host responds vert slowly   Can take up to       minutes anytime you send a message  I loved the building and the location   The value would have been five stars if the host had put forth the effort to have better communication 
756173411,Bed was comfy  location was amazing  and the water was good and hot  However  we had trouble with building entry  and there wasn t any way to make coffee short of bringing our own coffee pot and coffee  I m not that difficult to please  Give me a smooth checkin and morning coffee and I m happy  I don t like giving negative feedback at all  but I want you to know where we felt the experience was lacking  bc maybe someone took the coffee maker  Maybe the person who last clean the unit  on April     forgot to leave coffee packets and sweep the floor  Maybe the entry process has changed recently and the instructions haven t been updated  All these things combined left us with a less than stellar experience  but we did sleep great  the water was hot and things were generally quiet  See below Instructions on how to enter the building were not correct  It said to enter on the side at       th st  The correct entrance doesn t have       anywhere around it  It says       just like the other side of the building  A kind gentleman who lives or stays there directed us inside the entrance    We were instructed by you to enter     in the keypad  then verbally deliver a   digit code  We entered     and got a busy signal  We tried entering the   digit code and were given entry  but the elevator would not go to the  th floor  We ultimately had another resident help us gain entry to our floor  The entry process was nerve wracking and stressful  No one likes feeling lost in an unfamiliar environment  Thank goodness for the kindness of strangers  Rug was dirty  had no been vacuumed  The awful instructions for entry  I ve never stayed in an airbnb OR hotel that didn t have coffee  until now  No elec coffee maker  There is a French press  which is great bc that s what I use at home  However  there is no kettle to heat water and no carafe or container to heat it in the microwave  There is also NO COFFEE  Absolutely nothing in the cabinets besides drinking glasses and plates  No Salt or pepper  Airbnb s are appealing to me bc they have more comforts than a hotel  This one doesn t  It has a lower level of comfort than a hotel  If you wish to continue providing this level of  amenities   you might want to warn people  It s an amazing building and the setup is great  but we were left wanting much more 
755624837,Well  there were several things that didnt go as planned  So the pros  the unit is nice and clean  Its also in a great location  right downtown    The cons  the check in process was a huge headache  When we arrived  we were told that we can enter a code to access the building  The code didnt work  We had to wait until a security guard let us in to the building and escorted us into our room  Without a functioning code  we cant enter the building nor can we access the elevator to reach our room  We were also expecting a key fob in our room so that we wont need the code to access the building  There was no key fob in our room  We proceeded to contact Zencity  and Zencity promised that we would have a key fob the following day  They also provided us with several other codes to try for the building access  On the following day  we left the Airbnb and upon return  we had the same problem  we were unable to access the building and elevator with the new codes we were provided  Again  we had to wait for the security to escort us to our room  Luckily  thy key fob was waiting in our room  Besides the check in process  the Airbnb was great  Thank you for letting us stay at your place  A few suggestions for improvement  make sure the code given to enter the building works  Second  make sure the fob is accessible in the unit  Otherwise  the place is nice and clean 
755366642,Was the absolute worst AirBNB experiencE I ve ever had  I couldn t gain entrance to the building because the apartment number wasn t in the call box  Then couldn t get to my floor due to no key fob  Had to take the stairs to the  th floor  Once in the room I was informed that the key fob was in the room but it wasn t  When I contacted customer service they took forever to respond which led me to not be able to go to work that night because I wouldn t have had any way back in the building  So I was stuck in the building all day and night because they didn t get back to until the next day  After asking for a refund things started happening but still not in a timely fashion  After  pm the next day I finally got a key fob  Never again will AirBNB with this company  Make issues a priority  Call box didn t have apt number in it so I couldn t get in the building until someone let me in  Took forever to respond to my immediate issues 
755076960,Thought place was bigger says it sleeps   but it do not only one bed
753498953,I wish I could give an accurate description of this stay but I was not able to access the apartment and therefore didnt stay  The codes that Zencity sends in the instructions for access to the apartment did not work  After contacting a Zencity representative  she was not able to to get the access to work either and promised a full return from Zencity  I am still awaiting return from Zencity and response from Airbnb  I am still waiting for a full refund from Zencity for inability to stay at the Airbnb because I wasnt able to gain access as the codes were invalid and when talking with a representative  she was unable to help and therefore we were not able to stay at the Airbnb  Unable to access I was given instructions to access apartment that were invalid and spoke with a member of Zencity that was unable to help as well Didnt get to assess because I wasnt allowed into the apartment
753384852,If youre in town because of a conference at the convention center  this place would be alright in a pinch  we werent and I wished Id picked a different spot  to get to the key you need to walk into a parking garage and get from a black box on the wall  you can find cheap or even free parking by going a few blocks north and finding a meter or neighborhood  the garage is a waste of money  the building is an odd mix of residents  airbnbs and businesses  you have to check in with the security desk  then use your pass with the first elevator in the right  room      was very hard to open  just keep cranking the key and push hard  the apartment itself is cute and has nice views of the city  the entry layout is weird  the kitchen is small and unequipped  fine its you arent planning to cook  the thermostat was also weird  push the on button until it turns green  then hit mode until it moves to heat or cool  then use up down arrows to change  the bed is kind of small but comfy  the shower drain did not work  I had to prop it open with my fingernail clippers  they only provided   big towel for   guests  the tv remote did not work well  not sure if it needed new batteries  other people were still logged in to most of the apps so be sure to log out on your own  overall  I would not stay here again and recommend you find something else  preferably closer to Westport or north by the city market  hello  I recommend you make a visit to this property and update some items  very specifically  the bathtub drain is broken and wont stay up  I had to prop it open with my fingernail clippers  the door was terribly hard to open  most of the furniture is worn  theres no coffee pot  more instructions on how to use the thermostat would also be nice  however  the views were lovely  I didnt understand we were to walk into the parking garage to get the key  we drove in not realizing what was going on  finding and using the right elevator was also an issue  we asked   questions   different times through the app and never received a response  it was an ok destination  next time Id stay in Westport it was affordable but not as nice as I thought itd be based on the other prices in the city
753354758,broken bed frame refused to fix properly the cleaners are rude and not good at their job broken bed refused to fix and only one key with SOOOO MANY DOORS TO GET THROUGH I was locked out so many times unable to get in for hours
753349664,Great location I wanted to check in at   am  wasnt allowed to check in till after  pm after sending request ahead of time  water was not hot  Asked to check in at   am and did not get a response in time to check in  Wasnt able to check in till almost midnight becuase i did not get confirmation on the   am check in
753043399,nice place but very bad heck in and in my opinion that is the most important part so your guest are to get into there place and relax not worry and be stressed out plzz in the future make it to where guest can check in on the weekend because if there have been people going into the building i would not have been able to get in wrong i info to  check in had to wait    before someone answered
752375957,The location is perfect  but thats it  After fees this came out to a little over     dollars per night and I would have expected a little more cleanliness  There were foundation stains on the pillow  the headboard has completely broken off and has been held back together with zipties  There was no liner in the bathroom trash but someone left their chewed gum there  There is no real shower curtain  just a thin clear liner  There was a used soap bar in the shower  and the toilet wasnt scrubbed  We were lucky someone happened to walk in while we were trying to check in because the intercom system in the instructions was not working at all  I wont be booking Zencity again 
750763350,Key fob was not in the room as promised and we were given an incorrect access code for the building  otherwise it was a decent place  The key fob for the front door  gym and elevator was not present in the room upon arrival  That alone prevented us from utilizing most of the perks of the place  and we couldnt really leave our room because the access code to the front door and elevator did not work  It would have been fine of we had the key fob  We were given the wrong code for the door  They did not get back to us until   in the morning with a potentially correct code 
750584625,I do not recommend staying here  I could not access my own unit until another resident of the apartments helped me in and used their fob to use the elevator  They took forever to respond  And then there was supposed to be a fob in my room so I could leave and come back as I wanted  There was no fob and they never got me one  My pregnant girlfriend and I were unable to leave because we would not have been able to get back in    I also talked to   other groups of visitors that were coming through zencity and they were also experiencing just as many frustrations  I was unable to get into my unit because their instructions on getting in did not work  The intercom and code did not work  After over an hour of not being able to get in  they set up another code for me to get in and that still didn t work  The floor was sticky and there were dirty utensils in the drawer 
750355367,Cool vintage setting  We loved the amenities and the location  Thank you for having us  We weren t informed about an important event that would taking place right next to our room  A photo op was set up right in front of our door  There was glass shattered in the room and we kept stepping on those glass shards everywhere 
750041450,The location is great  You truly cannot beat it  The restaurant downstairs  Canary  was absolutely amazing  We ate there twice  The apartment however was dirty and the bathroom door doesn t shut  The walls had dirty marks on them and there was random pennies and coins on the floor and Bobby pins on the window  Overall  the apartment did not feel clean  The tv also didn t turn on to anything other than a screen that said  fbi cam  so that was extremely weird  We tried to have the tv issue fixed and we tried to address the issue of cleanliness and the owner was extremely rude  Such a disappointment because we truly thought it was an amazing location  The lack of help was extremely frustrating and the apartment was not clean at all 
748943237,We had a total of   people with no music getting noise complaints  We kept volume to a minimum  Left the same day in case of additional charges for noise because we wanted to be respectful  Overall disappointed we couldn t stay at the place I purchased  We had a total of   people with no music getting noise complaints  We kept volume to a minimum  Left the same day in case of additional charges for noise because we wanted to be respectful  Overall disappointed we couldn t stay at the place I purchased 
748501448,location is nice  bed was comfy  other than that the rooms seemed unclean towels were out of place and smelled dirty  also hair on sink and tub
748367538,Room was not clean and not equipped as advertised  Floor hadn t been vacuumed  Trash under the bed and dresser  Hairs on the sheets and towels  No duvet on the bed  no extra blankets  No coffee maker    Rooftop area is not as pictured  no cushions on seats  Both the rooftop bar and the lobby are still under construction and I never saw anyone at the front desk    Messaged the company through airbnb at   pm upon arrival and at   am the next day still had no response  Both times I called I was out on hold for    minutes before someone spoke to me and then there was no clear timeline on when the issues would be addressed  Ended up asking for a refund and leaving two days early  Would not recommend  Not inspecting the room before checkin  During Covid  Really   The lack of clean and the lack of communication were both infuriating  I didn t feel safe or comfortable during my stay  Please get housekeepers who thoroughly clean and have your manager inspect the rooms before arrival and please please answer the phone promptly instead of routinely having a    minute  hold  time before you even speak to a guest  Disgusted and disappointed  Rooftop was not as pictured  no cushions on chairs and no instructions on how to access  No signage on property to direct either  Hairs on both sheets and towels  Stains on pillowcase  Makeup stain on wall in shower  No can liner in bathroom trash can  Floors not vacuumed  Trash on floor under bed and dresser  Messaged the host through AirBnb immediately on arrival about the apartment not being clean at   pm and at   am the following day I still did not have a response  Called twice to try to get the apartment clean and both times I was on hold for    minutes before someone answered the phone  Apartment not as pictured  No duvet on the bed  no extra blankets or pillows  No soap in the bathroom  Coffee maker incomplete so it didn t work  Apartment not clean upon arrival  Host hard to reach  Will not be staying again  don t bother coming here 
748273804,A nice property for ONE person   Conveniently located   The building entry process is not the most efficient   Security is good  A nice property but customer service remains paramount   Two days in trying to get into the property is absurd  I did not feel a sense of urgency from your team to rectify the issues at hand  Apartment much smaller than pictures show   Insufficient towels and linen provided   Kitchen utensils greatly lacking  A very nice washer and dryer somewhat offset linen challenges  Extreme difficulties checking in   I had to get a hotel for two days because the lock box was inaccessible and no keys were available  Multiple texts and phone calls required to get issues rectified   People were ver cordial but response times were poor  Nice location  Convenient to downtown and highways  Nice fitness facilities added value 
747966333,Waited an hour upon arrival for the apartment to be clean from the previous guest  The host said he would make a few adjustments to the trip to accommodate but there was no follow through after that  I spoke to   different  managers  of the property and they were responsive but not helpful  I do NOT recommend staying here  Host Cleaning lady was an hour late  The host was responsive but unhelpful 
747838526,good location   however this felt like an overpriced hotel room with complicated entry and subpar amenities  check in was difficult   the intercom outside to get in was finicky and didnt understand us well   there was no fob inside of the room to get in easier  the bathroom door handle fell off as soon as we got inside   bad lighting and several of the outlets didnt work  intercom didnt register our voice very well  felt like an expensive hotel room   not very homey
747460239,This location is amazing  Walking distance to great shops  restaurants  architecture  and if you are feeling up for it   museums  Not sure if it s COVID related or what  but be prepared to bring your own amenities like coffee filters  unless the ones we left are still there   there were some Splenda packets though    But with great coffee shop s near by  maybe you don t even need to worry about that  I am truly sorry about the noise complaint  Never in a million years would I think it unreasonable to do a quick workout at      in the morning  Particularly when it s raining and when there s a pandemic happening  Im not sure why someone would be so petty  Particularly to go so far as to lie about a pet being with us  I wouldn t even have a dog in my own home  let alone someone else s and without permission  Accuracy was good  Unfortunately  a lot of the reviews were pretty accurate too  There s a coffee pot but no coffee  which we figured due to reviews  but there also were no coffee filters    that alone is a blasphemous  There are nearly     filters in the cabinet now though  The bathroom was pretty clean  The kitchen at dirt on top of the fridge and we found dust bunnies or something in the cups    dust bunnies  The carpets seemed like they hadn t been vacuumed in quite some time  The cleanliness issue is largely the reason for the low rating  We were frankly a little shocked at how rough it was  The location is without doubt fantastic  But the cleanliness was shockingly bad  And the lack of basic amenities was pretty bad too  see the coffee filters comment  Another issue  we received a noise complaint after we did a workout in the middle of the day in the apartment  Had we done this in the evening or at night  I could      understand this  But there s a pandemic goin gym on  and it was raining so outside or the gym were unsafe and not viable  How can you not do a quick    min workout in the middle of the day       AM   in the comfort and safety of the space you are staying in  Prisoners even get that luxury  That said  the staff was very friendly about it  I m just shocked that the neighbors bugged out like that  And lied and said we had a dog on top of it  we had no pet   Aside from that  our stay was pleasant  Come prepared with your own amenities and prepared for absurd unreasonable neighbors and you will for sure enjoy your stay 
747080028,Good location  easy check in and out  Id stay here again because the price is right  I felt safe  etc  Just wish the place was cleaner  looked like grease on several surfaces  floors not clean   Could see greasy fingerprints on chairs  couch  etc  Floors in the bathroom and kitchen were not clean  I had to wipe my feet to put my shoes on because of something sticky on the kitchen floor   Hair on the bathroom floor  Not a big deal  but looking up from the bed I could see dust spilling over the side of the ceiling fan blades  Otherwise things were tidy enough  The price was right  Id definitely stay here again to stay within my budget  I just would hope that for a couple hundred dollars I wouldnt have to clean the place myself before I enjoy my stay  Location was great  we were able to walk to the Country Club Plaza and could have walked more places if we wanted  Easy to check in and out and I felt safe  Walls are thin so we could hear neighbors moving around and doing laundry 
746594978,Probably not the best place to book  First room I showed up to wasn t clean  so the put me in a second room  which smelled like cigarette smoke  Third room was finally ok  They upgraded me to a bigger room for the trouble  Room was a little dirty and there was definitely a lack of homey ness  This place would probably be fine for a business trip or if you don t plan to spend a lot of time in the actual room  Place is in a good location too 
744611583,It was nice enough  but the walls were paper thin so a random phone call the neighbor took woke us up at  am  The walls were paper thin so lots of noises work us up all night 
744134661,      minutes to check in  The code to unlock the key box and retrieve the key was incorrect  When the host   Zen City  was contacted there was no immediate response  I then contacted AirBnb who responded promptly and tried to contact the host as well  After a long wait Zen City was contacted and they opened the box remotely  Unfortunately there was no key  I had to reach out to Zen City again and after some time they were able to find the key  Overall they were helpful but slow to respond     Kitchen sink didn t work  The water pressure was off and the water trickled out  I had to use the bathroom sink to fill a glass of water and wash my dishes  After a few days of dealing with it I contacted Zen city  They acknowledged the issue but never took care of it      The fire alarms continued to go off during my stay  Once at     am and another time at     am through     pm  When Zen City was contacted for any information on when the fire alarms would stop or if this problem was going to continue they again acknowledged my issue but never offered a solution   Despite these issues they were not completely detrimental to my stay  The apartment had a beautiful view being on the  th floor  The apartment was well furnished and had a great aesthetic  It was a quiet location and felt very clean as well  The location was walking distance from grocery store  I still would recommend to stay here despite the few rough patches  Great stay overall despite the multiple set backs  The place was furnished very well and felt very clean  Although Zen City responded to my complaints no further action was taken after acknowledging my issues  The log in number to retrieve the key from the lock box was incorrect  The host was very slow and unresponsive  I had to contact air bnb to help contact the host as well  After a   hour trip it was the last thing I wanted to deal with  Once we got a hold of the host  They took care of the situation as best as they could    The host was extremely slow in responding to the problematic check in  I had to contact air bnb to get a hold of the host     The kitchen sink water was only trickling out  I had to use bathroom sink to wash dishes and fill my water glass  I reported the issue and nothing was done     The fire alarms went off for two days in a row  Once at     am  and the next day at around     am till     pm when I left the complex  I reported the issue and asked if they had any info on the situation and when the fire alarm would turn off  The host responded and said they would look into it but never fixed the issue    Kitchen sink didn t work   Fire alarms going off for two days with no info on what was happening     The problematic    minute checkin
744076658,No communication at all   Wrong key code delayed my check in about a hour and the worst part I was woken up by pest control at    am on my second day there and they came in and sprayed while I was there in a studio   Messaged the host and told him what happen he responded asking if they sprayed I told him yes and also let him know that me and my guest left and he never responded I even messaged again later that day after I had to go check in at a hotel and he never responded  Then finally on my check out day he sent me a message saying he hoped I enjoyed my stay  No communication at all Wrong information waited about    minutes till I actually got the key Old soap marks in bath tub left Did not respond Second day I was woken up to pest control at    am and they sprayed pest control while I was there
743842462,A nice little apartment with a good city view for a decent price The stay was good  but the check in was awful  After over   hours of trying to get help  I ended up getting access to the building from another resident staying there  Check in was at  pm  and I wasnt able to access the building after  pm due to a code pad malfunction or wrong codes given to me  I had to cancel dinner reservations because I couldnt access my room  I talked to   or   different people  and they eventually stopped calling me  I needed their help to access the building due to incorrect codes given to me 
743796476,This far the worst AirBnB experience we have had    The description was wrong  and clearly this host has no quality control or check in  check out process to ensure this place is setup    No coffee maker   There was a French press  but no way to boil water    Not even a pot or kettle    We finally got a kettle after many messages    No cable Tv  Only Roku    No forks  we got some day     No designated work area      Dining table has only   chair    We only had   towels    hand towel    No oven mitts  basically you can t cook in this place   There is only   key   huge inconvenience    They keychain was a plastic straw     The bottom line in my opinion is that this is why some cities hate Airbnb    This isn t someone renting their home or subsiding their vacation home     This is a company whose mission is to complete  badly  with hotels     I would avoid ZenCity in all of their locations  Find a new business It too far too long to get responses and it was clearly nobody read what we said
743195070,Perfect location  Add elevator instructions 
742691550,Very slow to respond to messages since you cant call anyone  Place could have been clean much better  No designated parking as described   We had to switch parking spots twice because someone parked in our spot twice  When i texted zencity they replied they would remove the vehicle but they never responded back  Its a great location and also a good value  But those were the only good things No designated parking space as described You could tell the place was clean really fast and with no regard Very very slow responses  Always had to message and couldnt call 
742414630,Nice looking place  bigger than we expected  and a great location   The hosts ability to deliver on promises is not good  I have entered a      dispute with CitiBank   Host  Marty  told me in an email that I should withdraw the dispute  to make sure Airbnb doesnt give you any trouble there    Please advise what sort of trouble I might get in by disputing the charge   It sounds like a threat  but I doubt it is a threat from Airbnb  am I correct about that  Two of four burners on stove were unusable  coffee maker but no filters  reserved parking spot not enforced  Host is great saying action will be taken   Host is horrible actually taking action  Nice looking place   just the worst host we have ever had with Airbnb 
742185199,This place was very cute and in a really convenient area  However  the apartment was very dirty  I would not stay here again  Said there was  enhanced  clean  The apartment was not clean  Not clean  Dirty dishes and crumbs on the floor  Multiply hair balls throughout the apartment The apartment was super cute  but was unclean  Would not pay the price since it wasn t clean
742183587,Place was really nice for a   day stay  Close to resturants and bars also grocery stores  The apartment was as described in pics but the check in was very very confusing  I would agree with past visitors  Also getting in and out of garage was tricky  Since there was no one to actually call i had to send messages and wait for a response  Well at   pm no one wants to be waiting outside in the rain  We had to lug our luggage from the main entrence and thru long hallways just to get into the room since no garage access  Dont think i would stay here again because of lack of communication from this company
742152406,YOU WILL BE SORRY if you book this loud dump at Roasters Block   Valet  trash stinking up the hallways for days at a time   RB issue not zen city s   Parking is not included although  zen city  will claim that it is  Rude residents slamming wrought iron pool gates throughout day and night  You ll need to bring your own detergents to clean clothes and dishes   I did   Boy Scout motto   always be prepared  Avoid this place like the plague  In case you insist to try it out be sure to remove the hidden listening device  I certainly did  Don t say you were never told  Worst ABB ever  I ll gladly spend more on a true hotel room then ever book a  zencity  property in KC St  Louis or Chicago   Nothing zen about it  Disingenuous and fraudulent  I never leave a property without clean up after myself  see the reviews of me as a ABB guest prior this until now  Was no point to do so  You should fire  kristy  the maid and take your listening device with you  Nothing  zen  about it  Parking pass that was stated to be included was nowhere to be found  Because  zencity  fraudulently claimed parking was included when in fact it was NOT  They attempted to state they were  sorry for the confusion  when truly only zencity is the confused clowns  Then they tried to con me into paying over a         extra    night stay  for parking several blocks away    NO THANKS     Pictures shown were of another unit altogether of similar layout   Parking Included  was a total lie and responses were condescending  Filled with dirt and body hairs that weren t mine  Disgusting    Place stank like vomit  Left the windows open the whole time  Faceless Boston based flunkies   internet company  allowed unit not to be remotely clean although chalkboard note stated that it was  Pandemic has every corporation claiming to be throughly sanitizing every thing but dirt was evident on every surface with a quarter inch of nasty dust nearly everywhere in this downtown  loft   BRUTAL Sloppy Well it was where they said it was  Right on Broadway  Loud as hell  racing cars  sirens all night every night  to be somewhat expected I guess as it is downtown  The loft building Roasters Block allows this unit to be used for AirBB because they cannot least if long term as anyone staying there hears nothing but slamming iron gates all day and night as it faces the pool courtyard  Pool was not open btw as it was last week of winter first week of spring  The Five people that congregated by the pool sounded like a riot gone wrong    nd floor right above stereo speakers made it worse  People who have rented it for a year have broken thief lease to get out 
741579687,The place is not clean  Communication with the host is poor  I sent my concerns as soon as I checked in along with photos of the unclean areas  they offered to send out a house keeper the next day but one never came to clean and the host stop replying to my messages at that point  Photos are enhanced  Bed slept ok  Apartment complex is old  The place needs a new vacuum cleaner and the sofa needs shampooed Floors needs vacuumed  tub needed scrubbed  oven is filthy  sofa has stains and ash on it  surface tops sticky Responded to my first message about the concern on the cleanliness of the place  then stopped replying  said they would send someone the next day and never did
741571260,I d rate this a     Only thing good about the place is  Great location   nice place   The Airbnb we booked said it came with parking   Once we arrived they informed us that it doesn t include any parking   They just forgot to update their website   That was a little annoying    Main thing we look for is parking included    We drove around for awhile to find street parking    Also another thing   you can literally hear everything happening around you    Rooms very nice as shown in photos    If you don t mind hearing everything around you   maybe not getting a promised parking spot this is your place  Update your website for accurate agreements   You could hear literally everything   Place was nice at least Site said parking but actually wasn t available  Update your website information  People book with parking included  Kinda confusing when the person helping you out doesn t live in the state we re staying in   Also have a back up plan when things go wrong 
741257203,This place was ok at best   If you need a cheap place to stay then stay here   But if you are looking for hotel like qualities this is not the place for you   They can do a lot better with very little effort    It s the small things that matter and they have not yet grasped that  Things that would be helpful    A full body mirror   Non stained sheets  Matching pillows on the bed  as in the types and firmness    Two should have been one firmness and the other two the opposite firmness as the first two   Two extra towels and wash clothes   An extra blanket in the closet  A small thing of detergent or packs  Decent light fixtures in the bathroom  it was incredibly hard to see yourself in the mirror    The fixtures were utility room fixtures   Step up your game    A better bed frame   Very uncomfortable and not supportive   A COFFEE MAKER When you claim to have a  hotel  like stay it makes one think certain things   Hotels have matching pillow cases   No stains on their sheets   An extra blanket for the bed   More than two towels for their guests   Also  hotels  don t just have porn hub saved as a app on their TVs with full access   That was a grand surprise   Glad my kids weren t with me when that popped up  The floor you could tell was not swept or mopped   If it had been they did a very poor job of it   I was walking barefoot and my feet were so dirty afterwards   Also the bed sheets had stains on them  Well I thought it was a great value until I got there and realized their idea of cleanliness and mine was a really different idea   I have stayed at other places at the same cost and had a much better cleaner stay 
555066079611721310,This unit looks good in pictures but the building it is located in is really not nice  There was trash all over the grounds including the entryway and elevators  The hallways smelled horrible and the smell leaks through the door into the unit    Zencity staff are very responsive via messaging but there s no way to tell via this listing how rough the location of this unit is  We will not stay here again  We were really disappointed with how much worse this unit was compared to the photos and description on air bnb    The apartment grounds had trash spread all over the grass outside  entryway and elevators  The hallways smelled awful and the smell leaked through the door to our unit    When we arrived  half the lights in the building didn t work  The sheets had stains on them and the unit was clearly very old    We didn t feel very safe in this location either    The listing doesn t address the roughness of the building or the area and we would not recommend this unit to anyone else 
554381501648889646,The bed was really comfortable and it was very close to where I needed to be but they charged me     for a dirty sink that was there before I got there The bed was really comfortable and it was very close to where I needed to be but they charged me     for a dirty sink that was there before I got there
497889865161733681,My car was stolen while parked in front of the entrance   This listing does not include parking in the garage or gated area   I should ve NEVER stayed here   What a mess  My car was stolen while parked in front of the building   Right next to the entrance   Unacceptable   
745490965,Great place to stay  The only downside was the washer wasn t working   
744687767,We had an issue with parking  If you book here  make sure you get your correct parking spot that is assigned to your room  Obviously we were disappointed in the stay  I hadnt mentioned to you yet that there was no hot water  The parking situation was frustrating to say the least  It definitely could have been prevented  I appreciate the gesture of reimbursement but it still didnt cover the cost of the tow and theres no way you could compensate for me not being able to get to work on the morning that it was towed  the time and resources it took for me to find where my truck was and go get it  It was      and they only accept cash  Im trying to communicate this to as directly and straight forward as possible without being unreasonable  I hate to say this was by far the worst Air B B experience I have had  I ill not post that publicly though 
744609744,This was a disappointing stay  We were supposed to stay   nights but left after the first night because the place was so dirty   We feel like this was falsely advertised for its cleanliness and the reviews all talked about how clean it was too  The place was dirty in a way that felt like it hadnt been deep clean ever  We reached out to the owners and they did respond and offer to have it clean for us but it wasnt one thing that was dirty  We felt too uncomfortable there to stay another night  The whole place was dirty  The description talked about how clean it was and that they were doing extra clean because of COVID  I feel like the reviews are false too because they all talk about it being clean and it was NOT   It was dirty in a way that shows it is not clean well ever   We actually left after the first night because we of the dirt 
507210434676810344,Everything was great besides the hiccups with the door code throughout the duration of my stay  Other than that great location  true to images and safe environment  Thanks for a great stay  everything was great besides the hiccups with the door code throughout the duration of my stay  Other than that great location  true to images and safe environment 
504468560596773211,Gross  This place literally wreaked of human feces  It filled the lower floors and slowly the upstairs  We left because of how bad the stench was  We tried multiple times for them to make it right and refund us  even brought in Airbnb  they couldn t be bothered to respond in a timely way  They also wouldn t respond to Airbnb outreach  DO NOT STAY HERE  Or if you do  go in eyes wide open  You re paying for the photos  not the accommodations  Stay away    Worst experience ever  You should be ashamed of yourselves for how bad the smell was  how bad your communication is  and your inability to connect with Airbnb  Literally  if will disparage your company any chance I get 
744094927,Bathroom had a terrible odor  hair on pillows  dirty counters 
510936149111642621,Place was great there is little parking though especially if there is an event at uptown  The worst thing was check in and the call box for us  They didn t relay the information to the maid of being another check in at    we got there around    and the key was missing from the box which ended up being that the maid still had the key 
552857602859072002,Stay away from this place dont spend your money here very very outdated no Central air   The radiators made noise the entire time I was there  No sleep bed was not comfortable bathroom was disgusting they need to replace the sink and the bathtub and the flooring in the kitchen and the bathroom  I took us over   hours to get into the unit because the keypad was not working properly and no maintenance to help  We were sweating our butts off the first two days we were there because we could not figure out the radiators and no maintenance to help us The last day we were there they wouldnt come on at all so we froze and they constantly made loud annoying noises  The dishwasher is sticking out in the middle of the kitchen because it was not installed properly  The freezer and fridge were dirty and rusted Soooo many issues  This property needs major updates  unit is very outdated  radiators were too hot and couldnt figure them out and last night they didnt work at all  radiators were constantly making loud noises dishwasher needs to be installed properly  bed not comfortable  need dresser in bedroom  need new flooring in kitchen and bathroom and tub and sink need to be replaced in bathroom  and bathroom needs to be painted
742697878,The place is in a good location and we found street parking easily available  The kitchen was fully equipped and there was a comfortable desk for working  However there was strong smell that we had to manage with candles windows  The dishwasher and garbage disposal was not working and we contacted the owners and received no response  The washer and dryers are extremely loud and felt uncomfortable running it due to the noise to neighbors  Overall mixed experience  would have appreciated more transparency about the condition of the home  Smell
471019005227044425,Key fob was nowhere to be found which made it extremely difficult to get in and out of building  The entrance you are told to use is not the correct one  Additionally  communication was terrible  Responses all seemed automated with no real information to questions and response time was a day later  Communication was good until the stay  some help would ve been appreciated  Not having a key fob made the whole experience very difficult 
742364970,Wouldn t recommend Bad door man Door man at building was a creep 
742151737,I would not stay here ever again  Terrible communication  cold water in the mornings  they towed our rental car from the garage for no reason  refused to put us in touch with the on site property management to problem solve the situation  the common areas and elevators were disgusting  there was a constant cloud of weed and cigarette smoke  and the building was routinely left unsecured  I sincerely hope someone with some decision making capability reaches out to me soon so we can rectify this situation before I need to take it further  Every time I messaged the host to voice a concern I was connected with a different person who was not up to speed on any of the issues that we were dealing with  It was even more difficult to get someone on the phone  Texting is not the most effective or efficient means of communication especially when you are working      days teaching and presenting to several hundred attendees   With regard to the hot water issues  we had very early mornings because of the conference we were presenting at across the park at the St  Louis Union Station Hotel  The second or third time that we notified Zencity about the issue we had explained that the water was cold early in the morning and would be fine later in the day  They sent another person to our rental while we were AWAY without notifying us that they would be there  and our personal items and equipment were un secured   Zencity REFUSED to put me in touch with the on site building manager so we could problem solve the issue of them towing our rental vehicle   The fact of the matter is  there is ZERO guidance in the rental or in the house rules manual with regard to a specific parking space within the parking garage  There was zero signage or warning about having your vehicle towed if it was in the wrong parking spot  The parking pass was visible on our vehicle and it had several numbers on it  not to mention that the garage is a key card key fob secured structure with garage doors  By the way  the key fob also had a number on it that did not correspond with the apparently  assigned  space either   In fact none of the numbers visible on the pass  fob  or apt  appeared to correspond with any of the parking spaces in the garage  The garage was never full and it did not appear that spaces were specific to the cars in the garage as every time I parked there I observed different cars parked in different spaces   Here is how the situation should have been handled   If I was parked in someones space then when that person contacts the building manager and let them know someone is in their space   The building manager would then see that the pass hanging in the mirror shows that the vehicle does belong in the garage  and furthermore  the driver must have had a key fob to gain access   They would then cross reference the pass number to find the Apt    that it belongs to and then Zencity would have reached out to us to say   Please move your vehicle to the assigned spot  XXX    Instead  someone gave the tow company access to private property and towed our rental car  We have been incurring late fees  towing fees  and daily rates since then  even though we have been gone since the   th  Budget still has not been able to recover their car from the tow yard  We also were unable to rent another vehicle because of this so we had to pay additional money to get an Uber Lyft to make our flights when we checked out   So now here is how I am rectifying the situation  Airbnb   Zencity owe my business SLC Squared for time lost  we missed meetings the day we had our car towed  so that will be at our normal hourly consulting fee   Budget Rental Cost  Tow Fees  Budget Administrative Fees  and Uber Lyft fees  Also  we are disputing the charges for our stay as it was not what we thought we were paying for   I will be providing invoices for the substantiation of those costs incurred from Airbnb Zencitys negligence and I will be sending a bill to be paid Net     Late fees will be assessed as necessary as we will be having late fees assessed to us until the bill to Budget is paid  If necessary we will pursue civil action  I would prefer not to do that The access points to the complex were supposed to be secure but it was hit or miss if the doors were actually secured  There were several instances where they would be propped open  The outside and common areas of the location was gross  The elevators would have trash bags stacked against them for hours on our floor  Whenever you were in the lobby or on our floor it smelled like cigarette and marijuana smoke  One morning there was a whole to go box of food that was strewn all over the elevator and it was not clean up until the next day and even then there was food that still remained from it  Also  smoke and smells would come into the listing through the vent in the kitchen  Every time I messaged the host to voice a concern I was connected with a different person who was not up to

significant amount of money and lost time 
741954799,Unable to enter the interior door   messaged the Airbnb several times and no remedy  I was not able to enter the interior door 
524090834150844082,I did not check in to this reservation  Made reservation   hours prior to arrival   The strict reservation policy is a money grab  The location was not safe  I did not know this until I arrived   Did not feel comfortable here  Will stay away from Zencity reservations for the foreseeable future as well as pay closer attention to any hosts with strict reservation policies   Even airlines give a person   hrs to change a reservation before you are locked in  Airbnb has really changed not as awesome as it use to be  Guests pay attention 
741584952,The building has great access to Forest Park and the Central West End  There was plenty to do walking distance for the weekend  The check in process was very easy and exactly as described in the email I received prior to check in  The doorman at the building was also helpful and seemed to have a lot of knowledge on the rentals in the building  The apartment was clean  had plenty of linens and the kitchen was stocked with the essentials except a way to make coffee  There are coffee shops within a mile walk  My only issue was the noise  There was no way to sleep due to another apartment on the same floor  The doorman does not work overnight so I attempted to message Zencity through the website but never received a response  I did speak with the doorman the next morning but the apartment was another Zencity rental and not a permanent resident so there was nothing they could do  Overall  it was a nice space for a weekend and exactly as the description and pictures state  I sent a video and email regarding the unbelievable noise in the room down the hall that went on until after   am  It was awful with yelling  screaming  door slamming  alcohol  and weed  There was no one in the building to contact and I received no response to my message  It was disappointing because the buidling is in a great location and everything else was exactly as expected  Communication was great initially  I was able to check in as soon as the room was ready and was given clear instructions on how to check in and find the building including parking  I reached out regarding the noise levels and still have received no response 
741574721,It was a nice space  very clean  good amenities  Location is great   walking distance to many restaurants  coffee shops  whole foods  the park  science center  and zoo  Easy entry and clear communication  HOWEVER  and we seem to be alone in this opinion based on other reviews but  it was hard to sleep in this apartment  There are sirens at least once a night  its very close to the hospital   Theres an old building clanking that happens randomly throughout the night and woke me up every couple hours  The temp was warmer than were used to    F  and theres no thermostat in the apartment  just a ceiling fan and AC  The above problems are obviously not anything the host can change but the biggest reason for my insomnia was probably the pillows  Theyre big and puffy and strained my neck  There were four pillows and all were the same  I might be alone in my pillow preference  I just wish there were different options  Keep in mind  Im a very easy sleeper  If sleep is important to you and you have similar preferences  I would not recommend this apartment  Im sorry for the average review but it was just not an easy place to sleep in  which was the main thing we needed it for  I want be honest so others know what to expect  Some of the things you cant do anything about   the hospital sirens  the random clanking throughout the night  the warm temp with no option to adjust  But the one thing I wish you would do is offer more than one type of pillow  You gave us   pillows each but they were all the same kind   very big and thick  I ended up folding up the wool blanket and putting it in a pillow case  This was more comfortable than the huge pillow that strained my neck all night but I still woke up often  The rest of the amenities were perfect  which is why I still scored it high in the category breakdown  We did not consider the proximity to the hospital  It was a nice area but sirens were guaranteed every night
741049325,Great stay  Old cigarette smoke old building smell  Didn t like how the bedroom had no tv  Large window in the living room has a crack causing wind draft  Thin walls  Bedding wasn t clean  Stain on pillowcase and bath towels were damp 
540633885631512142,Bathroom not fully clean  Relatively poor communication in confirming my stay here made planning a bit of a hassle  Decent area of St  Louis   close to quite a bit 
493502459345673323,Good
740612329,The building is secure  The workout room is amazing  The distance from the elevator to the apartment is a hike  Zencitys place is purely a rental  and the cleanliness of the apartment wasnt up to my standard  but maybe my scale is off  I found long black hairs on the bed as well as short black hairs on the window sill  Several pieces of debris were laying on top of the shag carpet which let me know the space wasnt swept   I found long black hairs on the bed and short hairs on the window sill  The carpets had not been swept as I found several pieces of debris on the carpets throughout the apartment  The distance from the elevator to the apartment was a hike 
493474969370243002,   
740123595,Beautiful but not very clean 
521001525778760841,The thermostat  as other guests have noted  is a HUGE problem  My wife and I stayed in the middle of December  which it was cold  It took way too long for representatives to alter the temperature  You cannot alter it yourself because a password is required  Outside of this  it was clean and everything was accurate  The hosts have to alter this  I would not want anyone or their spouses sleeping in a jacket like my wife had to  The thermostat is a serious issue  There are other reviewers who have noted this  I stayed in the middle of December  which is the Winter in Kansas City  There is no reason why a guest should not be able to turn the heat up  especially when it is this cold outside  In addition  the apartment has many windows  which will cause even more of a draft  Honestly  outside of the thermostat and the detergent dispenser for the kitchen sink  I would have rated the stay fairly high  My wife had to go to sleep with her Nike jacket on as a result of how cold it was  The customer support staff took way too long to get back with us in terms of remotely altering the temperature  I did mot even feel a need to ask to turn it up again as a result of how long it took the last time 
522412410763508653,The location of this Air bnb was amazing  However  the toilet had mold in it  the tv didn t work  and one of the living room curtains was stuck  making our room cooler than we wanted  Their communication was fast  but constantly was with a different representative  I was told they would send someone to clean the toilet and that never happened  The location of this Air bnb was amazing  However  the toilet had mold in it  the tv didn t work  and one of the living room curtains was stuck  making our room cooler than we wanted  Their communication was fast  but constantly was with a different representative  I was told they would send someone to clean the toilet and that never happened 
512335728287728073,When we arrived  they could not find the key  We had to stand for a good half hour before they sent us to our room without a key  We then had to wait another hour for then to get us the key  Terrible check in to start with   Then the place was dirty  with food crumbs on the carpets  stains on the floor  a hair tie under one of the chairs  The bed sheets and towels had some hair on them   They were however very responsive 
478939613534017870,The cleanliness of the apartment was not up to par  The apartment was not very clean when we checked in  It looked clean but when you put your hand on the counter it felt dirty  The towels smelled  The room smelled like smoke 
471662771457822221,Getting inside and getting the key was like being in an escape room  maybe some people will find it fun  I didnt really  I asked if someone can help me secure my bags for the   hours before check in  early check in wasnt possible  and neither was anyone making an effort to just stash my bags  The apartment is so minimully decorated its incredibly uninviting  I was extremely dissapointed no one seemed to be willing to make any effort to at least secure my bags while I waited the couple hours for my room  I was told that the room was occupied the night before  but according to the chaulkboard in the room it was last clean weeks ago  The apartment is so barely decorrated that it makes it not feel hospitable at all 
531124280502654899,This listing was not as described at all  No washer and dryer  it was unclean  furniture was literally thrown in place  no coffee maker  if you see it listed as available it s most likely not available  Heads up choose the other place you were looking at 
469561786201500816,This place was really dirty I don t think it was clean at all  Would not stay here again  Building is under construction This place was really dirty I don t think it was clean at all  Would not stay here again
490575052972643293,For the price  the room had a lot of issues  No hot water  Toilet leaked and the heater was loud  Also it smelled bad  Not to mention you could hear everyone around us in the building  fighting  yelling  kids running around an lots of bumping from upstairs  I was not happy    The place had a foul sulfur like smell  Only had hot water for a few minutes the first night and none at all after that  The toilet leaked after flushing and the heater in the front room was loud 
502933903953743637,Bright and large but very sparsely furnished   Location is excellent  beds and linens are high quality  Kitchen has basics but very much basic  The place was NOT clean   There was junk around the kitchen sink drain  hair in the LR carpet and dirt and hair under the tub  We put up with it but it was bordering on gross 
455753526191253249,BEWARE   I really wish I could write a better review  We booked this place starting on a Wednesday that went through to Monday and had planned to work from the apartment during the week  Unfortunately  when we got there  we found the router completely disconnected from the wall and the power supply in the night stand  The Ethernet port was actually just a large hole in the wall  I contacted them multiple times throughout the stay  The place is hosted by a management company  Each time we contacted them  we were responded to by a new person who hadn t read the previous communication  We were told that our issue would be escalated to management on Saturday  But I guess they decided that since we were checking out Monday morning  we were no longer worth their time  Bc even after me reaching out several times  we never heard back  The location is amazing  I wonder if the actual owners of this apartment knows how poorly their place is being managed  Oh  and there is only one mirror in the entire three bedroom place  If they just put one more mirror in there  it would make the whole place better  I really wish this could ve been resolved without me having to write a bad review 
504413484830757451,Nice apartment  good decoration and style  Key missing items   coffee pot   totally essential for us   broken microwave   no shampoo and shower gel  No functioning sink in our bathroom   After a lot of message we managed to get a coffee pot and some shampoo on day    of a   days stay  Zen city answering our messages kindly   but no action   not quite the spirit of Airbnb I feel Too many issues during the stay  All  reported immediately but not addressed until the very end of the stay and partially
536221601339888199,Pros  location  kitchen  laundry Cons  temperature control Temperature outside in the teens when I arrived  No heat on in the room  window unit poorly insulated  Took over   hours  after turning on the heat before I removed my winter coat and gloves  Second night room stayed much warmer  Suspect the room below had an occupant who had its heat on  Blinds broken in places and insufficient against city lights to provide a dark room  Heavy curtains could provide both warmth and darkness  Nice kitchen  laundry  bed  bedding  reading chair  Bathroom decor upgraded  but edges raw and room very cold  Door trim paint flaking off and badly stained from room into laundry  bath area and not possible to close  Overall effect a bit like lipstick on a pig 
541359032835069807,Great location and spacious   We enjoyed our stay  We really love the place but it was SUPER frustrating when we had an issue and need to reach someone at Zencity   Im not sure it is even possible to do so without being logged into AirbnB which was not possible at the time 
490552340925534308,Spacious and great location  However   could have been more clean  Sheets  counters  bathroom surfaces were clean but floors and basebords were grimy  Window blinds were torn up  a door was broken off it s hinges   no hot water in one of the bathrooms  no furniture to unpack luggage  Received a noise complaint for simply laughing  talking in the living room at night  Overall got the job done but unfortunately this property doesn t deserve a good review  Back bathroom had no hot water and door was broken  Window blinds in very bad shape and missing pieces  Overall cleanliness lacking
529702906811153993,I ve had better stays with Zencity  The walls are thin and the people at the Airbnb across the hall let their baby scream and holler all night  Also  I did not receive an access code upon arrival  so I had to wait about    min before I could actually check in  customer service had to call me back  and my access code was also changed in the middle of my stay I ran to the store just to come back and discover that I was locked out  I had to call customer service back and wait about    min just to be let back into the apt with a new access code    Other than that the stay was fine    Also  there s no washer and dryer  the laundry room is downstairs  I found a bug in the sink on the last day  I think you all should exterminate    Also  check in was difficult and you all changed my access code in the middle of the stay which was inconvenient
475339049082926294,I would stay here again  but that s me  so that is what this review will be based on  because you might want a different experience   It was difficult to get past the secure entrance  but once you did  using the key fobs was kinda great  I wish I had them at my house   The location was great for us  because there was a coffee shop  an awesome coffee shop  right next door  good and great restaurants within     blocks  a vintage clothes store  a few bars  and other businesses  At night this section of Broadway seemed a little sinister  and loud with sirens  but during the day  it was people taking walks  shopping  and getting coffee   The apartment functioned pretty well  low water pressure in the shower  a bulb was out  The bed was really comfortable and the bedding pillows were nice   In an apartment building  you hear your neighbors  and you smell their food  If this isn t what you are used to  or don t want  be ready  Another note  other apartments in this building are used for vacationers  so you don t have to feel like an interloper   Finally  as I said  this worked for us  but it s loud at times  It s Kansas City though  one of the greatest cities in the US  get out and enjoy it  Hi Zencity    your checkin process was really hard  We followed all the steps you sent and they didnt work  We finally just entered a random number that showed up on the intercom box and thankfully it worked  The intercom readout was hard to read because it was broken and crooked and showed only a portion of the information  It was stressful and a difficult way to start our weekend  Also  this is a small thing  but some of the blinds were broken in the apartment and some of the lights didnt work  Also  every air bnb Ive ever stayed at  and there have been many  has included coffee and a a drip coffee maker  We used the french press  but it seems like a small thing you could include for your guests  We really liked the location and once we got the key fobs everything worked fine 
452834399380772005,The studio is fine and clean  but if you need any help don t expect anyone from this corporate company to support you or have any real human interaction  Customer service takes days to get back to you  Limited flexibility  Communication the entire tire was terrible  extremely delayed and my questions left unanswered  When I called I did not get a response  rates per night fluctuated grately and there is no humanness to the experience I will never stay at a corporately owned Airbnb experience  not only are you contributing to high rent prices ans gentrification but your customer service and value is terrible 
510918785130318501,DO NOT BOOK DO NOT BOOK DO NOT BOOK  First off the box that you have to put the code in to access building didnt work  I brought my work clothes and my childs clothes the dryer didnt work  I would have booked a nice loft on Washington if i knew the washer dryer aint work  The microwave didnt work when my daughter went to warm up her food  I didnt trip off of any of it i let it slide i didnt bother the host     THE SHOWER DIDNT WORK   That was a deal breaker for me i wrote them about it at     pm it took for me to call them around  pm for them to finally respond with NO SOLUTION  This was unbelievable i have never had issues booking an airbnb  I felt like I was in an apartment in the HOOD  And it stank when you walk in   I hope they refund me at least one night since they kind of did mess my whole weekend up  The only good thing about this place was that everybody was LOUD AF so it was cool that my kids didnt have to stay quiet  Fuck off
528327258849329299,the kiosk for the key did not work  my room was dirty  there was drugs and drug paraphernalia in my room  the floor was flooded from sewage water  they did not get me a new room by the end of the night  and the next day they accused me of breaking the refrigerator  I will never stay here again  I strongly suggested if anybody stays here that they do a walk through first  maybe before you accuse people of breaking things in an apartment  maybe you should make sure the door wasnt left open for housekeeping staff to come in  and perhaps it would be a good idea for you to actually check the rooms before checking in a guest  that way theyre clean and dont have drug paraphernalia  being forced to be around drugs is not something that I appreciate and not something that I should have ever had to deal with in my life coming to you 
525549931873763748,There was feces on the floor when we entered the building  We were in the unit less than    minutes   roaches took over the kitchen  We left immediately and they refused to give us a full refund  We sent pictures of cock roaches in our unit and feces on the floor as we entered the building  We requested a full refund in the amount of      and was only given     
532642464069292872,The space is great and exactly as advertised  The lack of response from Zencity about a maintenance issue was surprising and disappointing  The kitchen sink didn t work and despite messaging the host  Zencity   there was no resolution to the issue  No sink and no dishwasher made it really challenging to use the kitchen  Four days of receiving  we ll get back to you  messages is unacceptable  Your inability   or unwillingness   to resolve the maintenance issue was really disappointing and an inconvenience 
481103518880649560,Convenient location right above the L  also comes with train station announcement noise   easy self checkin  others fine  Sliding glass door on shared balcony did not have complete blinds  so neighbors on their balconies could look in on the bedroom at night  Many blinds panels missing from the blinds on the balcony sliding doors   did NOT feel safe to have neighbors the on the shared balconies able to look in at the bed at night  Also  inability to deadbolt the unit door was not great either 
495028752403261528,Needs better parking instructions  Host controls climate in apartment area  No television in small bed room area  just dinning area only  I was also told about noise complaint  Which funny that all happened the night of me canceling my reservations early  when in fact I did not have any loud music on and it was around     pm before   pm quite hours  You will do better just getting an hotel in that city  Area need to be climate controlled by person only  Needs specific parking instructions included  Faster response from host   Add television to bed room wall not just dinning area 
385402203993944298,Place was filthy when we arrived and reeked of marijuana smell  Toilet seat actually had fecal splash on it  Kitchen had dirty pans  Kitchen is poorly equipped if want to actually cook  Apartment is totally dead for Verizon cellular phone but at least provided wifi was reliable  We saw at least two centipedes and a couple mosquitoes in the apartment  Once we clean the apartment ourselves and the marijuana smell finally faded location was quiet and convenient for Hyde Park  Zen responds quickly to emails but no follow through on anything that needs action  Building code stopped working a full hour prior to check out time  Luckily one of us had stayed behind to let others back in  Our first and probably last Airbnb experience  Your leaving us a dirty apartment that reeked of marijuana smell for the first two days was no appreciated  Also blowing us off on our request for waive of clean fee is crap on your side 
541371636621199106,Our stay was pretty good with Zencity  The location was unbeatable  despite having limited access to free parking  The desk attendants were all sooooo wonderful and kind  Check in was easy as well  We had continued issues with several outlets not working  as well as the oven and microwave  which made it difficult to reheat leftovers we had  We also had ice cold showers  I ended up washing my hair in the sink because I couldn t tolerate being entirely in the shower with how cold it was  Overall good stay and worked for us as we were mostly out and about  but definitely some comfort measures to improve upon Hello    We had continued issues with several outlets not working  as well as the microwave and oven  We also had two nights of ice cold showers
521746462217365794,This apartment is in a great location but since it is on a more commercial street  the business signage and street lights are pretty bright  The bedroom windows face the street and the blinds and curtains dont do a very good job of keeping the light out  The apartment is quite sparsely furnished and is on need of a thorough clean  The apartment location is great  The space needs a detailed clean and a paint refresh   Good quality blackout curtains in the bedrooms are really needed  I was able to read a book in the bedroom at night with the lights off  some sort of shelving unit in the living room to hide the internet modem router would be good  The rug has been tripped over on one corner so many times ti now always sticks up and is a trip hazard  Alsosome sort of luggage racks would be nice 
530501881115048726,Cleanliness was not up to standards  floors  kitchen surfaces  refrigerator  sinks  furniture  and place smelled like smoke   The front intercom system was broken communication through AirBNB system  if we would ve showed up at  pm or after no entry would ve been granted  No parking pass  thermostat is controlled by nest and once again communication through the app to get someone on site to adjust temp  It s a basement unit so was dry no circulation and hot  very uncomfortable   The blinds do not close      and bc this unit is ground literally sidewalk level no privacy bc of this issue   No actual running kitchen water hope you like making trips to the bathroom to wash dishes  Terrible  Reference messages sent
505813939080964019,This apartment is in a great place just west of the Country Club Plaza    I wanted a quiet place due to the holiday season  and Christmas lighting ceremony   A very quaint spot hidden off the quirky yet neat little roads in this neighborhood   Easy access for someone who is fit to walk to the Plaza area    The parking spot for this apartment is small  not sure if a big car or truck would fit   Good thing I drive a medium to small automobile   The brick steps were loose and gave way on the walk downstairs to the apartment building  ouch  but Im OK  really  with neat little French doors with a touch lock   Cute mid   s charm one bedroom with small shower bathtub   Missing one pane of the plastic nylon vertical shutters to outdoor balcony where I immediately made the acquaintance of a nice little kitty poop   Did I mention that the towels that were set out for me smelled like cigarette smoke   Yes  unfortunately they did   Shame  I really wanted to give you a   star rating because of your swift email correspondence   Respectfully submitted  Clementine Nice location    Fast email service   Towels that were set out smelled of cigarette smoke   Blinds dont shut all the way and one panel is missing   Cat poop     left on balcony  and brick walkway a bit dangerous and bricks on steps were not cemented in and fell as I walked down them to get to apartment   Also if you have a big car  parking spots are small and only allow for one parking spot  though it is free 
455748720919576389,STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNIT   WATCH OUT FOR FAKE REVIEWS    This place was a dump and the photos of the unit are from years ago  The unit came with   less sofa then pictured in the description  It also came with a dog bed that was supposed to pass as a place for a human to sleep    Be careful coming up the stairs as the handrail is loose and some of the wall anchors are coming out of the drywall   Theres was dried blood on a few of the walls of the unit when we checked in  There is no WiFi as advertised with the unit  The place comes with the minimal amount of bedding blankets  pillows  many without covers   and towels    I made multiple requests to management and to improve our stay  Management usually took over a day  sometimes    to respond to any of my requests  I was told I could go out and buy the things I requested    The outdoor heater is broken  the record player is broken  the outdoor furniture is filthy and most of the pillows in the living room are stained  I could go on and on  stay away from this sh t hole  This was hands down the worst Air B   B Ive ever booked 
486150547575645369,Be sure to check ahead of time if the call box to get in works  Otherwise you will have to rely on people leaving the building to let you in  The check in was awful  I had to rely on people to come out by chance to let me in  After multiple phone calls  still no resolution after two days  Other than the shower light fixture crashing down and barely missing my head  the actual room was awesome  I really do think a refund or discount of some kind is warranted for all the trouble 
539157559557596502,Whew  I wish I had believed the reviews when they said the check in process was a hassle  To start it off  our garage opener wouldnt work  Luckily a kind resident used his for us on his way out  Once we parked  which ends up being the  th floor  you have to find the door leading to the main building  once you go through the door you walk around which felt like a maze to find the elevator and take to the  th floor which felt like a maze to find our unit  luckily our code worked but for the remainder of our trip  with contacting the front desk  them giving us a spare one that ALSO didnt work  trying to explain to the host but no solution was given  we never had the garage opener work so we had to either wait for another resident or park on the street and ask the front desk to come out and open the garage door for us  it was very frustrating because it was such a hassle entering the garage  Other than the lack of timely communication from the host  we liked the unit  it was clean but beware the toilet clogs easily and when I messaged the host for the maintenance number  I never received it  luckily it was the morning of check out  upon checking out  the rules say to leave the card key in the unit but you need it to get to the  th floor and for the door to get out into the parking garage so what we did was have   person bring the car to the front and the other go back and drop the key off  when my friend got back to the unit   the clean person was already there and said to just leave it at the front desk  we were hesitant because thats not what the rules were so I messaged the host again and they just said  thanks for letting us know   they need to update their rules and have better instructions on how to find the unit from the garage  ultimately  it is in a central location and the parking being included is great but there was too much hassle to get in and out of the buidling each time  Very good location but the check in instructions need to be explained better  please include the maintenance and front desk number so we can call with any emergencies 
491323824649045225,Dirty  old but good location  Blood on bathroom floor  Smoke alarms were removed from ceiling  unable to turn heat off  Shower unsafe  Bathroom floor had blood on it 
485435348249614453,The apartment itself is fine and the location is good  The apartment is managed by a company and not an owner who is invested and it shows  We never received confirmation that the original keys to the apartment were found  we used a back up set since the key box was empty  and we were never given a pass to get in out of the building to access the apartment  The fire alarm was chirping when we first came in  No one fixed or addressed issues after being asked multiple times  We were told that no one would enter the apartment   the previous renters  probably had the keys     Good apartment but would not stay with this company again  Resolutions need to be more swift  If someone stays at an apartment building they should be able to come in and out of the building  A card to access the building was never provided 
500774842037690636,Great location  Cute apartment  I was a disappointed that the amenities included  cable tv and there was none   Also  there was a smoke detector chirping in the hall   I was assured someone would come out to fix but nobody ever showed up   Next to the couch is a large heat register   This needs to be clean   It had clumps of dust all over it 
521734416491433743,Great price   However the dirty towels piled on the floor  dirty sheets   and trash cans not empty after a   hour drive was a bit irritating  Definitely not very clean  Price was great  However the towels were still dirty and piled up in the bathroom  trash cans weren t empty and sheets were dirty 
510157780015856521,This was   without a doubt   the worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had    Zencity provided an incorrect door code and thus I was left stranded in a hallway that smelled of garbage masked with weed at midnight  After reaching out to ask for a new code  radio silence  I heard back from them at     am  which was just someone asking  If I had gotten in alright   without even including a new door code or any acknowledgement that their failure to provide the correct door code had left me locked out  I found a hotel with an available room  booked it  and when I woke up wrote to Zencity to request a refund and a cancellation of my two day reservation  which they refused to provide  They then said that they hoped to be able to provide me with a better Zencity experience  which clearly they did not want to provide or they would have answered my requests  I had to elevate the issue to Airbnb to get a full refund for my trip  Zencity has continued to refuse to provide a refund or compensate me in any way for the expense of the nearest hotel  I had a lovely trip  thanks to the Hoxton and the Ace hotels  I cannot stress enough how much I recommend avoiding Zencity when looking for your next Airbnb stay  Hello  I just wanted to   yet again   reiterate how terrible of an Airbnb experience this was  After you failed to respond to me as I was checking in  the response  at     am  did not even include the correct door code  And you ve continued to refuse to provide a refund  despite my requesting several times  AND I continued to receive messages from you as if everything was fine and I was able to check in  That is just terrible customer service  especially in hospitality  This is not to mention that getting into the apartment building felt unsafe and the hallway smelled like rotting garbage masked by the smell of weed 
510934479218328231,Broken glass french press  no Wi Fi  no cable  back door locked stuff  dirty and broken decor  broken lights with exposed glass   DO NOT stay here listing us not how it appears  Broken glass french press  no Wi Fi  no cable  back door locked stuff  dirty and broken decor  broken lights with exposed glass 
522683901746036416,tl dr  Avoid Zencity properties   This was my second time staying in the same unit  First booking was fine  This time  as multiple reviews have pointed out  the heater is impossible to turn off and runs full blast         By the time I checked in  not only was it always running  but it was also emitting a high pitched screeching sound  making the unit uninhabitable   I reported the issue the evening I checked in  spent one sleepless night there  and when about    hours had passed with no resolution  no maintenance sent out  I cancelled the booking and moved elsewhere   Im now close to two weeks into a fight for a refund  which they have refused  and are now ignoring my messages   My only recourse was to dispute the charge on my credit card   The whole thing was major  and completely avoidable  pain in the a    They could have sent a maintenance person  they could have moved me to another unit in the building  there were units available   or just refunded my booking  They did none of this   If youre wondering why their properties seem below market price  this is why  They buy up a ton of property then skimp on maintenance  customer service  etc  I wish I had realized this before booking 
518071120847374508,The good  The best part about this Airbnb is hands down the LOCATION  As a St  Louis native  the location is truly unbeatable  Shockingly  I was easily able to find parking every single day I was there which was very surprising given how busy the area can be  The kitchen was very nice  the studio space was very nice  big TV  nice bed  and cute chair and ottoman   Now  the not so good  The bathroom is RAGGEDY  This apartment is in a very old building and it s evident  The bathroom was almost uncomfortable to be in  It lol just looked like it was falling apart  Also  there was this weird steam coming from the bottom corner behind the bathroom door  Sounded like it was coming from a boiler room or something idk  The bathroom sink also wasn t clean properly  The washing machine didn t smell very nice and didn t get some of my clothes clean    The host  Initially  they acted like they didn t want to approve my stay because I m new to Airbnb  They told me this in a message and sort of interrogated me about the purpose of my stay  This was a little off putting and I was about to cancel and go with another place  but they approved it right before I cancelled  I liked the location so I decided to give them a try  The self check in process was very easy  I ended up needing to stay another night because I mistakenly booked my stay one night short and I asked for them to extend  This host does take a lot longer than others to respond to messages  BUT they did extend my stay  They did charge an extra     blaming Airbnb for putting the incorrect lower price  They also forgot to ensure the code to the door remained the same  so I got locked out of the apartment for a few hours which was very inconvenient    Overall  it was just okay  The location really is the selling point here 
475358878633158563,Had a ton of difficulty getting into the property  First at the building entrance  using the call box would only take you to their help line and not ask for a code like it says in their  how to get in  message  If it wasnt for other people coming and going from the building  we would have never gotten in  Secondly  their key fob system didnt work with the code that was given to us and it took    min to actually get into the room despite being in the building  Customer service times are aweful  Work on getting into the building and customer response times 
500760917147657822,Good area SMELLED VERY BAD AND THE TUB CERTAIN WAS NASTY AND DIRTY
482550346422610784,The apartment was nice but the check in process was a nightmare  We were road tripping and stopped in Kansas City just for a place to sleep  We showed up late in the night and no one answered the intercom as instructed  We would ve been stuck sleeping in our car if it weren t for a family coming in late at night  There should be a better process where the renter has freedom at night 
511577713029587983,Pretty awful experience  Room smelled like cigarettes  Wi Fi was really slow  Most people in the hotel or place never wore masks  Parking was a nightmare    Tried to talk to one of your staff members and she just made me feel stupid for not mentioning how the room smelled when I first entered    The clean fees and extra costs are really steep as well  Overall I couldn t be more disappointed with Zencity   Jerry Retired USN Pretty awful experience  Room smelled like cigarettes  Wi Fi was really slow  Most people in the hotel or place never wore masks  Parking was a nightmare    Tried to talk to one of your staff members and she just made me feel stupid for not mentioning how the room smelled when I first entered    The clean fees and extra costs are really steep as well  Overall I couldn t be more disappointed with Zencity   Jerry
429649497835950699,Firstly  we are grateful for the space as well as the hospitality of the staff    We were assured that the space was going to be clean when we entered but in reality we felt like more care could have been placed into the space   When we checked in  we found significant amounts of dust all over the picture frames  on the window sill and on the air conditioner  We had to take the liberty of wiping down every surface in the apartment ourselves    Also  the sinks faucet was detached and seemed to not be fully installed  It was an ordeal to use the faucet because we had to hold it down first before we did anything   Honestly for the price we paid  we were expecting the space to be a little more put together  At the very least  the space could have been properly and fully clean  It felt more like someone went in  saw that it hadn t been touched  made the bed and reported it clean  Firstly  we are grateful for the space as well as the hospitality of the staff    We were assured that the space was going to be clean when we entered but in reality we felt like more care could have been placed into the space   When we checked in  we found significant amounts of dust all over the picture frames  on the window sill and on the air conditioner  We had to take the liberty of wiping down every surface in the apartment ourselves    Also  the sinks faucet was detached and seemed to not be fully installed  It was an ordeal to use the faucet because we had to hold it down first before we did anything   Honestly for the price we paid  we were expecting the space to be a little more put together  At the very least  the space could have been properly and fully clean  It felt more like someone went in  saw that it hadn t been touched  made the bed and reported it clean 
479701646226894081,Believe anyone else here when they say how terrible the check in process is  It s so inaccurate  The fob in the room does nothing  The elevator in the building sometimes works with it  sometimes doesn t  The building itself only has one working elevator and there is a lot of construction going on so it s dusty  The pool is under construction so was closed    The room itself was okay  The shower did not drain correctly so you do stand in your shower water every time  The bathroom lighting is super dim to begin with and a lightbulb was out so it made it worse  There were some holes in the wall which was weird to see    You do have to type in a long code to get into your room every time which is a bit annoying  Overall  it wasn t the worst place to stay in the entire world but ZenCity needs to get it together and make some changes  Please please please update your check in instructions  Literally everyone complains about it and you ve done nothing to change it    Also there are light bulbs out  Change them  It s pretty simple 
532628652824760725,Fire alarms went off   time s during our   night stay  each during the middle of the night forcing us out of bed  Just something to be aware of  Thanks for the stay  The reason for the rating was because of how many time the fire alarms went off during the middle of the night  I understand it s not your fault  but maybe something to mention be aware of 
511648202586158860,Not a great stay unit is not clean at all  This was not a great choice to stay The stay would have been great but the room was terrible  You can tell no one is properly clean the unit  Kind of disappointed considering it was my girlfriends   th birthday  I would not return to this location
394900622998807163,I ll start by saying that I booked this Airbnb by mistake  My partner and I were traveling for a family member s funeral  and I thought I was simply sending a message  I had a question about parking  but the interface actually was a  Reserve  button instead of a  Send  button    I was on hold with Airbnb for over an hour before a senior representative said that it would be up to the host to refund me in full due to the mistake  Zencity is a company with no remorse for my situation  so they stood by their cancellation policy  I was going to lose out on a significant amount of money if I had cancelled so we decided it would be best to just go ahead with the reservation  The neighborhood  it s location to where we needed to be  and fairly easy street parking were the ONLY positives of this listing   We checked in around   pm because we were driving from NYC  We were tired from the road trip  and grieving being back in my partner s hometown  To say we needed comfortable accommodations is an understatement  We could not afford to find another place to stay given the circumstances of our visit   The apartment and building is dirty  dingy  and dilapidated  The chair in the studio is absolutely disgusting and looks to be covered in what were human fluids  I m assuming this was not checked by someone from Zencity after it was set up by whatever housekeeping company is used  The linens were not soiled and had been washed  but we still found hair  a giant ant  and light stains in the bed  dust and dirt on tables  headboard  windowsills  hair in the bathroom  the main rug is absolutely dirty and dingy  dust caked onto the ceiling fan  grease oil and food stains on the walls  The trash can in the kitchen won t close all the way  Dirty eating utensils in dusty kitchen drawers  I wish I could upload photos  We decided to sleep on top of the comforter because of how uncomfortable the mattress is and after finding a second bug  silver bug  the second night  The bed squeaks at the slightest movement and feels terrible    When notifying them about the condition of the apartment  their initial suggestion was to send a cleaner when we were not there  Were we supposed to repack our personal belongings  and lug it out and lug it back  In the middle of our visit  Or did they expect us to leave our personal things there while cleaners worked around it  Either thought is ludicrous    I requested a refund of some of the fees  and they refunded only the clean fee        I ended up buying a few sanitizing clean supplies to wipe down the surfaces that our stuff came in direct contact with  There are some clean supplies  but I barely wanted to touch anything in the room  The mop swiffer thing was as dingy and dirty as the apartment   Some of the hallway lights leading up to the room were broken  and the light sign right outside our door is broken flickering  The hallways and lobby smelled  Throughout our stay there were random pieces of trash throughout the hallways and stairway  The listing also said that this unit includes a washer and dryer  which it does not  There are communal W D on the basement ground level  When walking through the basement ground level to use the staircase by the apartment  the floor was littered with dead cockroaches  You can t make this up    On our last day night  we came back to the unit with the light switched on and we were POSITIVE that we had turned off every light  We think that someone at Zencity must have notified the cleaners to come that day thinking it was our checkout day  and they arrived  turned on the light  and quickly shut the door seeing that it was still inhabited  I don t know if this actually happened  but we KNOW we turned every light off    Please save your money  Zencity does not care about hospitality and comfort  They just want to get paid  We should have been given a more significant refund due to the condition of the apartment and building  It s absolutely disgusting  and makes it feel like you are really scamming people   On our last day night  we came back to the unit with the light switched on and we were POSITIVE that we had turned off every light  We think that someone must have notified the cleaners to come that day thinking it was our checkout day  and they arrived  turned on the light  and quickly shut the door seeing that it was still inhabited  I don t know if this actually happened  but we KNOW we turned every light off 
452911769630198399,Good location building  Parking is a little tricky  The place was not very clean when we arrived  Worked in a pinch  but would not highly recommend The place was fairly dirty when we got there
512294895098252811,the neighbors were strange and keep coming by my door  felt like everytime I left  stuff was moved around inside apartment  when I reported this to zencity  I got no reply  It was a clean apartment but parking is terrible at this location  please make sure no one can enter into a guests room with prior knowledge 
476832446329971748,Good things     Apartment and building looked like the photos   This is an old hotel that has been converted to residences and it had a charm about it   It was clean and well maintained         Security measures included card or fob to select your floor  so no one entering the building who wasn t supposed to be there could get to your floor        My floor was quiet during sleeping hours        If you do get through to customer service on a phone  they were very pleasant and they maintain a      operation for concerns   However  their ability to resolve most situations appears limited        One security guard was on rounds during early morning hours    am      Barriers to an excellent stay     Ghost host   There is no onsite or  in the area  host   Any issues one faces must be managed via text message on the AirBNB text platform   Further  there was no telephone contact provided for customer service   I had to look this up online and it took a while to find   They are based in Palm Springs CA  which was nearly      miles away from my site   And  it s clear the messages sent out prior to and after the visit are auto generated   There really is no  Ava  at Zencity  someone just copy pasted a message or pushed the  before  and  after  messages through   Low marks for impersonal service        Host does not know the property   For the conglomerate of Zencity  which apparently runs properties in Chicago  St  Louis  and Kansas City  they do not keep up with any changes to the property unless they hear about it from customers or residents   In my case      the pool had been closed by the health department   I had hoped to use the pool  as I had seen it on the photos   A kind update would have been appreciated     the original call box I was supposed to use for entering the building  at a side entrance  was disconnected and not operational   Signs had been posted directing people to go to the front entrance   Zencity customer service staff were clueless about this and asked me to text them photos    the address for the side entrance  where I was originally supposed to enter  was just plain wrong  promoting added confusion     the other call box screen at the front entrance required different codes  which I did not receive until the next day     of the two lobby elevators  one was broken down   Permanent residents did not know when the other elevator would be repaired     the area is frequented by a transient population pressing for handouts  presenting some safety concerns        Rough first day   Because of their lack of awareness  see      I was given the wrong entrance codes for the building   I spent  h upon arrival trying to contact someone  the mysterious  Ava   by text message on the AirBNB platform   I got in via a resident  who used their elevator key card to help me access my floor   The codes for my room were accurate  so at least I could get that far   However  the HID key fob they left in my room that was supposed to operate the HID panel at the building entrance  to release the door lock  was non functional   With neither a working key fob or working building entrance door codes  and no one getting back to me  I had to find other lodging that night   I eventually talked to a customer service agent by phone  but my issue was not resolved until the next day  after a    minute session over the phone    I only used   of my   prepaid nights there   A resolution for a partial refund is still pending on this matter         Residents and guests bad mouth Zencity overall   Every resident I met said Zencity was worthless and should not be running apartments there at all   Other guests using the space said the same thing   lack of response to concerns  no way to meet with or talk to a human about a problem onsite  bad key cards or fobs  inattention to building concerns  and other issues     Only   star for this property  because there are no zero stars  and because all the good things I listed above  I could get somewhere else routinely     Run away from  don t walk towards  a Zencity property   Regrettable experience  I had a very difficult experience  which can be re read on the AirBNB text platform as well as in my public review  While customer service reps were as helpful as possible over the phone  the business model you have as a remote host is not a suitable match under AirBNB  largely because you are reliant on text and email conversation  not in person communication   You are missing the point of hospitality   building relationships    I have requested a refund for the one night I was denied  as I did not receive a resolution for entering until the next morning   For the      apt at     McGee I noted the towel bar was coming loose at one end and the soap dispenser was too tall for easy use at the bathroom sink   Also  the tub did not drain well at all   Soap scum from bathing showering adhered to the tub floor and made the surface very slippery  a distinct hazard   You would do well to install an ADA bar to help with careful entering and exiting the tub  even if you clear up the slow drain   But  you would do best overall to discontinue your connection to AirBNB and pull this property off their site 
457199097010787509,The apartment was right above a Starbucks  in walking distance to Wrigley field  Great open space   the pictures dont do it justice  On days without Cubs games there isnt much to do in the area  but on gamedays the area comes alive    The only issue we had was there was no key left for us in the lockbox when we arrived  When we called to try to get it sorted  we were told they would call us back to work something out   they never did   We luckily got let in by another tenant in the apartment above us  but we couldnt leave the building because we didnt have a key to get back in  Finally    hours later    pm they told us there was a backup lockbox in the back of the building that may have another key in it   it did  Definitely frustrating to spend the day in the apartment waiting around and unable to leave    The floors are very creaky and loud  and the keypad lock on the apartment door required a    digit code to get in  It auto locks the door  so anytime you leave youll need to enter the    digit code to unlock it  Two minor bugs  but not major    Enjoyed our time here and if it wasnt for the building key snafu it wouldve been perfect

476087699611871447,Location is great  Apartment needs improvement  Hello  thank you for having us  We really enjoyed being in Kansas and being so close to everything  The apartment however could be better improved  I d like to leave the note here as I wouldn t like to leave it on public wall    The clean was not that great when we arrived  There was a lot of hair in the bathroom and also in the bed sheets  We didn t feel comfortable sleeping in the bed after we saw that but we didn t have other choice  The floor in the living room was very dusty and the carpet was stained with wine  If you look under the couch  there is still a broken wine glass there  The couch was also was stained with some white thing  I don t think the person doing the clean is looking at these thing s very well  Also  some more items in the kitchen to help us prepare a meal properly would be great  At nighttime  there was a lot of noise from some neighbors  It was al ways during    am  On Saturday night we were really scared as someone almost broke a door knocking on it  I believe it was next to us  On Friday night someone we didn t know came knocking on our door as well passed midnight  I hope you take these suggestions into consideration  It would help you grant your future guests a better stay  Thank you 
530722229389477117,expect the shittiest stay of your life  Ive stayed with you guys before and had no problems  The second time I made a reservation with you guys literally every part of it was fucked up  I was able to get through the front door of the apartment building but after that everything went to shit  Yall gave me the wrong code for the keycafe so I couldnt get my key to go any further than the lobby because you need a key fob for literally every door and the elevator  it took about   hours to get ahold of someone and finally get a key for me to use  So me and my girlfriend made our way up to the apartment  When we got to the apartment door the door wasnt locked  Instead it was open and when we walked in it was fucking disgusting there were used bandaids on the floor  the bathroom had someones hair all over the sink and toilet and shower  dirty towels on the floor  used wash rag in the shower  there was trash all over the apartment  and the bed was dirty and had obviously been slept in by someone  its was just disgusting and a horrible new years eve and experience all together
480457993936168432,Filthy and freezing is how I d summarize the stay  I have never had a negative Airbnb experience until this one  I truly feel like the other negative reviews were hidden or I somehow missed them this time   You ve been warned     Code they gave to the apartment was wrong  got locked out and took about    minutes before it was resolved  My booking also said it was for the rear apartment  but when we got there the check in instructions were from the front apartment  this matters because it s a busy street near a hospital   it was noisy     apartment was not clean  Floor was absolutely FILTHY like it had been weeks since it had been vacuumed  Dust on walls  grimy blinds  etc    biggest issue was NO HEAT  we called and messaged multiple times to let them know the thermostat was either set low  or the furnace was not working because either no air or cold air was blowing whenever the thermostat  said  it was heating  It stayed a frigid    degrees the entire weekend  They never offered to fix it    furniture was stained  greasy  broken  and basically was from a frat house or a dumpster    Terrible communication with Zencity  hours between responses  and no contact ever from the  host   If this was a much cheaper apt I wouldn t have such an issue  but this was an expensive stay for bare minimum  The worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had  Either you are ripping people off  or your management company is ripping you off 
468832631740514424,Location was good When we arrived at   for check in the cleaners were still there and said they wouldn t be done for    minutes   When we did check in  the unit was not clean   Garbage in bathroom trash cans and floors were filthy   The location is great   I think you need a new clean crew   Also  there was a letter taped on the door one day when we got back that your lease expired         and plan to vacate in December  rd   I have a copy of the letter and left it on the coffee table in the living room 
526800151336643840,I had to step over trash to get on or off the elevator anytime I left the appartment   The elevator also smelled like a trash can   The fact that the appartment had a balcony was a deciding factor in renting the room   The balcony was directly about a couple dumpsters and a grease trap   This is the first bad experience I have had renting a Air BnB  I had to step over trash to get on or off the elevator anytime I left the appartment   The elevator also smelled like a trash can   The fact that the appartment had a balcony was a deciding factor in renting the room   The balcony was directly about a couple dumpsters and a grease trap   This is the first bad experience I have had renting a Air BnB

542052435007403046,Extremely cold at night  the toilet didn t want to flush nor could i make it flush with the plugger at the end i had to put a lot of toilet paper on top and spray some perfume  It was so stinky  Bad pressure of hot water as well  Old building 
480458926705630025,Location is great  and apartment was ok but wifi never worked    Sofa is not a pull out even though I made the booking for   people Wifi hotspots didnt work and Zencity network never worked    If you allowed me to book the room for   guests the sofa needs to be at least a pull sofa   And lastly I insisted with that sofa and never got an answer   
531895280767599934,My comments were private and intended to improve the facility  Hi this is private   I don t want to leave a bad review  Most of the problems involved technology  The communication when we arrived was poor because I kept getting incomplete texts and had to communicate through the website  It was cumbersome to do outside in the freezing weather  We were never able to access WiFi in the building  even though our hostess sent us additional options  none of them worked for either of our phones  The three legged chairs were dangerous  both of us nearly tipped over when we sat down  Finally  the turf between the parking lot and building was covered with piles of dog feces  We needed to walk across the turf to avoid ice on the sidewalk but it was almost impossible to avoid the dog poop  The trash cans were overflowing and there were no bags for guests to use to scoop the poop  As we were leaving in the morning we saw a fellow clean the grounds  but it was a mess the evening before 
526819917927851184,Cute studio The stay was well overall  Whoever is doing the clean of the place is not doing a well job  The rug looked and felt dirty and there was an actual booger on the comforter on the bed 
527551838951602572,We were unable to check in and had to stay somewhere else over a simple key issue  Worst Bnb experience I ve had with a host  Customer service was unhelpful and had no clue what they were doing  Steer clear of Zencity Very disappointed with the lack of customer service and problem solving  Shame on your business

471700116592169422,Bathroom shower had hair from previous guest on the walls shower head has build up water stains garbage is not clean when you walk in it looks so tidy however they make it look good but they dont thoroughly clean  Make sure the place is clean actually go through entire place   no hair left over from the previous guest garbage can is clean not just taking the garbage bag out and replacing it 
450675928462256255,Our stay definitely wasn t a  bad  experience but for sure was mediocre compared to what we were expecting  While the building and apartment are  updated   the complex and the apartment are not  luxury  at all  It s pretty comparable to a basic   star hotel    People got stuck in the elevator and the fire trucks were there for hours which was right outside our window   there were people who appeared to be experiencing homelessness in the lobby one evening when we got back from dinner  and we got an automated message from ZenCity that there was a noise complaint about our music  when we were playing it on our phone which is not loud  but then spent a morning hearing erotic noises coming from the neighboring apartment    The apartment had dust everywhere  scuff marks all over  the bed frame was incredibly bent and we stubbed our toes on it constantly  no extra towels or blankets  just sheets and hand towels   the absolute bare minimum in the bathroom and kitchen  food from the previous occupants left in the fridge  and the thermostat was set to    when we arrived    With all that being said  it served its purpose and was in a great location and included a parking spot 
494971127502109104,Across the street from a club that rocks pretty hard till  AM 
471657820683821106,We knew walking in that this place might not be the best kept apartment  but didnt expect it to be as bad as it was  bags over smoke detectors  air conditioning that doesnt work and windows that dont open  and overall pretty dirty  The location is perfect  perfectly in a wonderful neighborhood  and the building is great  Surprisingly the train is nearly silent inside with the door closed   If you can look past some of these things and have a moment to wash your sheets before you start your vacation it can be a nice spot to lay your head  Was very disappointed with both how poorly clean and maintained the apartment was and the response time and ability to help resolve issues  Our vacation was marred by the non functioning air conditioning and having to take some time to clean the apartment before we could get our vacation started 
494977358228390109,Pros  For visits to Hyde Park area  UChicago   the location is great  The building is a beautiful historic location right off Lake Shore Drive across from a park and the Museum of Science and Industry  Parking was easy  we parked for free right across the street with no issue  and the drive up area is very convenient for loading unloading  The front desk staff was friendly and helpful  It s in walking distance to a few restaurants  a Trader Joe s  and a Walgreens  Since this is a turn of the century building in Chicago I sort of expected to see signs of mice or other rodents  but I didn t spot any during my stay over a full week   Cons  As others have stated  the unit is minimally furnished and needed a lot of deep clean  This is the first time I ve ever gotten out the clean supplies and started clean upon arrival to an Airbnb  It was covered in dust  had peeling paint all over  and the carpet is clearly several shades darker than its original state  The bed slats were broken  The Wifi  named  Zencity   was never present and when we messaged about it we didn t get a response for days  we had to find the physical router and connect to it manually to do work  One of the units above us seemed to be under construction the whole time we were there  so there was constant hammering    Overall  I ve stayed in several  professionally run  Airbnb s like this and this is all pretty standard  but for this price I would definitely have expected better 
541995361550282313,Everyone should know the building is not a safe place to be at night  There s a lot of drug activity  The main door is not kept locked when it is the key fob doesn t work to get you in  I have photos of coke or heroine bags outside the elevator door  Room      had their door open all night with a creepy man watching you go to   from your car  The shower road was broken   the hot water NEVER worked  I ran it for    min from faucet   shower   it was out  I was approached to buy drugs   was made fun of by the door man when he thought it was funny to make me wave up and down at a motion censor that wasn t their to open the door  There was no good apology   all they offered was a next stay discount   I ll tell you I ll never go back there ever  I ve stayed at several in many big cities all with their own problems   this was horrific  Save you re money   get away from that place  FrontDesk   Bradley s are so much better You already know my problems 
453611892491309493,Beware parking is not included and I couldnt purchase a pass for the building garage for the week I was there  ac is not very cold  very close to BJC The bathroom sink leaked very badly  When reported they said they would fix it  they never did so I couldnt use the bathroom sink  I also asked for towels they had only left    since I had used those to clean up the water from the sink  They brought the towels that morning  so good response there  The window ac units even when set at max setting never got cold enough to be comfortable for me  The waterproof mattress covering  I under the necessity  was the cheap kind thats super hot and plastic feeling  As far cleanliness I found trash and earring backs from the last guest  I hope  The location is very close to BJC  Parking was a nightmare 
511618118347175314,The communication was fine but I dont think the owners visit or have an understanding of the problems with access to the building  I had to speak with several residents to find out what was going on and they all expressed frustration about building entry  There was also delivery people from Doordash who couldnt figure it out so how are non resident visitors supposed to  Currently  the front entry door to the building does not work so you must go through the basement garage and it has generally been propped open  but I wouldnt count on it or the keycodes working    As far as the apartment itself  if you like Andy Warhol this might be your spot  The lack of art minimal furniture and few kitchen supplies gave it a minimalist feel but not very welcoming  There was a single book of Andy Warhol polaroids and another small one on some specific architecture  Otherwise one off centered bland painting in each room and cold colors  It feels like no one actually ever lived there and someone just bought an empty apartment and hired someone to put in the minimal amount of art and amenities for cost savings    Its OK for the money if you need this location and dont mind trying to figure out the building  The building has entry issues that need to be resolved  Even residents there expressed frustration about getting into the building  For people are arent familiar with the grounds this is even more of a challenge  Also the lack of art furniture appliances makes it feel very barren    It was clean and communication was not bad so I appreciate that 
509449441067046057,Beautiful place  Poor communication  Wrong building code   different times  while locked out for the  rd time  my car was broken into at the parking garage across the street  Did not get a new code until the next morning once I messaged again  I got locked outside   occasions and did not get a response until I messaged again the next morning  While locked out  my car was broken into  The car issue wasn t on you guys since it was in the garage across the street  but safety was a concern  Beautiful place  great location  Communication is always key to a good stay  Thank you for the place for a few days 
450697134729325628,I want to give a good review but I can t  The apartment itself is great  In a great location and the building has AWESOME amenities  if only you had access to them  The fob doesn t work to get you into the gym or many of the common areas   On top of that  the internet password was correct but it said no internet connection  I reported the problem immediately upon check in and it was unresolved all   nights we were there with no one trying to make it right  All I got was  are you sure you put in the correct password   And  did you try restarting to router   OBVIOUSLY I did both of those things several times   No internet no tv on top of the disappointment that we couldn t access the amenities  VERY disappointing experience and bad communication from the host  Take care of your guests when they report issues  Not having internet or tv is a major inconvenience 
475294773137694339,This place was fine  The instructions for how to use the call box are very complicated  and as the owners are a company based out of CA and not locals  it was not possible to get them on the phone for troubleshooting  The elevator was broke all weekend  The elevator would not go to floor    we had to go to floor   and walk down  The last day it was broken entirely  The apartment was relatively clean but I found a comb filled with hair in the shower and a razor head  but the rest of the apartment felt clean  The building was beautiful and the location is perfect  I just think that if it wasnt quite what I expected for the price  Hi  this was a great apartment in a great part of town  but I suggest reassessing the directions for the call box  as they can be very confusing  Also the elevator was broken and I found a dirty comb in the shower 
511640521723248258,We had difficulty checking in   could t get the key code to work  We were on the phone for quite a bit with tech support before we were able to get our key    At      AM a stranger opened our door and scared me half to death  mom and child alone   Luckily it was a sweet lady who was on the phone with tech support   someone gave her my apartment key  She said she had been locked out of her room since      AM    There is no interior lock for safety   no chain lock   just a regular metal key  deadbolt  with a sketchy door  looked like it was about to break     It was clean and otherwise okay  It was cheap  I went for cheap even after reading reviews  I knew I might have a problem checking in but did not expect a stranger to enter while my child and I were sleeping  Add a chain lock for safety  Someone was given our key and we were scared awake by a stranger opening our door  The key code is a joke and needs fixed 
476110021261682289,Home was beautiful  Check in was easy  Getting in door after hours sucked  The intercom did not understand what was being said  I was very clear and wasnt sure where the mic was  But it said speak into the mic  Oh well  moving on   They need to hire new housekeepers  They left dirty towels behind the bathroom door  Sewerage smell was coming from bathroom  Wasnt sure from where  Kind of hard taking a refreshing shower and it smells  That was a first  Did inform the owner and was told sorry and my next stay could be discounted  Not sure I would come back here  Check in was easy  The home was beautiful  Got to the room it was dirty towels in the bathroom hanging on the door  It smelled like a sewerage in the bathroom  Had to keep the bathroom door closed the whole time doing my stay  Did inform him by sending pictures  Had to go to the store to get clean supplies to clean and disinfectant everything  So i didnt feel clean here at all 
493526363441444410,This place still has the issue pervious guest have with the propertys door access   The codes given do not work   Thus I  you will  end up having to wait on apartment tenants coming and going to get in   If theyre kind to let you in   Aside from that  my experience was ok for the price   The studio apt had everything you needed and internet access and streaming accessibility was a breeze   As for the parking some commented      parking is free for the     slots right in front of the building  but its rare to come up on one   In the area there is metered parking which stops at  pm   If you go past the WHole Foods in that same block street parking is free and the next block over there is free street parking here and there   I can say this owner did take heed to previous guest comments  I saw the roach traps  it was very very clean and make ready   All in all it was a decent stay  This is for who I think is the owner   Please in the future dont stop by the property while your guest are there posing as maintenance  presumably because you couldnt accurately see my Profile picture    AND have the complex fix the peephole so your guest can see out   I couldnt see through it at all   PLEASE  PLEASE get your guest an accurate entry code       If nothing else  Here are also some following suggestions for the future   take out the bidet  it takes up too much space and messes up the toilet seat   might be good to invest in a good mattress   I felt like I was sleeping on a Walmart rolled up box mattress   I would trade out that chair for a small but more comfy sofa chair  I think you have the space for it   Lastly  I would position the desk somewhere you can have an electrical outlet close by  where the desk was positioned it was nothing long that wall on either side   I like that you took heed to previous guest comments  I saw the roach traps  it was very very clean

542048171553561431,Be careful  They will try to take your money with false clean claims  All drains were clogged and the whole building smells like smoke 
465875010495911755,This is an Awesome location in the Hyde Park community   The location is accessible to so many great places  Walking to find food and entertainment is A   The actual apartment space was another thing   Overall it was okay but not the cleanest  We found dirty pillows and linen in the closet put away  One of the clean wash clothes had a strand of hair attached  These are things that can and hopefully will be taken care of by the host  If so I think this will make for a great Airbnb while visiting Chicago  The location and hospitality of the lobby staff were great  Unfortunately the actual apartment space was not clean as expected   We found dirty linen and pillows put away in the closet and also one of the wash clothes had a hair strand attached  There was not enough wash clothes and towels for the number of days we stayed at the location  I  would also suggest placing a bath rug outside the tub instead of a towel 
474563934099939977,Our room was very dirty  especially for having customers pay a clean fee after each use  There was poop in the toilet when we arrived and the floors were not clean either  We had to sweep and vacuum when we arrived and the shower had hair all over  The clean supplies were empty  there was nothing in them at all and the vacuum cleaner was broken  Parking is a little hard to find at night  but we expected that being in the area we were in   It was a nice room and we had a good time  but were very disappointed with the cleanliness of the place  Our room was very dirty  especially for having customers pay a clean fee after each use  There was poop in the toilet when we arrived and the floors were not clean either  We had to sweep and vacuum when we arrived and the shower had hair all over  The clean supplies were empty  there was nothing in them at all and the vacuum cleaner was broken  It was a nice room and we had a good time  but were very disappointed with the cleanliness of the place 
470987118056350620,Close in proximity to everything in downtown Kansas City  The Apt  Could definitely use some minor improvements  but overall was fine for a weekend stay  The apartment was fairly dirty  We found hair in the bed  stains on the comforter and hair in the bathroom  Plus the shower drain was clogged and wouldn t drain and spit out nasty drain water  lint and more hair   The apartment smelled toxic with paint fumes due to the painting going on   The first check in instructions were not helpful  They didn t work  Ultimately I had to call zencity and they gave me a new set of check in instructions for the front entrance  the     entrance was no where to be found   Only instructions for the front entrance should be given going forward to guests   I will say zencity s response rate to this problem was fast and very helpful though 
480443927881216574,I canceled my reservations   days in advance  I was billed       The host is refusing to provide me with my refund  I contacted Mark with the Airbnb resolution center for assistance  He was to cancel my reservations since the Airbnb website would not allow me to complete the cancellation process  The host was included in the message thread regarding the cancellation process  Mark with Airbnb Resolution Center did not complete my cancellation  He is a failure at his job and actually blocked the entire thread regarding our conversation  I have an open investigation with Airbnb  I have reported both the host and Mark with Airbnb  I have been dealing with this issue for   days at this point and I have yet to receive a refund from the host  I would never recommend this host or any property associated with Zencity  I would also recommend that anyone dealing with Airbnb take screenshots of everything pertaining to Airbnb communication   Airbnb seems to be as shady as some of the hosts  I never thought Airbnb resolution center would actually DELETE BLOCK conversation threads and leave the customer holding the bag  Theives are everywhere      Since I canceled my reservation and you still owe me my refund I have nothing but bad things to say about you as a host  Pay me my refund  I have an active claim with Airbnb  She is conducting an investigation  My reservation was canceled   days before my check in date  I can t control the Airbnb platform and why I was unable to supply you with a cancellation confirmation  Mark with Airbnb Resolution Center stated that he would complete the cancellation process for me  He failed in providing me with a cancellation number which is again  out of my control  You received the same messages  from him as I did  I have reported his poor performance to Airbnb as well and he is part of the investigation process  You are well aware that you owe me my refund  You billed me          Give me my refund 
542073838966222509,communication with the host might be spotty Would like a refund  had to cancel this because our key fob wasn t available for us to pick up  so we had to find a new place to stay  what are the next steps for a refund
475384751691610939,Be ready to hike once you park  it will be at least two blocks  Give yourself plenty of time to check in  you will likely run into issues  I was very disappointed with our stay  Checkin was a nightmare where we were able to check into somebody else s room for two hours  I am not sure if that room was clean before the next guests arrived  I had revived an email that said if we  had any questions or concerns to let you know  Once we finally got into our room I expressed the concern of safety  I never got a response  We stayed four days with no response at all until an automated message on the morning we left  The tub did not drain at all  which I couldn t tell anybody because nobody got back to me  Nobody should have to stand in a foot of dirty water from the pipes while they shower

529022727894276258,Do not rent this place unless you dont have much to carry   It is clean and very comfortable but to much of a hassle to deal with the key fob that doesnt work   Couldnt get downstairs to play pool like it is advertised in the app   One lady in the office was a snot to my husband but changed her when Iwalked in the office  There needs to be something done about the poor service with the key fob   I couldntget back into the garage after I parked    I wanted to bring in the rest of my things and couldnt get back to my truck because the key fob wouldnt work   Poor communication for sure 
514452863896288089,The last day we had there they kicked us out at    am and we didn t get to come back in till the day was over  Even tho I paid for it  Other then that it was okay but I will never pay for that again The last day we had there they kicked us out at    am and we didn t get to come back in till the day was over  Even tho I paid for it  Other then that it was okay but I will never pay for that again
473121320899293095,Very disappointing  Amenities listed  such as the gym  pool  coffee bar  games courts  etc were not available to Air BnB guests  Seemed to be the policy of Zencity to block  On site unaffiliated building personnel told us it had been that way for quite some time  Amenities were open  but we couldnt access Location is good  but price we paid was for the amenities  Zencity was not responsive at all during our stay of of   days  During our trip  only communication was that they were unable to accommodate early check in due to another guest  and check out instructions on the final morning  This was despite several attempts via phone and app to reach them starting   hour after we first checked in  very disappointed in the lack of response during our stay to the immediate feedback we offered shortly after check in of amenities that were listed not being accessible  further  feedback we received from the local leasing agent  who could not help is  was that this did not seem to be an error  rather  a policy of Zencitys to not offer access  this was directly contrary to the listing  as well as even the welcome communication we received day of with the check in info  Other feedback   better instruction on need to use the fob to lock the door when leaving would be helpful  and if was initially a little hard to find the lockbox with the fob  describe a bit better where to find it at  add a few more utinsels to the kitchen  like a coffee maker  cutting board  etc 
746165073,Location in CWE was great as well as the apartment concept   Apartment needs clean and updating   At the time of our visit  the microwave was not functioning  feedback already provided via messages between host and me directly hardwood floors do not appear to have been washed other than being swept or vacuumed in quite some time   some surfaces appear to have been wiped  but others had not
744694301,Great location and beautiful neighborhood with some great places to eat within walking distance   Really cool building that has been modernized into great places to stay   We loved the roof top space as well    However  the place was filthy dirty 
743368844,This may have been an insolated incident being that the entire apartment wasnt clean  but it was unacceptable that this company didnt have cleaners available the day of my check in to come and clean  They were scheduling for next morning clean which meant I would have to sleep in a filthy apartment  I cancelled and am awaiting a FULL refund  Ended up spending      extra dollars to book a last minute hotel room  Disappointed from this experience Please refund me  This may be an isolated incident  but it was unacceptable for me to stay there and I must let other positions know truthfully of my experience Apartment looks like what was in it  just a lot of wall scuffs and sagging furniture Hairs in bed  shoe prints and debris in shower  should and water stains on counters and living room end tables  floor not swept or mopped  sink dirty in bathroom  no trash bag in bathroom trashcan  food debris left in fridge Call center type of contact
480429685001983959,Great location and value but had difficulty with key card  getting into locked building and using elevator   Had many issues with key card  As   women coming back from bars at  am and not being able to get upstairs  it did not feel safe 
480404165604541326,Pros  located in the art district and close to train You can walk to many bars and restaurants  Comfortable beds  Cons  wasnt well clean   The floors were pretty dirty and there are so much dust around the window areas  Theres a terrible plumbing smell as soon as you enter the building  The smell gets worse in the downstairs bedroom  The basement bathroom sink is so small  its almost impossible to wash your face   brush your teeth   The stay would have been very pleasant if there were no sewage smells all throughout 
490565293388122430,I gave this condo a three star review due to us getting constant  noise complaints   Come to find out the unit has a decibel machine so if you re too loud let s say get excited during a football game or maybe playing cards with your friends you would get a noise complaint but nobody s complaining just the machine  We even had the front desk coordinator from downstairs come stand out in the hallway for a few minutes and said they heard nothing but you could walk past other units in the building and clearly hear them having a loud party  The location  size  the building all amazing  Host communication was fantastic  I have it a   star rating tho bc we kept getting a  noise  complaint  We weren t being loud  We even grabbed the front desk coordinator from downstairs to come see if we were indeed too loud  She sat in the hallway for some time and said she couldn t hear us at all  Come to find out the host has a decibel machine in the unit  So let s say you got excited during a game  It would send you a noise complaint  If the tv was too loud  Complaint  I m a grown adult  Not some young kid trying to party  There were no more then   of us in the unit  At one point he was going to send the authorities if we  didn t keep it down  I said you re on the phone with me now  I m in the middle of what you say is too loud  does it sound too loud  He agreed that it didn t but the machine kept going off  It was my birthday day weekend to get away from kids and be an adult  Needless to say it kind of put a damper on my stay  Will not rent from zen city again just for this reason   If we were too loud I d completely understand and be apologetic 
455008755950715819,Honestly  this place was pretty awful  First  we arrived to check in and could not get in  The entire screen on the pad to type everything in was froze  We called our  host  which is a call center for the entire Zencity  not a specific person  that had no idea who I was or anything about my airbnb stay  He literally was zero help and the only reason we got in    minutes later was because we caught the door when someone came out  Next  to be brief   the bed in this airbnb is old and worn  We didn t even feel comfortable getting in it because it looked so dingy  The bedroom also reeked of cat urine  We ended up buying an air mattress unfortunately  Pretty much the trip was an overall disaster  Kitchen and bathroom was pretty clean and up to date  Bedroom is awful  Checking in was TERRIBLE  Communication was TERRIBLE 
522498685381320344,Decent place  The location had a lot of construction  Parking is a bit of a walk if you don t get in early  The shower drain was clogged with a giant hair clump  and the under sheet is a mattress sleeve so it s never been washed  Top sheet  bead spread  and pillows were all clean  Cookware is abysmal  Battery missing from ceiling fan remote made it unusable  They offered to replace if I gave them permission to enter for    hours   I declined  Checkin was fast and simple   Overall good price  but lacking some amenities  Clean the shower drain there was so much hair clogging it the shower almost flooded due to a buildup of hair  most likely from emptying the mop  Also better pots and pans would have been nice  Battery missing from the remote made the ceiling fan impossible to use 
531163403985475364,Really nice location  Great View I will most def book this again  only down fall is not able to control the Air or Heat I was comfortable Friday night but Froze Saturday night but other than that it was awesome    Thanks for letting me book you Airbnb for the weekend everything was nice and on point  only down side is not being able to control the heat and a c I frozed Saturday Night
480453089297115351,Great location  but not very clean 
515210872683294661,Dirty dog hair was all over the key fog to get in apartment took    mins Couch was full of dog hair   key fog is not easy to get
528212200680226031,Expect NO PARKING Pass if your out late passed    pm     housekeeping items other than that it was kool stay
478314910960882800,The key drop box wasn t working so I had to wait an over hour just to check in then once I got to the room the tv did not work  other than that it s a nice place  
476822049636394842,It s fine  I found dust on the bed coming from the old and barely working AC  and hair on the toilet  The furniture looks good but the lighting is poorly designed  Very unstable Wi Fi  Probably won t stay again for my next visit 
453591491114609896,HORRIBLE   PRICE WAS DECENT   NO TRASH BAGS  BED WAS UNCOMFORTABLE     GAVE US THE WRONG DOOR CODE  AND A BAD SMELL TO BOOT   PAY A LITTLE MORE AND FIND A BETTER PLACE     
495684059942167542,Overall it was fine  The sheets on the bed were clean and the towels were clean as well  I couldn t figure out how to lock the door when I left  which was concerning  I messaged the company a few times but didn t get  Response  Not ideal when I have personal items in the apartment  Shower worked fine  overall it was a fine experience but the unlocked door bothered me and the lack of communication was troubling  I wasn t able to lock the door when leaving  We were out all day Saturday and the door was unlocked because the automatic locking mechanism wasn t working  Also it appears there s blood on the rug towards the bathroom  Not sure  Beds   towels were clean 
514539431694685430,great location  I appreciate my stay  Just a note to make sure you clean and change your air filters in the unit  VERY dusty and dirty and had not been clean in a while  I wont give bad reviews  just wanted to communicate that with you for future guests  Great location 
541375283953661277,Unfortunately this was not the experience that we were hoping for  I waited TWO HOURS after check in time waiting for a key to get into the air bnb  I was never able to get a key  and to top it off the building was being evacuated after the fire alarms were activated  We had to rearrange our plans for the night due to the inconvenience of not being able to get into the air bnb  After waiting so long and STILL no promise of even getting a key for the night I cancelled our reservation  I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to staying in this air bnb  Even though customer service was not able to help  I will say they responded in a timely manner  If you decide to stay here  I would be cautious and have them verify a key is there and available before you check in 
495635700586457583,overall impression  would not stay here again     POSITIVES  comfy bed  modern appliances  good location   NEGATIVES      Was not clean   We had to vacuum clean ourselves when we arrived   There is a board that said it was clean   days prior to our arrival  however couldnt get early check in due to someone leaving earlier that day so im pretty sure it actually was not clean       The bathroom toilet does not flush properly near the kitchen    The listing is not accurate   The listing says it fits   people however when we arrived there were only   queen beds and the couch changed from the picture and wouldnt fit an adult to sleep on   When asking the host  they offered   hr late check out as a solution and said they did some remodeling     When we took the late check out  the door locked at   am and not    and wouldnt let us back in building   Luckily we had one member in the room to let us in     The building lock stopped working one day and had to prop it open with a newspaper just to get in out      Very bad pillows bring your own if you are going to stay here      There were a few curtains that were not functional  one was installed backwards and stuck so light comes in the morning   The other bedroom curtain also broken so light comes in       No shampoo or hair dryer  they did have multiple bottles of body wash and conditioner though      Wifi went out while there  re started and did not return  We had to use our hotspot      Coffee maker was there but no filters   Tea water heater available  but no cord for it to actually work       the patio area with seating pictured is not included in stay and should be removed from their advertising   The roof area seating is private and you cannot sit up there    I would have stayed here again if the listing was accurate  the room was clean  and would only bring   people and expect one functional bathroom   Be prepared to bring your own hairdryer  pillow  eye shade  earplugs and hair body products 
500691383711592969,Overall stay would have been phenomenal if we had hot water for longer than just the first day there  I reached out multiple times  even contacting Airbnb support  getting to the point where I just had to call the office of the complex so someone could finally resolve the problem   Also in regards to the toilet leaking into the below apt the following morning of our arrival  the plumber walked in unannounced  hours later    stated he  didn t know the place had guests    Location was the main good thing considering the elevators reeked of marijuana as well  Overall stay would have been phenomenal if we had hot water for longer than just the first day  I reached out multiple times  even contacting Airbnb support  to where I just had to call the office of the complex so someone could finally resolve the problem   Also in regards to the toilet leaking  the plumber walked in unannounced  hours later  while everyone was still in bed   stated he  didn t know the place had guests  
499326988105027530,I am not a person who generally complains but this was a bad Airbnb experience    There is no heat in the unit  The property management company did nothing to rectify that problem   Furthermore  I was traveling and liked the that the unit had a washer and dryer  After arriving  I washed my clothes only to find out the dyer does not work so all of my clothes were wet  Again  the property management company did nothing to rectify that problem   I was also locked out of the unit several times  I would have to call the property management company to get a new code  That takes time and was not always seem less   The front door to the building also does not work  The property management company has no control over that so it is difficult to access the building    Lastly  very loud as it is right by the front entrance and mail area where packages are dropped and doors are slammed    The one positive  the location  The neighborhood is great and you can walk to nearby businesses 
499317250545252240,The room was clean   The location was great   The cost was affordable   The check in process was a complete and utter disaster   For the first room       I had  the apartment building key card was not available   This made it impossible to get to my room   I was told that at     pm that the housing     team would contact me to get me the card   They didnt contact me by      pm   Turns out they leave for the day at  pm    After   phone calls and   hours of wasted time late at night  I finally got checked in   I basically had to beg to get transferred to another room  evidently their support staff couldnt come up with that solution on their own     The check in process was completely unacceptable  it is the last thing you want to deal with after a late dinner  Be sure you have the key card for check in   For the first room       I had  it was not there   This makes it impossible to get to my room   I was told that at     pm that the housing     team would contact me   They didnt by      pm   Turns out they leave for the day at  pm    The check in process wasted   hours of my time late at night and was completely unacceptable   I basically had to beg to get transferred to another room 
495646468480600577,DO NOT STAY HERE   From the photos this place looks like a steal  but once you arrive you will soon realize how poorly maintained the place is     My wife and I arrived around      and were immediately hit with smells of weed and cigarettes in the hallway   Not pleasant  but we can t expect management to be able to control the neighbors   Once we walked into the apartment we were wishing for the hallway smell as the entire apartment had a stench of rotting garbage   It felt like some didn t take the trash out for months  and showed of right before we arrived to remove it   As we walked around the place we noticed unclean floors and countertops  area rugs that should be trashed  and to top it off sheets that smelled like the previous guests   As we were debating on whether or not to stay or find a hotel  we noticed human nails in rugs next to the bed as well as pieces of glass near the coach    Clearly this was not the place for us to stay the night  and we left for a nearby hotel   I brought this up to the management group and their response was  ohh well   and  we will refund the clean fee    It was so dirty that we couldn t stay there a refund of the clean fee was an insult   I highly recommend that you keep scrolling to the next option 
465290503584795811,Our experience was not good  We had an issue upon check in with a smoke detector beeping  We were unable to reach the detector and deferred to Zencity for a resolution  We were advised the following day that they couldn t have someone available on the weekend to help  We spent the entire first night trying to sleep through a beeping every    seconds  We were advised through Airbnb to cancel as we went to get a hotel room for the  nd night  The issue still isn t      resolved and the communication has been terrible on Airbnb and Zencity  This trip has verified we are done with Airbnb and will book through hotels moving forward  Our experience was not good  We had an issue upon check in with a smoke detector beeping  We were unable to reach the detector and deferred to Zencity for a resolution  We were advised the following day that they couldn t have someone available on the weekend to help  We spent the entire first night trying to sleep through a beeping every    seconds  We were advised through Airbnb to cancel as we went to get a hotel room for the  nd night  The issue still isn t      resolved and the communication has been terrible on Airbnb and Zencity  This trip has verified we are done with Airbnb and will book through hotels moving forward 
465230494908816165,First this place is not safe  there was an incident that made us feel extremely uncomfortable and vulnerable  the police were contacted twice and never responded  I messaged the host and they didn t get back to me until the next day and all they had to say was that they d notify their team so they could  keep an eye out   Upon arrival the home was dirty  I sent multiple pictures to the host and got no response  The amenities were very minuscule  no trash bags  a coffee pot and only two plates  It s extremely loud due to the location  traffic  and the neighborhood  The night of the incident we stayed in the car until early morning  I do not refine d this place  for lock of safety  cleanliness and lack of concern from the host 
465216896642263648,This air bnb was awful    The instructions to enter the building did not work  We did not even get a key fob to access the building once we got to the room  Zencity was impossible to contact and when they answered they could not even offer any help  I would not stay here  The instructions to enter the building did not work  We ran into another couple trying to check in to their air BnB who had similar issues not being able to access their room  A resident of the complex was kind enough to let us in  but once we got into our room we were promised a fob that gets us inside the building and up the elevator  After not being able to locate the fob  it was nearly impossible to contact Zencity for help  Once they finally answered they had no way of helping us with our problems so we were scared we would have to sleep in our car if we did not catch a resident entering the building when we were coming back  They did not help us all weekend or offer any sort of refund for the lack of communication and not being able to access our room ourselves 
465135616008079051,The irony of calling their company  ZenCity  is not lost on me  We were not only highly annoyed but we were also then late for our engagement  also needing to find a new place to stay for both nights where we could guarantee re entry into the building  and also on the phone with ZenCity staff who by no fault of their own  are in no way helpful  Just entering the building is the most stressful thing  I generally enjoy Airbnb experiences  but I have now learned my lesson to only do Airbnb from actual individual owners and not these ill named corporations who run Airbnb properties  What an embrasement for Airbnb   First of all  do not book this  But if you do  do not follow any instructions they send you about getting into the place  Even if you call them and ask them to clarify because you read the reviews about it being hard to get in  it wont matter  They will say its easy to get in  They will say instructions are forthcoming  And you believe them because  what self respecting company gets multiple reviews saying theyve made it difficult to get into the building without remedying the situation  But Im not entirely convinced that anyone at ZenCity visits this apartment to know how to actually enter the building  On the keypad  you need to dial your apartment number in the directory  not the other number they give you  From there  the code they send you MAY work  IF you get in that way  they then recommend you walk around a desk and through a mailroom to find a key fob at a kiosk that does not exist  Meanwhile  the elevator to get you upstairs only stays unlocked for you for about two minutes  So while youre looking for the unicorn key kiosk  you get blocked from getting up the elevator  Fortunately  if you get there before the leasing office closes  the kind worker  who is embarrassed to have ZenCity in their building  offers to let you up the elevator to the apartment but is  of course  unable to provide access to the apartment  So you will stand there with all of your things while you wait for  Zen City to answer the phone and feign shock that you cannot get into their place  saying   We at ZenCity are not known for this   all while providing no real solutions  When they finally found a code to get us in the room  we asked how we would get back into the building  and they suggested we wait outside for someone from the  front desk  to let us in  This is NOT true  The desk  like the kiosk  is fake news  And how is that a solution for trying to re enter a building at midnight in downtown KC anyway  Why would they find this an acceptable solution regardless  Were supposed to just HOPE someone arrives and lets us into the building  No  Fortunately  we found a place to stay  The actual apartment is small with water dripping from the toilet  Its otherwise modest but cute I guess  and absolutely NOT WORTH IT  I dont know who you are reading this much of my review  but I do know that you  lovely human  deserve much much better  I suggest you send someone to the building to actually create instructions on how to get into the building and rooms  NOTHING about your instructions to enter the building are correct 
458704895811733293,Wasn t what we expected but we enjoyed our stay 
746441178,Great location  but missing some standard items to include access FOB  pots or a kettle  etc  Overall good stay  Some inaccuracies  but overall good stay  Missing some standard items  to include access FOB  two wine glasses  pot or kettle  etc  After initial messages  no response when requesting additional details about key FOB location 
745073728,Nice location  building and very clean  It was also easy to find parking   However  there were a few issues      When booking  the inquiry was weird  I felt like it was invasive  I have NEVER had that with booking an Airbnb and I like my personal business to stay personal  However  there were a lot of questions asked  I don t think it should matter where I live or why I m coming to Kansas City       The apartment had a smell  Not a big deal though      There was only one large towel provided  There were two of us and I put that when I made the reservation  so I m not sure what happened there      Check in was annoying  I wasn t provided instructions until after my check in time  In fact  I requested it at       I was told to wait at       which was my check in time  and not provided the instructions until       I don t care how petty it is but I want my   minutes back that I paid for  Seemed rude and it was not good customer service       This is something I do not blame the host for  but the couple in the apartment next to us fought from literally      am to      am  It woke me up and I couldn t sleep  so I ended up changing my early flight   Overall it was ok  but the customer service sucks  It made me feel uncomfortable  If I wasn t in town for a last minute emergency  I would have booked something else 
460138667349307754,You get what you pay for here and the prior reviews regarding the check in and the call box are correct  I had to tailgate in the building as the call box does not work as given by the instructions  The area is nearby mostly hotels in the area and office building but a shot walk away from the touristy spots 
744328954,The place appeared   smelled unclean  with the hallway having a strong cigarette smoke musty odor  I couldn t even walk barefoot in the place or else my feet would get dirty  Also  responses from host were slow  As for pros  the area was convenient   nestled in a hip cute area near parks  Also  the bed was comfortable  Would I stay here long term  No  A few days was the most I could do  Entire place looked   smelt unclean  Floors were dirty   I couldn t even walk around barefoot without my feet getting dirty 
460807462801271095,Apartment itself was nice and clean  the communication was good in the beginning  We got responses back within an hour or so  However that changed Once we got to the property  Getting in the building was very difficult and someone who lives there actually let us in the building  We had talked to the security in the building for help  He told us that the intercoms do not work and that we ll need a key fob to get in and out of the building as well as the elevator  The security was able to let us up the elevator  When we got to the unit  the key fob was no where to be found  We immediately contacted zencity and they told me that someone will deliver the key fob ASAP  We waited around for   hours for the key until we absolutely had to leave for our dinner reservation  Again  when we got back  we had to explain the whole situation to the security again so he can let us up the elevator  That night  we received a message saying that the property manager did not have an extra key fob so they will not be able to provide one for our entire stay  On Sunday  we got back to the property and asked the security to let us up the elevator  The security told us that they can not do that anymore because of the protocol  We were scared that we will not even be able to get our stuff from the unit much less staying another night  We ended up having to sneak in with someone to get to the unit  We packed up our stuff and got a hotel room for the rest of the night because it was too stressful and scary that we do not know if we will be able to get back in the unit after leaving  So this might be something you might want to consider before renting through them  They also took     hours to respond back to my request or questions after the check in 
509459470718267224,The front door entry pad was malfunctioning and broke   We had to be let in by others in the building   Later the door  was propped open   I had to enter the code to retrieve the key three times before it unlocked   There was no extra blankets in the room   There was so much hair in the bath tub drain you couldn t close the drain   The smoke detector looked to be held together by duct tape   The whole fifth floor stank terribly   It was like dead fish   The only relief was to get in the room close the door and spray the room with freshener   The room temperature was set at    and was not able to be changed without a code   That code was never given to us  The front door entry pad was malfunctioning and broke   We had to be let in by others in the building   Later the door  was propped open   I had to enter the code to retrieve the key three times before it unlocked   There was no extra blankets in the room   There was so much hair in the bath tub drain you couldn t close the drain   The smoke detector looked to be held together by duct tape   The whole fifth floor stank terribly   It was like dead fish   The only relief was to get in the room close the door and spray the room with freshener 
743701866,Full information on how to get in the building Would I be able to get my money back really disappointing that wasn t able to check in had to leave the same night because of money wise was short and didn t have any money left or didn t get my money back to find a place to stay  Waited for a response didn t get nothing it s really upsetting Wasn t able to go in Wasn t able to check in front desk didn t let us in at all saying we wasn t suppose to be there Didn t stay the night and wasn t able to get my money did cancel and everything I m really disappointed wasted my money and didn t have a place to stay the night so left home that same night
505810293586017482,Great location for the CWE  Within walking distance to Whole Foods and restaurants in the neighborhood  Location was great  but the cleanliness of the apartment and apartment complex was a concern 
743614893,The property is beautiful  HOWEVER  the looks are deceiving  Everything is either cheap or not worth the amount of money you pay  For starters  the description states they ll provide toilet paper and I wrote them once we ran out  I looked because I m thinking it was more in stock  no response until LATER the next day questioning me but never sending someone up  SO I WENT TO BUY SOME  The bed is hard and uncomfortable  The couch had a weird smell  In my younger days of college I would not make a review but I paid      to stay and I m not a happy camper  I m a physical therapist and just wanted to relax and get away from Chicago and even though it was beautiful  it wasn t worth the money  The residence weren t friendly  I know  they don t have to be BUT DANG  a wave rather than looking because they don t know who you are   I had many problems throughout my stay and the response time said   hour and I wouldn t get a response until the next day     hours   The property is beautiful  HOWEVER  the looks are deceiving  Everything is either cheap or not worth the amount of money you pay  For starters  the description states they ll provide toilet paper and I wrote them once we ran out  I looked because I m thinking it was more in stock  no response until LATER the next day questioning me but never sending someone up  SO I WENT TO BUY SOME  The bed is hard and uncomfortable  The couch had a weird smell  In my younger days of college I would not make a review but I paid      to stay and I m not a happy camper  I m a physical therapist and just wanted to relax and get away from Chicago and even though it was beautiful  it wasn t worth the money 
493477500949152498,Those staff who had contact with me through the chat and phone call were nice and had good communications   But the door stuff at the Parc Frontenac Apartments had so bad communication issue   She just kept ignoring me  and I was not able to get in my room  That was the worst customer service ever I had experienced  After I called the call service  I could have a room at different apartment after about an hour from I got there  Never book with them 
743109061,Although the location was great  finding off street parking was a pain  We could not access the floor unless we had a key fob which was difficult and we wouldn t have been able to access it via elevator if someone else hadn t helped us  The bathroom and towels were not clean  hair on floor  toilet  and towels   On top of all this  the smoke alarm began beeping Friday night in the middle of the night due to low batteries  Out of frustration  I messaged the company and never heard back from them  Overall  we would not recommend this place to others 
742739512,The apartment was clean and well located  but none of the doors locked and the outer doors were propped open when we came in  The host failed to respond to these concerns  The apartment was also incredibly loud  the neighbors were playing music until   am and we did not sleep at all I do not recommend  It is not acceptable to stop responding when a guest tells you they feel unsafe because none of the locks work no locks  unsafe stopped responding when i reported a concern
742673015,As a third party vendor with so many reviews  I would have thought the experience would be a lot smoother  Not having a key fob was extremely inconsiderate and made entering and exiting the building very difficult especially elevators  At first  I acknowledged maybe it was a small mistake and someone will surely drop one off the following morning  yet that never happened  I shouldn t need to remind you of that  Then  I met another couple complaining of the same exact situation with their stay  That someone would  try  to deliver their key fob and never did  The most uncomfortable is the fact that the entire apartment smelled like cigarette smoke  First exposure was strong  and we figured it would go away  For   whole days each time we entered and exited the smell never went away and was consistently strong  That makes no sense for an apartment that says  no smoking allowed   If we are being charged a clean fee  things like that should be triple checked to ensure guests are comfortable in their stay specially since there s no ventilation  All my belongings still smell like smoke and that s gross  Also  many of the light switches did not work  At first I didn t care until I compared the listing photos with the unit we got and realized it was different  hence why the natural lighting wasn t strong  So the combination of the important light switches not working made the apartment very dark and gloomy for no reason  Poor lighting  Horrific smoke smell No key fob Very very poor lighting  only     light switches worked out of the many available  The place smelled like smoke the entire time  and inaccurate descriptions in terms of utilizing a key fob  NO KEY FOB       I messaged them immediately to which they kept asking for photos as if I d lie about that  In the end  they stated someone will try to drop it off tomorrow and they never did  Even saw another tenant in the elevator complaining about the same issue of not having a key fob  This made going in and out of the building such a hassle and wasted lots of time  After inquiring about not having a key fob  they stated someone will drop it off the next day to which no one ever did throughout our whole stay  Never mentioned it even after check out  I had to bring it up at check out since they instead reminded me about the      fee if the key fob was not left in correct place  when we never even got one  which shows they never even kept record of it  For the amount paid  relative to other airbnbs that I had the option to rent out  it didn t seem fair  The inaccurate description in terms of the exact room  wasn t same as photos   very poor lighting  and it being a  no smoking  room but smelled like COMPLETE smoke  Every time we entered the place  the stench would hit you immediately and never went away despite trying to air it out  Now that I m back home  my entire luggage and belongings smell like cigarettes which is ironic as one of the key rules is to not smoke ever  This really really bothered me  There was no ventilation in the bathroom either so the smell would linger constantly 
741980986,No salt and pepper or oil  Clean place  host never responded to our messages 
741923953,Do not spend your money here  Very unclean and disappointing 
741791448,They need to update their pictures  most people would not stay here if the pictures were updated  Missing pieces to the sliding front door  looks like they tried to patch some holes and it looks terrible  For towels there was a dish hand towel  it was just weird  Sheets balled up in the bedroom closet  they didn t even attempt to make it presentable    I m giving   stars because it was a semi convenient location  The building itself is awful  my boyfriend and I couldn t sleep AT ALL  The walls are like paper and the surrounding neighbors are loud  they re doing construction work next door  so I would advise you stay somewhere else or a hotel  They need to update their pictures  most people would not stay there if the pictures were updated  Missing pieces to the sliding front door  looks like they tried to patch some holes and it looks terrible  For towels there was a dish hand towel  it was just weird  Sheets balled up in the bedroom closet  they didn t even attempt to make it presentable  Okay  so I m giving   stars because it was a semi convenient location  The building itself is awful  my boyfriend and I couldn t sleep AT ALL  The walls are like paper and the surrounding neighbors are loud  they re doing construction work next door  so I would advise you stay somewhere else or a hotel 
543545359706713615,Great place to stay
490536780738200450,Overall not a bad experience  Location is nice and basic housekeeping was in order   There were some bigger issues though that made it difficult to enjoy the space    The heating system may need to be repaired or replaced  The temp was stuck in the low   s the whole time and it was very uncomfortable with the outside temps dropping   The security was not good  front door call box was broken so we had to find a way into the building  Many of the exterior locks were broken    Communication by phone and messaging was fine but there was no on the ground response  at least no one came to address the issues we were having  even after asking 
468206299067421828,Buyer beware   They couldnt get me into the actual apartment via the intercom  which required me going to the apartment building leasing office upon arrival   Once I gained access to the apartment  there was no key fob to give me the opportunity to come and go   So I was literally stuck in the apartment   Zencity was not very responsive to myself or Airbnb in terms of resolving this  so at   PM I was forced to cancel and go a hotel in another part of town   Never again with anything Zencity 
741240519,The place was fine and it was as advertised  The check in and check out process was a disaster  Each part of the check in process had an issue  Our access codes did not work and we had nowhere to park  The host responded  but it was not very timely  We were told we d have a free parking space and did not get a parking pass until day    We had to find on street parking in the downtown area of a busy city and pay for it  The host reimbursed our parking expenses but it was very stressful and the last thing we wanted to spend our time and effort on  The checkout process was also confusing  We were told to leave our keys and pass with the front desk  however  there was no one there  Our issue did not get resolved until we had already left  There was nothing wrong with the actual apartment  but we will not be utilizing this host again  No part of our check in process worked  We weren t able to park where we needed to  our access codes didn t work  and we weren t presented with a parking pass  which was listed as a part of the package   Although the host responded  it was not very timely  Each issue we ran into took about       min to fix which made our check in process almost   hours  We didn t get a parking pass until the next day and had to find street parking  paid  until we got it  The host did reimburse parking expenses        but it was very stressful and not how we wanted to spend our time on vacation 
741233970,Pros  great view  great location  spacious  full kitchen  good security  modern furnishings and appliances Cons  sheets and towels were stained and we found hairs on them  no extra sheets as stated and host never provided any despite our messages  no k cups at the coffee maker which was downstairs BUT there was a grinder and french press in the room if you brought your own coffee I would recommend bleaching towels and bedding and having cleaners wear a hair net so that guests dont find hairs that arent their own    The couch was dirty  along with the bed sheets and towels 
740533048,Did not receive full refund  Did not get to stay here  Could not get into building  Bad experience  Did not receive full refund  Did not get to stay here  Could not get into building  Bad experience 
500023650970845177,You don t have any privacy there isn t any curtains in the house downstairs so everybody going up and down the streets can see right in and the furniture is so outdated The furniture is very outdated and then you need to put some type of blinds or curtains up so people can see inside their isn t any privacy  There wasn t even a blind or curtain in the bathroom on the third floor why can t people have privacy if your so worried about people having a gathering where you have it open for people to watch maybe you need to take it off of Airbnb don t nobody want everybody looking at them what if someone wants to walk around naked then tell your cll lol eating service yo clean right the floor was sticky by the kitchen nook area I was just disappointed with not having any privacy
457225191673489025,This is an awesome room I ve booked with Zencity for all my stays in Kansas City  Although the room I was switched to was nice I wanted the original room I booked  The missing key really frustrated me
457228231202790221,When I arrived a lot of things were broke the dishes in cabinet were dirty  No parking on site have to walk distances  But other than that everything else was fine
491318129599295382,I would not stay here alone  Homeless were sleeping on the main floor  lobby area   Entire building smelt of weed  Back door to building not secure  If you have issues checking in  host does not respond  I was having issues with the code to get in  no one responded at all  Very unsafe place  homeless sleeping in the lobby  back door always unlocked  Entire building smelt of weed 
453633599222469320,First  I d like to say that the on call attendant did a fantastic job trying to help us as much as they could in the given situation  Thank you for being so patient and staying on the phone with us until you knew we were taken care of    Upon arrival  the directions to the call box on the side of the building were clear  But the call box did not work  We had to wait until someone that lived in the building to let us in  Which was great   However  the elevator needed a key fob to be activated  Which would have been solved by the intercom box working  activating the elevator  So we had to wait until someone was able to badge us up for the elevator  Then the rest of the directions worked flawlessly   Then we got to the room and there were no key fobs  I proceeded to call the help number and they answered on my first call  And immediately started to attempt to solve the issue  They weren t able to do anything in the moment but did say they d have someone drop of fobs for us to use in the morning  We never got any fob keys  I called the help number around midnight  They again answered on the first call  And stayed on the phone with me trying every solution we could think of  They made phone calls trying to find some way to help us remotely  We ended up making it to the room after about an hour of trying   The room itself was amazing  Perfect location and absolutely loved the amenities  I had a stove and pot to make my tea in the morning     Just have extra fobs printed off and communicate with the leasing office or maintenance for after hour check ins  Make sure the call box works and this would have been   stars  Please make sure you have extra key fobs printed  I know you can t help when people don t turn in their keys but plan for that  You re a business  You know these things happen 
543533691191871583,a decent place
453624977586905850,Make sure to have a good  CLEAR line of communication  Need better communication  I wasnt able to even make it into the building or talk to someone who couldve helped 
472464627456457602,The place was old and not really comfortable for families 
515969189491651541,Ok place the parking pass was missing the first day so struggled with wondering if I would get towed from parking in lot   They told me it was fine but still a nerve wrecking experience as I kept doing downstairs checking to make sure I was ok to park there   It was also cold in the home and the heat would not go past      needed a code for the thermostat to get any warmer   I also requested for late check out   hours early  They did not respond until    checkout saying they could not honor late checkout because other guest requested early check in   But what about your current guest that asked   hours ago   Poor communication and a big inconvenience as my flight was delayed  
515889448151538868,Great location  but faced internet connection issues all throughout the stay and did not get replies to couple of messages to the host  Other than that  the stay was great 
459444196580192932,Not helpful to check in Customer care was not helpful
495699869595765628,Great location  Walking distance to lots of good food and drinks  The hallways are a bit confusing at first and the instructions don t mention going through to a gym area but once you find it it s not bad  My only complaint is that the apartment was NOT clean completely before we arrived  The living room rug had large French fries all over it and a bunch of hair on it  Pretty gross  Couch had some weird stains though they looked old  The walls have also seen better days   scuffs and scrapes   though on the whole this isn t really a problem  Just a  the more you look around  situation  The kitchen bathroom and bedroom seemed clean though  Main issue was the living room  Other than that it was a good spot in a great location I messaged you already about the gross carpet  but please take care of it for the next guest 
515926273573994551,Nice price for the room we got  Accurate to the pictures and the room itself was clean and spacious  Only problem we had was we could get into the room fine  but we couldn t get into the building because the call box was broken  Customer service was no help  I messaged them many times and rarely got a response  Then when I finally called They said  well we ll put in a maintenance request for the door  but we can t help if the room key works  they basically said just go in when someone comes out  Which was a burden because that meant we just had to get lucky to get into the building  They said when they hear from their operational manager they d call me back but they never did  The problem never got resolved  Nice room or whatever but communication and the door really stopped us from really going out and enjoying the city bc I didn t know if we d be able to get back into the building  Give your guest a key card to get into the building instead of a code to call someone to open the door because I had no access into the building what so ever my entire stay  The only way I could get in was by luck if another resident was going in or out   Not a good experience at all
439143992392770583,Great location  but the bed is uncomfortable  The gasket on the freezer needs to be replaced  The table in the kitchen needs to be a little smaller so   people can sit comfortably  The chair by the bed is broken and needs to be fixed or replaced  The bed was very uncomfortable  but I am not sure if it was a mattress or bed frame issue  Window blinds would be nice on the window near the bed  However  we did appreciate how quickly you all responded to all my messages  We were just disappointed that the room was not up to the standard that you all expected it to be at 
495603621376929199,The  location of this place is really good   Walking distance to a beautiful park  bars  restaurants  groceries and pharmacy   Everything important in St Louis is at a short driving distance   The building is in a nice neighborhood   We felt safe all the time   Convenient and secure parking   Once inside the building it can be confusing to locate the unit    Now   be advised  this place is run by a corporation  not an actual host    They do have rules and processes that I consider big nuisances   For instance  you cant control the thermostat of the unit   If you want to change the temperature  you need to contact the company that controls it    Additionally  this company has some sort of automatic messaging system and we received multiple txt messages and Airbnb messages about excessive noise when we were not on property     So  in my case these are deal breakers   I will make sure next time I pick a place not run by a corporation but by an actual host with a human touch  This has been the weirdest experience at an Airbnb for me   I am planning on leaving a fair review but I am not going to comment on the cleanness of the place   This place needs a really good clean    The moment I step into this place I started sneezing   I  thought maybe someone near had a cat or something but right before leaving I opened the closet and saw the filter   I took pictures if you need them   The filter of this so called eco friendly place was not only clogged but had mold   The cherry on top   we also found an adult toy under the couch when we were checking to see if we packed everything   We left it there  I was not going to touch it    The thermostat issue and the unnecessary messages about noise were also not appreciated    Next time I will try to get a place not run by a corporation but by someone with a more human touch 
452117307942695422,This property should not be an option for anyone  The central air doesnt work and they expect that a portable air conditioner will cool the entire apartment unit  On top of that the smell of cigarette smoke is over powering  The finishing touches to this ordeal are the sub par maintenance and lack of cleanliness throughout  Please see past messages between myself and Zencity 
455733831262448844,This unit is extremely well located   close to lots of restaurants and bars  in walking distance to many things  Unfortunately  the key fob did not work for us so we were unable to come and go as we pleased as we could not get back into the building unless an actual tenant happened to come out and let us in  It made for a stressful trip and felt unsafe  Also unfortunately  the unit was not very clean     Other than the location  the two best parts were the rooftop hangout space  theres a hammock  grills  seating areas and a TV as well as hot tubs  So bring your suits   and the bed  This is probably the most comfortable bed and pillows Ive ever experienced at an AirBnb  Unfortunately  we did not enjoy our stay with Zencity  Here are a few reasons why   First major reason  The key fob we were given to enter the building DID NOT WORK  We could not get access INTO the building and had to rely on waiting for other people to come and go and hope they would let us in  I contacted this listing   times during our stay to see if someone could fix this emergency issue and I did not get a response  It impacted our ability to enjoy our trip and come and go as we pleased needed  It felt unsafe to not be able to access the premises when we needed to and I did not like having to rely on strangers to let me in   The unit was not very clean  No one marked the  Cleaned By  sign to indicate that it was clean before we arrived  There was toothpaste running down the front of the bathroom vanity and pooled on the floor  The living room rug and bedroom carpet were not vacuumed  The walls are HORRIBLY dinged up  scratched  and they look blotchy and filthy throughout the entire unit  It did not make us feel comfortable  clean  or like we were getting the value for what we paid  Also  the bathroom faucet barely hangs over the sink so water pools all over the counter  The faucet is lined with mold and mildew from the constant mess  And the apartment smelled bad   The light fixtures in the bedroom dont work  One was broken and the other one didnt even have a lightbulb in it   Someone elses clothes were still in the dryer   We could not adjust the temperature   There was no mention of the rooftop hot tub on the listing so we didnt bring our bathing suits  Such a disappointment 
451408141860641682,DO NOT STAY HERE     Impossible to get into the building and I was approached inside the entryway by a street person and had to decide whether I was gonna have to fight with my bags on me  The entry instructions DO NOT WORK  It was  am and after    minutes a security guard let me in and said he has to let ABB people in all of the time  When I got up to the apartment  it smelled horrible  I had no choice but to stay after the fight to get in  I had   nights booked but left the next morning  I doubt I will get a refund  Read the other reviews  I tried to be proactive after reading how it was impossible to get into the building  Only got canned answers with no way to contact Zencity except for the app  which they responded to hours and hours later only to ask   Do you still have a problem   This is not a safe place and whatever you do DO NOT STAY HERE  You need to not be on Air B B as your instructions and customer service are the worst 
459407663367640649,This is my second zencity stay and the first one was definitely a lot better than this one  It was okay but the shower wasn t the cleanest  They had a clean lady come out to clean up but i wasn t thrilled about the stay  However the building is really nice and in a nice location
515923092981038719,The place was real cute and good location but it wasn t clean at all  Pet hair was on the bed sheets  cobwebs in several corners and the floors were sticky  Within    minutes of being there one night I was told that I had the tv on too loud  Mind you it was  pm on a Saturday when quiet time began at   pm  Another weird interaction was that the host knocked on the door  waking us up  prior to our checkout time asking if we were leaving on time  I don t understand why that couldn t be a text or email  Beds had dog cat hair on the sheets  cobwebs in several corners  floors were sticky
450657092141655905,The host posted the wrong address on the website  I messaged them when we took off and they replied two hours after we arrived  I called customer service to tell them we were lost because of the wrong address and she hung up on me  What was suppose to the a    min drive turned into over an hour and cost      on Lyft  The microwave in the apartment was broken and the bathrooms were filthy  I messaged them and no one came out to fix it  Customer service is unacceptable  I will not be booking with them again  The only great thing was the location of the apartment and the views  Power and light district is pretty cool  Everything is in walking distance  The host posted the wrong address on the website  I messaged them when we took off and they replied two hours after we arrived  I called customer service to tell them we were lost because of the wrong address and she hung up on me  What was suppose to the a    min drive turned into over an hour and cost      on Lyft  The microwave in the apartment was broken and the bathrooms were filthy  I messaged them and no one came out to fix it  Customer service is unacceptable  I will not be booking with them again  The only great thing was the location of the apartment and the views  Power and light district is pretty cool  Everything is in walking distance 
395609897458248835,Place is great just communicating with them is horrible  I tried to extend my stay and had until   am to pay for hours I was messaging and no response because they let someone else stay go thru at   am when I extended my stay at   pm the day before  Then they promised me another unit at the same rate but never responded or gave me the unit so I had to stay in my car and it was storming outside  Sucked but the place was nice parking was really bad wish there was parking had to pay for parking  I love the place but communication was really bad and I was not happy with way it was and how everything went when trying to extend my stay 
544173182154468326,This place looks nice on paper but beware that I caught a huge rat on the premises  I also saw a second rat on the last night and heard the scratching in the walls throughout our stay  If you think that I m lying  I have pictures and videos to prove my case  Check in was delayed by a hour and I had to start online teaching in my car   Lastly  I was informed this less than an hour prior to checking in and it was a huge inconvenience  The place looks nice but a rat infestation  is more than enough to turn a nice place into a complete dump  I would hope that Zencity has eradicated these issues by now but I cannot recommend anyone staying here until they are fixed  Also  please process my full and complete refund  RATS RATS  Rats  I hope that you have called an exterminator because catching one but seeing   rats is too much for any guest  I don t want to mention the hearing rats scrape inside of the walls of this place  I would like a full refund for my trip due to this inconvenience    Sincerely   Christopher Davis
469513708991206627,Air conditioning not working  The apartment was    degrees when I got in  the wall thermostat was on set up cool but blowing hot air  Turned it off and turned on the unit  only cooled the living room  Needed a fan to sleep with 
450651763496105312,It was okay  Clean for the most part  Super roomy  You guys wanted to charge me for       Because apparently I smoked in the room  But I didn t it says you discovered it on Sunday  But I was still in the room Sunday so I don t understand where you found it on that day anyways  I don t smoke yet alone smoked in my room  I don t know how it got there  Or if it was even in there in first place due to y all saying you found it on Sunday   I checked out Monday  
449909389781283606,This apartment is as pictured but be warned if you require a very clean space   It did not live up to our expectations in terms of cleanliness   It seems to be a heavily used unit and requires a deep clean   Even basic things like vacuuming were done poorly prior to our arrival    The neighborhood location is fantastic and the amenities in the building are nice   The keyless entry is also very convenient  This apartment is very dirty   Even the basic things like vacuuming and sweeping the floors was done poorly prior to our visit   We had to get out the vacuum first thing when we arrived because there were so many crumbs on the carpet    Aside from those basics  this apartment needs a deep clean   There is dirt piled up in every crack and crevice  the windows are filthy  etc   
447048533184113433,Zencity lacked communication and sense of urgency when we arrived and couldn t get into our airbnb because the lock box wasn t working  A neighbor in passing had said that the girl the day before was having the same problem and couldn t get in which means that this had already been a problem that wasn t fixed before we got there  Waited outside for an hour messaging and calling and not getting replies  If it wasn t for a neighbor who lived in the building  we would have been outside for a lot longer  Once we got in  we couldn t leave because we didn t know if we could get back in which isn t cool  Had to wait another hour before they finally got someone out to the fix the problem  The place itself was okay  in a decent area with lots of stores and restaurants around  First time using Airbnb and I was disappointed by the customer service skills  There was lack of communication on Zencity s end  No one had reached out to me on how to check in until I messaged and waited a good    minutes before someone got back to me  The lock code was not working and a neighbor passing through had said he saw another girl that was struggling with the same problem the day before which means that Zencity was probably aware that this was a problem and didn t do anything about it before we had arrived  We waited outside for over an hour  We had just gotten off an   hour bus ride and really wanted to get to our Airbnb and relax and sitting outside added a lot of unnecessary stress  All while this was happening   I wasn t getting much in response to the messages between myself and zencity so I had to call several times with no success on getting in  The man that I spoke to every time was nice but also lacked communication  Said he would be in contact with us through zen city messages and I had to message him at least   times before I heard anything back  Didn t seem like anyone knew what was going on and I didn t feel like my boyfriend and I were being treated as a priority  If it wasn t for a neighbor who lived in the building  we would have been outside for a lot longer  Once we got in  we couldn t leave because we weren t sure if we could get back inside again and that was very inconvenient for us  We were upset that we were stuck and didn t feel like anyone wanted to help us  At one point  we had asked if could just get a different airbnb because we were so sick of waiting around and getting no answers  My boyfriend considered calling the people who owned the building to come and fix the problem since Zencity wasn t doing anything  Waited a total of       hours before they finally sent someone out to fix the lock box  The place itself was okay  under the bed that we slept in was super dirty and dusty and I found that out after I dropped one of my shirts down there and pulled it back out  Covered in dust bunnies and dirt  This was my first airbnb experience and it was not a great one  I think a partial refund is fair giving the circumstances we dealt with upon our arrival  It was really inconvenient and unprofessional to have us waiting outside and no one seeming to have any urgency 
501427022449556147,Good location to CWE and Barnes Jewish  Area seems safe  Grocery and lots of food within walking distance  Unit seemed clean but still dusty  Had troubles entering main lobby doors few times  host was not helpful in that regard and just had to wait for another resident to help me in  For the price  would expect a little more  But will get the job done 
492085471788276705,Absolutely loved the look of this place  Communication was great until I encountered a problem  The place was spotless except for a few cobwebs on light fixtures  Overall  it was a nice place to stay  however  I did not have access to the parking garage or gym during my stay which was very upsetting as I am a daily gym user  I contacted the host and they claimed they would figure it out  but that never happened 
516617466204912999,  pros and   cons below  Pro      the apt was close to the subway  in a nice and safe area  close to shops  bars and coffee shops      The apt has the heat on high   Better to be too hot than too cold in Chicago winter     The bed is very comfortable   The TV is a nice set up with many apps already sign in  Con     The front door key was missing in the lock box   We waited for an hour before we could check in     There is hair in the bath tub  sink and in the bed sheet   The apartment isnt dirty  but its not clean neither     Someone knocked on the door at     am thinking we had an early check out   Check out time is   am  This apt looks very nice in the pictures   However this unit is in a very old building   Zencity renovated it just enough to be an airbnb  Your team members did the best they could to accommodate us  I do appreciate that   but there isnt one specific person for the property  every email exchange or phone call I have to deal with a new person and explain the situation  
501421478153224747,Walls  are super thin try in not to make to much noise neighbors will complain I had the tv volume on ten in let them tell it it was too loud Hey did someone turn the key in if not I m willing to pay the fee
443666030235721227,NIGHTMARE  This was an entirely fraudulent airbnb  Showed up at    PM with instructions to look for a lockbox with key in it  There was no such lock box  Got Zencity on the phone  talked to someone at length who could not reach anyone in charge  said they were all  remote    and we got  disconnected   Called back and was told there was no way to get me into that place but they were looking for someplace else  Periodically they said they didnt have anything until the next evening  but sometimes they said maybe they could find a place with only one bed for the night  But an hour went by  and there was no solution  I got a hold of the property manager for the actual building  and was told that the lease on the unit I was supposed to be in had ended more than a month earlier  and no one had a right to rent it on airbnb  Had to take a     uber to a hotel  Zencity then asked me to cancel the reservation and take the dispute for refund up with airbnb  I did not do that  instead I contacted Airbnb  Airbnb  to their credit  took care of it  cancelled the reservation  refunded me  gave me a discount for my next rental  and offered me a little gift  Zencity is not to be trusted unless you want to risk arriving in a strange city  in the dark  and having no place to stay 
455810760560710953,Im just going to be straight forward and address pros and cons   the pros are that the neighborhood was homely and nice  the apartment is rather spacious    the cons are the smell  the drain in the bathroom  the loud ac that doesnt work in the bedroom  and the spotty internet and TV   overall  not a great time  but it wasnt the worst address the smell problem  its genuinely disgusting  and theyre probably wouldnt be gnats if it didnt smell so bad everywhere 
443498341692343237,Beautiful property  and amazing location  Cleaning job and wifi could have been better  but it didnt take away too much from the experience  Hello  This was a beautiful apartment however the clean job was not acceptable  Their was food  crumbs  hair  make up left around that seemed like the place wasnt clean after the previous guest  I stayed at one of your properties before and had a similar experience  While I absolutely love the aesthetic and location of your properties  the poor clean causes a disservice  We also had issues with wifi both times  but I do appreciate how someone reached out about it without us having to ask 
443415816470873604,The lock pad wasn t set properly so we couldn t get into the apartment when we arrived  had to call and wait outside with our bags for some time to be able to even enter the unit  We were notified by management on day   of a  noise complaint  after a night of the two of us watching the   pm news on the couch  Meanwhile  we could hear every footstep upstairs  and every time the neighbors leave through the shared front door it sounded like someone was coming into our unit  which we did not complain about because we understand that this is city living   The dishwasher door spring was broken so it crashed to the floor when opening  which rolled the shelves open  and ended up in broking glasses   The worst part of the entire stay was when they sent someone to fix the dishwasher  He showed up the next day  walking right into our apartment while we were there  without knocking  through the complex door and through our front door literally into our living room while we were standing there in shock  Next  when attempting to use the oven  it immediately made the smoke alarm go off because the oven was so dirty greasy  They sent someone to clean it  and it was still dirty enough to set the smoke alarm off during preheating which made the oven unusable  and during a   week stay  this was a problem   At one point the outdoor side gate was open when I came home at night and was unable to be closed locked  The Wi Fi was slow most days and was completely out on others  They finally had to provide a hotspot so I could work from home  Most cabinet drawers were broken  The couch is stained and the springs feel like they are about to come through the top of the cushion  The unit was not clean properly   there was hair and debris all over the living room rug and spiders in the corners  Many of the messages I sent about these issues were not responded to  Overall I m shocked that Zencity is allowed to manage Airbnb s  and I could never in good conscience recommend this place for anyone to stay for a significant amount of time 
456532460642429071,The apartment was very minimally appointed  There were only   towels  no coffee  no salt and pepper  etc  It was a brief walk to great restaurants in the Central West End but because of the close proximity to the hospital  there were sirens during the night  We didnt think it was a good value  The apartment was very minimally appointed  There were only   towels  no coffee  no salt and pepper  etc  It was a brief walk to great restaurants in the Central West End but because of the close proximity to the hospital  there were sirens during the night  We didnt think it was a good value 
538453662490014411,Check in process took   hour because the keys was not in the lock box it should have been in  This things should be checked often for accuracy and good customer service  When speaking to someone for assistance  they did not have the answer and was placed on hold while they tried to get answers  Room was changed three times due to this issue  Check in process took   hour because the keys was not in the lock box it should have been in  This things should be checked often for accuracy and good customer service  When speaking to someone for assistance  they did not have the answer and was placed on hold while they tried to get answers  Room was changed three times due to this issue 
481179784441823796,The main reason I decided to book this place is because I was told there would be garage parking on Pine St  The key fob for the garage did not open the gate and I was forced to park on the street  I was on a cross country trip with valuables in my car and did not feel comfortable leaving my car outside of the parking garage  As I approached my car the next morning I saw I was given a     parking ticket as well  I am extremely unhappy with everything that has transpired  Who ever runs this spot needs to check in and make sure the key fob actually works because it did not for me  The main reason I decided to book this place is because I was told there would be garage parking on Pine St  The key fob for the garage did not open the gate and I was forced to park on the street  I am on a cross country trip with many valuables in my car and did not feel comfortable leaving my car outside of the parking garage  As I approached my car this morning I saw I was given a     parking ticket as well  I am extremely unhappy with everything that has transpired and am requesting a refund  Who ever runs this spot needs to check in and make sure the key fob actually works because it did not for me  I am lucky no one decided to break into my car as I have been told not to park on the street at night in this area 
481163132444792456,No heat made the stay VERY uncomfortable  The heat was not turned until we were leaving  The thermostat was locked and could not be adjusted by us  Either give the tenant control or respond to their requests  I called every day and I received promises with no results  This is totally unacceptable  We had to wear our winter coats inside the unit   There were a couple of other items   The toilet seat was very loose  I hand tightened it but someone needs a screwdriver and a wrench   Coffee pods and a Keurig would be a nice touch   A set of measuring coups would be helpful   The lack of heat made the stay VERY unpleasant  
481119350844157433,Very horrible experience at this place I don t recommend this place for anyone There were some many things wrong I don t know were to start the door to enter the apartment building was broke was out there for   mins before a resident walked up and was like it s broken it s a trick to getting  Then once we were about enter the Elevator she informed me that dog had urinated into the elevator which no one clean up  Which almost vomited the smell was so Disgusting  Then the style of the apartment was almost like loft style in which I was assuming I was getting two Separate bedrooms  Then the  st bedroom had a dirty used diaper in the closet and the laundry room had an used tampons in there  The whole experience there was just disgusting and had me sick to my stomach
480001887874228616,Let me start off by saying I NEVER write long reviews  However  if I could give this property zero stars  I would  I had high hopes  even though this property had no reviews  because I ve booked with Zencity before  But NEVER AGAIN  The photos listed are of a totally different property  I have proof   The place was FILTHY  There was urine in the toilet  dirt and grime in the shower  and the sofa had stains on it  Not to mention there was a crackhead on the steps in the lobby  The host s communication is terrible  It took hours for them to respond  They only offered to send a housekeeper the next day and did not even acknowledge the fact that the photos on the listing did not match the property in person  I ve never had a problem with AirBnB until now  Even they were hesitant to refund my money  My trip to STL was RUINED because of Zencity and AirBnB  Do yourself a favor and don t book  I am extremely disappointed with my St  Louis stay  The property was inaccurate and not clean  Do better 
479221355011536269,Unit was not clean  Found cockroaches  Left and rebooked elsewhere  Will not book with this company again  I did not think they handled the situation appropriately 
478919048236993925,Okay 
467355148823260984,You get what you pay for  the Airbnb was nice but the actual complex was shady  The neighborhood was not too good so didn t really go out at night  Next time I would pay the extra for a better location The Airbnb was ok  a new couch is definitely needed  It was clean but there was an unusual amount of hair everywhere like bed  bathtub  etc  the neighbors were extremely loud from playing loud music all night or screaming people 
473899767851769923,The apartment was cool  location very good  easy check in but cleanliness was very poor  for the same price than a hotel  Id expect a more thorough clean    Very few kitchen appliances and utensils  Cleanliness should be better for     USD a night  which is basically more than the cost of a hotel 
445828741737742806,I was told we would get refunded for   nights because our entryway was blocked because of parties happening throughout the night  We couldn t get in or out of our room without going through people hosting an admissions table  I was told I would be able to cancel my last nights stay with no charge   We were told it could sleep    But it could barely sleep     There was mold on the shower curtain   A hole in the bathroom door  The floors were sticky   No check out instructions  were given    There were no extra blankets and the couch was a loveseat instead of a normal couch as the picture showed    I shared with them that I would go through ZenCity first before contacting airbnb if they could accommodate the issues we were having  They said they would accommodate  They didn t  so here I am  Im so disappointed in this stay and the dishonesty  I was told we would get refunded for   nights because our entryway was blocked because of parties happening throughout the night  We couldn t get in or out of our room without going through people hosting an admissions table  I was told I would be able to cancel my last nights stay with no charge   We were told it could sleep    But it could barely sleep     There was mold on the shower curtain    No check out instructions  were given    There were no extra blankets and the couch was a loveseat instead of a normal couch as the picture showed    I shared with them that I would go through ZenCity first before contacting airbnb if they could accommodate the issues we were having  They didn t so here I am  Im so disappointed in this stay and the dishonesty 
445674269189549587,When we arrived the directions to retrieve they key did not work  I messaged Zencity and did not get a response  I called and they gave me a different code that worked  Once I had the key  the security card to get into the building did not work  again  I messaged them and did not get a response  Luckily  I knew someone in the building so I got in  Later I called Zencity  again  they said they didn t know why the security card didn t work and I should contact security  The security guard told me Zencity had lost their license to operate in KC and were being evicted from the building  I guess I am fortunate I had a place to stay  The apartment was  nice but only had   small hotel size shampoo for   bathrooms and a   night stay  There were no tissues or extra blankets  etc  I would have been better off in a hotel
445564830318714073,The apartment was nice and the pictures were accurate  One negative for us was the parking situation   Zencity did say that we could get a ticket from the parking garage and have if validated by security  The security guard did validate  but he mentioned that not every guard would validate for Airbnb guests  Then  when we left for the evening  we came back to a closed garage  Apparently it is closed on weekends  So just as others have mentioned  the parking situation at the Airbnb is not great  We ended up parking a the nearby library and paid daily    We also had an issue with check in  We were given the wrong code for the locker to get the keys  and the fob to get into the building wasn t working  Zencity did respond quickly to give us the right code and the security for the building was able to help with the fob  but it was all a bit of a struggle at first   Other than these issues   the Airbnb was fine 
526805539790559911,A disappointing experience for a vibrant city    Lack of Building Access   After following the instruction on the directory  I was not presented with a prompt for building access  I repeatedly made a request to ZenCity to provide a key card as an alternative to dialling a keypad and voice activated responses  I was only able to access the building via building tenants allowing me to tailgate   Loud Air Conditioning  that is intermittent in air and temperature  If you are interested in sleep  I would say you might find you are challenged but the auditory abuse of this appliance    The following were additional items of question             Exposed Duvet without a duvet cover as bedding             Thin walls  can hear the footsteps of neighbours and conversation in the next door and above 
495669923213027413,Spacious  sparsely decorated apartment in a Good location   Be prepared to live out of your suitcase as there are no clothes dressers to place your garments during your stay   Hopefully Zencity will have replaced the missing blinds in the bedroom so you will have a modicum of privacy   With  luck  the furnace will be working your entire stay  it only operated for the last day of our four day rental   We froze and complained for three days and Zencity did nothing   Oh  and keep your fingers crossed that the sinks in the bathroom drains   We didn t have use of one bathroom for three days because our repeated  respectful requests to have it repaired  and to get the heat turned on  were ignored   I ve heard that Zen is a path towards happiness  but the road Zencity will put you on is a rocky  unpleasant path to frustration  Furnace did not work  sink did not drain and it took you three days to fix those significant problems   You never did repair the missing blinds in the bedroom   Your failure to act showed disdain for your customers 
443401937079402314,The counter was dirty and the floor was dirty   The door was not attached the curtains were falling and no privacy  There was mold on the pillows and bed  The counter and floor was dirty and their was mold on the pillows  
442718038979971606,DONT GO TO THIS PLACE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT  The most stupidest place I ve ever been to please go somewhere else even a motel would be a easier stay  Got to the freaking place the code on the lock box didn t work called and the lady was like are you sure you re at the right place yes I was at the right damn place  Are you sure you re at the right lock box there s only one lock box  Are you sure it s number    Yes  She gave us like     codes to try none of them worked  Was asked this for a damn hour  Ended up telling us to walk a couple blocks to the other Airbnb that they also have at like midnight  Would of drove but I already payed for my parking  Ended up there code didn t work for the entrance to the apt  Someone finally let us in get to our room the code for the door doesn t work  Had to call for the  RD TIME  Had to wait for another    mins finally got the right code  The place was on the  th floor not the   st like the place I wanted  The place was awful compared to what I wanted to stay at  Honestly want a reimbursement  But Foreal don t go       Sorry if I don t make since still so pissed on what happen Worst stay I ve ever had  Had better at     motels  Honestly want a reimbursement  I got to the right place couldn t get in because the codes weren t working for the box  I kept being asked the same freaking question when I told the person on the phone what was happening  You sure it s number    Yes told her it was    times was on that phone forever  Ended up having to go to a another Airbnb that you guys had that was not even as nice as the one I payed for  Code didn t work for the door had to call again for the  rd time  Finally got around   am than got woken up at    am could of let us stay longer since you guys messed it all up on your end 
490547294045883612,Disappointed in our stay  Unit is a great location  clean  and had towels  dishes    Those are literally the only good things about the trip  Where do I begin  Upon check in  it was    degrees  We attempted to adjust the thermostat  It was only blowing cold air  We notified the host immediately and did not receive a timely response  When they did respond  their advice was to use the extra blanket  which was a sheet   I was freezing so we left to meet up with friends thinking surely the host would be over soon to take a look  Nope   Upon our return  the temperature was    degrees  I called the host  He said he would call back in   minutes  At   AM I received a response  We had an absolutely awful night  No one ever came to look at the place  We found a service slip that said the thermostat was  broken and unable to cycle dated a few months ago  The unit needs repaired    We did not have time to find another place to stay so we made it work  Upon checkout  the clean people came before we had even vacated  Not impressed and we will never use Zencity again    The complete lack of communication and lack of basic temperature control was completely unacceptable  Terrible communication  We needed assistance for a comfortable stay and got literally no help 
456695657214884495,I was really looking forward to staying here for a few days  Check in was at    they didn t send check in instructions until    pm  To which i found out address on the listing was wrong  I could not get in the building because the code box was broken  they had no alternative except have someone let you in  Their keyfob did not work either  I was left on hold for over    mins and then the rep hung up  Defeated i decided to stay at a hotel instead  They never called or messaged me back  If you re able avoid this company at all cost  This isn t my first mishap with Zencity Terrible communication 
516694517148854121,It was ok  not the best or friendliest hosts ever but beggars can t be choosers I got a charger delivered cause I lost mine and it was stolen before I could use it
439765109863313450,Bring your own coffee  apartment did not have any  Big bummer when all of the family needs coffee and your an early riser  Also the check in was a mess  Many instructions to follow and we still failed  Coffee and a coffee maker would have made our stay more enjoyable  The instructions for check in were very detailed but we still struggled  We are from a small town and dont have to use parking garages often  The frustration levels were high and missed the key card to get into the building  Instruction to enter off the street were wrong since if we could have found the key card we enter in the parking garage  The bed sheets were also smelly  We had to wash them just so we could sleep
482540423806642919,Great Location  Access to the building did not work and the apartment code had to be reset  Location was very good but a feeling of being unsafe at night
465046244966541372,I was excited to stay at this unit for my trip to see a Bears game   I had a later flight  so was glad they had self check in   I assumed because this was a company as the host and not just an individual person  they would have someone on call      for any questions    I arrived at the unit and used the instructions to check in that were given to me earlier in the day   I didn t have an issue getting into the building  but when I tried to enter the code into the smart lock on the unit door it did not work    We tried several times then received an obnoxious alarm from the lock  likely meaning too many attempts   I messaged the host and called them   times   Only to sit on hold with elevator music once for   minutes   When the host responded via message about    minutes later they gave me a new code to try on the lock that I tried twice and it also did not work     I ended up leaving and going to search for a hotel to stay instead    I did contact Airbnb and I did end up getting a full refund 
440565599787211556,Good    Nice location  Hyde Park  Chicago     it s walking distance to restaurants   retail stores   Bad   both beds are broken   sinks in   very uncomfortable    couch was broken   replaced during my stay Both beds are broke  The couch was broke   replaced during my stay  Could not sleep in the bed
441212533093961818,The area was great and plenty to do  It is centrally located to a lot of other locations in Chicago if you aren t opposed to driving  The wifi did go out during my stay and it was an inconvenience for work for a few days   The host is very responsive  Hi   The wifi was a huge inconvenience  but overall it was a decent stay  Thank you 
440569830431939670,Zencity is a corporate owner that seems to operate a bunch of apartments in Chicago  Each time we contacted them  a different person responded by email  Sometimes they were prompt  other times they never replied  For example  I emailed the day before arrival to ask whether another person in our group could check in if they arrived first   Zencity never responded  Also  I emailed to ask about a late checkout and was told that the apartment had been booked so they could not accommodate my request  An hour later  I received an official email from Zencity  through the Airbnb message system  indicating that I could pay     for another night or late check out  I followed up and asked why they previously indicated that late checkout wasnt available but never got a response  So either they lied to me about having the unit booked or their automated system for offering late checkout  at a price  wasnt accurate  Overall I felt like I was dealing with an automated system rather than an actual conscious entity  You really need to make sure there are two sets of keys for an apartment that hosts four people  We had to spend an hour or so calling Zencity and working with the building management to get a second set of keys  Also  the toilet off the  master  bedroom needs to be fixed   it was running constantly during our stay 
456469962239681937,Great location and good value for the area  The bathroom and living room were not as clean as most AirBnBs Ive stayed in and check in directions were not provided ahead of time  Thank you for accommodating my day of room request   The shower drain seems to need attention   the tub started backing up before I even stepped in 
505250288263386428,Photos are fantastic  They manipulated them really well  The unit was incredibly underwhelming  Also  I was assaulted outside of the unit and the property manager did not care  I was assaulted outside of the unit and management did not help rectify the issue  They did not care

532607404622391921,This place is as advertised in a location near shops and food  also close to Wrigley field  The area is nice and the train stop is a block away  We chose it because it was within walking distance of our daughter  It is an older apartment but was clean  as some complained the floors are noisy  In winter it was nice to have good heat as we are from the south  The only issues i have are the windows in the bedrooms need better blackout curtains as the street lights outside the bedrooms are very bright at night  also if you are a light sleeper there is street noise at night  but not too bad  One other issue we told the host about the door lock was somewhat loose and not completely secure  but did stay shut  The apartment was in fair shape  but the entrance door needs some repair  The electronic lock is the only security and does not hold the door shut completely  The hole for the dead bolt is wallowed out and the inner frame is the only thing stopping it from opening  Also the curtains in the bedrooms need to do a better job of blocking out the street lights at night  The only other issue was the eviction notice left on the door in the middle of our stay  that was a little unnerving  Also it would be good for snow situations to have mats to put shoes on when entering  Over all the play was comfortable and was close to our daughters place

404340459506319511,Zens place is exactly as advertised  Simple  but it met all our needs  and the location cant be beat  The bed was comfortable  closet space and kitchen more than adequate for a short stay  Theres a desk for working  though we didnt have occasion to use it   Check in was all remote and easy  and the hosts were very responsive via messaging  Wed stay again  Hi Zen  Thanks for the stay  A couple things would make this rental better  reading lights or lamp by the bed  the lighting throughout the studio is very harsh   a drain plug for the bathtub 
391200920895083883,The place was absolutely filthy when I stayed there  The chair and loveseat were broken  the floor was sticky  and there was old take out food in the fridge that reeked  There were also tons of  bed bugs     I use airbnb all the time and this was my worst experience    Check in and location were great  I think you may need to hire a new clean service  The place was absolutely filthy when I stayed there  The chair and loveseat were broken  the floor was sticky  and there was old take out food in the fridge that reeked  I also got devoured by bed bugs  I use airbnb all the time and this was my worst experience  I tried to resolve it with your customer service but they stopped responding 
435492871995224576,The Good    the apartment has a nice view with good lighting and it is close to the train making travel into the city very easy  The Bad     The apartment was downright dirty  The floors were sticky  my boyfriend and I actually went out and bought slippers to keep from having to put our feet on the ground  The rug in the bedroom was so full of grime it was matted  The Couch was dirty and stained  The walls were a mess    the entire place needs a fresh coat of paint  Then after leaving  Zencity tried to charge us      for a broken leg on the couch    a couch that was so dirty we covered it with a sheet to sit on it  We did however  stay at another Zencity apt following this one near Wicker Park  which was much nicer  The apartment was down right dirty  The floors were sticky  The rug in the bedroom was actually matted it was so filthy  The Couch was dirty and stained  The walls were a mess    the entire place needs a coat of fresh paint  Following this stay we stayed at your other place which was much nicer 
435481202218800533,dirty It was so dirty when we checked in  The bottoms of our feet were literally black from walking around the apartment  there were stains on the counters and hairs in the beds and shower
481076417161442455,Great location  walk to CWE   We were able to park on the street  The door to the building was broken from Thursday to Monday   The comforter in one bedroom was dirty and I washed it and found the washer and pan under were dirty  One  suggestion would be to have a way to lock the unit when inside as the lock is connected to the code box  The location was great  but it was frustrating to not be able to use the door   to get in or out  in our building   We had to go to the building next door go down to the garage and walk over to the building and take the elevator up   Also people in the building were propping the door open which  also lessens  the security 
479669004695189338,It was ok but really missing the extras  the hospitality I have come to expect with AirBNB  Clean but kind of shabby  The building and location are great  Please fix the edge of the step into the bathroom  it is very sharp and dangerous  You really should make   keys available  it is nearly impossible for   people to use the building with one set  I also felt very uncomfortable leaving the keys in the unlocked apartment

536272875252039408,Everything was ok but we wouldn t stay there again because of a few things that we encountered but I let Zencity know about it and hopefully they take care of it  Everything was okay other than the bug bites I endured while staying there and the things that was broken 
536997305275825932,My group and I chose this AirBnB for the location and value  and while it is in a nice part of town  we could not have been more disappointed with the apartment and our experience with ZenCity   On the day that we arrived  we found folded towels with lipsticks stains  a folded comforter with a stain  and dirt between the sheets and comforter on one bed  Between that and the dirt visible on the rug  it was clear that this location was not clean hardly at all before our arrival  We ended up having to do laundry for all of the beds before we felt truly comfortable sleeping in them  There were also a couple of cracked glasses and countless scratches on the walls  but there was nothing we could do about that   The biggest issue we had was how dang COLD the apartment was  The window in the front window didnt seal properly  and so it was     degrees colder than the rest of the unit  The Nest Thermostat could be adjusted in a reasonable range  but after only about an hour or two  the heat would turn off  I assume to save money   This was at all times  not just at night  and so when we woke up or came back from a day of sightseeing  wed find a    degree apartment  I have pictures   with    hours until it reached our selected    degrees  This meant that our space was never comfortable enough to enjoy in the morning and evenings when we would WANT to use it   All of these issues went partially or fully unresolved  as ZenCity was absolutely impossible to reach out to  Every time a message came in or out  it was sent received by a new person after some time at ZenCity  which dragged   message conversations into hours long communications that would still leave the issue unresolved  It took   days for them to answer a question regarding where to dispose of garbage bags  and that was only after bringing up an additional issue on the  th  Regarding the temperature  they said that they adjusted settings on their end  only for the apartment to get slightly colder while we were asleep away   This stay and experience was honestly the only thing keeping us from having the perfect Chicago vacation  I would recommend staying as far away as possible from any unit managed by ZenCity 
483339108652292203,They tried to charge me      for damaged and extra clean  but the pictures of the damage and mess were for a different unit and they wouldnt respond to messages to resolve  The location and unit were nice otherwise  They had Xfinity WiFi credentials  which required a bit of setup  but worked

471717891084500864,Great location with access to walkable restaurants is the only positive of this place  My check in time was pushed back for someone to clean but it was not thoroughly clean  I had to clean the floors because there was still visible dirt and dust  I also found hair and dirt on tub  The wifi was terrible and did not work on my Macbook or iPad  I wanted to like it but I was only disappointed in the end  My check in time was pushed back for someone to clean but it was not thoroughly clean  I had to clean the floors because there was still visible dirt and dust  The bottom of my feet were black from the dirt  The mop was very dirty and I bet whoever used it did not check to see if it was clean before use   I washed it then clean the floors myself  I also found hair and dirt on tub  I clean that too  Im sure you found the leaning supplies I left to prove that  I wanted to like it but I was only disappointed in the end 
465196707776830090,Reservation was cancelled by host   minutes after the check in time   Because no notice was given  they stranded us without housing  forcing us to find a new place to stay after arriving in KC last minute    Ruined our trip   Wish I never booked with this host     
434782617314006258,Beware   this company is extremely difficult to work with    I came here to stay the weekend with a friend of mine  We wanted two separate sleeping spaces  this listing says it sleeps   people  Sounds great  When the trip got closer  I looked through the pictures and saw there s a double bed and a small couch  I messaged the AirBnB owners to make sure the couch is a pull out  confirming we ll have enough space    They said NO  this isn t a pull out  The couch looks like a loveseat  so I ask them if it s a big enough couch for an adult to sleep on  They refuse to answer my question and instead ask why I need to know if only   people are staying  Valid question  I respond that we aren t planning to share the bed  that s why we chose a place that fits   people  so we can spread out    I ask how they accommodate   people  They refuse to answer  I remind them that this is false advertising  and ask them to explain how they accommodate   people again  Eventually  they ignore me because I m asking for a refund    Is that allowed  To just ignore your client   Here s where it gets weirder when we show up  the couch IS a couch bed  This whole thing could ve been alleviated  It was so strange    The place is fine  the company is super difficult and does not treat its customers with respect  I d stay elsewhere to avoid a scam  I asked repeatedly how you could claim   people slept here  You ignored all my questions  Extremely inappropriate behavior for a business  That s a very valid question 
434712312815766952,WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN   When I arrived to the building I looked at the entrance directions that were sent by Zencity  They appeared to be very clear and I assumed I would have no problem   I WAS WRONG  First off you have enter THREE codes to get to your room  First  to get to the lobby you have to  enter the unit number on the intercom   sure no problem  First I enter      THE UNIT NUMBER   the buttons stick and enter           Great  after a few tries i get it enter     properly  Then the speaker box rings where then im supposed to say another passcode into the speaker box  The speaker rings once then I get an error message  unable to complete call    So after    minutes of trying to figure out what is happening someone happened to be leaving the lobby and asked  Air BNB  This happened to me too  Someone let me and activated the elevator for me  They told me it happened to them too  But its fine when you get up there youll have a key waiting and you can use it to get in from now on  Okay so annoying but no big deal  He lets me up  I get upstairs and enter my room with a THIRD CODE  I get in the room and there is no key  NO KEY  So now I cant leave the building without having repeat this entire process  I send a message to Zencity   no answer  I call the phone number and get a hold of someone named Asheen  Hes the lone guy managing the phones for the all the Zencity Airbnbs  He tells me it can take       hours to get me a key      Im here for    hours how is this going work when I have to leave for business  Then he says he has a new code for me to try so I go back downstairs and try it  it doesnt work    So now im STUCK in the lobby with no ability to get upstairs  Asheen tried a few more codes and even he couldnt decipher what the instructions meant  So then he got off the phone to try to get a hold of someone else in the company  I sat in the lobby for    minutes to an hour with NO IDEA when id get back upstairs  And even if I did i still wouldnt be able to leave to conduct the business I traveled to do  I eventually get a call back with a code to a lockbox that has an extra keycard   If not for Asheen continually calling to other Zencity employees I would have been stuck there for who knows how long  I then requested a call back from management about the issue which I NEVER GOT   If I was an older person or a foreign traveler it would have been so much harder to figure this out and could have been much worse   What kind of person thinks THREE DIFFERENT security codes is a good plan to enter a building  elevator and room is a good idea  If your phone dies or you lose it your screwed  if you dont write the code down on paper and lose it your screwed  if you arrive and you dont have  key card and you cant get a hold of someone youre screwed   I was the third person this happened to THAT DAY   Just stay somewhere else that has a normal entrance process instead of something thats more of a pain that entering the Pentagon  Have someone who can actually explain something properly rewrite the  how to get into the building  section  Also no one wants to enter   different codes to get into a building  Its obnoxious
511561185670312134,Cleanliness was spot on  We ran into some issues with checking in since they didn t send us a code for the door  along with pluming issues with the shower that never got resolved  Otherwise the location was absolutely amazing  I appreciate the cleanliness of the property and room  I partially blame myself for not addressing the shower situation sooner however  we here hardly in the room due to hanging out and enjoying the city  I still wish that was something that could ve been fixed due to the fact that we both took one shower and wasn t able to take any more since which upsets me  Other than that and the check in issue with not receiving the door code and being locked out for       mins in the beginning I felt generous enough to still leave a decent review for you all due to attempting to address each situation to the best of your abilities  Thank you 
479694632191434366,This unit is on the  rd floor accessible by circular stairs only  Beware if bringing luggage  Stairwell is dirty   Unit accessed off an alley and if motion sensor light on building across isn t working you can t see well to enter the door code to enter stairwell  Unit could use a good clean and old items replaced  The wall vent needs to be clean and the hot water kettle is gross and needs to be replaced  The trash cans are beat up and the soap dispenser in the bathroom doesn t work and looks gross as well   Overall the worst Airbnb I ve ever stayed in
572530731196279466,We booked last minute and was excited to find a place a block away from the magnificent mile  This was the perfect location for an impromptu Chicago trip  The place appeared clean and stocked  But we had some issues with the apartment    The first morning when making French press coffee  it was discovered that the provided French press was cracked and leaked everywhere  I messaged Zencity and the response I got was  did you take a picture  Ummmmm no  I clean it up and messaged the owner  No concern was given  I had to go to Starbucks to get our coffee   The place was also not as clean as it appeared  The bathroom mat had hair all over it  The vent in the kitchen was so black from dirt dust  There were some coffee cups that were immediately placed in the dishwasher because the were not clean   The towel bar and toilet paper holder kept falling off   The shower s water pressure was a joke and the tub drained sooooo slowly that our feet took a bath while we showered   It was very annoying having to put in a code to get in the building and a different one to get into the apartment  Every other high rise apartment we ve stayed in had a key fob to use during the stay  Not a dealbreaker but very annoying    We didn t let this ruin our short trip  The location was perfect but the place needs some attention  We were extremely disappointed with the apartment  Some things really upset us with the apartment      The place was most definitely not clean   Most of the coffee cups in the cabinet were dirty or stained beyond clean and placed in the dishwasher   The bathroom rug had hair all over it   The vent in the kitchen had so much dirt on it  I have a picture   I couldn t possibly see how any air moved though it      The French press that was in the cabinet was cracked  When I poured water in it  water started leaking everywhere  I messaged our first morning and no remedy was offered      The towel and toilet paper holder fell off repeatedly  I have a picture   All the fittings were loose and every time we dried our hands or tried to use the towel bar  it just fell off  We had to take off the toilet paper roll off the holder in order for it to be useful      It was very very annoying to have to put in the codes every time we wanted to get back in  This is the only place if this type that required putting in a code more than once  Every other had a key fob for ease of access      The shower pressure was a joke but that didn t stop the tub from not draining  So we had to shower while our feet got a dirty bath   It s apparent that every expense was spared when renting this place  We have stayed in dozens of airbnbs and can tell when little effort was put forth in renting this 
545611601510146450,Great safe on site   The front desk staff is amazing    The location can t be beat   I had a horrible sewage stench in my unit   It was unlivable   Maintenance agreed  but zencity did nothing about it and management would not return my repeated calls and emails  I do not recommend   While it is a great value and location  zencity is I responsible and unreliable should something go wrong with one of their units  I wanted to love this place   It would have been a great value while I stayed in St  Louis to be with my hospitalized mother   However  the unit smell horribly   I begged to be moved and while everyone acknowledged the smell of sewage that permeated throughout the unit and even agreed that no one else could stay until the problem was fixed  no one helped me   My repeated requests were ignored 
545723142154470020,I ve stayed with zen city before and had no issue this time was not the best there was no remote in the unit so I was unable to watch tv I was told multiple times a remote was dropped off to my unit and was sent photos but the u to I was getting photos of was not mine I also had several oil stain  hand prints over the walls in the bedroom and the communication turn around seemed to take forever
455749214333240557,Could have been great   Wonderful location   Historic building    But    I had consistent trouble over several days getting through a security door   Contact person seemed surprised to be contacted   No follow up after several contacts to note the issues   It was a basement apartment with little light  stained and broken chair and a noisy and uncomfortable bed   Great claw foot tub  should be noted for those with accessability issues   Disappointing and if it were not for the love I have for the neighborhood and being there  I would have subtracted a star   Bad and inconsistent communication and service  I wanted to say positive things about my experience  really   I love Hyde Park and the Blackstone Villa has such historic meaning   I went to school at U of C and always look forward to being back  Your information about the room was misleading   And there was never any follow up when I had problem after problem getting into the building   I am just grateful for the amount of people who were residents that assisted me in getting through the security door and into the building   The room had little light because of the basement  the hallway smelled of sewage several times  the smoke alarm in the hall went off the entire time I was there  even after I alerted the maintenance people   There was never a check in to see if things were ok after I noted a problem to you   I called the contact number who was surprised by my call   This was the worst communication problem I have had on AirBnB  by far   In fact  I have NEVER had problems with communication with any other location over many years   And the worst bed I have ever slept on too 
460153545135730197,This spot is the perfect location if you plan to be out and about most of the weekend    and home late after a few drinks  Like the other reviews mention  the bars downstairs are loud till       AM on weekends  so if you dont sleep well  this is not the place to stay  Its also not the nicest cleanest place  so if you cant stand a weird bathroom fan smell or odor coming from the dishwasher  then again  I would probably steer clear of this place  The Wi Fi was a bit spotty at times    I recommend going to Philz Coffee up the street if you need to WFH  Halligan  right downstairs  is an awesome pub to catch a football game or to kill time  King of Cups  half block down Lincoln Ave  is this medieval themed speakeasy that is pretty awesome if youre looking for tasty cocktails  Dash of Salt is a solid brunch spot on that same block  I had probably the best gyro of my life at Athenian Room  which is around Oz park  SW of the apartment  If youre visiting with intentions to party and have a convenient home base to hang at in Lincoln Park  then this is a pretty affordable option in my opinion  I would not  however  choose this airbnb if I was in town for work or needed a comfy place to get a good nights sleep  We enjoyed our time in Chicago    the location of the apartment was perfect  However        something must be done about the bathroom  The toilet can barely flush  and the fan reeks of sewage      Same with the dishwasher  We ran it once and the entire apartment smelled awful  Again  of sewage      There were hairs all over the mattress when we showed up  so wasnt sure if they were clean      Wi Fi was very slow and spotty at times      We knew going into staying there that it would be loud  but you should really put a disclaimer on the listing that lets customers know just how loud it really gets  It was   AM on Saturday and the music was still pumping downstairs at Hook   Ladder  For people that arent going out  thats gotta be really annoying 
455789212744246107,This place is the worst Airbnb I ve ever experienced  The place is very super dirty  We walked barefoot in the room and our feet were dark  Dust is everywhere in the room especially on the carpet in the living room  My one year old niece sat there and she got rashes all over her legs  We also found glasses and foods on the floor too   I smelled like someone head on the pillow in my bedroom which was very disgusting  I knew right away they didnt change the bed sheet for us   When I first used the microwave  I found a piece of chicken left in there   I told the host what we faced  and the cleaner came to clean again after   days The communication was very bad because you would get reply in a few days or never  The ONLY good thing about this place is location    Place looks exactly like in the photos  If the host care more about cleanliness  this place would be great
572451857330439521,Terrible
572463225927727022,Place was clean and location was great  Seemed quite different from pictures though  It was a strange layout  dark and dreary  very little lighting and a second door that was unexpected  Place was super hot at first  contacted landlord who was very responsive  Little or no internet  Just an ok place to stay 
461435094479266389,Horrible  Would not recommend  Set us up for check in on Sunday   Office was not open on Sundays to retrieve key fob   No correspondence  would not answer phone       would NOT recommend 
460157285547973176,   The check in process did not go as planned  The code sent to me  for the lockbox downstairs was incorrect  The box kept responding that the code wasn t recognized  I had to call the emergency number and an individual remotely opened the box to give me access to the key       The tub doesn t drain  There was hair and other things that came up from the drain when I turned the shower on  The tub also had hair and other matter in the tub  The shower curtain also needs to be replaced   clear and very sticky      The clean sign posted near the front door of the apartment had no new dates  so I m not sure the apartment was clean prior to my arrival      The WiFi network posted by the door did not exist  I had to use another WiFi network and just so happens the password worked      I had difficulty returning the key  I had to ask my Uber driver to wait for my while I called the emergency number and then ultimately had to restart the machine for it to work properly   My flight was at  am and I almost missed it 
528327150442913549,The Good  Clean  convenient location  quiet  decent price for what you get  bedrooms spacious and comfortable  The Bad  Hokey gaps in the LVP flooring and bad drywall repairs  could use more towels and washcloths considering we got   towels and   washcloths for a   person   day stay  the pictures make the living room look big but in reality the furniture is very small and uncomfortable to sit in  Is like the whole area was designed for someone who is      The post says no parking  but we were given parking by the building and then had it taken away the last day  Theres a parking garage about a block away for     a night  but street parking is very limited    Note  If these things dont matter to you and youre just looking for somewhere to crash while you explore St  Louis  then its not too bad considering the price and location     mins from downtown   We really didnt mind  but I figure people should know the reality of what they are paying for 
534049136711572387,Would stay again
484525436386907262,Check in was extremely difficult and overall process was not smooth   After entering the code given into the intercom outside  there was no response to be let into the building   Luckily someone was walking out so we were able to get inside   Once inside  the lockbox to access the key was unplugged and it took over an hour to reboot to obtain the room key  Check in was extremely difficult   Could not get in the front door with the instructions given and key lockbox inside was unplug so we were unable to get our key  Process took more than   hours
545813732958241298,The property I originally tried to rent became unavailable  so we were offered another property in a different location  When I went on to accept the request change  i realized this property was a studio when we had originally rented a   bedroom with city views  This listing was  also somewhere around        less a night  so I asked if we could refunded the difference and was told they would be  checking with management   I didn t hear anything back for over   hrs  despite checking back in to see if our request had been accepted  After    hours of no response  we got a message that our property was no longer available and that we needed to cancel  We received this message after just having landed on KC from California  Needless to say our experience was less than pleasant  I would not recommend renting from this management company as they are unreliable and not accommodating  The property I originally tried to rent became unavailable  so we were offered another property in a different location  When you were sending me the link to ask if the replacement property was acceptable  the link wouldn t work after   different attempts to resend it to me  When I went on to accept the request change  i realized this property was a studio and was listed somewhere around        less a night  I asked if we could refunded the difference and was told you would be  checking with management   I didn t hear anything back for over   hrs  despite checking back in to see if our request had been accepted  After   th a of no response  we got a message that our property was no longer available and that we needed to cancel  We received this message after just having landed on KC from California  Needless to say our experience was less than pleasant 
568184390046866442,I would not recommend this place  The place was in disrepair and dirty  Maintenance was required so the shower would work  They stopped by while I was out of the unit  the host did not communicate well and proceeded to injure themselves while doing the repair  They tracked their blood all over unit including on the towels  They gave me the false impression that they would award my requested refund amount  equivalent to      and instead then changed the offer to a paltry amount equivalent to a night s clean fee    Do yourself a favor  stay somewhere else  If I could award zero stars I would   I arrived to a dirty  run down apartment with broken cabinets  dirty counters  and dirty towels  However I wanted to give the host the benefit of the doubt  so I told them they didn t need to come clean  just be aware   Then I noticed the shower wouldn t drain  I communicated to them that this had to be addressed ASAP  They told me that as it was the weekend  it would take two days to repair the shower  I replied that this was unacceptable and that they would need to resolve the issue that day  They then stopped replying to me    I left the unit for several hours  When I returned I noticed they had fixed the shower and injured themselves in the process  I knew because their blood was tracked all over the floor and the towels set out for my use    I then contacted the host again and demanded a discount based on my experience  They gave me the false impression that the refund amount I requested  approx      had been approved  For this reason I did not bother to follow up w AirBnB   Once I returned home from the trip I followed up with the host to inquire when my refund would be awarded  Only then was I told the host was considering IF my experience warranted a refund  Angry  I contacted AirBnB to be told because I had not contacted them sooner  it was outside their control  Even though I refrained from contacting AirBnB as the host had lied to me  implying initially the refund would be issued   The host now claims I am due a paltry refund of less than one night s clean fee  I highly doubt I will ever see even that pitiful sum  When I called AirBnB today  an agent informed me that someone else will have to call me back regarding processing the refund 
568811427041154957,The condo needs a lot of repairs and clean  The pictures seem to have a filter  everything is much older and not as nice The condo needs a lot of repairs and clean The entrance was so dirty with dirty cloths and old plastic bottles on the stairs  The windows needs to be sealed   really cold wind coming through  The bath as tapes on the tiles and the ceiling needs repair The living room window is ripped  One of rooms has a terrible mattress on an assemble bed  The furnace noise is too too loud  The pictures seem to have a filter over  Everything is much older and not as nice  I can send you the pictures if you like
466668142900040820,The room has roaches   mice running around  Bring bug  killers   mice traps with you if you book this place They was roaches  and mice in the apartment  it was very nasty 
567412730606448986,I am never staying with Zencity again they promote    hr check in so when I arrive after a snowstorm at  am they tell me I can t check in so I m forced to get a hotel but while on my way their I had a representative tell me I d be okay to check in even gave me the door code but the code didn t work on arrival the TV didn t work either so for the     days no TV and its also been broken into before back door is all busted up and you can see damage as if forcible entry was used I did not like the people running this I think companies taking over this app is the worst thing that has happened on here I am not staying with y all again don t promote    hr check in and then have one employee tell me I can check in then can t and need a hotel y all are so whack
546333153971527101,Unit        the place it s self is fine    However   it is a two bedroom that has only one key for the apartment and only one key fob to enter the apartment complex   The unit is on the   th floor that requires key fob the enter building and key fob to access the elevator    Entry to the unit requires another key   We had two business travelers and Zencity  refused to help us secure another key and fob for our four day stay   We had to hide a key in the hallway  on an emergency exit sign so we both had access to the unit    Anytime one left or one of us went to bed we had to hide the key on the exit sign  Luckily building security was kind to us and let us in the building when needed and got us on elevator that you needed key fob for   There was no where to hide the  Fob so one of us always had to have it  This was business travel and my coworker and I were on different schedules   Total inconvenience   After a long day of travel and checkin issues  followed by calls to Zencity customer service about the key issue  decided to take a shower the first night   There was zero hot water in the unit   Called Zencity again their response was there is low water pressure in the building run the water for a longer period of time    Ran all faucets for    minutes no hot water   Zencity informed after a    hour travel day they may be able to have someone come look the next day   Eventually located the hot water heater on my own   Was in a trap door in kitchen area about   feet above ground   Also located fuse box  on my own and ended up fixing the issue on my own   Had to trip the breaker for hot water heater   times during stay   On check out day we were    minutes late when clean services miraculously showed up on time    miraculous  because we had zero customer service for our issues the entire stay but the turnover service was ready to roll   Check out was at       a m  By        a m   we were out the door and I began receiving phone calls threatening late check out fees    We were late because we had no hot water the morning of check out and had to restart again   By this time  I had lost patience with Zencity and was not too calm with those calling me about late check out   When I arrived home   hours later I had an email from Zencity stating there was a stolen item and they wanted       The device  supposedly stolen is call a Minut device   that apparently reads the decibel level in the unit to ensure there are no parties   I Was sent a picture of the device that we never touched  still intact    However  I think someone must have stolen their coffee maker at one point because there was not on in the unit   First time I ve ever had an Airbnb with no coffee maker   Despite those issues the unit itself was fine   Needs some paint   However   the management group Zencity  is more like ZENSH  TY   Will never stay in a unit managed by them     Building security tho A    those guys saved us  
458630309493751596,Nice location  pretty clean  had a few things broken unable to use and poor communication on host end  I was very dissatisfied with my stay  Mostly because of the poor communication  Thing were broken and and I felt as if you all didn t care enough to communicate with me about concerns   I am still waiting on response from you all 
458699238771175475,We were excited to spend some time in Chicago  A while after checking in  we noticed that the apartment had not been thoroughly clean  There was a piece of plastic on the counter  crumbs all over the couch and hair everywhere that did not belong to us weaved into the towels  The lack of communication and understanding was a major set back as the host wanted to do the very minimum about it all  even with pics for proof   I would only recommend staying here if youre okay with doing your own clean before doing anything else 
480442291715863052,It s a great location  but you re probably going to have issues with checkin  Zencity failed to provide me with ANY accurate information regarding checkin  I needed three main things  the code to the main door  the code to the airbnb unit  and a key fob  Zencity gave me NONE of these accurately  All the info in the checkin instructions seemed to be outdated    Since they gave me the wrong code to the main doors  l I tried to get in touch with them  and the number they gave me sent to an out of state  national corporate number  After a series of holds and waiting for an hour  outside the airbnb building  with all my luggage   the woman on the phone was obviously in a loud public setting  and proceeded to give me not one  but TWO wrong codes for the airbnb apartment unit  I was able to get in the building by the grace of another resident of the building  who also used their keycard to help me get to the floor I needed    They also failed to provide me with a keycard   which you need to use the elevators  doors  stairs  and to enter the building  Without it  you re quite literally trapped in the room  or you have to depend on other residents to give you access to your floor  the elevator  and the main building    That being said  the place itself is very nice  No microwave or laundry in unit  It s an apartment building  Pickwick Plaza Apartments   and they had delightful people in their leasing office who talked to me about Zencity and their pattern behaviors towards clients     Overall  kind of a nightmare  Skip it unless you re cool with waiting outside on the streets of KC while on a call with someone in Palm Springs  CA  trying to get into this building 
484026566205412253,The apartment and location were wonderful and a very reasonable price  However  initially finding the apartment in the building took about    minutes with the instructions given   Hint  go through the doors that look like the gym  When we finally got into the apartment  we noticed there was no parking pass  Zen city makes it very clear that you may get towed for street parking or for parking on their lot with no parking pass  I left several messages with Zencity about our parking pass being missing and after being sent around with several automated messages signed by different people  someone finally brought us a pass on our third day  This was somewhat stressful because we had a rental car and we were very worried about having a rental towed    On our first night  we decided to extend our stay because the apartment is very decently priced for the space and location   It has a washer and dryer which was very helpful because we had been traveling over a month and needed to do laundry  Half way through our stay  Zen city changed the code to the front door and we were locked out at   PM and had to spend nearly    minutes on the phone and wait about    minutes to have the code activate so we could finally get inside    All in all  I d say the apartment it s self is great if you re not worried about a few dirty dishes or scuffs on the walls  I d likely stay here again if it was under different management  We really did enjoy the location and the apartment it s self  However  finding the apartment was very difficult with the instructions given  We also were not left with a parking pass on arrival and communication with your team and receiving the parking pass took several days and several attempts  Dishes in the cabinet were dirty and the code to get into the front door was changed in the middle of our stay which was frustrating to deal with at   PM 
563836979108308594,Wasn t pleased with the stay   I was Looking for a place with free parking   a kitchen in a good location  Although it had all three   when we first arrived the person said he was new   didn know what to do when it came to the zencity apartments  His manager was in a meeting   he was waiting on her to call back  Then they couldn t find the key  Finally found the key   Got in the apartment   it was just not what i expected   There was stains on the counters   handles on the cabinets  Also smeared glass   microwave  The inside of the of the sink drain was yellow   Like bad rusted   Immediately I sent The owner pictures because we was writing each other back   forth because of the issue with the key   suddenly he stop writing me   I had To go out   get clean supplies   other stuff to make myself a little comfortable  The owner responded   hours later   The place wasn t that much so i guess You get what you pay for   Wouldn t stay again As i told You before the house wasn t clean   For it to be Covid going on you would think the place would be clean   sanitized 
518069187015067317,The apartment wasnt clean properly  The floors were dusty and there were roaches  There were roaches even in the dishwasher  I dealt with the roach issue since I didnt have time to pack my stuff and move to a new location since I was there for work  I also had already paid for a months stay and they were not giving me a refund  When I addressed the issue the company offered a  courtesy tidy up  mid month  I emphasized that clean the apartment wasnt going to solve the issue and that they needed pest control  I requested to be moved to another building but they could not accommodate me  On my last day at the apartment  someone tried to break in  The only reason they could not enter is that I had an anti burglary lock on the door  After the attempted break into the apartment  I decided to leave  I wasnt issued a refund not even for the remaining weeks I already paid for  This was my first experience using an airb b and it was a terrible experience 
529023071574577410,My stay was okay  however there were a few issues that I wish I was aware of when I booked    Cons    Check in   parking instructions were lengthy  Parking instructions indicated to enter the garage on Pine Street  The entrance here was blocked off by cones and the gate would not open  After circling the streets surrounding the garage a few times  we were finally able to enter on another street     The instructions indicated that there would be a parking pass to hang from our windshield  we saw these passes on all other cars parked in this garage  However  no pass was provided for us so we were concerned throughout our whole stay that we may be towed  I made Zencity aware of this and they said  sorry   and provided no further assistance  Luckily we were not towed  but boy was I anxious       The photos on this listing do not represent the actual apartment  We were expecting a studio with a large couch  Instead we got a one bedroom with a tiny tiny couch  May not seem like a big deal but we like to watch TV laying down so it was disappointing that we either had to lay in the bedroom with no TV or sit on the tiny stiff couch  Zencity messaged me at the end of my stay and asked for a positive review and requested that I inform them of any problems via message  So I told them about this and all they had to say again was  ok  Sorry   Really makes it seem like they just want attractive public reviews and dont care for their guests     Speaking of TV  this listing has a Netflix account available for guests to use  Bad news is that this same Netflix account is shared with their other listings so we were not able to use the Netflix as too many other users were on it     Pros    This listing is SUPER close to the enterprise center so we were able to walk to the blues game  Its also close to Union Station and Wash Ave so lots of walkable dining options are available     the view of the arch is great     apartment is clean and has all of the basics that youll need  Hot water took no time for me
572523881950984659,The building was secure where you needed a key card to enter and leave  The beds were very comfortable and the space was big for a two bedroom two bathroom unit  The location includes covered parking and most things are within walking distance  The room was clean but did not seem to be vacuumed beforehand  the shower water pressure was minimal  and it was hard to reach someone for help on the weekends  Not the best  not the worst 
572521099459745595,Overall  I would say my stay here was okay  The location was good and the interior was very nice  I did have an issue upon check in with my access code and had to actually set off the alarm on the door multiple times before anyone responded to me  The elevator also broke in the building and you have to access the stairs in the back of the building  I would have never known this if was not for someone that worked at the restaurant next door  You also have to have a separate code to enter the back door and had to wait outside in the cold to get ahold of someone  I would probably not stay at this location again 
451466196885365584,I got locked out and had a door code that worked earlier  I had to sit in the hall for and hour with my work equipment because check in was delayed  The instructions were  the most vague information I have ever read 
571512367033458897,BOOK WITH CAUTION   I never write reviews but this time I had to  I ve used Airbnb for many years and this has to be the worse experience ever    We arrived at  pm to the building   Check in time   The doorman for the building was helpful but they do not work for Zencity  Other tenants live there  not Airbnb related units   Anyways  we arrive and we go up to the unit  This unit only opens with a digital keycode  There is no physical key  We spent     hours on call with customer support at Zencity trying to get in  All the codes they gave us did not work  We tried over     times probably  The building doorman  not associated with Zencity  offered to help but they also could not get in  Zencity customer support was so unhelpful and they were acting with no urgency  They kept asking us if we were entering the code right  it s not rocket science to enter a code   They never sent an actual person to help physically  Never  No one    After this  it s been   week and they still have not refunded me  I keep messaging them but they regurgitate the same message    we are waiting for manager approval    Huh   Why would this require   week   There s clear evidence between messages and phone calls that we were never able to get in     In short  terrible experience  Horrible customer support  I would never want to book with Zencity again  You ve been warned  Please focus on making sure the customer is first 
571738894394025777,The unit itself was fine  especially for the price  The thing my group didn t like was how the common area and hallways were dirty   reeked of smoke  At one point some people were openly smoking cigarettes in the lobby  Again the unit itself was okay   livable 
454286154152871289,Cute place  but keep in mind it s not around a LOT of shops or places to eat really  Also the bed was not comfortable at all    Host was great and the building was nice   Cute place but please buy your guests a new bed   it was so uncomfortable and we did not sleep well  Otherwise great place  thanks for having us 
545682674433588458,My husband and I stayed in this unit for a week  While visibly clean  the unit reeked of cigarette smoke  we could smell it through our N    masks when we walked in the door   It was obvious someone had smoked  and smoked A LOT  in the unit very recently  The smell of cigarette smoke was so strong that it gave us both headaches    We asked to be moved  and were told there were no other rooms available  We asked for an air purifier  and they said they could bring an ozone machine but wed have to vacate the property for several hours    and that they couldnt give us a specific time when they would should up  Zencity was extremely slow in responding to our messages about the room    We had to leave all the windows open for three days and nights    in January  in St  Louis  it was freezing cold outside     to clear most of the smoke smell out   It was a very frustrating experience 
571007877545873592,Also  No coffee pot Wi Fi was not listed   when a message was sent  the same instructions were sent  Then requested pictures  Didn t seem to be a person paying attention   Leaving instructions are WRONG  We got trapped because of that 
518168969844162315,Solid location  It s about      minute walk from blue line metro station and a bus that can take you to Gold Coast  Decently safe area  the specific street the apartment is on felt safe   The apartment was clean but had a weird smell in it  Not bad just an old kind of smell  There were air fresheners but they were empty    I extended my stay an extra day and was locked out of the apartment the night before the last day  which was very frustrating  It took me    minutes to get ahold of someone to provide a working code  After I checked out  I received a claim that I broke one of the ceiling fans and should pay      This unit didn t have a fan and the screenshots were definitely not from this place   Overall decent stay and the price was very reasonable but working with the host company was not great 
569636472581587551,Customer service is the worst  Once I pay an extra night they did not generate a new code for me  so once I went to eat  they kicked me out from the Aparment and then I had to be outside for   hours while it was snowing waiting for a new access code   There is not a phone number and if you chat they take   hour to answer back  It is not a good idea to stay here  Customer service is the worst  Once I pay an extra night they did not generate a new code for me  so once I went to eat  they kicked me out from the Aparment and then I had to be outside for   hours while it was snowing waiting for a new access code 
462273609039134980,I was in my apartment and someone who doesn t even stay there walked into my place  It was scary  The host wouldn t even respond  I got it recorded also  It was very weird Hey I been trying to reach out to you all for the longest  I have a recorded conversation on the phone with you all while someone walked into my location that wasn t staying there  They already had the key pad entrance  I was scared of my life especially with everything going on in this city  The girl didn t even belong in the building
459368466954335917,Great location and great layout of an apartment   Theres a grocery store on the bottom level of the complex which was really helpful  Hello    The apartment was in a great location and designed well   but it wasnt very clean   The dishes that were put away on the shelves were very dirty   The sponges for clean the dishes were actually moldy  I bought a new one to use during my stay   The outside porch area had lots of cobwebs or spiderwebs  which led me to realize that the housekeeper never actually clean that area   Also  there were several hairballs in the living room   I wouldnt really want to write a bad public review  but I would suggest getting a different housekeeper    Best    K A
572524541322086239,nope I have pictures of clusters of pubic hair in the hallway and in the elevator waiting area on the  th floor  The night before I left  there were shards of glass on the elevator left by the clean crew  You need to watch the clean crew  because those people are making   person do the majorityof the work while the restof those lazy fucks sit against the wall relaxing  Saw it twice   and yes  they were all black  I was in the same situation    years ago   Youre saving money on clean  but in the end its going to cost you  Eat shit all the way until your noy is Turdville  not leaving a bad review   but you need to have a rover to check the situation in your common areas 
507105934490869512,This property is not as expected   Though they advertise exceptional clean there was still hair in the shower drain   There were holes in the walls where the blinds had been pulled out of the wall  There were tiles missing off the bathroom walls  The worst part is the room is right next to the elevator  an elevator that  squeaks    So every time the right elevator goes up or down  day or night  you hear it   The room is so hot you have to turn on the room unit which goes on and off constantly and is in the living space so you will need to constantly adjust the TV volume  the air unit also has a terrible oder for the first day   I contacted Them within the first   hours of checking in with concerns   they did offer many other options in the near area  Now they want me to pay      fee for a missing key fob  that opened the main door and elevators  
572515349885286380,Tl dr  would not recommend    First problem was that the code to the apartment door given was incorrect  After sending a message and receiving no response  I called  The property management company gave me several different codes to try and finally one of them worked  When i got in  the place smelled like cigarettes  It was tidy but not clean  Stain on blanket and a previous guest s items  stripper heels   left in the chest of drawers  There was a car parked in my designated spot  which i reported and parked on the street for the night  hoping that it would be gone in the morning  It wasn t and was still there that evening  I let them know  again  and they advised that it was my responsibility to call and have it towed   I did not   The steps from the parking area were icy for days and never salted  very dangerous  as there is no railing  Don t plan on cooking here  as there are only two tiny saucepans and one tiny skillet  No dishwashing soap  The walls are incredibly thin  and i could hear every movement and sound of the neighboring apartments  A huge panel of the wooden fence had fallen down into the pool area  and appeared to have been forgotten there for some time  The gym had only two  lb weighs  a   lb and   lb weight  and a few ancient pieces of exercise equipment  This is one of the cheaper airbnbs in the area  but i would suggest paying     more and getting somewhere decent to stay  The best thing about this place is that they did have good coffee in the cupboard  but overall not a good stay  Completely unacceptable to suggest that it was my responsibility to have someone s car towed 
518142148630032514,The door was open when checking in and the door lock didn t work at the beginning  Never answered chat through the Airbnb app so don t try it there but rather call them  The CS agent on the phone was very kind and fixed the lock problem right away  Probly not coming bck 
480453736984813328,I m sure they re fine   but they need to be more understanding of things that are out of someone s control like having to check out early  I checked out a day early due to a family emergency and was able to recoup    of that due to their lack of understanding 
460078474829051289,The apartment itself was fine it s a basement apartment so it has a damp smell and daddy long legs   we killed four a while we were there  Everything was clean and the location was great  The problem came in with the owner upon arrival we immediately received a noise complaint notification one of the mini that we received while we were there we weren t even able to talk   laugh without getting a complaint  We spoke to the neighbors who said they never filed any complaint and could barely hear us so that was very perplexing upon check out we received a notification that we would be charged      for a missing charger base that one of my friends had accidentally taken we offered to drop it back off and never received a response  You never responded about how I can return the base
572486490351822780,I gave this     because my check in was ridiculous long this time  this is my second time using Zencity     however everything else was okay except for there not being a sink in the bathroom   I gave this     because my check in was ridiculous long this time  this is my second time using Zencity     however everything else was okay except for there not being a sink in the bathroom  
480413420847547131,DO NOT STAY WITH ZENCITY   We were never able to actually access the apartment  the key was missing   After we messaged them about the problem  Zencity apparently knew that it had been missing since October  th and didnt do anything about it   They didnt have anywhere for us to stay so we ended up sleeping in our car   Thanks for nothing  assholes
534076659944536020,Not bad for the price but the view and appearance cover up a lot   Mold in the AC units  shower head sprayed the ceiling causing mold  no tenants wore masks in elevators  parking is a bit of an unsafe walk away  and bullet casings on the sidewalks 
461602142539336460,It s dirty and stinky not worth even a dolor I was going to stay here when I got to the place first had problems just to be able to get in then once in the building the smell was horrible and then got to the apt it was so dirty I decided to cancel and they didn t refund my money because of they re canceling policy but if I m sopposed to get a clean apt and get the opposite I should have gotten my money back oh and the place looks nothing like the pictures It s dirty and stinky not worth even a dolor I was going to stay here when I got to the place first had problems just to be able to get in then once in the building the smell was horrible and then got to the apt it was so dirty I decided to cancel and they didn t refund my money because of they re canceling policy but if I m sopposed to get a clean apt and get the opposite I should have gotten my money back oh and the place looks nothing like the pictures
463033185283992907,Truth be told this is ALL location location location  Other then that not much more to say about the apartment  we could not get an early check in due to the apartment being clean and so we were expecting just that     far from it  unfortunate because with just basic and care and basic items the unit could be a true GEM    NO COFFEE maker  we were in town mostly for work and do rely on basic necessities and a coffee maker is one of them   no blender like I said if it wasnt for the location and rooftop not much more to say about the unit or the customer service Truth be told this is ALL location location location  Other then that not much more to say about the apartment  we could not get an early check in due to the apartment being clean and so we were expecting just that     far from it  The floors were far from being clean there were fingerprints on the stove and microwave the fridge was not clean at all there were crumbs everywhere  the bathroom tub had hair in the tub and on the wall   the tub did not drain and when brought to someones attention not much concern was given  NO COFFEE maker  we were in town mostly for work and do rely on basic necessities and a coffee maker is one of them   no blender like I said if it wasnt for the location and rooftop not much more to say about the unit or the customer service
505081726428628943,This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with Airbnb  Just Checking in is was horrible because I received a different room then what I paid for  Once I got to the new room  there were a few instructions someone forgot to mention in the email  and I was unable to get to the key fob that would give me access to the building door  Once I finally received the key fob  there was issue with the door code for the room and it took over  hrs to get into the room  The room only had one sink  located in the kitchen ONLY  and it suffered water damage in the bathroom  Finally a day before my checkout  I had no access to my room because the door code no longer worked  and it took over  hrs before Zencity decided to give me a new room for the night  This was an inconvenience for me because all of my belongings were in my room and once I got to the new for the night  there was no available WiFi and I couldn t charge my phone  Zencity was able to get me into the room early the next morning but due to the time it took I lost some wages for the day  as I was working remotely  I asked them about compensation for the trip and they still are giving me the run around  The only thing that ran smoothly   was the checkout process  That was the only good thing about this disaster of a Airbnb booking  I would not recommend Zencity to anyone  You re not missing out on anything here  there are hundreds of Airbnb I m sure are much better  and at this price point  This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with Airbnb  Just Checking in is was horrible because I received a different room then what I paid for  Once I got to the new room  there were a few instructions someone forgot to mention in the email  and I was unable to get to the key fob that would give me access to the building door  Once I finally received the key fob  there was issue with the door code for the room and it took over  hrs to get into the room  The room only had one sink  located in the kitchen ONLY  and it suffered water damage in the bathroom  Finally a day before my checkout  I had no access to my room because the door code no longer worked  and it took over  hrs before Zencity decided to give me a new room for the night  This was an inconvenience for me because all of my belongings were in my room and once I got to the new for the night  there was no available WiFi and I couldn t charge my phone  Zencity was able to get me into the room early the next morning but due to the time it took I lost some wages for the day  as I was working remotely  I asked them about compensation for the trip and they still are giving me the run around  The only thing that ran smoothly   was the checkout process  That was the only good thing about this disaster of a Airbnb booking  I would not recommend Zencity to anyone  You re not missing out on anything here  there are hundreds of Airbnb I m sure are much better  and at this price point 
570271906342910156,Poor communication  Poor communication 
542068078082406212,I wouldn t come back here  My experience was bad  But you could try your luck  You need to work on your units  How could I pay all that money just to not have a wifi for my whole trip and don t have control of my own unit temperature 
470949238071954974,Smells like sewage water  The closet in the downstairs living room needs to be checked out  Not sure what s in there but it smelt like moldy sewage water  Also the vents should be clean as well  We experienced burning nostrils and sore throats after the first night due to inhalation
529010809281050919,OK  but not the cleanest and parking is not included  It would be good to have the  no parking  available information more noticeable in the ad and not after youve made the reservation  There was a strong smell of curry from the previous tenant and bugs in the bathroom 
460104623965273317,place was hard to get into  We had to wait outside hoping someone from the inside would let us in  Contacted the host and they were super nice and told us they would fix the issue told us that if others could let us in to feel free to go inside and they would message us when the issue was fixed  Never got a message so the whole time there we had to wait for someone to open the building door for us  Place was okay  Neighbors were loud 
539848184352805552,I highly recommend NOT staying here  The owners are corporate  the walls are thin as paper thin and efficient  communication is challenging to say the least  ZERO stars  Look up the definition of empathy 
460071488007779461,It wasn t the best but it wasn t the worst  The apartment itself was okay  It wasn t fancy but it wasn t run down  Everything appeared to be clean  The air conditioning didn t work well during the night in the room I slept in  so I woke up sweating both nights  The apartment building had a STRONG smell of marijuana  You smelt it as soon as you walked into the building and didn t stop smelling it until you got into the apartment and shut the door  The building was run down and kinda gross and I didn t feel safe  but I didn t spend much time there  The instructions on how to get in the building at check in were confusing  They also said there would be keys and a parking pass  but there was no parking pass upon arrival and the door has a keypad so there were no keys either  There was a key fob to get into the building and parking garage which kept me from having to punch the code in every single time so that was nice  At check out  they tried to charge me      for the missing parking pass  but there was never a parking pass there to begin with when I checked in  I haven t heard from them since I tried to talk to them about the situation  Overall  it s not the worst place I could have stayed at this weekend  but if I could go back  I DEFINITELY would have just gotten a hotel room 
542094722739784568,Avoid at all costs   The company is shady as hell and looking to milk you for every dime  Beyond that  the unit has no end of problems  I signed for an extended   month stay and regretted every second of it     Leaky upstairs neighbor pipe caused damage to the ceiling that now constantly drops powdered drywall an the counters   A heating system that you cant controle  Runs full blast while its in the   s  but turns off for days when its    outside   Barely stocked kitchen makes cooking nearly impossible   No parking at all  Youll have to try your luck with street parking   Internet down roughly half the time    Wall a c units that can barely keep you cool when its in the high   s  and cant outpace the radiator that is always running   If you need somewhere to stay then do yourself a favor  Sleep outside  Itll be nicer 
567674227363724397,Access codes did not work and ended up canceling while trying to get inside the building around Midnight on the day of my stay  Codes didnt work and I had to cancel 
567456657036541123,Yes location can t be beat  Beds are comfortable  Check in was a nightmare as the keys to the unit were not in the box   Fortunately for me  another Zencity renter was experiencing the same problem  and already had Zencity on the phone   Their first response was to argue with her  and me  about the empty boxes   Told us he had a picture from the clean team that the keys were in the box  and wanted a picture from us to prove that the box was empty   Long story  but after    minutes of standing in the cold     degrees outstanding  and open  garage  I found the master keys to all Zencity units in another lock box   The unit keys were hanging in the unit   First thing we noticed upon opening the door was the   smell   it reeked of cigarettes   I reported the smell  they offered to do an ozone clean  but never did     night stay     I emailed before I came asking what type of coffee maker there was   exact quote    All Zencity units have a coffee pot and a french press in the unit   There was only a French press  which for   people is time consuming  and to top it off  the microwave did not work   Could not even heat up your cold French press coffee   Kind of a major problem   The microwave issue was noted in a review last November and still not fixed   Our last day  they brought a second French press   Not helpful   One bathroom had a shower issue and the sink was permanently plugged  didn t drain   Also seemed to be noted in past reviews    As noted by another reviewer  Zencity answers their emails promptly  but they do not solve problems   I would be very careful renting from them  You are very quick with your responses  but you I fine the questions were never answered completely  let alone problems in the unit actually fixed 
460117308213120441,I d probably avoid booking here    We were really excited for this place  But sadly reality didn t match the pictures    Cons  When we arrived we realized we had not received the check in information that we were told  I will be in contact closer to your arrive for a smooth check in   The check in was anything but smooth  We were unable to enter the building using the provided code and had to call for a second time within    minutes of arriving to be let in  The first phone call was to receive the check in information and codes and the second call was when the codes failed to work  Then the door to the unit had issues opening for the first time  we had to use tricks such as pulling the door so that the lock would properly work  We were told we would be able to use a key fob found within the unit to enter the building on our own  The fob did not work and this was where communication started to decline  The first three calls were resolved quickly  however  the fourth phone call did not result in the same  This communication took from   pm  Thursday night      pm  Friday afternoon  to hear any sort of update  despite asking for an update  we were trying to determine if we were able to leave and come back on our own or if we had to call every time we wanted back in the building  Thankfully other residents in the building understood how horrible the Airbnb is with their guests and were nice enough to let us in  The residents  three different residents mind you  also noted that other Airbnb guests were having similar issues and that this is an incredibly annoying issue to continue to have    The unit itself isn t bad  I m just a bit confused about what our clean fees covered  There were visible dirt burn marks on the carpet  dust on surfaces  and what looked to be pieces of food left in the sink  which may have been due to the kitchen sink draining terribly slow or the food disposal being broken   The floors also looked as if drinks had been spilled and not clean because it was still sticky and black  The ice tray in the freezer looks like it has melted and refrozen as a large block that was unusable  There were dents and scratches throughout the entire apartment that were not shown in the pictures prior to booking    The air conditioning was awful and did not work  Luckily we had beautiful weather so it wasn t unbearable but it would never adjust below     The air filter was also a disgusting brown color   Pros  It was a decent part of town that wasn t far from anything we wanted to do  The bed was comfortable  it does squeak some  but not too bad  The gated parking lot is also a great feature    Overall the unit has a lot of potential to be an incredible stay  but sadly the technical issues of allowing us to freely enter drastically dampened our impression of the host and their ability to meet explicit expectations laid out in the booking summary we used to make our decision to stay here  I would not stay here again 
519629430482373855,Not so Zen w  Zencity  I stayed here one     night  maybe      hours  Upon arrival the hallway on the way to the unit was very smoky  no problem no complaint  I enter the unit and while doing my usual walkthrough I notice the clean job is not so clean  again no problem no complaint  I search Airbnb to see if maybe I could find another place but nothing was available with such short notice  I run to the store and buy clean supplies etc then return to scrub down the kitchen  bathroom and whatever those stains were on the couch  Again no problem no complaint  I put a sheet over the couch so I could watch some tv and order dinner  After all that I was finally able to relax and go to sleep  I never once messaged or called the host and I certainly had no intention of doing a negative review  I woke up  wiped the bathroom back down after showering and placed all of my towels in the hamper they provided  After check out I then receive a request for      from Zencity saying I busted a hole in the closet door  With   picture showing a hole in the interior of a closet  I decline the charge because I did not nor have I ever caused any damage to any Airbnb  and I ve stayed in plenty   Furthermore  I didn t even use it at all being that my visit was so short  I have never had a host try to blame or charge me for any damages  Especially after I clean etc just to be able to stay the night there  This host has presented themselves as very dishonest in practice and is trying to pull one over on me

459367597725299060,The original confirmation code did not work and had to call for a new one  The room was subpar clean and most importantly  did not include a fob key  This is a major issue because you need the fob key to access the elevator  After addressing the information and asking for a full refund  Zencity has yet to respond to me    Would NOT recommend

513834683561658827,I left my hat at the location which I understand is totally my fault  I reached out in hopes they would be able to return it to me and provide me with a way to retrieve it  It was a very expensive hat  They told me they would send me a shipping label when they find it  They ignored all messages after that and I never got a shipping label  You all are terrible at responding to messages 
519550719746332997,Zencity management does NOT keep up with clean and property upkeep their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   It is disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my first encounter with a Zencity apartment  The property at the Shoreline is a lovely building  and the customer service at the front desk is great  but the upkeep in the Zencity unit is where things fall apart     Problems in the apartment   Cleaning Supplies  I had to spend my money  and purchase Lysol spray and Clorox wipes to clean the apartment to ensure that I would not come into contact with bacteria or the Covid    virus     Kitchen   dirty floor  I swept   there was a layer of dust on the stove  I clean   handprints on the drawer pulls and stove handle  I clean   the garbage can has caked on grime at the bottom and on the lid  There were dishes in the cabinet that were not properly clean  The door handle to the microwave is badly damaged and looks like its melting away    Carpet   The entire carpet from the entryway to the main room is dirty and stained  I had to sweep the entire carpet to get up the surface dirt  There are stains around the barstool area    Bedding  The pillows on the bed and in the storage closet were STAINED     Bathroom  There was hair on the floor  on the shower walls  and the floor had not been mopped  I sprayed the bathroom down in Clorox and mopped the floor  The water from mopping the floor was dark gray   just disgusting     Linens  I washed the pillowcases and towels before using them based on the condition of the bathroom and the stained pillowcases     How did Zencity help  After numerous messages sent on the Airbnb app  someone  without a mask  brought new pillows  and I received a measly     credit  Does my time and effort clean your rental property equate to     dollars      As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together   I  am very disappointed that the Zencity management does NOT maintain their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   Its deceptive selling  and its personally disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my first encounter with a Zencity apartment  The property at the Shoreline is a lovely building  and the customer service at the front desk is great  but the upkeep in the Zencity unit is where things fall apart     Problems in the apartment   Cleaning Supplies  I had to spend my money  and purchase Lysol spray and Clorox wipes to clean the apartment to ensure that I would not come into contact with bacteria or the Covid    virus     Kitchen   dirty floor  I swept   there was a layer of dust on the stove  I clean   handprints on the drawer pulls and stove handle  I clean   the garbage can has caked on grime at the bottom and on the lid  There were dishes in the cabinet that were not properly clean  The door handle to the microwave is badly damaged and looks like its melting away    Carpet   The entire carpet from the entryway to the main room is dirty and stained  I had to sweep the entire carpet to get up the surface dirt  There are stains around the barstool area    Bedding  The pillows on the bed and in the storage closet were STAINED     Bathroom  There was hair on the floor  on the shower walls  and the floor had not been mopped  I sprayed the bathroom down in Clorox and mopped the floor  The water from mopping the floor was dark gray   just disgusting     Linens  I washed the pillowcases and towels before using them based on the condition of the bathroom and the stained pillowcases     How did Zencity help  After numerous messages sent on the Airbnb app  someone  without a mask  brought new pillows  and I received a measly     credit  Does my time and effort clean your rental property equate to     dollars      As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together  
460084984971548499,Great location  Nice apt   However it smelled of cigarettes and pot   So much so we could not close the windows   The code to enter was wrong and it took over an hour for zen city to get us a new one   Overall disappointed in the management  Good location however we had a difficult time entering the apt as the code was wrong   No one would return our communication through Airbnb  We finally called and received a new code    Once inside we smelled cigarettes and pot    The apt was fine as was the location   Zen city did a poor job managing our stay 
510896136481122923,There were so many issues with this unit and building   To start we got to the building to retrieve the key   fob  The code didn t work to get the key   After calling they had to see if there was any other way to get a key  Finally got one out    We got to the unit  it was clean  The bed only had a sheet on it  KC in December you need a comforter    After going to dinner and coming back  the fob didn t grant access to the building  I called the host  Their solutions were calling other units in the building to let in  that didn t work so we were told they many need to put us up in another place  Finally after an hour we got in  Again cold outside December KC    The next day  went to lunch and came back  Again the fob didn t work  I called again and they reached to maintenance   I was told I would get a call back  After   hours of no call back  I called them back so we could leave the building  Their solutions   they would be able to get a replacement fob the next day  they day I check out  Then to get in find someone s else entering the building and sneak in behind them    I told them that I have medication I need access to  All I got was sorry that s the only solution we can offer    Finally I asked if there was any spare fobs at all that I could have access to after an hour on the phone  They had to call maintenance again  Finally worked  I ve still not received a call back on the poor experience  Not having access to the unit I rented is such a big disappointment  It s something you pay for  On top of it  they told me the comforter was missing when it was never there    I expected much better from ZenCity  I really need a call back from someone  This has been the worst experience I ve had  I didn t have access to the unit multiple times in the cold  The solution you gave was for me to sneak in when someone else buzzes in  Then you were going to give me a new fob the day we checked out  Someone needs to contact me
463782901469764772,Great location  comfortable apt      of electricity was out  st night  No WiFi for   days  Otherwise  location was great 
563734922431799404,Host was not honest about the Airbnb  They knew the building would not have power during my stay before I booked the room and did not share that  When the power went out and I tried to contact them they were extremely slow response and were not honest about the problem  Refusing any refund but offered     off my next stay with them when I made it clear I will not be using there company ever again  Host was not honest about the Airbnb  They knew the building would not have power during my stay before I booked the room and did not share that  When the power went out and I tried to contact them they were extremely slow response and were not honest about the problem  Refusing any refund but offered     off my next stay with them when I made it clear I will not be using there company ever again 
498606907356366461,This place was not clean at all upon arrival  I wouldnt suggest staying here  There were at least   flies in the room and outside the bathroom there was a splatter on the wall with hair stuck to it  The carpets were clearly not even vacuumed and there were pieces of trash still left around  Great location but not very happy about our stay here  This place wasnt clean at all     
546349262488271362,Zen needs to have a better logistic when it comes to paying attention to clients  I waited   hour and    minutes unable to access the building  Tried contacting the host several times and the only response that I got   several hour later  was to remember my check out  disregarding my inconvenience 
463679444651766483,Well the location was good  I always found free parking on the street that was nearby  The interior of the apt       was good and clean   The bed was comfy but the pillows are horrible and seem to be made from polyester and hard foam   The hallway areas of the building  were dirty and had food  dirt  tiny papers trash all about  And this was on every floor  the walls of the hallways were also a bit dirty and unkept  I stayed here  five days and nobody clean the floors   The building needs maintenance workers or new residents that care about cleanliness   Furthermore the elevator was broken for nearly   days  The instructions to enter the building from street level were still incorrect  It was a total pain to wait on a resident to let me in the building that I paid for  It was so inconvenient  Sometimes I just stayed in the apt all day due to being afraid of not being able to get back into building  you really need to fix this issue
500765823175764405,Sent a private message to this owner about our experience  After   days  They finally reached out with a saved message sent to all their disappointed customers   Thanks but no thanks    Move on to the next    when searching Already sent and it took you   days to respond
543466511256363162,DO NOT STAY HERE  The unit was DISGUSTING upon my arrival  It was so GROSS  The city sidewalk is probably cleaner or an alley  I didnt even stay there  I had to stay at a friends house during my entire trip all while trying to conduct business meetings  via zoom  Im currently working with my bank and LAWYER to get my money back for services not rendered  Zen you have the pictures Ive sent regarding the matter    I  also have video evidence of the unit that backs up my claim  Do yourself a favor and do the right thing  REFUND my money  You need to make sure your clean staff is clean the unit after every guest  Shame on you for charging a clean fee when no clean is done  This is why I didnt stay at your bnb  It was disgusting  With covid cases on the rise  you should be on top of keeping things in and around the bnb sanitary  Instead of letting germs and filth fester 
526144434166168192,Nice place clean and cozy  Be prepared if intercom system is down  Communication became a blur after that  Nice area and decent parking  You need an alternative for when the intercom is down 
460810369845708470,Good location and nice building  However  it claimed to be  obsessively clean  and that was not the case  Walls were covered with markings and the furniture and carpets were visibly dirty  Overall  we enjoyed our stay  I just wish it had been as clean as they advertised it to be  Really enjoyed the location and overall it was a nice place  I did wish it was a little cleaner through  Especially with how much it claims to have high cleanliness standards
520875919630513180,Still waiting for refund  Zencity  the host company  provided several options for check in time when I made my reservation  I chose  am  The night before my reservation  Zencity wrote to me with the check in instructions and told me I could not check in until  pm  When I explained that my reservation was for a  am check in  they just said  Airbnb made an error  and would not let me check in

503663226272408653,The apartment is nice  if a little dirty  but the listing is misleading  There is no washer dryer  smoke alarm  carbon monoxide detector  iron  or hair dryer in the unit  Additionally  the oven was non functional and the coffee maker was broken  I replaced it at personal cost  Zen did not respond to my suggestion of compensation    I would likely not have chosen to pay this amount to stay here had I known these things in advance   Zen addressed an issue with disruptive noise coming from the radiators in the unit and had the oven fixed  but in general communications were very slow  expect a canned auto response within    hr  but actual action being taken generally at the      h mark  This included when the access code to the front door of the building stopped working  Luckily I was able to sneak in behind other residents  as the issue was not addressed until late the following day 
480352280424923702,We were unable to access the Airbnb upon arrival as the passcode to the room was not working  We messaged the host but received no response  and when we called the number provided on their page it went straight to a voicemail  which was full   We waited at the building for a while and then left and tried to figure out alternate arrangements  About an hour and a half later  around      pm  the host finally responded and suggested that we try the passcode again  We trekked back to the Airbnb and the code again didn t work  We talked over the phone and they gave us a new passcode  and were finally able to access the room    Mistakes happen  but it was very frustrating that we were unable to reach the host for so long when we encountered issues  and a stressful experience  We nearly ended up purchasing a hotel room because we were concerned we wouldn t be able to reach the host    The Airbnb was decent fairly bare  no hair dryer or iron  for example  but with a bed  bathroom  and minimalist kitchen  Clean  Pretty good location  However  our checkin experience was very poor and we were disappointed  Proceed with caution We were unable to access the Airbnb upon arrival as the passcode to the room was not working  We messaged the host but received no response  and when we called the number provided on their page it went straight to a voicemail  which was full   We waited at the building for a while and then left and tried to figure out alternate arrangements  About an hour and a half later  around      pm  the host finally responded and suggested that we try the passcode again  We trekked back to the Airbnb and the code again didn t work  We talked over the phone and they gave us a new passcode  and were finally able to access the room    Mistakes happen  but it was very frustrating that we were unable to reach the host for so long when we encountered issues  and a stressful experience  We nearly ended up purchasing a hotel room because we were concerned we wouldn t be able to reach the host    The Airbnb was decent fairly bare  no hair dryer or iron  for example  but with a bed  bathroom  and minimalist kitchen  Clean  Pretty good location  However  our checkin experience was very poor and we were disappointed 
476107450956616750,Great location   Parking was a challenge  The bathroom drain was plugged when we arrived   We pulled out a long  orange plastic strip and then it did drain   There was a cooking odor that persisted until we aired the place out for a day  We would have liked a mattress pad on the bed under the sheet   Was the mattress actually a box spring   Perhaps wash the bathroom rug   We found one German cockroach  FYI 
460693093614231101,This is ran by a company  not an individual  They could provide a working key fob for me to get into the apartment  After speaking with a rep on the phone  and being locked out of the apartment  they couldn t call me back to let me know about a replacement key fob  They still tried to charge me to stay in this apartment after they couldn t provide a working key fob  and after they couldn t return a phone call to let me know whether or not they had a replacement fob  I would not recommend renting from them  Not trust worthy 
460858070091318296,Was a nice spot  easy check in  close to everything   Parking was a bit challenging but wasn t too bad     Only down side would be the smell of the unit   Luckily we were there much but it s an issue that would need to be addressed The stay would have been much better if the unit didn t stink so bad   Something is very wrong with the toxic smell that is coming from the downstairs spare room closet   It s way overbearing   I had to get air fresheners and a candle to try and mask the smell   But that didn t really do much
546414351341072251,Nice room  exactly as stated in description  All of the amenities you need away from home  Even provided laundry detergent  Just a little feedback for you  The room was clean and well stocked everything was as you said it would be  The issue I had was the check in  I followed the instructions to a t but I still could not get in the temperature was in the single digits and I stood outside for over    minutes with your employee helping me get in  Then when we got upstairs with the key the key would not also work  I traveled up and down the elevator with all of my luggage twice to retrieve the other key and it still did not work only to find out that I only needed to press the lock button for it to display the numbers to put in the code  Your employee was under the impression that the key fob would open the door  My entire stay the key fob Ive never worked and I had to use the code to get in and out  The other issue was that the temperature got down to single digits a couple of the nights and I could not turn the heat up  It read that it was being controlled remotely  A couple nights I was extremely cold  The last straw was that I needed to use the extension link that was sent to me and it did not work  So I called or text and requested to extend but the rate I was charged was not the rate that was stated on the extension  Im not sure if additional service fees or clean fees were added but I only requested three nights at     each and my new bill was an additional       I decided to leave and just go to a different Airbnb  You have a nice facility but the administration portion needs tweaking
502959112736267511,Location was great but when we checked in  the place was not clean  There were not enough towels for three days so I asked for more  but host did not respond  Do not recommend 
526722183716743234,I booked this place and requested a early check in on the form in two locations  I explained I was a  rd shift worker and travelled four hours straight from work  I needed to check in early to sleep  They accepted my reservation request and never gave me check in instructions   They also never informed me until I arrived that my request wasn t approved  Had they told me  I would have gone somewhere else that could accommodate me  They refused to refund all my money  They ad also says free parking but if you look harder within the ad  it also says no parking on site  This place is also in a very dangerous park of down and looks nothing like the pictures  There is no one on site to help you  I booked this place and requested a early check in on the form in two locations  I explained I was a  rd shift worker and travelled four hours straight from work  I needed to check in early to sleep  They accepted my reservation request and never gave me check in instructions   They also never informed me until I arrived that my request wasn t approved  Had they told me  I would have gone somewhere else that could accommodate me  They refused to refund all my money  The ad also says free parking but if you look harder within the ad  it also says no parking on site  This place is also in a very dangerous park of down and looks nothing like the pictures  There is no one on site to help you 
460821171157697903,This space was really cute at first glance but it was not clean once you looked around  Dirty dishes in the cabinets  dirty floors  and it made me wonder how clean the linens  blankets  and pillows actually were  The place was really cute at first glance  but there was dust everywhere  it hadn t been vacuumed  the dishes we used had to be clean before we used them really unhappy with what I paid and how unclean the place actually was
465969887169699503,To start off with the pros the location is close to lakeshore restaurants and stores  Getting in the rental was easy             The cons we finally made it through the two front doors and once we got to the Airbnb the room was completely dirty  Bed wasn t made garbage in the kitchen  tub had a bunch of dirty towels sitting in it  Ants were on the floor and I had to sweep to keep them away and it is a basement studio  Called zen and they said someone would come and clean the room and for us to come back in an hour after we had to wait until  pm and our flight got in at   am and was told no early check in and to have to wait another hour was a complete inconvenience on top of the room being dirty  Other than the location I would not recommend staying here  you would be better off paying for a hotel room  You told me I would be given a refund of   night and a clean fee and I haven t received neither yet  I called and messaged you and there was no answer  I just called and the phone just keep ringing  I will be taking this further if a refund is not given back as we discussed 
521014451593703556,The most trouble I ve had with an Airbnb  Both of the checkin codes they gave me were broken  i wouldn t have been able to get inside if it weren t for another couple  also  having trouble checking in    Eventually got into my room  The bathroom door  slides over  has a huge gap  and won t stay closed anyway    The room got very warm even though it was December and I had the heat turned off  the thermostat was locked to prevent using the A C  It took several hours to cool down with the windows open as far as the window guards would allow    Also the water in the only sink was always at least warm  cold water would not come out of the tap    The icing on the cake was getting a knock on the door the day before the end of my stay   Another  group had been given the same room as me through Airbnb  I confirmed my stay was not yet over  but I can t imagine the other group had a fun time finding a last minute place to stay 
481886831106497235,Very clean nice place  but Main Street is very loud so beware if you don t want to hear cop cars nightly  I had so much trouble getting the keys  and getting into my unit  needing help from some strangers who had also been having trouble getting keys to their own unit  Parking is definitely tricky  not a ton of spaces available close by  Overall  not my favorite especially not for the price  but very nice interior aesthetic 
473887879528816877,Awesome clean location just not good communication as am still awaiting replies for things left behind  Left my camera there have contacted the host and no reply as of yet  Have filed police report and will be reviewing footage  Please contact             Jordan  Thank you
515925111268273555,There were stains on the carpet and none of the remotes worked  The first thing we weren t able to get in for almost an hour  The key fob didn t work  and I had to get a code    Second  the tv remote barely worked  I couldn t turn on the tv with it or change the volume   Third  the fan light remote didn t work at all    Fourth  there were stains on the Carpet   Fifth  the window was left open  and the clock had the wrong time   Sixth  there were stains in front of the window by the bathroom   Lastly  there was food or something on the picture frame that talked about the place   I have pictures videos of most of these  I usually love Airbnb and have stayed in a Zencity before  This definitely was my worse experience  I complained to Airbnb  but they told me to first talk to you 
496650623550623781,I was never able to check into the unit  The call box number to use to gain entry was not working it seems based on other online reviews of Zen City  that this is a common issue with their short term rentals    They are pretty good in communicating their pre check in instructions  but post check in they are very spotty with communication and don t seem to be able to resolve anything  they only message to ask if anyone was able to help  isn t the person I m messaging supposed to  know this    Furthermore  when you try to contact them by phone it goes straight to voicemail with a voicemail box that is full    Not sure how often this happens  but I know I m not the only one  Your instructions for entry do not work  because the call box number     Zen City  does not work and just returns a busy signal  This was an ongoing issue  Also  your pre check in communication and instructions is great  but your ability to resolve and communicate after the check in time is very spotty 
505097591620204319,The only good part about this property was it s location  There was no parking except paid parking on the street  Apartment had roaches in the kitchen  only   blinds worked properly  so place was dark  only one of three light bulbs in bathroom worked  shower and tubs paint was peeling badly  apartment was cold and drafty especially at the window AC units radiators wake you up every morning  about   am sounding like someone hammering the pipes in your room  Management sounds like they re calling you from China with an oatmeal box and a string  This place was AWFUL 
461578127434512063,DO NOT STAY HERE    They were supposed to leave me a fob keycard to be able to get in and out of the building  in and out of the parking and to be able to use the elevator and stairwell  I rented this Airbnb as I was driving    hours for a concert  I ended up missing the concert because it took   hours to sign in due to having to have the front desk escort me around the building that way I could get into the apartment  When I called the phone number I was rudely hung up by a customer service agent of this company  It s not a apartment owner renting out there property it s a business that has multiple units and after speaking with the front desk all the other people who rented there units also had the same issue  So I ended up wasting      plus    hours and   days due to me not being able to leave the apartment  I called numerous times but they would not respond to me and when they would answer the phone I would have to explain my whole issue again for them to say we will call you back shortly and them never calling me back  Worst Airbnb experience ever  I will never be staying with you again this was a horrible experience  I still can t believe the fact that I lost my concert that I drove    hours to go just because your company forgot to leave me the keycards for the building  elevator  stairwell and parking 
465144009723857472,Nice place in the perfect location but  it was not clean and I had problems entering the building  keep the place clean please
516655596932253043,Although the apartment was huge and very clean  we had some major issues  Principally  when we arrived to check into our apartment  we were alerted that someone else was staying in our apartment  Although the concierge was very nice and helpful  it was a bit alarming that Zencity didn t know at first who could be staying in our apartment  We ended up finding another Airbnb in the same building  but it definitely added an element of spookiness and discomfort to our stay  Secondly  the wifi was pretty terrible  We resorted to waving around our laptops in the air in order to catch a connection  If these issues were resolved  I would happily stay here  but alas as is  I would be hesitant to book again 
465151043691739037,The space is adequate  the appliances function  the streaming TV works  and the beds are comfy  The building access instructions did not work and we got no assistance with that problem  We had more than half of our showers cold  apparently at random 
521050409940372854,Great location  Good amenities  Has a gym and basketball court in basement that my friends really enjoyed after a day out in the city  If you re looking for a warm and hospitable airbnb experience you wont find it here  Its all very corporate  No snacks nothing to make one feel welcome as one walks into the space at    pm  They also need to improve their check in process   We were stuck in the main vestibule waiting for someone to go in late at night with bags as the machine wasn t unlocking the door on saying the password  We all tried multiple times  I was really disappointed when i texted them about needing a late check out  Hy which i meant max    minuted but their immediate response was give us    more bucks and you can have a late check out  No question about how late or anything  So disappointing  It really left a bad taste and was very off putting  Definitely not what im used to from airbnbs with a personal Touch
547127311655412837,After our   week stay  I would recommend that you please do NOT stay here or in any Zen City owned property  Especially if considering this unit for a long term stay  I preface this by saying I travel year round for work and rent often from AirBnb  I have never left a poor review before this    During our   week stay  we encountered issues that have been mentioned in previous reviews  which shows they have never been successfully resolved  as well as new issues not mentioned in previous reviews    When we arrived  the unit smelled very strongly of sewage and or a dead animal  We notified the hosts  who sent maintenance out  Maintenance was only ever able to give trouble shooting ideas  none of which resolved the issue  and then the hosts never had maintenance come assess or try to resolve the issue again    There is also a clear issue with water in this apartment  The water would only run hot sometimes  and when it did  it only lasted between      minutes total per day depending on the day  The hosts sent someone out to address the issue  and when that repair did not resolve the issue  they never sent maintenance back to address it and it went unresolved    The city maintenance also had to shut down the water for an hour  which caused one of the toilets to stop working  We had an unusable  broken  clogged toilet for an entire week before it was fixed  as maintenance had to order and wait for a part to arrive  and we were paying for a two bed two bath the entire time  Thankfully  AirBnb support was able to process a     refund of affected nights    On top of all these individual issues  communication with Zen City the entire time was extremely vague and lacking  When I mentioned issues  I was often told they were passing it along to the corresponding team  and rarely or never received information with solid details on when or even if maintenance was going to show up  When I would check back in  not having heard anything  I was often speaking with someone entirely different than before and had to re explain issues as if they were brand new  I even communicated that no one was to knock or enter the apartment before   am  and that boundary was either not communicated from Zen City to corresponding teams or completely disregarded    as maintenance showed up at     am  We spent our entire stay waiting for issues to be addressed or resolved  and it was clear by the end of our stay Zen City was not addressing issues  but it felt they were rather waiting for us to leave  After the initial troubleshooting attempts for both the terrible sewage smell and hot water issues  no one ever came to address the issues before we left    I will never stay with Zen City again  and strongly advise anyone considering staying here not to  It s unfortunate  because the unit is gorgeous from its appearance  but entirely unlivable due to unresolved issues and horrendous communication and customer service  Our stay here was an absolute nightmare  Ive never left a poor review before this  and it makes me sad this was the case  as    solely from appearances    this unit if beautiful  However with the extreme inconvenience caused from unresolved maintenance issues including the horrid sewage smell  the hot water issues  and the broken toilet which wasnt fixed for a week  as well as with the clear gaps in communication  I am left with no choice  I highly recommend establishing better communication between your Zen City staff and your maintenance teams 
465140441645604969,We didn t appreciate the rude behavior of your clean lady after she cussed us out for arriving for our approved early check in  She told us to leave and return in    mins which we did and she did a half fast job  Floors were dirty  room smelt like weed    bed sheets had a blood stain  red stain  The key sensor was also an inconvenience because it did not work and it took about an hour and    mins before we were able to get a new one  We didn t appreciate the rude behavior of your clean lady after she cussed us out for arriving for our approved early check in  She told us to leave and return in    mins which we did and she did a half fast job  Floors were dirty  room smelt like weed    bed sheets had a blood stain  red stain  The key sensor was also an inconvenience because it did not work and it took about an hour and    mins before we were able to get a new one 
486161831185256574,Place wasn t bad for a quick stay  nothing super to boast about and although it was only     to stay  the clean fee cost more which seems a bit extreme  Also had issues getting into apartment and messaged host about the issue only to finally get a reply hours later 
465286178909503039,I d like to preface this review by saying that I never actually write reviews  Only in cases where the experience is very good or very bad do I think it s worth the effort  My wife and I have stayed at a number of Airbnb s  and  our experiences have generally been great  Our stay with Zencity was anything but   We were staying for a week in Chicago for my work  with my wife planning to work full time from the Airbnb for the week  My wife is also pregnant  By the second day of our stay with Zencity  the unit began to reek of cigarette smoke  and was at its worst during the day for the hours that my wife was working from the unit  Secondhand smoke is a terrible risk to a developing fetus  The next morning I reached out to the host to resolve the issue  We requested either to be moved to a comparable unit or be refunded the remainder of our stay  It took multiple messages for them to respond  and even once we were in the middle of the conversation  the average response time to a message took hours  The resolution that they offered was either to move us halfway across the city to a much cheaper unit or to request that my wife find somewhere else to work for a day while they used an ozone unit to temporarily reduce the smell  even getting to this point in the conversation took over    hours   Not wanting to endanger my wife our baby  we moved to a hotel and alerted the host so that we could be refunded the remainder of our stay  The host claimed to be considering the refund repeatedly over multiple days  but on the last night of our stay  requested that we cancel the reservation  After cancelling  they alerted us that they were denying our refund request because they couldn t confirm that we weren t in the unit because we hadn t hit the  cancel  button in the Airbnb app despite informing them that we had vacated partway through the stay  Taken together  it seems as though they were just delaying responding so that they wouldn t even have to offer the     refund in their cancellation policy  Also  the TV does not work and unsurprisingly  Zencity never responded to our message at the beginning of the week asking them to fix it   This experience was all around terrible  We will never be staying with Zencity again and we recommend that you do not either 
461531374036365818,The good  Apartment was exactly as described and the location is perfect   The not so good  The check in process doesn t work  I parked a block away and arrived at     pm  I was able to get into the building but was unable to use the elevator as it requires a badge  The check in instructions say that it ll be unlocked for    seconds from the time you get in from the front door  I did it multiple times all under    seconds  I was unable to reach anyone to let me in  Building security told me this is a common issue with this property and that the stairs are secured too and that I would need to contacted the host  I was unable to reach the host so called AirB B who was also unable to reach the host  I was getting the information to go stay at a hotel when another tenant took pity on me standing on a dark Kansas City street with two bags for an hour and badged me into the elevator  Arrived in the room at       If they fix the check in process this would be a   star review  You should strongly reevaluate your check in process as it s broken 
465217841322327777,The unit is exactly as shown  The unit was NOT clean properly  Slimy sticky residue in the bottom of shower tub  The carpets were very dirty and looked as if they hadn t been vacuumed in QUITE sometime  While packing to leave  my fianc  and I seen black mold that was on the wall surrounding the window and inside the window seal near the ceiling  that was attempted to be covered by tape and paint  There is an awful smell of trash mildew that permeates throughout the unit  source unknown   Be sure to bring your own toiletries and amenities if staying longer than one night  Only two towels  two hand clothes  and two wash clothes provided for a   day   night stay for two individuals  As well as one roll of toilet paper and one roll of paper towels  There is no public parking on the premises  but several parking meters down the block and     parking garages within     blocks of the unit  The unit does have a great location and is conveniently located near Barnes Jewish hospital  Whole Foods  several restaurants bars  and shops  Unfortunately  the apartment was not clean  There is black mold growing in the windows seals  Which was covered by tape and painted so that it wouldn t be noticed  Maybe look into a different  more thorough  clean service  and have a routine check done of the apartment unit from a representative of Zencity 
461542236183154013,I have been to Chicago before but it was my partners first time so this location was perfect and walkable to a lot of the main tourist sites   Check in was easy and the elevators convenient and pretty fast  We didnt see a note about where the amenities were but ventured to the top floor and found them  We didnt get a chance to use it but it looked nice  The cleanliness was mixed  The floor felt like it needed to be swept or mopped but the counter tops were clean  There was laundry in the washer dryer and we couldnt discern if it was clean or not so we re ran it   We appreciated having a W D in unit as well as the availability of extra towels tp clean supplies if needed  As for the kitchen  I wouldnt expect to cook a full meal there  but why would you unless youre there for a longer term stay   but adequate to reheat leftovers over the stove or microwave    The bed was comfortable and the apt was spacious for two  The shower pressure was good but the temperature fluctuated a lot probably because it is a high rise   If you have issues with City noise while sleeping then this wouldnt be the spot for you as it can get pretty loud at certain hours  garbage pick up  night life  etc     Overall we were satisfied with our stay and thought it was worth it  but the space lacks the attention from somewho who actually owns the unit as some things seemed broken or slightly less operable  Check in was nice and easy   A few things  When we arrived there was laundry in the washer and we didnt know if it was clean or dirty so we re ran it and folded it so that the cleaners would know  Noticed there was a board to write the name of the clean person but it wasnt filled out  The kitchen could use a baking sheet for reheating purposes  The bathroom fan didnt seem to work  The windows dont close well since theres tape all around it 
495610523866159095,Good location  Apartment was ok  Unfortunately the wifi did not work which caused me a lot of troubles as I was traveling from Europe  As you know  I was very disappointed by my stay since the wifi did not work 
462293454402892691,UNPROFESSIONAL UNORGANIZED AND DISRESPECTFUL  I DON T UNDERSTAND HOW A COMPANY CAN OPERATE LIKE THIS  SAT ON HOLD FOR OVER TWO HOURS AND THEY STILL HAVEN T MESSAGED BACK WHEN I REACHED OUT about the problems The floors  counter tops  and tables were ALL crumby  The company has   communication skills AT ALL  The check in process was   out of   stars because i didn t get correct check in info until   hours past the time i arrived  I was paying to extend the reservation after all these inconveniences and sat on hold AT     AM FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS  UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE TO EXTEND BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAD ENDED MY RESERVATION  BUT IM IN TOWN ON BUSINESS AND IT WAS TOO LATE NOTICe ti find anywhere else to go
475301180459408045,Wifi didn t work at first  We couldn t control the thermostat ourselves which isn t great   the main bathroom needs a serious bathroom remodel  The shower curtains were too long and we were standing on them while we took a shower 
528989766549855607,Decent stay The bed  towels   bathroom all could have been clean a lot more  There was long black hair everywhere  The towels had stains in them   the bathroom walls were dirty  The wifi also kept going out every   mins or so 
546387287789542831,Appartment was dirty   Other peoples hair all over the bed  floor  and linen   To top it all off  someone cut the catalytic converter off my truck   All around horrible stay   I will not stay with zencity again  what can I say     stays with your business     times I wish I would have gone elsewhere 
460863262729784837,It s an older building so it does not look super clean  The tv and WiFi didn t work  The neighborhood is really nice  It worked fine for a quick weekend trip if that s what you re looking for  The place wasn t super clean and the tv and WiFi didn t work well 
547126325921980470,Room was not accurate and very very dirty  Would not recommend  Wouldn t even respond after I sent pictures of dirty room upon checking in Horrible dirty room nothing was done about it
460167037030997012,Not good communication    I accidentally left my Apple Watch at location and only reply I got back is go to a location with no other information  I tried to contact to get times and phone number to the address to verify my watch was there and no response 
521706263800926042,this place is ridiculous this company is ridiculous I will never choose one of their properties ever again they have horrible customer service they leave you on hold just to disconnect you their key fobs dont work so we have to wait for hours to get into your apartment even after I extend my stay because I had no other choice I had to wait outside the apartment   hours to get a new code  after spending three hours the first night trying to get a code because their key fob didnt work  all they wanted to do is give me an hour late check out which which they ended up locking me out of the building half an hour before that time was up so I couldnt even get my phone this place is ridiculous this company is ridiculous I will never choose one of their properties ever again they have horrible customer service they leave you on hold just to disconnect you their key fobs dont work so we have to wait for hours to get into your apartment even after I extend my stay because I had no other choice I had to wait outside the apartment   hours to get a new code  after spending three hours the first night trying to get a code because their key fob didnt work  all they wanted to do is give me an hour late check out which which they ended up locking me out of the building half an hour before that time was up so I couldnt even get my phone
547071512009528082,Filthy disgusting place wasn t clean at all   I found dirty used underwear on the bed   The place was cold it had air coming through the windows  When I say everything in the place was dirty down to bathroom to walls everything about the place was horrible The place was filthy disgusting it s was not clean at all   I found used underwear  When I say nothing was clean in the unit Down to covers on the bed
486940955971834301,I do not recommend  the place smelled rotten flesh and they gave me the runaround about getting it taken care of  when a guest tells you the place smells really badly you should definitely get it taken care of 
539892382772320055,it was a great place  finding the apartment was confusing though  and it seemed as though the place had been clean in a rush  still residues in places and seemed very halfway clean   granted i booked for the same day that i needed to check in so that could be why 
483363627233999800,Seems hit or miss on cleanliness  my stay was definitely not clean   clumps of hair on the bathroom floor  old sandwich in the fridge  and no soap in the bathroom soap dispenser  Ive reported this in several different ways but no one has responded to my request to refund my clean fee   The unit is very nice  however  and the front desk staff was very kind  Please refund my clean fee   I paid more than the price to stay in clean but there was hair on the bathroom floor  an old sandwich in the fridge  and no soap in the bathroom soap dispenser 
465124225853245363,I originally booked a room                 in The Netherlands      Main Street Kansas City Mo       through ZenCity  I was forced to check out early on            Upon check in ZenCity failed to send my access code to the key retrieval box so they had to open the box remotely  Once receiving my key and attempting several times to enter my room I discovered the key did not work  I contacted ZenCity again and they assigned me       When I enter the room the room had not been clean since the last guests stay  I contacted ZenCity again and was relocated to       The room did not have the amenities promised  The washer and dryer was not hooked up and operational as well as the refrigerator and the wifi was non existent  After waiting for the key and each room assignment I was forced to wait   hours in between call backs  I did not enter the  rd room until     pm on my check in date due to ZenCity s lapse  I woke up the next morning           with a call from ZenCity stating that I had to leave the unit and they would find me another  I was forced to cut my trip short and cancel due to the unit and area that ZenCity chose to relocate me to  It was not in the area that I had time to research and read reviews about and I was a woman traveling alone   My staycation was a nightmare 
460149608672120421,Rented one location   Got there  keypad didnt work and no property manager on site to let us in   Moved us to a  comparable  location across town   Gave us the wrong keycode to get in   Finally was able to access location which in no way  shape  or form was comparable to what we booked originally and included a backed up tub   Communication was very slow   took    hours for them to address the tub issue by text   In fairness  they were kind enough to return the difference in price between the two facilities  but I will not use this company again  When you cant get your customer in the place they booked  it would be nice if you  put them in a comparable location   Additionally  it may be wise to have a property manager in the city you are booking rooms in 
534792007603115364,Lots of inconveniences out of owners control but unfortunately made our experience pretty rough  Thankful for the good communication though 
480446668827655590,The toilet is not in great working order and the shower had a plastic bag over the faucet   water smelled bad until it ran for a little bit  All surrounding street parking is permit only which would have been helpful to know ahead of time  The toilet is not in great working order and the shower had a plastic bag over the faucet   water smelled bad until it ran for a little bit  All surrounding street parking is permit only which would have been helpful to know ahead of time 
547172480756954489,For the price that we paid  this Airbnb was probably what we shouldve expected  For each good thing  theres something bad to go along with it    The reserved parking in a covered garage was fantastic  but its a    minute walk away and you have to take the stairs since the elevator is broken  One of the exit gates also broke on the second day of our stay    The unit looked clean  but we also found a cockroach on the first night  Luckily we didnt see anymore after that though    The water is hot  but only during the day  Past   pm  there simply is no hot water  Plan your showers accordingly   They have everything you need to make a decent cup of coffee  but theres no hair dryer or shaving razors    The unit is convenient and you can easily access all the major attractions within    minutes drive  on top of the    minutes walk to the car  or so  but you also get to be constantly sketched out by your immediate surroundings    Theres supposedly a gym with this listing  but we never found it      Heaters work well  especially for dead of winter  as long as you can deal with the loud rattling and lack of actual temperature control    TV has Netflix but the couch is visibly covered in questionable stains    If something comes up  the host picks up phone calls quickly  but you still need to call multiple times because for the first two calls youll hear someone clicking away on a computer but not actually say a word to you  Thank you guys for the stay  There were definitely a number of hiccups but I hope you guys are able to improve the experience    Consider having disposable shaving razors and a hair dryer available    The parking was nice but itd be also nice to know that its a little bit of a walk away before booking and receiving the instructions day of    While I wasnt able to get a picture of the cockroach and we luckily didnt see more after the first day  its still concerning seeing one at all 
531924022203362227,Cleanliness of the room itself was okay  Ran into issues with zencity not communicating and beating around the bush when I told them the room was missing blinds making it hard to sleep  Kept saying theyd bring it to the attention of their team and schedule a time to come out  Never did  and only on the last night did they say it wasnt gonna happen  leaky shower head shot water on electronics the first night  Towels they layed out for us were also damp and smelled old  good thing they had spares  Decent parking around holidays  decent location  Gun shots from the neighbors  as expected   its St  louis  security was nice  but disappointing still Cleanliness of the room itself was okay  Ran into issues with zencity not communicating and beating around the bush when I told them the room was missing blinds making it hard to sleep  Kept saying theyd bring it to the attention of their team and schedule a time to come out  Never did  and only on the last night did they say it wasnt gonna happen  leaky shower head shot water on electronics the first night  Towels they layed out for us were also damp and smelled old  good thing they had spares 
472436706948559776,I couldnt even get into the building of the place I was supposed to be staying and for over   hours I tried to get in finally having to leave because I was cold and tired  zencity was no help at all  at one point they actually told me just to try to find security or wait for someone to come out of the building to let me in which I did and was not let in by security or whoever was in the building that I asked so I finally left and had to go and pay for another place for my two day stay and now its in City wont even let me know anything about giving me a refund I would not recommend staying here  I dont understand how its been   days and nobody has even contacted me to let me know if or when Im  even getting my refund 
470255006035883197,FIRST OFF  UNIT IS REALLY NICE    Pros  Beautiful Views  Great Building  and Amenities    Cons  Lack of communication from ZenCity  money was stolen from unit  company accused me of smoking in unit and trying charge a      fee    We enjoyed the stay overall for our honeymoon  but with the poor communication it makes me rate this airbnb lower  After a week  still no communication from Zencity about the smoking charge and stolen money  Someone access the unit and stated they were maintenance and money was stolen  Just ruined the amazing experience  Thank you  I am still frustrated about the lack of communication regarding the unit being accessed with out any communication  and money stolen  Lack of communication and timely response to my concerns and a trump up allegations regarding smoking in the unit  Really unprofessional at the end of the day  Over all great unit and building 
465873118853613150,This was the worst experience I have ever had while traveling  The Zencity canceled my reservation right at check in time   They did not have the curtesy to call me and let me know the reservation was canceled  They did it via that app  When I call the owner  I was give no other option   I will never stay at a Zencity apartment and I would be very worried if you select them the next time you travel 
748533852,This host is a total scam  After paying for the room  no check in information was given and we were unable to access the property  After our flight landed at      pm we had to take another Uber from the property and pay for a hotel 
746851246,Shower floor had brown stains in the floor and there were streaks of some liquid running down the walls   Whoever Picked out the sink did a poor job because the water barely pours out over the edge and gets all over the countertop when you wash your hands  Photos make the bedroom appear much larger than it is   The bed was super wobbly and just basically a cheap bed frame   We had issues locating the keypad   You have to tap on it to get the numbers to light up   Also  the smoke detectors were beeping for about an hour after we got there   Took forever to get someone to respond and get maintenance down there to replace batteries   You also have to contact them if you want the thermostat changed as well   Things that should be in the directions just aren t communicated well  Photos make the bedroom appear much larger than it is   The bed was super wobbly and just basically a cheap bed frame  We had issues locating the keypad   You have to tap on it to get the numbers to light up   Also  the smoke detectors were beeping for about an hour after we got there   Took forever to get someone to respond and get maintenance down there to replace batteries  Shower floor had brown stains in the floor and there were streaks of some liquid running down the walls   Whoever Picked out the sink did a poor job because the water barely pours out over the edge and gets all over the countertop when you wash your hands  Needs to be a quicker way to get ahold of someone when issues arise 
747920612,Great location and nice rustic apartment in a great neighborhood  Perfect for   or   people  I had two issues  wifi didn t work  and apartment was missing a french press  When I texted a host  my issues were never resolved and they didn t get back to me about wifi  Not a big deal   but might want to be mindful of this 
746866114,Fair   Had trouble getting in It was difficult to first get into the building the code provided didn t work  I had to stay on heard forever and get code that did work  Then got in the elevator it still wouldn t take us to our floor so we had to walk two flights of stairs  Get up to the room and discover the ppl before us lost the key for the doors and elevator so each time we had to take the stairs and wait for others to let us in  Then on top of tht the kitchen lights didn t work   Some one was supposed to come look at it but never did  And the desk on the side of the bed had a cigarette burn on it  Then the second day the toilet stopped flushing  
748699207,Great location
747380623,Wonderful location  Helpful   front desk  Parking is EXPENSIVE   Kitchen area smelled of sewer  Came from dishwasher 
746821283,Check in experience was horrific    Was stuck outside and could not get a hold of someone for almost an hour     Code to get in building was incorrect    Took several attempts to finally get a hold of a customer service agent     Will not use in the future 
744634895,Cute little apartment  If you dont want to hear noise throughout the night and sirens though  then do not stay here  The place is cute though and its nice bc there is a restaurant on the first floor  Parking is minimal
521805790064813806,The parking was nice and the staff was kind  Unfortunately  there was a mix up as we were told on our arrival that someone else already checked in using my name  Once we proved my identity with kind cooperation from the front desk and Zencity staff  we still were concerned that there was another set of keys that was not accounted for  keys absent prior to us reaching this destination  Our initial checkin experience made for an uncomfortable stay  Other than that and the lack of shampoo which was listed as an amenity  the stay was fine  Staff was kind  location convenient  place was clean  Thank you for the stay and for having    hour support  We needed the support because when my son and his girlfriend arrived in Chicago at   am after his girlfriend worked a full day before their drive in from Arkansas  he was told that a  Debora Robertson  had steady checked in at  pm  had the key and was occupying the room  I m Debora and was in Little Rock AR as I had been explaining in the messages in the Airbnb app for weeks  This trip was a Christmas gift for my son  Francis at Zencity helped get the room  but my som was treated as suspect until we cleared that up and then he and his girlfriend wondered if someone else might enter the room the entire time they stayed since the front desk staff said they had given the extra key to  Debora Robertson  already  It made for an uncomfortable stay  There also was no shampoo tot conditioner  I was worried for them until they checked out since there was an extra key handed to someone else  We still don t know how someone else could have checked in as me  This initial checkin experience made the stay uncomfortable and we will probably use a hotel at our next stay in Chicago    They did say the front deal rep was kind and searched the room with them when they entered to make sure no strangers were lurking    The parking was convenient and free and close  They view of downtown was nice  And the place was clean    Thank you 
748485761,   
746391190,The room itself is cute  but check in was a nightmare  We had no instructions for getting in and had to wait   hours to check in because the host wouldn t respond to messages or calls  Then when they did  the instructions to get through the door didn t work and they still wouldn t respond  We only got in because someone was leaving and held the door  Also weren t told about the confusing way to lock the apartment so we left the room unlocked on accident and had to figure it out ourselves  The space was nice  but the customer service was non existent 
746599356,Y all can expect confusion disappointed and shitty service Y all was the worst host I every had stuff didn t work Y all Should focus on taking care of y all Custmer and stop False Advertisement I book Some thing Else and this what I get a place that didn t look like the pic They didn t have the key  nor  the fobs and they make me go To A different room That I didn t want  and it was hard to Find  the room The host was bad at communicating didn t never communicate took them For every to respond and had a shitty attitude The parking was horrible and expensive
746395741,The place was dirty and reeked like cigarettes  It s carpeted and it was as if someone had been smoking in there for years  I complained to zen city and they told me to crack a window and spray febreze  I don t think I ve ever written a bad review in my life  
748940121,Room wasn t ready   hours after check in  Constant smell of cigarette smoke  No key set  very difficult checking in 
465943766196941137,Place was not clean AT ALL    an inch of dirt on the floor  pizza sauce over the coffee table  lip stick over pillow cases in one room    even found a bag of weed in the tv stand drawer  Would not recommend Zencity Airbnb to anyone  Place was obviously not clean from pervious tenants    an inch of dirt on floors  pizza sauce all over coffee table  lipstick all over pillows cases in one room  even found a bag of weed in the tv stand drawer 
747469992,Great location to explore Forest Park and had a great view of the city  However  we did have some of the amenities listed such as soap and key fob to access roof top lounge area 
547112211660061483,I really wanted to like this place  It s a cute small efficiency style room  Good for a single person or couple  It could have been cleaner  The bed was very uncomfortable  The room was temperature controlled so I was cold every night    night stay   Parking can be challenging as well  But the location was not far from downtown so that s a plus 
748719410,Very clean  Good location  Sometimes host did not answer messages  Poor communication
748889803,Neighbors were not quiet and could not sleep  There was feces in the hallway  There was no TV remote  I was briefly locked out one night when my code stopped working  Perfect location however  Neighbors were not quiet and could not sleep  There was feces in the hallway  There was no TV remote 
747172463,Hostdidnt provide check in instructions prior to arrival and was extremely difficult to get any response from  Location was excelent but the room was not worth the price  Cleaner and less expensive Air B B acomodations are available nearby  Hotels are available with better ammenities for the same price nearby as well  This is the first Air B B I wont stay at again and wouldnt recommend to others  Host messaged they would have more details about check in before I arrived   They did not Never recieved check in instructions arriving  upon arrival I messaged the host multiple times with no response   I then called several times and was disconnected several times and placed on hold endlessly twice   At that point messaged the host I would report the charge as a scam if i didnt receive a reply  I then recieved an immediate reply which told me theyd been ignoring me  During all this a storm was moving in and i was stuck out in it  Hair and remnants of soap bars in the tub  Crud on the shower curtain rod   Peking paint in the bathroom  Host was nearly impossible to contact  I had to go to extremes to get check in information from the host Service and quality of the room were substandard  for the price
747066354,Not much to offer  but it works  Definitely smells like smoke  The fees were more than the stay  A shelf in the shower would be nice  Cooking was difficult as there wasn t even oil  Easy to follow directions but there was a lot of steps The clean board said it hasn t been clean since        Someone knocked on our door to repair something at   am  without warning  and was entering the apartment on their own  Tons of fees so it wasn t as inexpensive as it seems  Not as nice as it seems in photos  definitely 
749173319,The tv didn t work  the bathroom door doesn t latch closed     sliding barn door style  so it just rolled open and stayed open    parking for Airbnb is off property    across the street    Check in wasn t fluid  had issues with the code provided for the Key Fob    added a few minutes for having to call in and get someone to override a key box    no one on property to help with anything     If there is a problem  you re going to get a message in an email that says basically  sorry for the inconvenience   It is a clean little place and the location is pretty much near everything  TV didn t work  Bathroom door design is bad for anything other than a single person staying   Check in wasn t fluid  key cafe didn t accept code provided  had to call in    Location was good and it was a clean little place 
488358570406594920,Good stay at this beautiful Airbnb  Only dislike was the uncomfortable couch and unavailable parking  The key is jagged and tough to unlock door  Very responsive
750357280,Overpriced  But  good location 
749213035,Renter none responsive  Extremely annoying access requirements  Does not have the basic kitchen or bathroom appliances for an Airbnb extended stay rental  To get inside the building there was one way to input the entrance code of   digits then to access the elevator there was another way you had to enter the  digit code and finally to enter the actual apartment there was yet another code with   digits  Not user friendly at all  Refrigerator was not clean well and had dirty areas with crumbs  I sent a message the day I arrived advising there was no hairdryer in the bathroom and never received a response   Come to find out they did not have the basic necessities for an extended stay such as a toaster  a blender  very limited cooking utensils and pans   Headboard in the bed is not secured therefore every time you made any movement the headboard would hit against the wall and make a lot of noise  Not impressed whatsoever 
748119216,I m five months pregnant and this place was advertised as smoke free  Definitely not true and the entire complex filled with smoke  People down the hall were smoking weed as well  My husband and my eyes were bloodshot and we had to leave not even twenty minutes after we checked in  DO NOT stay here if you prefer a smoke free environment  ALSO they have cameras IN the apartment  Make sure you read the fine print  You know what happened
748672171,The place itself was nice  a great value    But  some issues   I couldn t get my keys from their box  so check in took about    minutes longer than it should have  late night after a long day of travel     I couldn t control the mode on the thermostat  Mode is controlled by the building  and for some reason it was set to cool throughout my trip  even though the outside temperature was in the    s   There was almost no silverware  and dishes were a little dirty   Nice restaurant in the building advertised in the listing was closed throughout my visit   Host was responsive   courteous enough  but ultimately not that empathetic to or effective at solving my issues 
750966765,Good communication I was told I d get a discount due to me walking into a unit and it being completely trashed and nobody had been in there to clean  I was moved which was even more of a inconvenience after the key not being in the designated area and being put on hold for about a hour 
750333471,First things first  the location is amazing   However  we had a pretty rough time checking in and it ended up making us late to our dinner reservation  Then  we realized that the entry fob  that you need to get into the building and use the elevator  was missing  so we had to do some sort of modified way to get in every time we returned from somewhere  and we never received a replacement during our stay  Overall the place was nice  but there were a few things missing that we asked for that were not addressed  no spoons    no hot plate to go along with the kettle  hand soap in the bathroom was essentially water  etc    Like I said  the place was nice  but I wished the customer service was a little better when things werent exactly desirable  Hi  thank you for letting us stay  I reached out previously to try to address some of the reasons for the negative review  but heard back from no one after multiple days  Overall we were mildly satisfied with our trip  but there were quite a few issues that we had that werent exactly taken care of 
516640817798806646,  Check in was terrible everything else was good
747364406,The shower was broken and they never came to fix it  I had to make a hotel reservation to shower and getting in touch with the host was difficult  The shower was never fixed and I still had to book a hotel to take a shower 
748678984,You can expect many delays with their customer service and the intercom system not working  If you dont want a headache I would chose a different building of theirs  I am sharing with you the message I sent to AIRBNB  I tried to resolve with you the issues that i expierenced during my stay on multiple conversations with your customer service and I am incredibly disappointed in your response  We have stayed with you many times and I would of hoped that you would do more to keep our business  But since you did not I had no choice but to reach out to AIRBNB and  the message I sent is below                                                                     I am contacting you about the above stay with Zencity from April  th to the   th  When I arrived they said there would be a fob to easily gain access into the building  There was no said fob and i had to use the code provided to enter the building every single time  using an intercom system  On saturday  one day after our stay  i messaged zencity twice about the fob and did not recieve a response  There were zero issues with the intercom system so i just went about my stay  On Monday the   th I tried to gain access into the building around      pm that night and I could not  I immediatly called Zencity and was on hold for a total of    minutes between two phone calls  All while im waiting in the foyer of this apartment building because i had to have a fob or key to even get into the lobby  For the next     HOURS i was stuck in the foyer speaking with zencity     mins into being in the foyer a woman came that was also staying with zencity and she was stuck with me  at the end of     HOURS there was a total of   of us that were staying with zencity that could not gain access into the apartments that they rented  While i was on the phone with the woman from customer service we tried everything  different codes  she tried calling management and they would not come  they said that they do not have a master fob in one of the lock boxes of this foyer bc they were getting new ones  I had no water  food  and no charger  my phone ended up on     so the customer service lady took down Kats  one of the other people stuck in the foyer with me  phone number so that she could call us back and she never called us back  At this time two more people joined us and they called zencity and basically the only solution was to BEG a resident to let us in and use there fob in the elevator  When i got back in my room zencity said that they could not fix the problem until at least   am in the morning     i got into my room a few minutes after   pm      so they said i had two choices        I could not leave the apartment until   am bc i would have zero access into the apartment due to the intercom system or    I could go get a hotel or a different AIRBNB  The guy on the phone said he could give me a refund of          and i basically told him that wasnt good enough because it was not going to make me whole  I had to take a     uber to my hotel that cost      for the remaining two nights of my stay  When we tried to get the refund the next morning through the message they sent it said it was expired and i could not collect  I called zencity and basically they pulled back the refund and she said that her manager would call me the following day  We are now at Thursday and no call from the manager and no partial refund  I called them again on friday and nothing  This morning i called them and he said he had to get managers approval but would be sending a refund today  We recieved a refund of      this afternoon  It wasnt even the      they first sent us   We paid zencity      for the stay and only recieved       I asked today to speak with a supervisor  i have never spoke with one as of yet even though the supervisor was suppose to call me the other day   I understand that things happen but i expected them to make us whole since it was their issue that the intercom system didnt work and it was the apartment buildings issue  I am also highly disappointed in their customer service  I would like you to please review our stay and let me know if there is anything you can do with zencity to get a more comparable refund  They did not provide us with a fob as stated and we could not get into the building for half of our stay and had to relocate and had to relocate to a hotel Customer service did not find a solution to there problem about their system not working with the intercom system  Also I was told a supervisore would call me back and never did and I was told a specific amount of a refund and i only got the partial amount that they said they would give 
465935661694181824,Pros   Location  in the heart of CWE  close to Whole Foods  restaurants  bars  and metro    Comfy bed   Good shower pressure with hot water  Cons   Incorrect check in information  never received the correct code to get into the building and had to sneak in with other residents    Terrible communication  when asking for the correct door code  Zencity requested a video to be sent to an email outside of AirBnB    Unclean  cockroaches in the bathroom  food residue in the kitchen  dank mildew smell throughout the apartment coming from the washer   We made it work  but I would not stay here again  The information provided for check in was incorrect and the communication to resolve the issue was unhelpful  To have to send a video to an email outside of AirBnB in order to get the code to get into the building is inefficient and inappropriate  I NEVER RECEIVED THE PROPER CODE  I had to sneak in with other residents of the building every time   Thankfully the apartment door code worked  The wifi network was incorrect as well  There was not network listed as just  Zencity  Lastly the condition of cleanliness was not good  There was food residue in the kitchen and we discovered cockroaches in the bathroom  A big one was on the sink  Additionally the entire apartment smelled like mildew because of the washer  Something in there needs to be clean out or replaced  I get that you own many properties but management of individual units should be better 
749906835,The place has nice modern furnishings and is in a great location   so close to forest park and the cwe area   It has plenty of space and the TV is already set up for streaming   You must go check out the view at the rooftop if staying here   We had a delayed response when inquiring how to check in that scared us since no one was answering the phone number on the reservation   I would make sure you inquire about the check in process well before you arrive   The front desk staff was incredibly kind   The bathroom does have a backflow issue and it does make the whole place smell of sewage   it is not pleasant   The bathroom or towels were not very clean  either   The bed is extremely hard  which we dont prefer  but know that different people have different preferences   Parking was easy to find around the corner  The plumbing issue really needs to be solved so that there isnt a strong sewage odor in the space when arriving   I know this is likely an old building issue  but it is unacceptable for a place we are paying good money to stay in to smell like poo throughout the entire stay   Cleanliness is especially important during these covid times and we felt like a company like zencity would have good protocols in place    but the bathroom  towels  and shower were not clean and it was not a pleasant experience   The bed is also incredibly hard and not comfortable   Overall  the location is great  parking wasnt as difficult as others said  and the rooftop view is nice   We were generally unhappy with our stay and wouldnt stay here again   It was not a pleasant or comfortable experience  The instructions to check in werent sent out prior to us asking for them   It took an hour for them to respond via messaging  which is time we spent worrying that we had gotten scammed   We were waiting  nervous we would have to scramble to find another place to stay   I tried calling the host phone number supplied multiple times and it went to an automatic system that said it would connect me to someone  but automatically hung up on me when I pressed     It was followed up by an automatically sent text that said they were eager to help us with our stay but provided no help or way to contact anyone   The only saving grace was when we finally received the message with the check in instructions  the young man at the front desk was incredibly nice and helpful and awesome  The sink had crumbs or white pieces of residue in it that was pretty gross to walk into   The shower also had pink mildew along the bottom of the shower curtain  which isnt reassuring for how clean the place was overall   The towels smelled like pipe tobacco  which doesnt resonate as clean to me   Overall  the bathroom has some type of backflow preventer issue which causes the whole space to smell like sewage and waste  The time delay in response is nerve wrecking for a traveler   The message was clear in instruction once sent   These instructions should be included in the check in information so there is no scaring anyone when they are worried they cant get into the place they had reserved   Someone should always be available by phone and not hung up on if called   This is something that is often found with scammers and isnt good customer service for such a large company  It was overpriced for the accommodations 
749463462,The apartment is great to stay  nice location and great environment  However  it is difficult to get hold off the host  it takes hours for them to reply in Airbnb message  when there is emergency need to reach the host over the phone  it always needs to wait    min and more  Poor communication  ALWAYS takes over    min when calling to reach customer service  And sometimes miss replying in Airbnb 
748748757,Ended up canceling my stay the day of after the trouble I had and after seeing the room  Check in information was late  Bed had stains on the comforter and some blinds were broken  We also were told last minute the parking pass and parking fob were missing  thus we couldn t park there for the first night  This was a huge issue because we were from out of town and we didn t know any overnight parking areas  I understand things happen but we chose this Airbnb for its parking  We were supposed to be able to check in at  pm  I had to reach out and contact multiple people to at least get in by  pm There was a stain on the comforter right in the middle of the bed  The furniture was also a little beat up  Some breakage in the blinds Slow to respond  I had to call the help line a few times for immediate help 
750989248,Beautiful bright apartment  just not the cleanest  The building altogether is a bit loud as well 
484017686949824860,Great location  stylish space  comfortable bed  Unfortunately  the WiFi was down during the whole stay and the hair dryer was broken  and the host did not respond to related requests for help with these issues 
750431271,Our stay in this apt was a nightmare  Stay away from ZenCity they are very clause to what can be easily defined a fraud  The apt is far away from what they advertise and even if they are promoting the Anti covid clean policy they have no idea on what is  clean   If you intend to go there this is what you should know      an house which is at the limits of safety  Screw and spikes all around which are putting at the risk the kid s safety    dirtiness allover the house and furniture fully dirty and stinky  food left inside the fridge and hairs allover   We had to clean up everything and sanitise all the furniture  Far away from the COVID policy    no blinders or curtains which are making the sleeping very difficult  I have requested several time no answers    linen and towels full dirty and full of dust  We had to go to laundry to get them clean  Most of them were used and not washed      services advertised  such as laundry machine  which are not present in the house but in a dirty and stinky basement    windows fully dirty and with sliding guides full  of dirtiness in such a way to prevent any closing creating a serious safety issue  I had to repair by myself  I have contacted ZENCITY several time to solve the issues and they haven t done a single step to resolve the issues  We were there just because close to the hospital and need to stay there but i strongly recommend all the people who want to stay in CWE to stay far from ZenCity host  also other families we met had the same problema in other apartments  Look at my pics to see the reality on how this people are managing their properties 
750976397,None I already told them everything   But the main issues were noisy all night   No towels for a four night stay and again no contact via phone   We left one day early  No phone contact in St  Louis   Only messaging notes No phone contact whatsoever   You left a note and waited 
748732878,Not a good host at all  to be completely honest  The suite  location  and pricing was all pretty decent  but we had so many difficulties with getting into our building and communicating with the host  We were given a code to get into the buildings entrance and into the elevator  but that code stopped working on the second day of our trip  The key fob they said would be in the suite was absent  We messaged and called several times about the issue  but it was always  well get back to you  or no reply at all  That  or they continously questioned our ability to reach the elevator in under    seconds even though we did it on the phone with them  We never heard back or received the key fob  and we barely could leave our suite the entire visit because we had no way to get back in unless maintenance happened to be there  Absolute mess of a trip and we will not be staying with this host again 
470989254902943359,Great location and good size place  Only issue was a musty smell that dominated the place with zero response from place  Wouldn t stay there again We sent a message about the musty smell with zero response   Wouldn t stay there again
750351756,Where do I begin   I guess by saying PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE  SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE    Ive never has a worser experience with a stay in my life  In a nutshell     There were NO lightbulbs in the bedside lamps so I had to use the closet light for lighting in the living room  They told me they would send maintenance the next day  so I stayed in my room the entire next day waiting and they never came    The microwave AND stove BOTH DID NOT WORK  so I was unable to cook    There was LOUD construction pretty much all day   am  pm   except on Saturday and Sunday  The noise was head pounding and woke me up everyday  I was also unable to use the room as a quiet place to study     WORST COMMUNICATION EVER  If you want them to answer the phone be prepared to wait  and also pray that they actually answer and not just hang up on you after a while  The messaging was a bit faster  but they did a good job of not responding to what I was asking of them  Some instances they would completely not respond at all  or say they would get back to me and I would never hear from them again  It was very aggravating working with them    I complained about all these things and do you know what all they actually resolved  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  They couldnt even compensate me for the things that didnt work  On the  rd day I actually reached out and said I would like to cancel to receive the     refund for the days that I stayed and they didnt even get back to me  so I felt like I had to stay so it wasnt just a gigantic waste of money   I still cannot believe this place would allow themselves to provide this poor of a service to guests smh  Please do not stay here  you will regret it  Will never be booking with you all again  You all should take a great deal of more pride in the business that youre offering to people  I was overcharged for what I went through and no one helped  Ive also told people to never book here and will continue to do so  Non working amenities  no light bulbs in the displayed bedside lamps  and the  view  was just a window with another building completely in front of it  They did not send my instructions prior to check in  This made moving in a long  drawn out  and a hassle  WORST COMMUNICATION EVER  If you want them to answer the phone be prepared to wait  and also pray that they actually answer and not just hang up on you after a while  The messaging was a bit faster  but they did a good job of not responding to what I was asking of them  Some instances they would completely not respond at all  or say they would get back to me and I would never hear from them again Other than the fake view  I liked the location overall Construction in the neighboring units all day everyday  the view was not quite the  view  and very important things in the room were not working nor were they fixed 
752413240,Would recommend 
750973765,This was my worst Airbnb experience to date and Im furious with this company    Im in St Louis visiting family but was looking for an airbnb for two nights because I had a major presentation for work and wifi was spotty where I was staying  So I reached out to Zencity before booking to ensure that wifi could reliably support zoom calls  I was assured the average wifi speed at the unit was    MPBS  So I went ahead and booked  As soon as I checked in  I tested the wifi  which hovered between   MBPs and   MBPS  never even reaching above  MBPs  I immediately reached out to Zencicty via Airbnb  told them the situation  and underscored how I needed this fixed urgently  When they hadnt responded in several hours  I found the Zencity website and found a contact email  I sent that address an email and it immediately bounced back    the email address was no longer valid  They were not contcatable    I ended up leaving the unit and taking my dispute to Airbnb  Believe it or not  in the dispute with Airbnb  Zencity has refused to give me any of my money back  I still have not heard back from my original message  which included screenshots of the abysmal wifi speed     The rates are low for a reason  avoid this scammy company  Get your act together   this is no way to run a company I specifically asked about wifi before booking  I was booking this spot because I  NEEDED wifi for a very important meeting  and where I was staying didnt have wifi  I was told wifi would be   MPs  In reality it hovered between     MBPs  I tested the wifi right when I checked in  reached out to ask for help and never heard back   I also reachedd out via the contact email address on Zencitys website  The email address was defunct and my email bounced back  Then  in disputes with Airbnb  Zencity declined to give us any kind of refund  Long story short  this company is a fraud with no care for customer service  Hair on rug I  never  heard from Zencity after reporting the wifi issues  I also reached out via their contact email address on their website  The address was defunct and the email bounced back  I ultimately had to turn to Airbnb 
752875715,While the location was fine  and the apartment was as described  the smell of smoke coming from the rest of the building over took everything  It was very strong 
752382498,Great location in terms of being walking distance to the arch  aquarium and city museum  the parking garage is a bit down the road and the area is a little scary at night so make sure to have a buddy when parking  There was no hot water     days we were there not sure if it s because of the building or not but it was disappointing to not be able to shower
751291393,great people you guys usually do a good job I dont knowcwhat happened the last   spots no coffee couldnt even change the heater it was cold and no response which was surprising cause Ive stayed with them
751629051,When I arrived at the location I followed the building entry instructions  to the letter literally speaking the codes out loud as told to do in the booking details  However  the doors would not unlock  Much to my surprise  there was another couple who had booked a Zencity listing on Airbnb who also could not get in    We had to wait in the entry until a tenant let us in the building as they exited  Now  even though we were now in the foyer of the building  we could not use the elevator as the access code at the door activated the sensor allowing us to go to our floor  but since the access code at the door didnt work  we could not get the elevators to function without a key fob  We had been told that the key fob was waiting for us upstairs so this would not be an issue moving forward  We tried calling Zencity from the phone number listed but couldnt get through  After    minutes of waiting  still unable to reach them a family arrived and graciously allowed us to ride up in the elevator to our floor  At that point another couple joined us who also was struggling with Zencity their code for the door did not work either   When we all got off at the same floor  we went to our rooms  only to discover that the key fobs were not in any of our apartments  I was finally able to reach them on the phone  but was told that the fobs had been lost previously and there was no way for us to get a new one  When I explained that that made it nearly impossible for us to enter or get upstairs due to our access codes not working  the woman on the phone insisted that the codes did in fact work  I kept her on the phone  went back downstairs  and with her still listening to me out loud tried all three codes  Not a single code for any of the rooms rented worked  I once again found myself locked out of the building unable to use the elevator  I had to wait for someone else to let me in and take me upstairs  Promptly at      p m  California time  where theyre located  the woman hung up on me despite the fact that we were still having a conversation  When I tried to call back at      PST  the phone rang and rang and rang  I attempted calling five times  They never picked up   At that point no one had responded to my pleas for support over the Airbnb messaging platform  Given that I was in town for work  and would be leaving the building frequently  the inability to safely access and use any of the entries made it such that it was impossible for me to stay  Before the woman unceremoniously hung up on me  I had requested to speak to management to get my money back because I would be checking out she informed me that was not possible    I had to go through Airbnb  who were incredibly helpful and handled the situation beautifully  in order to cancel the room and get my money back    By the time I had booked a new place and checked in  Zencity finally responded to my messages on the Airbnb platform  Reiterating they could not refund me and that they had called for maintenance to see if they could let me in the building  Their service is the worst I have ever experienced booking through Airbnb   I wish I could say I was exaggerating  but it is simply a terrible company to deal with  they say misery loves company  but there was nothing gratifying about knowing that four other individuals were dealing with the same issues  We all spoke with one another and confirmed that none of us were able to get help from them  and none of us received working access codes or fobs    If you are considering booking at this building  do not and I mean do not choose a Zencity listing  The building itself was lovely and all its tenants exceedingly helpful  but Zencity made it impossible to safely stay at the location 
750579961,Great location  loved it  I have a couple suggestions and they would be to place a rubber mat with grip in the shower because it was very slippery and hard to comfortably shower  Also it seemed the bathtub drain was backed up a little bit  Other than that it was a great experience and thank you for hosting me 
750386386,The only thing we had trouble with was check in  Zencity has a machine where you say the code into it and it lets you in  I will say we spent about   mins when we arrived trying to get in  We were told there would be a fob but we never received one which made me anxious that we might be stranded another    mins every time but surprisingly  the machine actually got our code the first time after that which was much better  the only other thing is the walls are very thin  we were watching baseball and got a message that we were loud  Also  the doors get slammed when you walk out and we kept getting woken up around  am when the people across would leave    I decided to give it a try regardless of the reviews so I knew I Hey there  thanks so much for letting us stay in your space  I think the biggest thing was the fob  but other than the first night the zencity machine picked up our code the first time so maybe its a one time thing  would be helpful to let people know they might have trouble the first time so they are aware  other than that and the doors across being loud and waking us up around  am  it was a great space and walking distance to things we wanted to do  The light in the bedroom didnt work and there was a kitchen cabinet door in the closet but that didnt bother us   great spot  would be willing to stay there again  Upon checking in  the intercom didnt work for the first    minutes until it finally let us in  Not having a fob in the apt gave me anxiety not knowing if we would be able to get back into the building or if it was always going to take    minutes to get in 
462251541890733542,The location is amazing and the apartment was very clean   I would not recommend if you plan on making use of the kitchen as it was extremely limited with what is available  it shows that this was never a lived in apartment and is strictly for rentals   Communication was also an issue for us  we felt that the communication issue in having to reach out to obtain check in instructions despite being told we would be sent them  coupled with the lack of notice about maintenance on the building shutting off the water   was a real detriment to our stay     We also feel that there is a lack of basic necessities in the apartment in regards to the kitchen   i e  no pot holders   no salt or pepper shakers
751914998,The unit itself was good   As advertised   With that said  the listing says there is a coffee pot  hair dryer  and cable tv in the unit   This is false  Having to leave in the morning for coffee is kind of a big deal for us   I contacted the host about this and was ignored   Also  there is a restaurant right below the unit and you can hear music playing at night while trying to go to sleep 
752466443,Weird smell no parking This place had a weird smell and holes in some walls  Needed to be clean bad     
752278410,Pictures do not match  the place  Was very unclean and we ended up canceling our reservation  The whole apartment was dirty  Dig said it hadn t been clean since      and it showed  Yellow stains in towels and sheets  Holes and markings on walls throughout Bathroom fixtures and flooring were dirty  Window shades in the first bedroom were broken  and a chair had a white stain on it  Overall we did not feel comfortable  I have many pictures I can share upon request  Pictures from the listing did not match what the actual apartment looked like  Parking was very confusing Dirty throughout the apartment  Holes and marking all over walls  Yellow marks on towels and bed sheets  Spider webs in corners  Card in apartment said it hadn t been clean since       two whole months  Dirty floors especially in bathroom  Shower walls and shower has were filthy  I took pictures so they ar available upon request  Late responses
752662994,The place to stay was great   clean  safe and luxurious like a hotel room  However the intercom did not work while entering the building and the host wasnt responsive to help   Also there wasnt FOB in the room and the host didnt help out  The intercom did not work and nobody helped despite messaging  Everytime I had to check in with someone elses help
751497686,First time booking an Airbnb and I will surely take head to those reviews next time  I saw other reviews complaining about check in and I thought to myself  it can t be that bad  Ha  It was that bad  I m traveling pregnant with a    year old and we get dropped off by Lyft  We re standing outside bags in hand unable to enter the building  Trying to contact host  Contacts Airbnb rep literally NO HELP  Finally an hour and a half goes by and a nice neighbor got us some help  The building manager lets us in  Ok fine  By this point I just want to sit down for a minute and get us fed  Realize there isn t a fob in the apartment and we can t enter the building without the key fob which means we can t leave or we ll be locked out again pretty much  Remind you the host still hasn t contacted me by this time to see if we were able to get checked in ok     I m contacting them again because at this point we re stuck smh another   hrs go by no food no water  Finally someone contacts me and  has me go into another apartment for a fob  We work out compensation but it s been over two weeks and I still haven t received anything  I had someone contact me again yesterday and I reminded her of the agreement that was supposedly already in place and she sees no notes for that  of course  I received a message this morning saying if there was nothing else they were gonna close out my case  Inconsiderate  insensitive  and a horrible business to run  More people are gonna go back to staying at hotels where we have concierge on call  Better the communication of your business  You can t just have people booking a place to stay with no way of communicating  it s inconsiderate and insensitive especially for someone like me who is pregnant  People will just start booking hotels because of the convenience and assistance that s there when needed 
751229697,We stayed   nights  We were told there would be a key fob once we got initial entry  Well there wasnt a fob and there was no access to laundry facility or anything else  Very disappointed  Wont use again  stuck outside for over    minutes Being stuck at front entrance multiple times with it being between    to over    minutes was very irritating  no access to laundry facilities also frustrating  Dont feel you advertise correctly with washer dryer mentioned in headline but there isnt   in apartment   with no key fob I didnt have access to other floors  So what was supposed to be a relaxing little weekend get away turned out to be   frustration after another  Very disappointed  
755841385,Read last comment I wasn t very pleased with not having it clear as to the entering the building or codes  The kitchen was not clean and the bathtub was filthy  I actually had To clean the bath in the shower out before I can get in it  They were broken glasses I have pictures a private sale I won t be recommending this for anybody thank you
751946101,Arrive early enough that theres someone to help when you cant get in because of a bad code for the door or keyholder  Prepare to brush your teeth in the kitchen sink  Please check your own codes to make sure they work  Check in was the worst experience Ive ever had  And there is NO sink in the bathroom  Had to use kitchen sink and they did put a mirror over it but just not usable  I had to call twice as neither the door code would work  someone from the building saw me struggling with it and let me in when I explained  then the key code would not release the door to get the key  I did call host again and got a really nice lady who worked with me to get the key to get in  it was cold and rainy and was standing outside in it trying to resolve the issue  no sink in the bathroom 
751535565,Great location near Wash U in the Central West End  The check in information was not provided in a timely manner  and the cleanliness left a lot to be desired  We reported the washing machine and nothing was done  Blood stain on duvet was unpleasant and had clearly been intentionally hidden  as it was facing down on the bed  Despite the high clean fee charged  the apartment was really dirty  The neighbor across the hall left   bags full of garbage out in the hall on Monday  which sat out there all week  No entry instructions until we requested them Duvet cover with a blood stain  Rest of place not clean in areas such under bed  Plates not clean  Rug dirty  Vacuum un clean Washing machine not working it was reported but no action received
489150295472125336,Couldve offered something for my inconvenience doors werent secure upon arrival  then eventually was damaged and broken
753332546,hidden camera s in bathroom
751499635,We were trapped in our room  The key wasn t there to get into the building and the intercom to get into the building was broken  They gave us a refund but we were trapped in the room all evening and night  The only way to get into the building and elevator was to ask a resident of the apartment building to let us in  There was no one near enough to bring us a key  This place is a corporation and didn t have any way to accommodate us  The workers we talked to on the phone were nice but took    minutes to answer every time and couldn t help us 
754319997,Initial check in had its share of issues and difficulties  Couldnt get into the building and met a few other Zencity guests experiencing the same issue  Once in the room  it was a nice stay  but the Kitchen and Living Room lights did not turn on  Lots of room for improvement  could easily be a   star stay  But its not  Its a solid    Check In was ruff   
752673987,This may or may not be centrally located to a number of bars  restaurants  etc  but if youre only looking for a place to spend the night in KC  as we were  you could find a better place for this value  or even a hotel     Apartment was spacious but not terribly clean  No bath soap  blue and brown stains on the towels  Building is remarkably loud you can hear folks walking up and down the hallway as though they were in the bedroom with you and  as of April       adjacent to an active construction site  Wifi is on the slower side  at least in the bedrooms    Took about a half hour to get ahold of the keys in the lockbox  we were provided with the wrong code   The room is owned by a corporation  Zencity  and while we were eventually helped  it proved tiresome to communicate with its agents via the Airbnb app   Our phone calls were not picked up or returned    Parking isnt terribly convenient  but that much is made clear in the listing description  Beds were comfortable  Lovely  friendly coffee shop on the first floor  Thanks for the stay  I found a used sock behind one of the metal blocks in the bedroom to the far right you may want to do a thorough clean of the place to see what else might be lying around 
751206737,Giving this stay a   star review because the bedding did not appear to be switched from the previous guest  i e  there was a lot of hair on the sheets and pillows  and sheets appeared messy and not crisp  I was allowed to switch rooms but this was still a very off putting aspect of the experience    In addition  there are no staff onsite which means that if there are any issues during your stay  you may have to wait until the next business day to receive help if not longer   Another issue with this listing is that its operated by a company as opposed to an individual  so when speaking with the host about this and other issues  I was speaking with a team of people who werent always up to speed on previous communication with other staff   The location is good and convenient although it is right next to the train station so it may not be ideal for very light sleepers  however I personally did not find it to be such an issue   Overall  the management company  Zencity  ought to have someone on call whos able to come over to resolve issues in a timely manner  For a short stay this place may fit your needs but a higher level of service wouldve been nice at this price point 
752428271,We Were unable to enter property via intercom  there was no access fob in location  While likely just taken by last guest unintentionally  there was no communication or resolution  We had another stranger let us in the building hours later to collect our bags and ended up paying for a hotel  Cute place though  When we had to be let in and searched the entire place for the fob it started as funny and expected  With    hours and no resolution ever offered I had to get a hotel just so we could have someplace to stay we didn t need to rely on a stranger letting us in the building  Unable to use intercom to access  no fob for access in room after another person let me in  It took    hours for them to respond and I ended up paying for a hotel
754357083,Location and size is great but be prepared for a dirty apartment  Even after cleaners came back  it was still filthy  Hair and dirt all over the floor  a small blood stain on a comforter  sinks and tubs that don t drain and have gross stuff backing up  and gross stained couch and chairs  The kitchen is equipped with dishes but not any salt and pepper  oil  hotpads  or any other cooking basics  I was pretty disappointed in my stay  Very dirty apartment even after it was  clean  
752871979,Read the reviews   Spend the extra few dollars and stay somewhere else   The apartment was cute and the location was super convenient  but thats the only good thing about this place   Despite the not so great reviews  I gave this place the benefit of the doubt thinking it wouldnt be that bad   It completely reeked of stale weed  cigarette smoke to the point that it was unbearable and nauseating  I kept the window open the whole time to try and air it out some  but it didnt help much  I used the washer and dryer to try and rid my clothes of the smell before leaving  and even they somehow smelled like it too  I thought it was ironic that they had a  No Smoking  sign inside of the place   Also  the neighbors were having a rap sesh at      am one morning  and the other morning a woman was screaming  hitting  and kicking the walls outside of another apartment at      for at least    minutes   One of the extra blankets they offered also had a giant yellow stain on it  Gross   If you dont mind the smell and noisy neighbors though  go for it as it is in a great location  Thanks for the stay  May I suggest doing something about the stale cigarette  weed smoke   I know its most likely coming from the neighbors  but it was unbearable and nauseating  Maybe add a disclaimer or offer a more reasonable price  I almost cancelled my stay there because of it  but didnt want to only end up getting a quarter of what I paid back  and instead opened the window and slept on the couch just to have fresh air  Also  one of the blankets had a big yellow stain on it  Gross  Even the washer and dryer that I used to wash my clothes to try and rid them of the smell reeked of it too 
752867444,Place is nice and worth the money except there s no air conditioning    And they charge a       fee with is outrageous as long as you clean up after yourself you should get the fee back 
517375949118003385,NO WHERE TO PARK CHECK IN WAS VERY DIFFICULT AN COMPLICATED UNIT WAS VERY COLD COULDNT TURN HEAT ON      On the bright side the bed was kinda comfy Check in was difficult an to complicated the unit was very cold
754354029,Place was clean and marched the photos listed however the wifi listed was never an option to connect  to nor did any other wifi work  
754169586,Not really nice  Condo was not locked when we arrived  Closet door hanging  Hallway smelled of smoke  No bath soap  Old furnishings  Old coffee grinds in coffeemaker  Nothing to make it stand out as a place you want to be  Doorlock confusing  Condo wide open when we arrived 
465964695480476921,First n foremost the apt was located walking distance        min walks  to local spots  The area was quiet and the building altho needs some upkeep  was chill and safe    The apt however  advertised tv  wifi but there was issues with both  First off the tv had no remote and  buttons on it wouldn t work so  had to stay with it on or unplug it    The wifi i was given barely even showed up as available and   times it did  the password given both by airbnb app and written in apt was incorrect    The sink wouldn t drain quickly so water would accumulate quick and slowly drain    The shower head had a rack and i believe it was too heavy and pulled the shower head out of wall exposing a hole which had bugs crawling out of   Nothing crazy but a bit disgusting   All this was communicated to the host who not only responded    hours later but inly addressed one issue after multiple messages  New wifi  Name n password was given almost   says later  And missed out on one day of work bc of the lack of internet    The host seems to have multiple staff that manage multiple properties therefore diff people responded yet didnt follow up     Check in was smooth altho needed more time to clean apt  Ut they extended check out until    right sway for that inconvenience  Experience wasn t horrible  just wish i had the wifi addressed right away so i could have logged into work and that tv had a remote  Good communication is key bc even when things don t go your way  if you at least make an effort and communicate to customers that your trying to resolve issue promptly we usually are very understanding  Just something to be mindful going fwd and to improve on 
751283872,Work in progress  look forward to new location and better experience Call your clients back when they have concerns regarding your property Very dusty looked like someone just left
755404356,my stay was ok  they didn tclean the sheets  it a lot of hair and even looked like dog sheddin in the bed and all over the pillows  even the back up sheets had hair all over them  so i had to go downstairs and wash everything  Then once i contacted the host  they replied back the same day i was checkin out to have someone bring fresh coverings   i sent them pictures the first day i came and washed the sheets   requested my clean service fee back    i never got it  host wasnt very understanding nor helpful
756759299,Good value and location was great  Communication was not good  We didn t have WiFi and couldn t get an answer as to how to resolve it  Washer and dryer is not in the unit as advertised  It s in the basement of the building   which was fine  it just would have been nice to have known ahead of time  I d stay there again but I suggest Zencity pays closer attention to details in there ad and communication  We had no WiFi and did not receive a reply as to how to resolve the issue  It was also advertised as washer and dryer in the unit  They were in the basement of building   which was fine  but would have been nice to have known ahead of time 
755561807,The unit was not clean  The fridge had dried up juice at the bottom and sticky drippings on the floor  The ventilation system did not work also the ceiling had mold from what looked to be water damage  The bedroom door had a whole in it the bed was full of hair and the bedroom closet had dried gum in the wedges  The bathtub had not been clean it had dried up soap residue and hair all over it    guess the clean fee is money well spent  Not to mention this was a totally different unit than advertised in the photos when I booked  This stay was totally unacceptable  I sent in photos  messaged in dozens of times and was only offered for someone to come tidy up and on top of that I was still charged full price  This was a totally different unit from what I requested and booked and when I reached out to the host  I was told that it was when the whole decor  furniture and floorplan layout was different from the pictures  Upon arrival the stove had  crumbs on it  the fridge had red dried juice in the door shelves and at the bottom  their were also sticky drippings on the floor  The ceiling had mold from what looked to be water damage  There was a hole in the bedroom door  The bed was full of hair  as well as the bath tub and floor  The tub also had dried up soap residue  The bedroom closet door had dried gum in the wedges  Which makes me question why your company is charging a clean fee   The host replied but was not much help  The dirty unit and the host being unwilling to assist  also the A c unit didnt work
756141124,Very Disappointed 
754139446,There was a mixup and they double booked us with another group and we did not have anywhere to stay for one night  However  they did give us a refund for that night and made steps to ensure something similar wont happen again
757103795,  out of   
755580215,We weren t able to get in the place wasn t as clean as expected and while they were responsive on some issues they could use some adjustment on how you get in and get out Do you know the glitch which is two things number one place was not very clean it smelled funny seconds him we couldn t get in and out and that system you have for the door code does not work you need to come up with a different method for letting people in because that one that doesn t work
767507525,This Airbnb was pretty good for a little weekend trip  A few minor issues were getting into the actually apartment Zencity provided the wrong information for the call box but we got lucky and got let in  Secondly  our fob did not work  which you need for the elevator or to get in and the stairs only go to floor    but luckily after a few hours of communication the next day and the office being open we resolved the issue  Our bedroom light went out the first night which we just worked around  All things aside location was great and the Airbnb had basic needs for a comfortable stay  
758109772,Could have been better overall
757352777,The location seemed to be just throw together to rent  Obviously there was no effort to make the until comforting for the renter   No pots  no pans    and the door was not safe and could be easily broken into  It was plain at best  The location seemed to be just throw together to rent  Obviously there was no effort to make the until comforting for the renter   No pots  no pans    and the door was not safe and could be easily broken into  It was plain at best 
759277765,Worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had to the point where I more than likely won t be using this service ever again   I reached out to both Airbnb and the host directly about extremely loud construction noises that were impacting my ability to work remotely   despite me putting in my initial request that that was the purpose for my trip  I wasn t even able to get on conference calls because I couldn t hear  The construction was daily from  am to  pm and ran all week  I wish I could upload videos to share   With that said  I reached out in a timely manner and just stopped hearing from the host altogether and have been bounced around through several  help  assistants from Airbnb  The host tried to offer     of the nightly rate back which after Airbnb s astronomical fees  was less than      for a weeklong stay that was unworkable for my sole purpose of being there    Terrible  terrible service  If you re planning to book with Zencity  don t waste your time or your money  Their lack of communication impeded me from options to relocate and actually be productive during my work week   From the fees to the customer service issues to hosts buying up properties and jacking up prices  Airbnb is starting to become what it allegedly wanted to change about the hotel industry and you hate to see it    I m only giving two stars because the apartment was cute and the bed was comfortable 
758558310,The Airbnb was filthy  The host had good customer service 
759434610,Never got to stay bc it was canceled Sorry but y all canceled
767289813,This property did not live up to our expectations  The lights did not work in the kitchen  TV only got limited stations  washer machine did not work and we were missing a towel and had to go purchase one   Even the carpet in the hallway was disgusting dirty  The whole experience was not good  Excellent location but that was it  This property has not met our expectations and lacked attention  Lights in kitchen did not work  were missing a towel and had to go buy one because after calling and seeking help yet no towel showed up and yes we have permission to enter the unit 
756795196,Doors squeaked very loudly and bathroom door wouldnt close all the way   Shower was clogged   As long as Zencity takes care of those issues it is a decent apartment and good location  The bathroom and bedroom doors squeaked so loudly upon open and close it woke everyone up each time someone entered or exited   The shower was clogged and filled with water when used   My husband had to plunge it out   The refrigerator was empty but shelves not wiped down   Should offer more than one key to get in outside door as it was difficult to coordinate with multiple people in the unit 
768339233,The pictures are of the unit  The unit has a very strong urine smell  The toilet is not safely secured to the wall or the floor so it rocks  The room was NOT clean  The location was great 
766585213,Great location  Nice little apartment for singles or couples looking to get away and experience KC  Only issue we had was with the check in procedure  Better instructions are needed for building access  Check in procedure was difficult to follow  I tried step by step to work through the building entrance panel and never even got to the step where you speak the code  On attempting to find apt     manually on the touch screen  we found everything but apt      Someone else eventually let us into the building and the building manager let us upstairs where we found out that the key fob was being fixed so we didn t have one initially  That should have been done before check in at    Aside from all of this  we enjoyed the apt and its location and would recommend it to friends if the check in process improves a bit 
759140020,Its a fine place to stay  Sadly it is a corporation renting out apartments rather than an individual host  So if that matters to you  theres that  otherwise it was generally clean and comfortable  Just pretty lifeless 
758114611,Horrible communication and response time if you have any issues  The check in process is horrible I couldn t get in through the intercom box and had to wait for security to let me in and door to the apartment code didn t work that you all sent me 
470967261804011418,My rental wasnt clean upon check up  despite me asking that they ensure its cleaniness prior to me checking in  Please ensure your cleanliness in the future 
756192064,It s wasn t to bad
757080580,I stay in a lot of Airbnbs for work and travel and this was one if the worst  The carpet in one of the bedrooms was dirty and when we arrived the window was open  letting in the cold and rain  The latches on the window did not lock  and when I tried to report it  I was given no help  The place was minimal to the point of soullessness  Dont stay here  just get a hotel  Its not worth it for the price   I will never stay here again  It was a horrible place with dirty carpet and a broken and open window  The place had no amenities and was completely soulless  The carpets were dirty and the window was open   broken
756823494,Decent Whoever is clean isnt taking the time to thoroughly go through and actually clean and wipe everything down  The floors were disgusting Floors looked like they hadn t even been swept  it was picked up and organized but not clean
424461460627734699,This was my worst stay with Air BNB  The host was very responsive at the beginning when booking  I asked to stay later than the original   am check in  They mistakenly charged me for a whole other night instead of the     for staying late  They then took over    hours to respond when trying to get it refunded  Upon arrival check in was super simple and the place is keyed entry which is nice  When I got to my room at first things looked fine but a closer look proved otherwise  The sheets on the bed still smelled like someone s cologne  Definitely had not been washed or changed  The floor wasn t vacuumed  crumbs everywhere The windows had cobwebs  and the curtains were filthy  I couldn t stay  I booked the next flight home and was refunded  No way I could stay in there  Please actually get this room clean  The surface clean is not enough  Sheets should be changed after every guest visit  The should probably be a mattress cover as well  Curtains are dirty  Shades are dusty  Surfaces in the kitchen are not clean  This is such a safety hazard  Especially with COVID 
423099369875169945,SO GROSS  This apartment had toe nail clippings all over the living room floor  black hair balls all over the bedroom and bathroom  dusty  nasty    The shower doesn t drain  YUCK   Also  it s directly on the Blue Line Train line SO LOUD right outside the living and bedroom window  Over     trains pass by everyday  Keeps you up at night  Finally  it s    stairs up to the apartment  on  th floor  no elevator    ZENCITY is not local and was completely unresponsive  We begged them to move us from the moment we arrived to the  toe nail stairs palace   Sent    photos of the GROSS APARTMENT  After   days of asking to move  they gave us     refund for the unclean apartment  Wait what  We had to get Airbnb involved and after   nights in this NASTY PLACE  they reluctantly moved us to a new apartment  BEWARE   ZENCITY did call us   times on the  th day at the apartment because the owner realtor wanted to come in during our stay  THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON THEY URGENTLY CALLED US  Not one time did they call to discuss the DISGUSTING floors  Not one time did they call to explain why their description states  single level home  no stairs   Every message from ZENCITY was from a different person  so you basically start the whole discussion over and over again    If your dream is to vacation above a Taco Bell in Wicker Park  then this is your spot Please make sure that apartment description is HONEST do not describe as  single level home  in amenities  there are    stairs  and make sure future guests know that the apartment is directly on the blue line train tracks  It s SO LOUD  And this apartment needs a DEEP CLEAN  The toe nail clippings and hair balls were SO GROSS  It needs a serious dusting and make sure that earrings and personal items from previous guests are removed  DISGUSTING
767290469,DO NOT BOOK HERE They failed to provide me with extra towels after multiple requests not to mention I was forced to stay here without any air conditioning in the heat  There was no one who came out and checked this issue nor tried to compensate me in any way  This stay was horrible and I was doing anything not to have to be stuck melting in this apartment  It was not thouroughly clean everywhere but enough for me to be able to still stay  The windows are broken  shower curtains inside out  and mix matched curtains just to name a few  The Zencity staff offered nothing but excuses during the whole stay  Good luck if you do decide to stay here  I am very i pleased after my stay of having to sleep in uncomfortable temperatures with no help or compensation  I will not be returning and I still deserve some of my money back for the lack of performance of air throughout the facility and my sweat and tears 
757095203,They conveniently leave out that there is no parking  Whether you park on the street or in the garage you are paying at the least     a day or more  So beware before you book this place  Also the walls are paper thin  You can here the elevator and anyone who Is in the hallway or by the door  I kept thinking someone was coming in the door all night  The tub was clogged with hair that i had to remove with a fork because the water wouldnt drain  Imagine taking a shower in a tub full of water  THE WORST  And the host was unresponsive  She offered late check out in the check out details and when I asked could she accommodate late check out she stated she couldnt because the housekeeper was scheduled to come at    of which the housekeeper was late cause no one came while I was in the lobby  The location is cool if you trying to shop but if not  find another place with better parking options  Most of the shops had long Lines outside due to Covid restrictions anyway  Overall  the only good thing about good place was the view 
470936960558777363,Overall my stay was okay there were a few issues  I get the feeling this was the first time this unit has been rented so I hope this is taken as constructive criticism  The wifi didn t work which they offer to send someone to come fix but I didn t want to deal with having a technician come into the residence during my vacation  the bed didn t have a box spring so the mattress just fell into the frame causing uncomfortable divots in an otherwise comfy bed and sheets  I wasn t sent instructions other than  lockbox  there wasn t a lockbox number or code so I had to call host and wait on hold to get into the residence  when I called customer service seemed surprised that I had booked a stay this delayed us about    minutes  there was also someone else s headphones left plugged into the wall  All in with these inconveniences I d be hesitant to stay with this host again  Overall my stay was okay there were a few issues  I get the feeling this was the first time this unit has been rented so I hope this is taken as constructive criticism  The wifi didn t work which they offer to send someone to come fix but I didn t want to deal with having a technician come into the residence during my vacation  the bed didn t have a box spring so the mattress just fell into the frame causing uncomfortable divots in an otherwise comfy bed and sheets  I wasn t sent instructions other than  lockbox  there wasn t a lockbox number or code so I had to call host and wait on hold to get into the residence  when I called customer service seemed surprised that I had booked a stay this delayed us about    minutes  there was also someone else s headphones left plugged into the wall  All in with these inconveniences I d be hesitant to stay with this host again 
422429175211083242,Apartment is in a great location directly above bars  near cafes and the really nice Oz park  Lincoln park is a short walk away  If you re looking for a great spot in Chicago  this is in one  Hi there  Apartment was good and in a prime location  It was pretty dirty though  despite paying the clean fee  Happy to send photos to show you what I mean   but all round rooms  flies round vents  bathroom  windows  kitchenware and drawers etc were all dirty  All the rest with check in etc was very smooth  Thanks
759134101,   There is NO cable    There is NO sofa bed   its a   loveseat    There is NO shower  The faucet for shower bath doesnt work so dont plan on bathing    Check your dishes before use   many were unclean and grimy    Theres no kettle for boiling water for tea or coffee so forget that    The plus side is the location but its on the ground floor on a busy traffic corner so the noise level is quite high  Parking is a bear so you have to find a spot and watch the parking limitation signs  I would like a discount refund applied to my credit card  There is no sofa bed to sleep on   its a   loveseat and Im      Theres no cable  The shower bath faucet doesnt work so I was not able to bathe   stupid  Theres no cable  There was no kettle to boil water for making coffee  And the bath mat had to large wads of long black thick hair  gross   You charged me         which is way over priced for a place with no shower or sofa bed as we had planned  I expect a credit refund for one night            And you should not be in the Airbnb business as youre not a homeowner with the care factor that should go into the facility and the service  No one available to respond to no shower bath usage and no sofa bed to sleep on   This is not a host but a corporate outfit that does not know how to provide proper service for Airbnb  There was no sofa bed to sleep on so I had to share the bed with my traveling companion  the shower bath did not work so you couldnt get any water to run through the faucet  There were long black hairs in the bath mat  gross  and the cup glasses I went to use in the kitchen were dirty and grimy   had to rewash them all  No way to make coffee  no kettle  but they have a press but no kettle to boil the water  Carpets are dirty into the bathroom  Oh and theres no cable tv as stated  Only a very bad connection of a few local channels 
768163198,The apartment is beautiful and more spacious than what you see in the photos  we really liked it when we arrived and stayed for   days   But the clean part we were not happy with  it was not totally clean  the ceiling fan in the room was very dusty  the floor of the whole apartment too   In the furniture a flea appeared apparently there was a dog in the place   And the communication with Zencity was not satisfactory at all   At the end of the stay we had left the keys because the instructions said it was to leave it on the table but my husband left it on the shelf   In minutes they were charging us          saying that the keys were lost   We were already at the airport to take our flight and in the middle of the airport we had to do these steps which Zencity did not answer us  we had to ask Airbnb for help to help us and Zencity never answered the calls and emails sent by the operator of Airbnb   Thank God they did not charge us but they did not contact us to let us know  even following up if they had found the keys   My husband and I love Airbnb but with this company Zencity was the first and last time  we did not like their service at all  The apartment is beautiful and spacious we liked it a lot but the clean part we were not happy with  it was not totally clean  the ceiling fan in the room had a lot of dust  the floor of the whole apartment too   In the furniture a flea appeared apparently there was a dog in the place   And the communication with you was not satisfactory at all 
760428141,Nope  don t   Apartment would be fine with a good clean  maintenance  decent furniture  but Zencity s lack of organization and communication is incredibly frustrating   No parking access  so I had to pay to park   Bad experience and was extremely frustrating  Seriously poor communications  response to issues  cleanliness  poorly maintained property that wasn t the same as listing   Garage access never worked  so I paid to get after attempting to resolve every day  Maintenance man walked in while I was buck naked and after I had said to wait until after I was gone   You guys need to get it together or get out of the  rental business 
760362714,Great location but parking can be a pain 
769913389,This place was not at all like described in the listing  Noisy neighborhood  uncomfortable bed and couch  no street parking ANYWHERE and unresponsive host  The description of amenities was inaccurate and the host did not respond to any of my questions about them   she simply sent me copy and paste messages about check in  parking and check out  On top of that  the entire apartment looks out toward the community dumpsters   not exactly a  home away from home  situation  I love AirBnb but was sorely disappointed by this place 
381865494994981682,For the value  this is a pretty good airbnb  especially for the area  There were a couple of problems  loud construction on the floor throughout the day  VERY loud AC unit  light fixture fell out of the wall   but the access to the gym and rooftop were very enjoyable  The construction on the floor was very loud  making it at points impossible to do work  The AC unit also is very loud and not very not very effective at cooling the whole place  Additionally  a lot of the construction in the place was a little shotty  Like the light fixtures next to the bed were both falling out of the wall   one of which fell out in the middle of the night scaring the crap out of m 
420921739439209097,Horrible host  I requested an early check in  which had to be approved by the host before I was charged   They immediately accepted my booking but DID NOT provide early checkin  I m VERY disappointed with this travel experience    The space on the other hand  was in a great location and we were very happy with the actual place  Terrible check in  Requested a partial refund and you ignored it  You should be ashamed of accepting my early checkin request and not accommodating it  Tells me you are money grabbing 
383320298102011414,Great location  good amenities Already sent over my notes
763472627,Three problems     WiFi does not work properly      A C does not work properly      Host provided invalid smart lock code  was not able to access properly for   hrs until new code issued  Please refer to my email communications via the Airbnb app 
768387103,Nice location  parking wasn t bad  Check in was easy  host took a while to reply previous to the stay but during the stay I had no issues  The walls are paper thin  so if you like listening to music this place isn t for you  The walls are paper thin  I wasn t listening to music Loud and received a lot of complaints when it wasn t ever loud 
768370280,Awful stay  The intercom to enter the building doesn t work and we had to bang on the door until some workers let us in  The main light in the apartment doesn t work  The water in the tub doesn t drain  The pool is closed and they falsely still claim there is a pool available on the listing  Communication was bad  Do not recommend The intercom to enter the building doesn t work and we had to bang on the door until some workers let us in  The main light in the apartment doesn t work  The water in the tub doesn t drain  The pool is closed and you falsely still claim there is a pool available on the listing  Awful stay 
757797359,Convenient to local restaurants
760668683,Great location on a very quit street  Lots of good restaurants in walking distance  and no problems with finding free street parking  Having co hosted an Airbnb Plus in San Francisco with a super host  we are  perhaps  more critical than a usual guest  I am sure that the unit was a total showcase once upon a time  However  now it just looks tired  with drab colored walls  peeling paint on the deck  touch up paint on walls that does not match  little artwork  empty hooks on the walls  etc  Bed was comfortable  and master shower was great    Unit needs a good clean   living room floors were sticky  carpets dirty  oven and microwave dirty   island countertop was sticky  light switches dirty   Door to closet with washer dryer was off the track and stuck shut  making it unusable  Dishwasher did not work  Only   of the   burners on the stove worked  No kitchen towels to dry dishes  empty soap dispenser in downstairs bathroom  Would  also  recommend more silverware and dishes   Unfortunately  our  welcome  when we arrived was an electronic door lock that would not accept the code we were given  Alejandro was prompt in sending a new code   that also did not work   Alejandro then sent me an electronic key that required me to download and install the igloohome app  and create an an account  all while standing on the front porch  During our stay  the igloohome app would at times fail to open when I wanted to unlock the door  or would randomly log me out  requiring me to log back in  Per my request  Alejandro also sent an electronic key for me to put on my wifes phone  The app would not accept the key  and I never received a response to my complaint to customer support the next morning 
758457723,The apartment itself was okay  The main entrance to the front of the apartment complex was being held open with a rock  so that initially made me question how secure the building was going to be  We felt safe inside though and our room was fine  Heads up about the parking situation  The parking garage itself is actually about a block away or     miles so it was kind of a haul with baggage and a   year old 
464304449988083937,You couldn t pay me enough money to stay in this place again besides the key fobs not working  there is no on street parking like advertise there s construction going on  The closest place to park is a block away  The host was rude when I was upset and could not get my key fob to work and she hung up on me  I would say definitely that the apartment was very nice but the mechanics meaning the key fob in the rudeness of the host I would caution anyone from staying here
766265472,The pictures looked extremely beautiful which is what attracted us to the place to begin with  The location seemed ok  but the building over all was nice with the convenience of the restaurant  gym  and rooftop patio all in one  My complaints came when you enter the apartment and there was a smell almost like take out curry  which made me nauseous every single day   the dishes were still dirty  like they had never been washed  and to the point that we were forced to eat out every night  even the cutting board still had food left on it  There were missing light bulbs  shower curtain was broken  the chairs were broken  my   year old actually had fallen backwards in the chair and nearly busted her head  the couch was ripped  don t expect to sit on it without laying another blanket down because you will itch  If you re looking for cable or to watch the news  forget about thst  They only had Netflix  internet went in and out so much that the tv was constantly on buffer  After we left  they actually tried to accuse us of smoking in the unit and not clean up after ourselves even tho we paid the clean fee  So if you are planning to stay  make sure you take pics of the place the first day  And the last  And keep it in better condition than they left it for you or else they will try to get you on for an extra         moral of the story  dont stay here 
761558630,Worst AirBnb I ve stayed at yet  It was very dirty  very loud  the toilets were hardly operable  and zenacity did not respond until it was time to check out  Never again 
760754198,I can not say enough about the location and view   Amazing   But it was not a comfortable stay as the beds were just terrible  One of the beds was actually very badly tilted so I slept at a slope   Then the mattress was so poor that it only added more to the slope   Sleeping inverted is not comfortable   The lighting in the bedrooms were also very dark so it made anything a struggle   I would not stay here again  The beds and lighting in the bedrooms really need work 
765104349,Overall  this is a functional place to stay if youre not fussy about cleanliness  Its far from luxurious  but has a pretty good view from the living room   The host is prompt and clear with communication  The check in and check out was slick and easy All amenities were provided as listed and functioned  The location is ideal and this ideal location is where most of the value lies in this accommodation  The photos of the interior make the apartment look nicer than reality  however  if youre in town to get out and about the city  then this may be a good fit  Hi   Thank you for the accommodations  I appreciated the clear communication  quick response to my parking question  and ease of check in and check out  The location and view was nice   I ranked on the lower end for aspects of the stay that were about the overall state of the apartment  The floors are sticky  there was a very strong odor of smoke and other foul smells  there were hairs found in multiple areas including bedding  couch  and bathroom  a vase of old dead flowers on the couch  dirty windows and walls  Cigarette burns in the furniture and rug  and there were  minimal  fruit flies and water bugs upon arrival  There were stains throughout  lamp shade  comforter  rugs  etc  and bathroom fixtures are heavily rusted  The photos conceal the true state  Therefore  I was disappointed   especially considering the price of this accommodation  Other good aspect  however  TV worked  lights worked  toilet worked  low pressure flush and seeps at base   kitchen functional  AC worked  hairdryer worked  hot running water  and felt safe  Note   Neighbor s  were heard ragefully screaming both in their unit s  and in the hallway  on   occasions  but it never lasted more than    minutes   Best wishes  Melanie Moralez
762830195,Clean place  do not recommend going in the summer because the AC does not do much  just old  
405891644285470630,This was our worst Airbnb experience we have ever had  Upon arrival to the apartment  it was apparent that this had not been clean whatsoever  beyond setting some clean towels out on the bed  There was mold in the toilet bowl and shower  Every surface was hairy  dusty  and or dirty   There was dirty linen in the closet  Although we appreciated that the host immediately responded to us with an offer to  retouch these spots   we had to demand that it happen immediately  not the next morning  Unfortunately  even after that was done  it was still unacceptable and disgusting  It was not in line with what the pictures in the listing or description depicted at all  This consumed an entire day of our trip   involving extensive communication with the host and ultimately Airbnb   and we ended up relocating to a hotel for the remainder of our stay in Lincoln Park 
489104248064977990,Not clean  Host was nonresponsive about many issues  including lack of water  heat and laundry 
769100837,Getting into the building was difficult due to the inaccurate codes we were given and the TV was left on by whomever was there last  which made it concerning that we were entering an already occupied apartment   Never saw the inside  we cancelled our stay  since I was traveling with small children and felt uncomfortable  Staff has been fairly communicative and helpful with a refund  Though it has been    business days and I still have yet to receive the full portion that  Also  it was inconvenient if you re traveling with a lot of luggage  there s several stairs you need to walk up in order to get to the entrance of the building  I was appreciative of the attentiveness of the staff once we had decided we weren t staying there related to the difficulties we had getting into the building due to the inaccurate codes and concerns that we were entering an already occupied apartment  since we heard voices on the other side of the door  I was also appreciative of the assurances of the full refund  However  it has now been more than    business days since I was guaranteed this from Zencity and I still have yet to receive it   I have only received         when I was told I would be getting back         total  I would really appreciate some follow up related to this issue  Thank you 
769344598,Wouldn t stay in this unit until issues are addressed  Air did not work good   Not very clean  Air did not work good  Stayed    to     I let y all know and noting done about it  Seemed hotter at night when trying to sleep but couldnt  sleep well because too hot  Bed didn t get fixed in a timely matter in one of the rooms  Also I had to fix the shower head myself  Unit wasn t very clean either  I should be given money back for all the inconvenience had to go through  If you look in emails I mentioned these issues  I wouldn t stay again and wouldn t recommend anyone to stay in this unit until issues are fixed  I was very disappointed  Specially when we are in the area working already hot from a days work and come home to a warm apartment   
450672496221041807,The unit was not clean upon arrival  Dust was everywhere  along with a few dead bugs  AC was blasting at an uncomfortably low temperature  I asked if we could have the code to turn it up but customer service did not answer  We all woke up feeling like we had a slight cold because of the AC dust  The blinds were broken  Random marks on the a lot of the walls  The coffee table top was broken  Overall  the space look better in the photos than it does in person  I would look for another location in Wicker Park because it is a great area to stay in 
760417600,Location is phenomenal   Access to the place was very easy and the place was big  The apartment is very old and needs some TLC in many areas  The floors turned our feet black just from walking around  and the blankets in the common area felt a little grimy  The beds were nice and the sheets felt great  Location was amazing    I would say the value and location were awesome  but some tlc should go into the place like deep clean the rugs  furniture  and floors  Overall we were pleased  The bottoms of our feet were black  and it just needs a big deep clean 
761717733,Sencillamente la peor experiencia he tenido  Uno de los ba os sin agua  Todos bebimos usar el ba o que est  dentro de la otra habitaci n  En lugar de mandar a alguien a componer el asunto el anfitri n me solicitaba videos y fotos del ba o  Al d a siguiente ducha no se pod a cerrar  y solo agua fr a sal a  Imposible usar el segundo ba o  Los d as siguientes fueron fin de semana y nadie respond a los mensajes  ni pasaron a componer la fuga de agua  Sal  en domingo y a n era imposible cerrar la ducha  Ha sido la peor experiencia de hospedaje que he tenido 
770044438,Check in was delayed due an issue accessing it  Took about     mins but was promptly resolved when they were able to  There was some miscommunication with a maintenance man and the company so we    females staying by ourselves and in town for continuing education  were woken up at       with a man in our bathroom without any notification prior  The man and company were very apologetic but it didn t make us feel comfortable to stay another night or make up for the lost sleep 
759592121,Pros      The pictures were accurate      The house was clean and the bed linens were very comfortable    Cons     Check in is a HASSLE  I was very frustrated trying to check in  Clear instructions are not given and the security guard is not always at the front desk      There is a Decibel reader in the apartment  We received    automated text messages saying we were being too loud and I also received a phone call from an actual person saying that the decibel meter was reading to loud  We had four people in the room who talk loud  we had  a normal indoor speaker to play music  Hello   this is my follow up message to the conversation   with Adalisa  about the lack of clear instructions on how to access the   th floor    I was given instructions to  use the key card to access the building door and access the elevators by the security desk        There are three entrances to this building  There is an entrance that can be accessed through the garage  Since the guest get the key from the garage it would be beneficial for the guest to be made aware that there is an entrance in the garage      There are    elevators in the lobby and all of them are  by the security desk   Now   the two elevators that can access the   th floor are  the closest to the security desk   The elevators  are labeled with a sign  that says  elevators to the Sky on Main  and two arrows pointing at each elevator  In order to call the elevator   the guest must place the key card on the black key reader outside of the elevator  While in the elevator  the guest must touch the Key Card to a scanner  then the guest will be able to press the button for the   th floor    The instructions given were vague and led to a lengthy and frustrating check in procedure 
767460207,Great view and overall was a great experience  There was an old towel left in the shower  Also  there was dog hair on the floor in the bedroom  Lastly  the plates were wet in the cabinet  Overall  I enjoyed my stay and it was great experience  The view was amazing and I would stay again with just a couple clean hiccups  Thank you all so much 
760819644,This place is not clean  not remodeled  No central air  no washer and dryer  The laundry room is DISGUSTING and everything was broken  Look at the hepa filters and vents    I DIDN T HAVE HOT WATER FOR TWO DAYS EITHER Do better
770085272,nice location  cool apt  nice place to walk  after they finally gave us a parkingpass it was pretty good    Kathy was reallly nice and solved the problem of our door lock not working  the apt was nice  we liked it lovely location 
762248552,This location was great for me but the parking is terrible  The lot is reserved for residents who pay for the spaces so you have to find parking typically off street and be sure to follow signs so your vehicle isn t towed which can be a bit stressful  There s a restaurant one the  st floor of the bldg which is cool I guess but really doesn t help make the parking situation any better  My key fob access wasn t accepted for some strange reason but I contacted them and they called back   assisted me in a timely manner  My room wasn t as clean as it should have been  I addressed this   received a follow up call in which the cleaners were suppose to come do a touch up and correct some things but they never showed so I had to call back   cancel that after waiting a few hours so I could move forward with my day  The people who live in the bldg are sweet  everyone I encountered was so nice   helpful  The bed was super comfy  I was a bit disappointed about some things especially since someone I know who s used them multiple times before stated how good they are but all in all it was an ok stay   I would give them another try when traveling  You may want to consider having a back up clean service or possibly replacing the one you have  I addressed my concerns  they were noted   the cleaners were suppose to show within   mins of my conversation with Marty on       The cleaners never showed to touch up the place   after placing my day on hold   waiting a few hours I had to call Marty back to cancel them so that I could move forward with my day 
386143161320305147,The place was in the perfect location and beautiful  The only issue we had was the cleanliness  The couch had crumbs on it and was dirty and the floors were very sticky and unswept when we arrived  The cleanliness of the place was sub par at best  The couch had crumbs on it the floors were sticky and unswept 
540586570868448669,The apartment has everything you need  Zencity  did something out of the ordinary and agreed to help pack up the rest of my stuff to FedEx back to me since I left early with some of my belongings there  However  I am really disappointed that I did not receive some really valuable items sent back to me  I was very clear with all the items I had left in the apartment and I received everything else  but two things    it s again disappointing that they did not follow through on what was agreed upon  I am still grateful that I got most of my stuff back though  The apartment is really nice  FYI  it s on a busy street during the daytime  but you don t hear any noise in the apartment  I had some items not delivered back to me such as my Red Light box as well as some brand new makeup I bought at Sephora  I am really disappointed that I did not receive all my belongings back to me  It s interesting that I received all my other items except for those two expensive things 
761660240,Check in took    minutes keys not available as indicated   Apartment was not worth the amount charged  Check in took    minutes   Concrete floors looked cheap  Neighbors complained about noise was using hair dryer at       am  Next night neighbor came in at      with lots of noise 
542091736187266337,Our first disappointment with a vacation rental  I really hope you address the safety issues with the electrical and gas in this unit  We tried several times to reach out  leaving a phone number  before receiving a    minute window to respond with no verbal acknowledgement of our concerns 
762593212,I can t say that I was at all impressed with this stay for a handful of reasons   The location is undesirable  the area feeling unsafe and sketchy and smelling bad  The neighbors are extremely loud  dogs barking  people yelling and stomping in the halls  loitering outside  we literally saw a man and woman aggressively shoving each other and verbally fighting in the street outside of the building our first night  This was at all hours of the day and night   The apartment itself was not that clean or well kept  it was dingy  there were blinds broken  bed was uncomfortable  space was small  wires from the WiFi router were messy covering the floor next to the right side of the bed where I slept to a point where I couldn t step there without stepping on wires  The only great thing about that apartment was coming into the air conditioning that worked very well after a hot day out   On top of all of that the parking situation is a nightmare  No clear instructions and super hard to find  had to figure it out ourselves and when we reached out to Zencity for help the response was not timely  You re given one spot far away in a parking garage with a parking pass  but the pass that was given to us had the incorrect number on it  so when we went to park someone else was in the spot we were supposed to be in  When finally gotten back to I was told to just park in another place that the former pass supposedly covered with a different number  but the whole time I was afraid of being towed  I told them of that fear and got no response back until my check out time when they asked me to leave a good review and didn t even address my last message   All that being said  the few things that were decent were  close driving distance to everything  when I did get a response they were kind  my car didn t end up getting towed  and nothing bad happened to me   It served its purpose  but honestly this would not be a stay for me again  Not my first  second  or even third choice 
470962802611420868,The trip was good  the area was decent  but not having access to the thermostat  and it being an issue the   days we were there with it being    degrees in the apartment and no outcome  the likeliness of us coming to this site again is slim to none The stay was decent  the area was alright  but there was an issue with being able to use the thermostat  and due to acclimation preferences  we were a little unhappy  We understand that the thermostats are eco  but it was a simple code to unlock it   it became the whole   days that we were there that our apartment was stuck between      
765067717,This Airbnb was in a fun and accessible neighborhood for us  However  the apartment is directly above some late night bars  so it s rather loud and rambunctious at night  and we had to cut through the crowd and line to enter the apartment  Definitely recommend bringing ear plugs 
762319721,This is a studio run by a company  It is set up like a hotel   it is not what I consider and actual air bnb  response times are nonexistent  There is no one to actually contact since this is a company taking up housing from others to use it as vacation rentals  I would never stay at another Zencity place  This was not a home away from home as I couldnt have guests  The entrance light doesnt work  the outlet by the window in the living room doesnt work  and all the lights are really dim  The place smelled like Chinese food the whole time  Cant open windows for fresh air  no extra blankets for chillin on the couch   I had difficulty getting to to building  seeing as how the instructions dont say to push send or talk after speaking the number code  I tried calling multiple times and received no answer other than a message    minutes later  You are trying to run a hotel business from out of state   This is not the point of air bnb  Im better off staying at an actual hotel with concierge service  I dont feel I got the value I was looking for  I feel pretty ripped off 
761783387,location was perfect  central to everything and safe  parking was nice but tight and low we have a full size truck    The biggest issue was the ac broke and we couldnt get it fixed  The location was clean  but a but sterile like a hotel  loved being in the middle of the city though  the ac was broken while we visited  we tried to communicate  this  but still didnt get it fixed during our stay  we were told to open the windows but it was over    degrees outside  the only solution was to leave the front door open  to get ac from the hallway  there were several other small things that needed fixed or repaired 
767779518,Not bad but poor emergency plans
763057038,I was unable to access the unit because the key code that was given to me didn t work the keypad was missing numbers   symbols so I couldn t gain access   The front deskman was very rude and invasive and even followed me up to the unit and quizzed me for several minutes  treating me as if i didnt belong   I will give Zen City this  they did answer me promptly after I had to call the number though   i was not giving a resolution and was left without accommodations for the night   I was told I get a call back within    minutes after waiting an hour after speaking I was told I d get a call back within    minutes after waiting an hour after speaking to someone from the hosts office and I didn t hear back anything until     the next morning   mind you I was depending on that stay for my accommodations so I guess they didn t care whether I had a place to stay or not since I didn t hear from them throughout the night  I m not sure who dropped the ball when the ball was dropped or how the ball was dropped but it was dropped so someone needs to contact me ASAP to get this rectified or do I need to call Airbnb directly I don t know please advise
547024481672615696,INFESTED WITH RATS Rat infestation  unsafe conditions 
387172622741459593,This booking was a terrible experience but I ll try to be as objective as possible  The pros are that the location is perfect  The place was quiet and mostly clean except that the clean person missed some hair in the tub and a dirty wash cloth that fell from the shower curtain when I closed it    When we arrived the intercom system would not allow us access to the building  A resident finally came by and let us in  A fob was supposed to be provided to allow access to and from the building but there was no fob  Similar issues have been reported by other guests that were staying when we were  My first customer service response was a text message that told me to read the check in instructions  Then  someone called me and condescendingly just read the check in instructions to me  Several hours later someone responded that there was an extra fob In a lock box in the foyer  The lock box was empty  I was stuck there the first night because I wouldn t have been able to come and go    I had to leave the next day and left another message reminding them I didn t have access to the building  When I returned I had to wait several hours outside until another building resident was kind enough to let me in  When I finally got in the place looked like it had been completely torn apart  All the linens and towels were gone  the bed frame was apart  the head board was off the wall the mattress was standing up against the wall  I called zen city about this and they assured me no one had been inside the apartment  After sending pics  I was informed that someone came to spray pesticides for some unknown reason   I had to fight them to get a refund at all and it left having to book something twice the price    I contacted air bnb and they said they couldn t help because it was more than    hours since the check in time  I m extremely disappointed with zen city and air bnb    I ve learned my lesson about booking spaces with out of state management companies  They just aren t equipped to deal with problems that pop up    If you have any trouble checking in immediately ask for a refund or contact air bnb don t give them the opportunity to waste your time and pass that    hour clock
770006289,The location of the apartment is great  close to a park and the museums and many restaurants  and the check in was smooth due the friendly and helpful front desk staff of the apartment building  However the apartment itself is terribly maintained and not ready for guests  On the surface the appliances and furnitures are not new  but the basics things are not working  The handle on the bathroom door was loose and I was locked in the bathroom  It took my wife more than an hour and considerable ingenuity to free me  The faucet handle for shower was also very loose and wobbly  Before renting it out  the owners do need to do their homework and properly maintain the apartment  The way the apartment is falling apart makes the apartment hard to recommend  I was locked in the bathroom due to a malfuctioning door handle  and the faucet handle for shower is loose and wobbly  Please improve the apartment before renting it out 
770725608,I would not recommend this place

472467495507566314,DO NOT RENT     Very dirty and in disrepair  Listing shows rooftop  but at check in we were informed that the rooftop was not available to renters  The rooftop was the only reason we rented this apartment  Zencity  the rental company  utterly ignored my complaints about the state of the apartment  Also  location is not   minutes from Wicker  Neighbor s  on floor above got up around   am every morning  there appears to be no insulation between floors  Very unpleasant experience  I am copying here the message I sent you on the day i checked in  I never received a response from you    Oct          Select to open user profile for Elfe Elfe     PM Hello  Im deeply displeased with this rental  The place is filthy and in disrepair  The ensuite bathroom had hair all over the bathroom floor  I clean it   the shower is full of mildew and disgusting  The mattress cover in the en suite bedroom has blood stains on it  The two kitchen rugs  one in front of the bar  the other in the kitchen  are very dirty and old  The pillows in the ensuite bedroom are a joke  Furthermore  your advertisement of this rental is very misleading  It shows the roof top seating and it is the main reason we chose this rental  When I received the check in info  there was confusing language about using the roof top  I was subsequently told that we are not supposed to use the roof top  How could this be  I trust you will be able to fix all of these issues tomorrow         You can reach me at              if you need to discuss  I expect you to have a cleaner here tomorrow morning to do a thorough clean  and I expect a deep discount   I would like to add additional shortcomings problems     The ensuite bedroom  which I used  had a plastic mattress protector and no other mattress cover     The sheets on both beds where old and thin and tired    The kitchen was ill equipped  There was no coffee maker  can be bought for       except a French press which was broken  It was impossible to keep the coffee grounds separated from the coffee    There were two cutting boards in the cabinet  they were absolutely filthy  they even had large food particles sticking to them  I ran them through the d w several times and left them there  Hopefully theyre a little cleaner now    There were no tea spoons  The forks were cheap and of inferior quality    There was just one utility knife    The shades in the ensuite bedroom had numerous slats missing    The shades in the living room could only be partially raised and were crooked and ugly    The two stools at the kitchen bar were so wobbly  we couldnt sit on them    This is a   BR apartment  yet there was just one shabby   seater couch   It looks like this apartment was nice enough when it was first provisioned  but its clear that there has been no upkeep and that the clean crew does an extremely shoddy job  There was a little card saying   This apartment was last clean on            by              There was no info on that card   The apartment is significantly farther than   minutes from Wicker  another incident of false advertising    We paid       night for this very unpleasant experience  Ive never stayed in such a filthy place  and your staff totally ignored my communication  only to send me check out instructions today    I would like you to refund me at least     of the rental fee  I cannot imagine renting another place from Zencity 
763810327,Would only reccomend if you know that this place has the bare minimums but is in a KEY location  Apartment was so dirty  We had issues with the air conditioner which was never fixed  If the apartment was not in a KEY location  I would rate it even worse  All it needs is a deep clean  Communication was sometimes incredible and other times awful  I disliked that I had to speak to a different person each time  
763469307,The location is very nice  The apartment was NO ZEN   the smoke detector battery beeped EVERY NIGHT for  weeks  Finally the battery died  The company stopped answering my emails and calls  and said  don t worry we have our top team working on in    It wasn t complex   I needed a    foot ladder to change the battery   The manager for the building wouldn t answer my requests and airB B actually sent me texts telling me to stop making noise   This was a work assignment at a hospital   I was forced to move the mattress to the floor in the living room   only feet away from the bedroom  but with the kitchen exhaust fan I slept some   The shower has ZERO water pressure  seriously around   inches and warm but not hot   The Only plus was the neighborhood   I give both Zencity and AirB B a big fat F  my simple request was never met   I spent close to          and got a      refund  SHAME on you AirB B  for allowing this company to rip off a nurse at a hospital  Shame on you Zencity for your lies and complete ineptitude     So heads up if you have a problem with your space from the many places this company owns   you will not be helped by them or AirB B   Your response to my Valid and HUGE request was pitiful and completely unnecessary  The simple request to stop a smoke detector from beeping  but I had to wait until the battery actually died in two weeks    I was forced to move the mattress to the floor in the living room    and all you did was give me      off  I should have received   weeks free  The water pressure in the shower was ZERO   I decided your actual offices must be in China or somewhere  as your email responses were grammar wise inaccurate  I give your company a complete F  a FAIL for response and sincerity 
764560063,Sorry but  I had a terrible experience here Worst place ever  Never l stay here 
386189057133434982,I was unable to access the apartment so contacted Zencity from the lockbox area   They had a back up key but chose that moment to ask if the apartment had been clean   the person on the phone admitted that they KNEW the clean team had been unable to clean   They did not call to inform me that I would be walking into a place with dirty bed   bath lines  trash in the trash cans and dirty dishes   They suggested I clean and change the dirty bed linens with spares in the apartment   I was told the place would be clean by       the next morning  I booked a hotel for the night   Next day  again  not clean with no answer as to when it would be clean   Then they had the audacity to argue about a full refund as I had to book a hotel due to their inefficiency  Once I notified and spoke with Airbnb  I was refunded but only after   days and countless emails   Zencity should have contacted me beforehand as they knew the place was dirty     all in all the worst experience with a host  If you know you will not have a clean apartment unit  call the customer in advance   You knew the clean staff was unable to service the apartment   Secondly  if you have a service failure  which you did  for two days in your inability to clean the unit  dont make your  very upset customer have to spend time asking for a refund   I only received a positive result after contacting Airbnb to tell them about the abysmal service    Such a poor experience with Zencity   Never again 
387605131912377520,Had a very bad experience with check in   I had to wait for a long standing n street in sun during a hot and humid day just because the building entrance code provided to me was wrong   after check in there were some issues of cleaniness  Bathroom was dirty  there were some stains on sofas and carpet  wifi signal are very weak in bedroom and wifi was slow   I liked the location of central west end so this place is located at a very nice spot 
385518577496299567,Space is large and location is great   VERY disappointed with the following    CONSTANT harassment over noise level when we were not breaking any of the rules  number of occupants  quiet time    Misrepresentation of capacity  listed as   but there are only beds for     Beds are old and super uncomfortable   Place was not thoroughly clean  sticky floors  visibly dirty bathrooms    Kitchen is barely stocked with the basics for cooking Location was great and the space was large and open  as advertised   VERY disappointed with the following    CONSTANT harassment over noise level when we were not breaking any of the rules  number of occupants  quiet time    Misrepresentation of capacity   you list it as   but there are only beds for     Beds are old and super uncomfortable   Place was not thoroughly clean  sticky floors  visibly dirty bathrooms    Kitchen is barely stocked with the basics for cooking
386139556333021646,Place looks like photos but not clean  Bring clean supplies  Place also had an odor that would not go away after I clean  Place needs to be clean properly before allowing someone to stay there  There is an odor  Carpet and flooring where not clean  Counter tops  and appliances not clean  No supplies were available and I feel I was charged to much  There was not a day I wanted to stay just to relax as this was a trip for me to relax  I only slept because  was uncomfortable  Bed should be higher  Everything is so small and close to the floor  I recommend having toilet paper and paper towels for guest to use as part of their stay  That was a lot of money to hand over for a place that was not comfortable 
764845429,We were very disappointed in our stay at this residence  When we arrived  the floors were so dirty and there were visible clumps of dirt and hair balls all over  The bottom of my daughters feet were black after walking on the floors for    minutes  The couch is covered in stains and has springs popping through the cushions  There was hair from the previous renter in the bath tub  The windows are paper thin and we could hear every noise on the street outside all night long  We barely slept for the   days we were there  I would not recommend this place to anyone  We were very disappointed in our stay at this residence  When we arrived  the floors were so dirty and there were visible clumps of dirt and hair balls all over  The couch is covered in stains and has springs popping through the cushions  The soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken  The temperature in the unit was    degrees when we arrived and we were freezing cold  There was hair from the previous renter in the bath tub  It was a terrible stay and we were very unhappy that we spent almost      to stay here for   days 
388362533499747098,Not the best Airbnb   Experienced a c issues during the heat advisory during the past couple of days and wouldn t fix the issue
764904847,The check in was difficult  was not easy to communicate with 
387620570985885386,When reading this review  please note we are Airbnb hosts   As Airbnb hosts we were very dissatisfied with the cleanliness of the unit during a pandemic  the unit is in a beautiful building in a safe location however we didnt feel safe because of how dirty the unit was  there is a wall mounted air conditioning filter in the living room  it was so disgustingly dirty that the dirt came out   in from the filter  it doesnt look like its been changed in more than a year  the carpets were disgustingly dirty the tables were stained and looked extremely dirty  we went to go buy our own Clorox wipes just to sanitize the unit  the light in the bathroom did not work  The bed was very comfortable  the linens were clean  however because of the air conditioning filter and the flat white paint the unit looked very dirty because of the amount of dust and grime on the walls and the baseboards    even though we stayed there for   days they only left each one of us one towel and only one washcloth for us to share  there were no bathroom soap amenities    The kitchen was bare bones     This could be a beautiful place to stay if it was clean   maintained properly   The   am sunrise on the lake was most beautiful  From one Airbnb host to another we were very disappointed about the lack of sanitation in your unit during a pandemic   The air conditioning filter was disgusting   It looks like it had not been clean in over a year   The lights didnt work in the bathroom   The carpet was disgustingly dirty   We didnt feel safe to stay there because of germs   We went to buy Clorox wipes to sanitize the unit 
387614374363750000,Cool location  The apartment looked nice but i really hated the Nats  and the rug sofa have seen better days  Felt icky sitting on them  The shower in the basement sprayed water on the ceiling calling more Nats  Place has potential just needs minor repairs 
766803295,Cat hair everywhere  Allergic reaction and they didn t give me my money back Cat hair everywhere
404360243598489499,Horrible walked in and had water damage on the wall next to fridge  Found a dirty towel behind the bathroom door someone dirt old sock behind the curtains Hello    Also when I entered I saw mold on the wall witch is do to water damage where the paint was coming off the wall  Witch maintenance saw  Also found a dirt towel on the floor behind the door a sock under the curtains in the bedroom you could also tell the blanket was not washed because we found strands of hair in the bed  then the toilet backed up  So the stains on the towels just wash with bleach and soap and it comes right out maybe a lil bit of baking soda  Gets  the stains right out  So for you to complain about towels being stained is ridiculous and you need to do some maintenance to your apartment before renting 
387682498107878308,If you are looking for location then this is your place    if you are looking for cleanliness  especially during COVID  then I would avoid this location at all costs   I had a few other smaller issues with regards to initial communication and at check in the door code was not correct  but in comparison to the place being so dirty that I had to clean myself those were trivial   Upon arrival when I walked in I noticed crumbs on the floors and the counters   as I was on the phone with someone from ZenCity because I was unable to get into the unit initially I mentioned that I was seeing some dirty issues   their comment was something like    we only vacuum every few weeks so maybe this unit is due for a vacuum  I was floored   I then proceeded to walk around only to find more things that were just plain dirty   I ended up clean the unit myself   the paper towel that I used to wipe the small section of the kitchen floor initially with just water was BLACK   After looking for some clean supplies I came upon a broom that had about   inches of hair and dirt hanging off of it  a mop and bucket of which the mop was so dirty  it was originally white and now was brownish  and the bucket containing dirt  along with a floor duster that had not been washed in what appeared to be ever      There was also a half an inch of dust under the bed and console etc   I called and sent pictures and they offered to send the people back to clean  of which I declined given what I had already seen   instead I asked for a refund of some sort  especially on the clean fee   which I thought was extremely fair   They declined any refund other than half of the clean fee and gave me an hour extra for a late check out for the hassle that I had checking in  this I did not request    I have never written a bad review of an AirBnB  but this experience definitely warrants people knowing what they are in for  especially if you are looking for a clean space to lay your head There were several issues that I had with this property   one was the lack of communication initially    they wrong code was provided on check in and I was not able to get into the unit and had to call    the place was FILTHY and I had to clean myself and was only refunded half of the clean fee   this is my mind was unacceptable
764935512,As much as I try to write positive reviews  I am unable to do so for this listing  Although this is a great location and the building overall is nice  there were three major negative factors   The whole apartment smelled of cigarettes  I recognize this is mostly out of control of the host since it is due to bad behavior of a previous visitor  but this ruined our stay   The check in process did not work  Thankfully another Airbnb guest in the building recognized our situation having gone through it a few days before  if they weren t there  I m not sure we would have been able to get into the apartment  There was no washer   dryer in the unit despite that being in the listing  There is a hook up for one in the massive walk in closet but none was present
382509789964240265,The location is great  close to shops  restaurants and parks  but the place could use a little deeper clean  Thank you 
522486170101007437,I am very disappointed that the Zencity management does NOT maintain their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   Its deceptive selling  and its personally disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my second encounter with a Zencity apartment and you continue to disappoint your guests   The lack of proactive communication and response is aggravating and is a major business downside    As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together   I am very disappointed that the Zencity management does NOT maintain their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   Its deceptive selling  and its personally disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my second encounter with a Zencity apartment and you continue to disappoint your guests   The lack of proactive communication and response is aggravating and is a major business downside    As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together  
401417146375677198,Great location  However only one bedroom has AC which makes it a bit uncomfortable on summer nights  The AC in the living room is also underpowered   Need to make sure that basics like shampoo and soap are available in the apartment  Also the statement about AC is not fully accurate  One of the bedrooms does not have AC  It is a bit of a misrepresentation  The main door knob is difficult to use 
770610945,Location was very convenient to the WashU Medical campus and Forest Park   It was cheaper than the hotels in the area  but there rug clearly hadn t been vacuumed prior to my stay  just in the living room  rest of the floor is linoleum tile  and I noticed a little black mold where the countertop of the sink was coming detached from the vanity beneath   I mentioned this to the host and hopefully they ll correct it   Otherwise the space was very nice and I hate leaving a negative review but I know mold can really be a health issue for some folks so if that is true for you I would recommend verifying with the host that they have indeed addressed it  Prior to booking I hadn t reviewed this place as thoroughly as I usually do because I ve had such great Airbnb experiences   This one seems to be a company managing multiple places and it was lacking in some of the little things other Airbnb places I ve stayed at have  like coffee tea basic spices   Also unless you check with the host about whether they ve added a some sort of water filter to the unit perhaps bring your own  the tap water tastes terrible  Hi there  I already made these comments in a message  but will repeat here as I really hope you address them for future guests  The only complaint I have is cleanliness   The rug clearly had not been vacuumed prior to my stay   The area around the lamp next to the couch also wasn t very clean  which is less of an issue since that s not an area I would walk in  but I would recommend a thoroughly sweep mop of that area and under the couch   Also the counter top of the sink is partially detached and there is some black mold underneath  which can be a health issue for some people   I would also recommend a water filter in the suite as the tap water tastes pretty bad   Coffee tea would be a nice touch   Otherwise it is a nice space   Thank you 
400010400197507865,Had a terrible experience after my friends and I could not enter the property since the door was jammed  I tried calling the host s immediate assistance helpline several times but got no response  After several hours and waiting outside the bnb at   am in the night  I received a call back for the assistance I requested  A maintenance person needed to be sent out to check the door lock  Since it was already really late in the night and we had plans for the following day  we were forced to take a hotel room for  x the price it would normally cost  The next day I had to follow up with the host again to find out if the door had been fixed and they seemed clueless about my issue  We were finally able to get in the next day and complete the rest of our reservation  I am still working on getting my refund for the money I paid for the hotel rooms and uber   Location      Good neighborhood  clean spaces  Property       Shower curtains have black mold Bathroom door does not have a lock
767783585,Unfortunately  I had a comedy of errors during my    day stay at Zencity s   bdrm apartment on Milwaukee in May       The net net    the apartment is not set up for a    day stay  and here is feedback   THINGS THAT CAN NOT BE HELPED  The apartment is on a very noisy street with the very loud BLUE LINE train going by every X minutes  This made it very difficult to sleep and work from the apartment  The building is old   there are smelly pipes  old HVAC  and   flights of steep stairs to walk up   THINGS THAT CAN BE HELPED  Zencity s communication and air tight cancellation policy  esp for long term stays  The company has multiple people assigned to the account that do not communicate with each other  Most of the time  issues were handled in a timely manner  eg code on door to apartment did not work  but it would be resolved in a matter of minutes   But many times  communication just totally broke down  WiFi went out for   days during my stay  I had to tether from mobile   Each person I spoke to on Airbnb app just requested I re boot the router  When I frustratingly demanded they call the internet provided and stop asking to complete the same task  and when someone from internet company finally came to the building  they discovered the internet cable to apartment had been cut  and the provider was able to restore WIFI  but it took   days   When I requested some dirty and mismatched kitchen appliances be replaced  I only had   mismatched forks for a    day stay  and one was a cocktail fork   it was never addressed  When I requested a mid stay clean refresh  the clean team never came and then arrived TWICE at random times that were not agreed upon  These miscommunications came from the Zencity office  The AC and heating is complete out of wack  too cold during cold nights  too cold during hot nights  and I sadly ended up with a sinus infection  The apartment is top floor   th floor   of an old building  and that was not communicated until approximately    hours before   when I was already packed with   large bags and on my way to Chicago  It was extremely difficult to plan to get bags up stairs by myself and into the flat upon arrival  In early days of stay  I think the first day   I asked ZENCITY to find me another place to stay because I knew I could not stay there for    days with all the noise from train and street traffic on Milwaukee  though they manage multiple apartments in Chicago  they never got back to me about that inquiry   THINGS THAT ARE GOOD  The apartment is cool and in a fun central location  and could be fun for a weekend stay if noise is no issue  eg you don t need much sleep or to work on ZOOM   Hello Zencity Please contact me directly to have a debrief of the many things that went wrong during my stay   all which were disclosed and in some cases not addressed during my    day stay
403628693083576361,Zen city is the worst  Don recommend them  Filthy apartments and horrible customer service Apartments are super dirty  I stay with you guys allot and your clean ladies which are employed by you do a half fast job that is not worth what you charge for clean fees  Also there is no pool please don t mislead people
765987816,We had a miserable check in process because the so called  welcome kit  had apparently been misplaced   Zincity did not have a substitute  kit  available nor did they send an agent with a second kit   They just kept telling us that the  kit  was at the front desk  but never offered any real help   Fortunately  the  kit    the card key to exterior doors   a remote to operate the garage gate   was finally found by the doorman   But Zincity should have been responsible   actively helped us   The apartment lacked in many key ways   In the living room  there was only a small sofa with dirty pillows on it   a single pole lamp in the corner for lighting   No comfortable sitting chair   The living room rug was stained   The kitchen  also dimly lit  lacked so much as a  tea towel  potholder or even a salt shaker   the ice trays had been filled   The beds were comfortable but likely were doubles  not queens as advertised   While the apartment was spacious  it was very sterile  not a welcoming place to stay  esp  in comparison to the many other Airbnbs weve stayed in over the years    Hopefully  Zincity will respond to cure these defects in its service and property  Check in was the worst process weve encountered in all our years of using Airbnb   The  welcome kit  wasnt at the front desk as it was supposed to be    Multiple emails that I sent to Zincity met with the same response  the  welcome kit  was left at the front desk   But it plainly was missing   the responsibility for this failure   for correcting it was on Zincity   Instead  calls by me to Zencity  Customer Service  were unanswered by a human    I did receive one phone call from a Santa Barbara  CA exchange but there was nothing from an identified  Zincity office or agent     There was no offer by a Zincity agent rep to come with a second  kit     The  welcome kit  was no more than a card key   remote for access to the building   garage   There should have been a contingency plan   like a spare  welcome kit  when the first  kit  is missing or a Zincity agent should have brought us a second   We   the paying guests   should not have lost   an hour of very stressful time until the  welcome kit  was finally found      Then  the apartment was incredibly sterile   ill equipped    The living room did not have any lights except for a single pole lamp in a corner  and the only seating was a small sofa with two gross  dirty pillows on it   The living room rug was stained and dirty      The dim overhead lighting in the kitchen didn t adequately light that area   There were no tea towels  potholders  not even a salt shaker   Only ice cube trays in the freezer  which were filled   I had to rearrange lightbulbs to better light some areas   There was only one spare lightbulb   three burned out ones   I moved a pole lamp from a bedroom to the living room for more light   Shelves in the the entry hall lacked any books or other decoration   the walls throughout were nearly blank   There were no instructions on trash disposal  check out procedures or even how to gain entry to the garage from the building at the  th floor  the doorman showed this to me   My husband   I make frequent trips to St  Louis   The apartment is spacious   well located for proximity to our sons house   entrances to from I     but well not stay in Zincity properties given our check in experience   the poor service   maintenance of the property itself 
388325368110358058,Honest review here  The place was dirty  It has a weird smell  Found bugs in the bathroom  Carpets were very dirty  Good location but I must say the smell was a big turn off  It felt really dirty just to be there  Decided to leave after an hour of check in and did not go back at all  Hopefully hosts see this  Honest review here  The place was dirty  It has a weird smell  Found bugs in the bathroom  Carpets were very dirty  Good location but I must say the smell was a big turn off  It felt really dirty just to be there  Decided to leave after an hour of check in and did not go back at all  Hopefully hosts see this 
766251863,This place is a good value   low price in a great location  But our concerns were pretty big    the step by step instructions for getting in were immediately defunct as the main entrance was blocked by construction that cant have begun very recently   Thus our impression that the management is not around   So we had to find our way in through the back   via a space used to relieve dogs  scatter alcohol containers  smoke etc    and then up non ADA accessible rickety back stairs    Then theres the fellow sleeping in   and likely living in   the lobby  Guess what   the code to get that far has been the same forever  you can tell by the numbers rubbed off the key pad  and non residents seem to have it  He didnt cause any trouble but thats still alarming    The code to the apartment itself seems to change with each guest and the space felt secure and was quiet   once we had calmed down from our original alarm  So it is a place one can stay in if youre willing to take the trade offs    The photos of the place are all legit but manage to convey the place as nicer than it feels upon actual arrival  The renovations are even humorously slap dash  Recent  re glazing  of one bathtub being some goopy painted on substance that someone stepped in while wet and tracked onto the floors  Doorknob missing from bedroom door  etc  These were our experiences and responses as a couple with two children in tow  If Id been in my   s with some  friends in town for fun Id have said it still beats hotels any day  But for us this was a booking we mostly regretted 
767395883,Bottom line  if I had to pay the same amount to stay at this Airbnb  or another one run by Zencity  I wouldve just stayed at a hotel instead   The price was pretty close to some decent hotels downtown  but I wanted to check out Pilsen  so we went with this place   the pictures looked nice   The root cause of our issues was that the property is run by a conglomerate  who probably isnt local  and probably doesnt care if they get a few bad reviews   The good  location didnt seem unsafe to me  it was in good proximity to restaurants  we only parked   times but we were able to find street spaces within    ft and the unit was reasonably sized   As one reviewer mentioned  the AC unit is somewhat loud but it worked well and it was around    degrees outside all weekend   The bad in order     Bugs   there were tons of gnats or gnat like bugs all over the unit  but particularly in the bathrooms   What was weird was that the number varied throughout the stay   Sometimes it was unbearable  one person wanted to shower in the downstairs bathroom but was too grossed out and ended up showering upstairs    Sometimes it was just an annoyance   Either way  gross     Check in   we followed the check in instructions  but the key in the lock box did not work on any of the doors to get into the building   Messaging was useless  the first guy said hed look into it but never got back to me   Messaged again    minutes later and got a new person and had to explain the whole situation again   Meanwhile  we tried calling and when you follow the appropriate prompts for check in issues  the call just dropped   times   Finally  on the  th attempt  our call went through but was put on hold for    minutes   Once we got somebody on the phone  we were able to run through the other lock boxes to get another building key  which worked   Luckily there was another available key  otherwise Im not sure how long it would have taken us to get into the unit in the    degree weather with all of our luggage     Cleanliness  while it appeared that they followed the Airbnb  enhanced clean  steps  it seemed like they half clean everything else   The floors were dirty  the bathrooms were just ok and the bedrooms were just ok   Certainly nowhere close to spotless  which is the experience I normally have with well run Airbnbs      Wine glasses  there were   of them and   of them were cracked   I wouldve been fine with plastic ones  but not cracked glass ones     Dogs  there was quite a bit of barking from the neighbors dogs   Im a dog person so it didnt bother me that much  but it was frequent enough that I noticed     TV  didnt really use it at all but I couldnt figure out how to control the fire stick with the remote provided   No other TV options available unless you had your own device to connect to a HDMI cable 
766239058,Place was great  Had   issues  Code did not work to get in  Took about an hour on the phone before they could get it to work  Listing said there was free street parking  There was not  It was all meter  Chose this place because we had   vehicles and the free parking was important  Eventually got refunded for the paid parking from AirBNB as a courtesy since the listing was not accurate 
765975972,Perfect location and a decent space with very friendly staff at the reception desk  Great view  However  the room smelled like cigarette smoke and made the stay pretty unpleasant  I hope they can figure it out and get rid of it before the next person stays 
764310429,If you book this  make sure you read plenty of the reviews  and ask questions about the entry problems beforehand  First negative experience I have had with an airbnb and it was miserable  The key code that we were provided to get into the building did not work and my wife and I were stranded outside in the middle of the night trying to get a hold of someone from ZenCity with no success  When we finally got an answer from Zencity  the person we talked to was unable to help us  After   hours of trying   we finally ended up booking a hotel room which was overpriced and scarce due to the holiday weekend  The next day we were finally able to reach someone with zencity support who told us that we would be buzzed in when we arrived back to the building   When we arrived back at the building we called zencity to have a manager buzz us in  but they couldnt get ahold of the manager  After a bit a passing resident finally let us in  The unit was a good place to stay once we were finally in  and the location was very nice  but this was a terrible first night experience for us  We are already unhappy that the person we spoke with said we would not be reimbursed for the full expense of the emergency   am hotel option we had to go with  but we were told that at least some of what we paid would be coming back to us for the check in instructions stranding us and this still has not happened  We know this is not our error on the building entry  as there are tons of reviews having the same problem  Please do something to try and make this right  We have made airbnb aware of our issues as well and are waiting to hear back from support 
397726751047119737,The location couldn t have been more perfect but the apartment wasn t clean very thoroughly  The toilet seat was left dirty along with the silverware  There also isn t a wifi connection so a Xfinity hotspot is provided but doesn t work a majority of the time  Hey you guys   it s really hard for me to write a message like this but there were some things that were just not clean  Under the toilet seat there were still urine stains and the silverware was dusty and there were still crumbs in the drawer  I normally understand some things being dusty but items that are considered essential it s just not okay  I hope that you can pass this feedback on to housekeeping for future reservations   
766328704,I cancelled my reservation after finding a broken door lock and being forced to wait in a parking garage for an hour after being given a fake parking pass for an occupied parking spot  Also neighbors outside this place fighting on the street did not make it feel safe 
387587833811419398,This unit was okay but not as nice as the other unit we have stayed with this company  The coffee maker was missing when we arrived and not replaced during the stay  The garbage can was not clean and had mold growing in it that need to be deodorized  The company was responsive to our needs when the front door lock was inoperable but could have been more responsive to the other issues  The trash can smell in the unit was unbearable for most of the stay  I had asked for this to be corrected and nothing was done  Disappointed 
766633532,This was a great place with a very easy walk to the ball park    The check in process was awful and the instructions that were given were not how to check in or check out   Hopefully they will get this figured out for the next guest  The check in process was awful and the instructions that were given were not how to check in or check out  The AC was lock and not setup to where we could change the temp in the apartment 
386983789975678706,wifi did not work and they lied about all the amenities  She said they were open and when we got there it was all under construction 
766316192,The blinds in the apt were blinds were opaque blinds meant for living rooms or to accompany another blind that would actually block out sun  As the windows were huge it meant at night all the lights from city shone in and at crack of dawn sun came in  I did not sleep the time I stayed to the point I left early  Still trying to chase a refund  You didn t fix the blinds which made apt unlivable
417292930329437009,I haven t had a bad experience with Airbnb s except for this time  My husband and I booked a room with Zencity  at  am they messaged me the day we were supposed to arrive and they asked if we could change reservations to a different room in the building  We agreed because it was the same price and looked comparable in pictures  After arriving we were able to get keys but it was for the original room we booked  We were confused but went along with it and messaged them on the Airbnb app to see what to do  Not wanting to hold our bags in the lobby we just decided to go up to the room we had keys for  An hour went by and they messaged us saying you re booked for the other room  I hope that answers your questions    Needless to say it didn t lol  So we tried calling the number attached to the reservation confirmation and could only reach an automated phone line  They called us after an hour of trying to reach them and said you need to move to the other room  and we can try and help you figure out how to get the keys to the other room  This was such a hassle  We had plans and reservations so we didn t have time to troubleshoot their mistakes  After trying to reason with them on the phone  we finally just asked for a refund and said we wanted to leave because the room wasn t very clean  the street ally parking was so sketchy  the building itself smelled horrible of body odor and smoke    they refused to refund us because that would take  manager approval  and refused to get the manager    they finally just texted me after another hour went by and said just stay in the room we were in    needless to say  we will not be coming back or recommending this company Airbnb location to anyone in the future 
767335770,I would not recommend renting from Zincity at all  We stayed at a zincity owned Airbnb in St  Louis   The apartment was much larger than the photos led us to be and it s in a great spot in the city  Security there is also amazing so we were very excited   We noticed the AC wasn t working at all so it was very hot in the room  We contacted zincity through the Airbnb chat section  They spent the first day trying to get me to check the thermostat  like I didn t know how to work one   Long story short we stayed there for   nights and it was hot the entire time  They never fixed the AC  They would try to get me to fix it but I told them I m not a AC repair guy  They suggested I just open the windows  which are   stories up and did not have protective screens  I told them that was too dangerous with my young kids    They never offered to relocate us  even though I asked numerous times   they did bring up portable ACs but they worked like box fans  so they wouldn t cool any rooms down at all   they only offered us our clean fee back for compensation  and they promised a supervisor would contact us a few days ago and he never did  I explained to zincity that I was a disabled combat veteran with a wife and four kids and being in this heat would make my disabilities worsen and my kids and wife uncomfortable but zincity still didn t resolve the issue at all   I will not be renting from them ever again  I understand stuff happens  such as an AC breaking  but not resolving a problem and taking care of your customers should always be number one and we weren t number one that week  We stayed here   nights and we noticed the AC wasn t working  It was very hot in the room  I am a disabled combat veteran and if I get to hit them I can get very sick  I also have four children and a wife who were with me  who were also very uncomfortable   I notified y all of this that night and it was never fixed  It would take hours to hear back from y all on chat and at first it was just y all trying to make sure I had the air on properly  No attempts to move us or offer us a refund occurred and I didn t have the money to just leave and get a new place  so we had to stay in a hot apartment for   days  making the evenings of our vacation miserable   Finally I was told portable AC units would be brought up but what we eventually got did absolutely nothing to cool the rooms   Y all told me a supervisor would contact me a few days ago and no one did  I asked numerous times to be relocated and was either ignored or was told ok y all would and no one got back with me   Y all gave me the     clean fee back but that in no way compensates us for   days of misery in the rooms   I asked for half my money back to compensate us and no one has got back with us   On top of all that y all also had left books inside the room  probably for decoration  and one of em was filled with male and female pornographic imagery  I have no Idea why this would be left in an apartment that rents to families  My kids could have looked through it I d I didn t happen to first    This was an absolute awful way we were treated and we are still waiting to hear back from y all to see if your going to make it right 
390533540811727373,  The Airbnb and the building were both dirty  I have pictures of all of the unsanitary areas
766227803,Bring your own hair dryer  No amenities  coffee tea bags     A C unit in bedroom is full of black mold    Cannot block out   am sunshine without covering the A C unit  Plug ins on one side of bed are not functioning    I have traveled all over the US and Europe and have never had to leave a bad review on any Airbnb I ve rented  This is my first  Communication by texting was terrible on your end  only partial text came through   Airbnb was bare  no hair dryer  no coffee or tea bags  a semi functioning TV  Curtain in bedroom could not be drawn to block out   am sunshine  because it would block A C  Need to improve that with a blind on top  Ruined our sleep quality which we desperately needed    And as for the A C unit  covered in black mold  Shouldn t allow guests until it is professional clean 
765413579,Could of been clean Better for the clean fees we pay
766703222,Could be a lot better didn t like it Could be a lot better
390521202159061927,This property is OK  The location is great if you want to be in Hyde Park  which we did   The bedrooms are fine  There are   bedrooms  but the rest of the apartment does not reflect that fact  There is a very small dining table with only   chairs and the only other seating is a couch  The internet did not work  but the owners gave us a work around   There were few amenities    no soap in the bathroom we could find   In other words  it seems like the owners are trying to spend as little money as possible on this property   As such I feel it is overpriced for what we paid  Luckily there was someone leaving the building when we arrived so we could get in   the entrance code for the building did not work 
390505771951241898,the TV didnt work there  it keep saying network  disconnected  there were still broken glass in the door of the second bed room  there was so much build up around the tub Some of the electricity outlet didnt work The tub was stopped up to where we couldnt take a shower  we have to use the sink  the bed was comfortable  everything else was false advertisement  I appreciate it for you letting me and my family stay there but everything that was said about the place was completely wrong  the TV didnt work there  it keep saying network  disconnected  there were still broken glass in the door of the second bed room that my son got cut on and hes four  there was so much dirt and grim in the corners of the washroom  and around the tub  Some of the electricity outlet didnt work The tub was stopped up to where we couldnt take a shower  we have to use the sink  The only thing that was nice was the fact that it had a nice kitchen and the bed was comfortable everything else that you said was completely wrong  false advertisement 
765464898,The good   great location if you want to be close to streeterville gold coast   couldnt ask for better location overall   Check in and in out privileges were easy and had no issues with apartment access during the stay   There is a convenient starbucks downstairs and small market around the corner in addition to nearby pharmacy making this even a better location with easy access to amenities   The apartment was organized  good size  had comfortable furnishings  and location was quiet   Nice balcony with view of city      The bad  shower drain  mentioned in other reviews  drains extremely slow and you will be showering with feet full of undrained water  It looked like the small fan in the bathroom wall had years of dust collected in it and was not functioning properly   The faucet in the bathroom had a very weak stream making it difficult to wash hands   not great in the middle of a pandemic  There was no laundry soap  but empty container was there for it  for the washer   The lint tray in the dryer had not been clean in I would estimate       cycles and ugh   had to dispose of large glob of lint from unknown number of past guests   WAS CHARGED for damage I did not cause to a mirror which was not even shown to me in the original location it was located   if you are staying here  recommend to take pictures of everything before and after to avoid bogus claims      fix the drain in the bathroom shower    clean the fan in the bathroom   literally dust ball in there looked clogged    reconsider clean crew   the lint catcher in dryer must have had    loads of drying clothes lint in there and given bogus mirror damage charges           have faucet in bathroom checked   dripping faucet water with extremely slow stream made it hard to wash hands    make sure there is laundry detergent available if you are going to have a laundry room
391317404887668445,The furniture was broke and not well made there was no dinette table or chairs  The leg on the couch was broke therefore we could not use  the lounge chair was hard and very uncomfortable  you could feel the metal through the vinyl covering  and there was a strong fume of gas throughout the place the rod in the bathroom was missing  One of the chair was missing two screws  Lastly it was difficult to find parking  On a good note the service of staff and the location was excellent Also the room was very peaceful and spacious  The furniture was broke and  not well made there was no dinette table or chairs  The leg on the couch was broke therefore we could not use  the lounge chair was hard and very uncomfortable  you could feel the metal through the vinyl covering  and there was a strong fume of gas throughout the place the rod in the bathroom was missing  One of the chair was missing to screws  Lastly it was difficult to find parking  On a good note the service of staff and the location was excellent Also the room was very peaceful and spacious 
404989066751134084,Great location  Very quick and responsive host  Hi    Thank you for letting us stay in your home  We did want to let you know that your neighbors upstairs were very very very loud  You could hear everything through the ceiling  They were stomping around and making noises at all hours of the night   sounded like they were dropping weights on the floor 
386961280106804867,When we arrived  the front of the building was condemned and we has to use the back door  no problem  except the elevator was broken and we has to go up four flights of stairs to get to the room and back  However all of that wasnt even a dealbreaker if the room had been clean properly  We had even found hard used towels hanging over the shower curtain when we arrived  Mention the front being condemned and four flights of stairs with no elevator  also we had found the apartment semi dirty and found used dirty towels from previous renters still hanging over the shower curtain 
764443187,I wouldn t stay here again  There were a lot of problems   host s instructions for building entry were wrong  dishes were broken  no cooking utensils  inaccurate listing of kitchen appliances  thermostat broke halfway through  and host entered twice without advanced warning  The host is a company  not a person  so I was unable to get any help with these issues  Whenever I reached out  I kept getting corporate responses   thank you for your patience   The place was fine  but the host Zencity was terrible  I d book somewhere else 
429691110769649303,Great location in central west end   with a lively neighborhood to explore  The airbnb itself isn t the cleanliness place  it has all amenities and reflects the pictures advertised very well 
766329233,Pro s  close to downtown if you have a car  House looks more or less like pics  Private space in both floors   Cons  ac too loud  tv didn t work because the control had no battery  not enough basic stuff like coffee  not much light coming from the windows  bath hanger fell after one day  there where small flying bugs and two spiders in the lower floor  neighborhood is kind of sketchy at night  not the best place to walk alone   The apartment had wifi but it never worked  That was one of the worst things  My computer would connect to the line but no Internet whatsoever  Parking on the street is hard  we use an app  parking hero    and that work    Zencity Is a big company  so a new person answered me every time I needed to solve a problem  I had better experiences with Rbnbs managed by owner 
389837159041545639,Location is amazing  located in middle of downtown    Check in was easy  simple   There were many amenities in the Airbnb but no iron which I was disappointed in   The worst part of my stay is that the power was not working in half of the room during the second day  Which included the air conditioner  I spent the entire night and morning sweating profusely as it s summertime now    When I reached out  I was asked to go find breaker box in the basement  This may seem reasonable  accept the fact that this is an apartment building with    floors and it was      pm  So this was unacceptable  Fix whatever issue causes the air conditioner to stop working  It s summer and this makes for a very unpleasant stay 
391952251893043771,I ended up staying at a hotel  The entire building reeked of cigarette smoke  The unit has central air and a portable A C  but the bedroom was still absurdly hot  The hosts would not refund me for my stay  despite the fact that I didnt stay there  dirty any linens  etc 
386203118161487295,Unfortunately  I would not recommend this particular stay  The neighbors are sensitive to sound  While we were watching a movie  wasnt even that loud  we got a text from the host that they relieved a noise complaint   No toiletries are provided and the toilet paper is like Sandpaper  So if you book this stay  keep in mind you should bring your own   I definitely enjoyed the bed itself  It was VERY cozy  The place was clean    Overall  if I had known more about the place then what was listed by The Host I would not have booked this stay  It was not at all what we were anticipating for our vacation  I think it would be more appropriate to list it as more of a single person or business trip AirBnB  The Host themselves had great communication and were very kind  It might be nice to have a little note on the posting that the neighbors are a little sensitive to sound  Also we had a little difficulty getting in the front doors the first time around  The instructions were good but could be more detailed  It took us a few tries to get it  there also werent any toiletries and I think that should be noted in the posting as well  for the guests to bring their own  Most guests assume there will be toiletries provided  at minimum a body wash  One more thing  as an added bonus  you might consider spending just a little money on some toilet paper  My work doesnt spend a lot of money on our toilet paper and it was the same kind  The Sandpaper type  if Im going on vacation  I definitely dont want to wipe my derriere with the same toilet paper I use at a job that doesnt care about me 
402120639667937463,Be aware of the checking process   It s not the way it says and not easy  They will ask you to Download the igloo app  if you are lucky to follow a resident entering the building just follow and take the elevator to the right to your rented apartment  Once a the door follow the instructions to enter the apartment  make sure you click on the door key pad so you see the  s  Once in the apartment you will find the fob hanging next to the fridge  The checking was terrible  I read prior reviews before we checked in  The main issue people complain about is the checking process  It says use a code to get into the building  It s a LIE  Why    We try to use the code but we couldn t get in  I called customer service and spoke to a lady who had no idea what to do  She put me on hold four times  Finally I decided to follow a resident who just got into the building and proceeded to the apartment   and finally was able to use the code to get into the apartment and found the fob  It took us    minutes to check in  Few days later  we met a couple having the same issue trying to get into the building and we helped them with the process  They were at the door for an hour and a half trying to get someone on the phone  Terrible      The apartment was nice  one queen bed for a couple  friends will not use a queen bed to sleep together    The couch was not comfortable  I traveled with my kid only  so I gave him the bed because he was competing for   days   I suggest that they invest in the kitchen  They definitely need silverware bigger coffee cups and utensils    They need to have a layout of the building  We had to explore to find the laundry room  it is on same floor where your apartment is  the gym is on the second floor  don t be fooled by the pictures  there is   old treadmills  one bike and one elliptical  No wipes or spray or d sinfectant to wipe the machines  prior to and after workout  The weight room Is limited to one one machine and free weight adjacent  to the cardio room    THE POOL  is an indoor one but closed by the health department  A notice was posted on the door   It s definitely convenient because of its location but don t walk alone  specially at night   It s a  quiet and a clean building   Despite the negatives we made the most of it  We used it to sleep and cooked breakfast  we wanted to cook more but they didn t have enough utensils to work with  It was an ok stay 
470958735264124122,Location of the apartment is great and close to the hospital and the vibrant place of central end west  The check in was a bit turbulent because the main door of the building was stuck and didn t open with code  i had neighbor living in same apartment to help open the back door  The apartment is spacious with good living room and big TV with Netflix and Hulu access  It is overall clean but it seems it was clean days and may be weeks before my arrival considering there was some cockroaches in the bathroom 
766471516,This is not the hosts fault  but theres really loud construction noise right outside the window  Jackhammering  drilling  sand blasting  etc  Its impossible to work  have calls or relax during business hours     If youll only be spending nights and evenings in the apartment  Id highly recommend staying here  The location  apartment and lobby staff are all amazing  Otherwise  you may want to check on the status of the construction before booking  It looks a large ongoing construction project 
402850299499507571,It was peaceful I  feel like for the price the place could have been better kept  Some detector and wires were exposed and pulling out  blinds damaged etc  but not too shabby 
389060554952174489,Horrible customer service  I run my own air bnb and would never treat my guests the way Zencity treated me  Zero help  no one lives in the city that works for this property management company so I was left to sit in the hallway till I left to go rented a hotel for the weekend  ZERO STARS Horrible customer service  I run my own air bnb and never would treat my guests the way you treated me  Zero help  I couldn t gain access into the the apartment and you  left me to sit there in the hallway  ZERO STARS
765077739,We won t be staying with Zencity again  they don t care for their properties well  We wouldn t have been able to check in if the property manager hadn t been walking out the font doors  the system to let you in is glitchy  The AC was broken  no batteries in the remotes  floor wasn t swept  doornob was gone from the back of the bathroom door    That being said  location is great and we slept well on the bed  water pressure in the shower was pretty good and water was always hot  Hopefully they get some more staff and care take care of their properties better in the future  This place is clearly not cared for   I know it s not a private home but it didn t make for a welcoming experience  beginning with bad directions and not being able to get into the building  It s fake luxury but could easily be taken to the next level with some staff who give care and attention to keeping up when things break and adding some welcoming touches 
767232532,Location was great  apartment is ok but basic and we had   days without air conditioning  Also the front door automatic lock stopped working which we had to fix ourselves and there was a smell in the unit when we checked in  Communication from the owners acknowledging and resolving the owners was poor  I think I ve said enough but here goes again  the smell when we checked in  the lack of air conditioning for   days  the lock stopped working in the front door  poor communication and zero effort to help offset the issues we faced 
767361426,Decent for a stay but the listing could use some updates  The interior has a few repairs that were made that do not show up in photos and laundry while on site is coin operated only  Everything appeared clean but the shower had not been which made me question the unit as a whole  The building next door was currently under construction so there is some usual city sounds during the day   Walls are thin but thats expected in an apartment  Thank you again for the stay
765988569,The apartment was very sleek and stylish  Parking was a nightmare  We couldn t find anywhere close when we came home around   pm and had to walk pretty far in a somewhat sketchy area  The next morning we had to get up early and move the car because we were worried it would get ticketed   The shower took forever to get warm and the water pressure wasn t very good   There s a bunch of steps to do to get your keys for check in  Bed was very comfortable 
766704833,The Zencity team was super helpful as well as everyone at the Del Prado  The unit is exactly as listed  the only issue was the cleanliness of the unit  hair in tub  food residue in microwave  food left in the fridge  grimy dust along baseboards thought out   I booked very last minute and they were able to accommodate me  It s just a minute s walk from downtown Hyde Park which made the location ideal   Thank you so much for accommodating a last minute reservation  the Del Prado team was great and the room worked out  Wonderful location   Only comments are regarding the cleanliness  there was hairs in the shower  food residue in the microwave  food left in the fridge  and just a layer of grimy dust throughout the baseboards that made it feel like it hadn t been deep clean in months  Just a lived in clean 
451414078125021740,The ac never worked they never came out to fix it or clean up the room it was a horrible experience When we got there bed was not made up clothes in washer it needed a full detail just sad the way they treat you after you spend your money
430400539293146560,Im a frequent Airbnb traveler and this time booked the place for two weeks for my business trip  I found the Zancity apartment not suitable for my needs  there is no working table and a comfy chair  in the picture you can see a tiny table and a plastic chair   so I mostly worked standing placing my laptop on the microwave in the kitchen  There is a lack of drawers or other surfaces especially in the bedroom and bathrooms and I kept my stuff in the suitcase  The handers were missing so Zenticy stuff brought us some  We also got only one key even though we were two people with different schedules and were told that there is only one  Last but not least the apartment wasnt clean as we used according to the Airbnb standards   having some dust  stains  and peeling all around  Zencity sent a clean person but the place requires deep clean of the kitchen and maintenance in the bathrooms  I wont recommend this place as its also not so cheap  Please clean the apartment for the next guests  especially the kitchen and bathrooms   We highly recommend adding a working station   a table and comfy chairs for   people  Everyone works remotely today  Also adding some drawers would be great  I would go to Goodwill and buy some pictures and items to make the place cozy and reduce the feeling of a ghost apartment 
421661979857123673,This unit is NOT market ready  It needs a major deep clean  the unit was filthy when I arrived  The blind doesnt work and the outdoor furniture is in terr vel condition  Customer service from Zenicity terrible  renter beware  Your clean standards are below grade  Terrible maintenance of the unit  it was filthy 
427447160458878479,Fantastically situated apartment in cool repurposed building offering great space  form and function for a professional of leisure stay in KC  Check in process wasnt great   telecom system appeared to be a know fault and your backup fob in mail box   didnt work  there was no fob  save for tail gating I would have not have gotten access   there is a pretty strong sewage smell in the apartment which I figure is just a function of the older building plumbing but wasnt a great vibe when going to bed   There was some heavy marks on the stove top and some general wear and tear type stuff around the apartment   Otherwise a great stay  great spot and great value 
484696465237638190,Not suitable for a long term stay because the more time you spend at the property the more issues arise    In most cities downtown is the hub for greatness  not the case for STL  Close to lots of nightlife  only one grocery store across the street that is limited in what it carries  The building is close to the metro but I don t recommend taking it unless you want to encounter questionable smells and sketchy characters    Out my three months at the apartments the elevator broke at least three times a month I stayed on the seventh floor and was not given the code to the back alley stairway until after I had to hunt zen city down through Airbnb and wait almost an hour for a response  If you re handicap or have trouble with stairs I wouldn t even risk booking a stay here    The entry to the apartment almost pick and chose when it would accept the code  Sometimes it wouldn t register the number until after the  rd try  and other times you would have to jiggle the handle to reset the system and then enter the code    The apartment looks like the pictures but it does not show the cracked paint  holes in window linings  the slow drains  and the weak water pressure    This unit is suitable for a very short term stay if it s the only option but I do not recommend it for travelers in need of extended accommodations  Update the apartment  address the weak water pressure  change the batteries in the tv remote because since check in it s been low  actually communicate about maintenance issues in the apartment so you re guests aren t caught off guard 
389859598207304983,The lock to the room was broken when I tried to check in  and the door was wide open when I first got there  It was unsafe for me to stay so I wasted      on this Air BnB and had to get a hotel room downtown so I could have a place to stay where I wouldn t have to worry about someone breaking in 
444867323342794839,  several of the ights were burned out  wich left the lighting to be desired   the stove and sink were not clean   my guest had his truck stolen just outside the west side of the building  across from the federal reserve bank durring the day sometime between  am when i returned from work   and      ish when we checked out 
547122672758233004,By far the worst Airbnb experience we ve had  all because of management  There were a plethora of shortcomings with the apartment during our   week stay  but the worst was when our thermostat stopped working and the heat turned off when it was    degrees outside  After multiple attempts to work with Zencity to rectify the situation  days of them lying and telling me that maintenance was  on their way    someone finally came on day    only after I contacted Airbnb directly  We literally had to turn on the oven to heat the unit in the middle of winter  I travel for work and use Airbnb monthly  and have never been so frustrated than I was staying here  Do yourself a favor and keep scrolling 
387671912697076046,Departamento est  bien ubicado y es lindo  pero  el anfitri n deber  mejorar la limpieza y el equipamiento del mismo  Nuestra estad a podr a haber sido mucho m s placentera si el departamento hubiese estado limpio y mejor equipado   Las camas son comodas y sabanas y toallas adecuadas  Falta aire acondicionado en el segundo dormitorio que tiene un ventilador chico que no refresca el ambiente  Fue casi imposible dormir all  ya q recibe todo el sol de tarde  La cocina estaba muy mal equipada  con vajilla rota y poca  No hay bols  para hacer una ensalada  ni rayador de zanahoria ni colador para mencionar algunas deficiencias  No hab a ni un salero en la cocina  La tarjeta para el lavarropas est  desactualizado y no sirve  Solo funcionan con tarjeta de cr dito  Es una lastima que el anfitri n no se muestre m s servicial ya que el Depto es lindo y bien ubicado 
425324929123417873,The location is amazing  but there were multiple problems during the stay  First  the codes to check in did not work so we were stuck outside the room for over half an hour while someone on the phone attempted to get us inside  Secondly  we were never given our door fobs to enter the building room so we had to use different codes  up to   digits long  every time we needed to leave the room  Thirdly  the elevators broke down at one point leaving us stranded on the   th floor while they were fixed  The room was great  and the location is amazing  the rest was problem after avoidable problem 
400014721441469744,There isn t any parking near at all place was dirty pricing is good tho Please Add Option For Paid Parking
435476420588526967,Do not book with Zencity  They took my reservation and never sent me check in details  I waited around for   hours only to have to contact Airbnb for a refund  This occurred while sitting outside of the property 
386170318583171685,Be prepared to fight with the door when you get there  it s impossible to unlock and they didn t tell us this until AFTER we d been trying to get inside for    minutes  Also they will try to scam more money from you  They were unprofessional upon check in  only informing us that the door was tricky to open AFTER we were locked out for    minutes and had called Them multiple times  They finally sent me a video on how to properly open the door  but they should have sent that to me up front    Also they tried to charge me extra money claiming we checked out too late and they were unable to host an event they had planned for that evening  However when I mentioned possibly wanting to book another night with them to extend our stay  they happily sent me a bill for      and didn t mention that they needed the space for an event that same day  Seems shady to me  Overall they could have been more professional
386161046264447218,Great area   The place was extremely nice  clean  parking wasn t bad  We stayed on a mon wed  One suggestion is that they should rent to only     ppl  The other residents complain of simple noise  The television  group conversation  It s an old building and the walls are thin so you should expect a lil sound 
385402612836010361,A friend and I spent a week at this AirBNB  First the pros  The location is thirty minutes by bus from every major tourist attraction and fifteen or less by Uber Lyft  It s a great location  The space is also fantastic  there are living areas  bedrooms  and bathrooms separated by a floor so privacy for two people or two couples is fantastic  It s a recently renovated space and it looks great in photos and also in person   Now the cons that we experienced are going to echo some previous reviews on this site  This is the first place run by a big leasing company that I ve stayed at and I was disappointed  Once we got into the apartment  we discovered the place was swarming with gnats  so many that the downstairs was uninhabitable  This necessitated another call to the      number where a man named Marty intimated that he knew they were there and immediately offered    dollars off our      stay  while telling us that we would have to take care of the situation

which we got to stare at for the remainder of our vacation  along with our bowls of stuff   The gnats never went away   Additionally  the internet was spotty and didn t work well enough for the tv to work most of the time   It did not work on the bottom floor  This is not an apartment where teleworking is easily available without a personal hotspot   This is not an apartment that s handicap

at the back of the building and requires you to download an app to use it  Be very careful because the minimum amount of money you can put on it is       so I lost almost      that I can t get back   In general  communication was poor  We received our check in information on time  but it was incorrect  There was no information in the apartment of expectations or other typical information that I m used to allow us to take care of the apartment in the proper fashion  We didn t get our check out information until the day after I requested it  an hour before we were scheduled to leave for the airport   Each person that we talked to was a different person with a different understanding of the apartment  the history of our stay  and our requests   Finally  my last email from Zencity requested that only positive reviews be posted on Airbnb and negative thoughts be privately directed to the company  I felt this was unfair to future renters so I decided to post a review  which is

384771289651075271,Good location  Not very clean  One of the comforters has a blood stain on it  couch was dirty and stained  floor was filthy overall the place was dusty  I think you should reconsider who you chose to clean this place 
384745670553837433,I think this spot is great in terms of location  but the bed was uncomfortable almost like it was broken  Also there s a really bad smell throughout the building and in the apartment   If you can withstand the smell   location and space of the apartment are perfect 
384743283443240112,Overall it was a nice place  The view was great  free wifi  and for me parking was a breeze  It was a quiet place and the doormen were such nice people  Made check in smooth  The clean wasn t that great  When I got there there was still food and crumbs in the fridge from the previous guest  the floor needed to be swept and mopped  On the floor in the bedroom there was this weird sticky looking stuff on the floor by the closet  I didn t touch it to figure out what it was   And the window curtains were stained at the bottom  That part wasn t that big of a deal but appearance wise it could be something to think about  And the bathroom shower caddy is extremely dirty 
384698297435688954,Bed sheets on a couple rooms were not clean  other than that  things went smoothly Hi   A couple of things to note   First of all  the bed sheets were dirty  There was dirt  hairs  and they smelled like sweat  So I find appropriate to get a refund for the clean fee  since the apartment was not clean from the get go   Secondly  the code expired on the door lock  making us late for our flight  We had to call and figure out a new access code while the lyft was waiting for us at the entrance   Increased the lyft fare by       Please provide a refund for this as well   This is the first time that something like this happens to me at an airbnb   I know that sometimes these things happen  However  I find it fair to receive a refund for both the clean fee and the increased lyft fare given the inconveniences   Thank you  Juan Carlos
384687537867770871,Location for U Chicago is great  very close  Be ready for an old apartment  it is    years old building  Lobby nice room is old  Price is good  Carpet should be cleaner  If you want to have windowcurtain installed during their stay  you should let them know before they check in  We do noted elsewherecomfortable to have people walk into install curtain during this pandemic period 
384060853145448148,Really liked the location but we had difficulties at check in  Due to travel schedules  I arrived to the airbnb late where I discovered the lockbox containing the key was empty  I attempted to get ahold of someone and had to wait    minutes for someone to pick up the phone  on hold as its an office handling the property and not a person   At that point  the instructions to get into the building were not super helpful  the wifi information was incorrect and the place was not particularly clean  The bed sheets and towels were but the floor was not  There was also a lot of damage to the doors  walls and carpet  I liked the location but check in was difficult because of the issues with the key box  it took a while to get ahold of someone to help so I was stucking standing on the street at night with all my stuff in a neighborhood I didnt know  the information provided was all incorrect  including wifi and password  plus there was a lot of damage in the apartment and it was not very clean 
754119001,Not Superhost quality  No hand towels in downstairs bathroom  No working lights in east bedroom  No working outlet in main bathroom  Needed a good clean  See message sent Sunday  May   at approximately      pm
383997258161258493,The Zencity apartment was a good little apartment and it met our needs  There were a few things about the apartment that were a bit annoying  They only gave you one towel per person  a huge section of the blinds in our room were missing so the sun was SUPER bright  the place was fairly clean but you could tell is was done quickly as tons of dust and such piled up in the corners  there was absolutely zero amenities in the kitchen to use  this may be due to COVID   and there was no seating in the living room other than a small couch  so it wasnt the best for hanging out  They also came over to fix things  not requested by us  twice during our stay  With that said  the location was great   it was right by the metro  The check in process was smooth and easy and the price was great for the location  Overall  if you just need a place to sleep thats affordable and easy access to downtown and other areas of Chicago  its a great option 
383995700607618296,The apartment was clean  comfortable  and laid out as advertised  The main issue was that the wifi connection did not work  We contacted the host  a management company  via website and phone  and they didnt get back to us until the next day  The solution was to give us a different hotspot link  which did work for the duration of our stay  There was also a weird communication issue where we were emailed an invitation to extend our stay by a night or elect for late check in on the last day  but when we tried to confirm  the host was unable to approve the extension and apologized for the confusion 
390570685068544943,You get what you pay for  There are SO many reasons this place is significantly cheaper than places around St  Louis  The floor was so sticky it was hard to walk in the room and it reeked   When we got there  there was no fob for access to the building  and no one answering the calls for the access code  We never received a replacement fob which impacted our access into the building as well as the parking garage  This meant we had to pay for parking every    hours in a public lot  The floor was so sticky it was hard to walk in the room  We never received a fob which impacted our access into the building as well as the parking garage  This meant we had to pay for parking every    hours in a public lot 
383305118435319135,We had a bad experience  We stayed there for more than   months  The kitchen doesnt have an oven tray  pyrex or anything to be able to use it  after they said they dont provide it we had to buy one   The oven was dirty  but they clean it the day after we told them  They also dont have tea spoons or anything to be comfortable cooking eating there  When we arrived the bed slat was broken in many places  the living room lamp and one of the bathroom lamps were not working  These thing were resolved     days after we told them  They dont have cable tv and the firestick stopped working correctly  had to reset it many times every night  We asked for a replacement and after   weeks of waiting  and complaining  they told me to buy it and that I was going to be reimbursed  They never did  and they are not replying my messages regarding this  Honestly  in my opinion  the only good thing about this apt is that it is nice  true to the pics   If you are planning on staying for a few couple of days and dont want to cook there  it might be ok  But dont expect to feel homey  Also  keep in mind that it doesnt has a dinner table  just a coffee table  as you can see in the pics   From all the airbnb apt houses that Ive stayed in the US  by far this was the worst  I believe you could have make us feel great with really little effort money  The things we were asking for are simple easy things  something to be able to cook in the oven  tea spoons  solve the firestick issue    after   weeks of waiting for a new firestick I was told I could buy one and you were going to reimburst the money  I feel scamed    not only you havent done it  but also you dont reply to my messages regarding this issue  I believe after paying over       we deserved not to have to buy our own firestick and oven tray  I feel disappointed  I have stayed in many airbnb apts houses in US and this one was the worst experience  In the rest of the places  you felt more at home  they even had coffe tea sugar olive oil conditioner and shampoo  big bottle not the tiny ones   I dont think you care  so I am not sure why am I wasting the time to write these    
407920616242749780,When we first got there we didn t have to put in the code the door was broke so that was the first issue  Walking in the whole building smelled like weed cigarettes  All we he was a sheet to sleep with there was no blanket  The room itself was clean but the location was terrible  The Airbnb is a room basically in the projects just tidied up  I wouldn t stay here again  I didn t feel safe walking from the garage to the building  When we first got there we didn t have to put in the code the door was broke so that was the first issue  Walking in the whole building smelled like weed cigarettes  All we he was a sheet to sleep with there was no blanket  The room itself was clean but the location was terrible  The Airbnb is a room basically in the projects just tidied up  I wouldn t stay here again  I didn t feel safe walking from the garage to the building 
386192505966786962,The check in process was awful  there was no intercom for us to enter the building like the check in instructions described  We had to wait for someone who lived there to let us in  Furthermore  they did not leave us a key for us to get in and out of the building and did not provide one until a day later so we could not leave the building  Also  was later contacted by the host that there was evidence of BEDBUGS in the couch so we needed to leave immediately  We tried many times to contact the host for these problems but would always be on hold  given an inconclusive answer  and no help  In the end we had to hound down a security guard to help us 
409320720869328166,We were very disappointed with the level of cleanliness in the apartment  Everything felt very dirty and the shower was clogged so it was overflowing every time we tried to shower  The shower curtain was also dark brown on the bottom and should be replaced  The apartment also smelled like vomit and cigarettes  All the sheets in the beds had stains on them  including blood  and didn t smell clean  The carpet and couches were extremely dirty  It was also very uncomfortable to work remotely because the dining table chairs did not fit the table properly  We were also very uncomfortable that there was an automated noise complaint message that we received in the middle of the night  even though we were sleeping  The lack of noise insulation made it very difficult to sleep through the night since this apartment is on a busy street and right next to an emergency room  Also  the lights were severely flickering every time we turned them on and made us concerned for the safety of the place because of how many old buildings in this neighborhood don t have updated electricity  There was also no shampoo left for us and a very limited supply of dishes silverware which would have been nice considering how much we paid for the place  The bed in the front room also has a broken frame  Overall  for the amount that we paid for the place  this did not meet a basic level of expectation  We were very disappointed with the level of cleanliness in the apartment  Everything felt very dirty and the shower was clogged so it was overflowing every time we tried to shower  The shower curtain was also dark brown on the bottom and should be replaced  The apartment also smelled like vomit and cigarettes  All the sheets in the beds had stains on them  including blood  and didn t smell clean  The carpet and couches were extremely dirty  It was also very uncomfortable to work remotely because the dining table chairs did not fit the table properly  We were also very uncomfortable that there was an automated noise complaint message that we received in the middle of the night  even though we were sleeping  Also  the lights were severely flickering every time we turned them on and made us concerned for the safety of the place because of how many old buildings in this neighborhood don t have updated electricity  There was also no shampoo left for us and a very limited supply of dishes silverware which would have been nice considering how much we paid for the place  The bed in the front room also has a broken frame  Overall  for the amount that we paid for the place  this did not meet a basic level of expectation 
420343931689659561,Great location  and once we saw the place it would have been perfect  However they didn t send check in Information  once they finally did send Information it was wrong  Once we finally got ahold of them after   hours of going back and forth they still were not able to give us keys to access the building fully the way we needed to  We ended up cancelling after       hours of back and forth and had to last minute book a hotel instead  which wasn t the easiest to find for the same price  They were easy to work either after to get a full refund which we greatly appreciated but definitely not something I will deal with again nor will I ever book with Zencity  I have always loved Airbnb and this was my first terrible experience  but it definitely makes me hesitant about ever booking one in the future  Hopefully this place can figure it out because it really was a great location and would have been perfect for my family  but after reading reviews seems like there is something always wrong  Wish I Would have read Into that more 
410154884946939668,Very nice  clean  modern space in the heart of downtown  Would definitely recommend  Everything was great besides the AC being out  Spot was very clean  spacious and the location was great 
405015517399155884,This is in a great location if you are wanting to go to a Cubs game  check out food places or shop at all small little stores  The customer service guy that took the call was really nice  The apartment walls could use some scrubbing as there are scuff marks and dirt on them  The only complaint I have is that there were two adults staying there for two nights and we were only provided   towels and   wash clothes  When I called about it they did get with the clean crew  however  they couldn t bring them until the next day  We needed the towels for the first night as well  so that part is disappointing about our stay  Hello  The suggestion I would make is to provide more towels for the guests  Although you guys did bring us more towels it was on the last day we were there  I needed the extra towels for both days  Also the rug by the door needs to be moved  we were only able to open the door part of the way 
381788702820404737,The smoke smell was unbearable  so we left early  As mentioned in a previous review  messages from Zencity were automated and did not acknowledge our complaints  The previous problems around check in and wifi code have not been addressed  so you will need to read the previous review to know how to open the door and connect to wifi  Additionally  the A C unit could not keep up  so the apartment never got under    degrees while we were there  I received no acknowledgement about the smoke smell being unbearable  You should not be renting this place on Airbnb until you remediate it 
768416350,Great location  relatively clean  would prefer floors then carpet  It s very hot no air conditioner  I had a lot of trouble to gain access to the apartment  I don t recommend for summer  The check in experience was horrible  I was tempted to cancel  I had so much trouble obtaining the key  The host seems to be a corporation which does not provide the best experience because they are not even aware of the condition of the apartment   The apartment was not comfortable no Air conditioner and Chicago is now in the      hot temperatures 
768339471,This place is just okay  It s an old building and apartment that hasn t been updated at all  It s a great location  The internet is very weak and we struggled to have a zoom meeting  There were no amenities at all   no coffee maker  salt  sugar  nothing   so be prepared 
768092918,Nice location  but bring your own towels and bed stuff  The place was not properly clean and tons of stains on all sheets   The front staff was very nice  Nicely located and free parking on the streets 
767797504,Very simple place  great location  No air conditioning  it was very hot  I was in town during a    degree weather weekend   prepare accordingly Get an air conditioning unit
450674758707009695,great location
766595834,The bed was comfy  The noise level was unexpected  Not only the bars  but the neighbors and the bus  Not on the same level of cleanliness as other Airbnb s I ve stayed in previously  Overall  it wasn t so bad that I felt I had to move  but I probably wouldn t stay in this unit again  This is more for someone who wants to go out and party  not ideal for a business trip  The floors   bathroom were very dirty  Other people s hair on the floors bed and bathroom  Very disappointed   The noise was unreal  Not only the bars  but the neighbors and the bus  Maybe     hours of sleep 
500731284640794263,We had booked this place for two days but our flight was delayed until the following morning  Upon arrival  we found a dirty rental  The carpet grossly stained and covered with debris  the walls were stained  dirty utensils remaining in the dishwasher  and a bedside table stained  When we contact Zencity  they offered us a clean during our stay  However by the time we received noticed of their offer  it was already evening and we were too tired to be inconvenienced by having a clean crew in the rental while we wanted to rest   We were leaving in the morning   I did my best to vacuum but the vacuum available was not good    There is a nice coffee shop in the building  The location is convenient  The apartment would be much better had it been clean  We had booked this place for two days but our flight was delayed until the following morning  Upon arrival  we found a dirty rental  The carpet grossly stained  the walls were stained  dirty utensils in the dishwasher  and dirty bedside table  When we contact Zencity  they offered us a clean during our stay  However by the time we received noticed of their offer  it was already evening and we were too tired to be inconvenienced by having a clean crew in the rental while we wanted to rest   I did my best to vacuum but the vacuum available was not good    I recommend that a better clean crew and also to have the apartment repainted walls fixed especially in the areas that are very visible damaged or distressed     I am still waiting to hear back regarding our last message 
389050643003015978,Location is awesome but unit just doesn t measure up to pics or my standards  I should have went with hotel instead this time around  Hi  I did send pics of the mold in shower tub caulking  The unit overall did not look clean and did not have fresh smell at all I had to had fresh smell myself  The A C does not cool entire unit and with TV only being in living room space it was simply uncomfortable staying here  The remote stopped working on day two  Yes  the replacement was offered  I would clean routines  A C performance  adding TV in bedroom  The price was not worth the stay  Thanks 
763055295,It was over all an okay place to stay  First   days the air was not working took them two days to get back in contact with me  The bathroom shower curtain was dirty like it haven t been clean  There was so much stuff from previous stay that was in the couch 
762560665,This property was filthy  Stains on the couch and bedding  dirt grime on all of the walls as well as in the tub shower  dirty appliances  debris on the floors  etc  I left immediately  booked a hotel  and am making other arrangements for my stay in Chicago  I travel for work  staying in Airbnbs for    months out of the year and will never book with zencity again  as they clearly do not manage or maintain their properties well 
451408866695550470,THE GOOD  BAD AND UGLY GOOD   AC  washer and dryer worked well   Unit was well supplied with paper products   Customer service rep  Andrea and maintenance man  Jeremiah were very good in responding to problems  See below  BAD   Property was very dirty  kitchen floor and AC vent were black with dirt   smudges on the walls  drapes were falling off the wall and blind were missing slats and draw strings resulting lack of privacy and security issues  repair took two weeks   Sections of flooring in the hallway were missing which could cause a stumble and fall  UGLY   We had a    day pre paid lease and were illegally locked of our unit for more than    hours   We had to go to a hotel without fresh clothing  sundries and medications  After returning to the apartment we could not leave the unit because the access key pad had be improperly installed and would not lock    Another call to have something fixed 
408609176306296081,This was my second time staying with Zencity in KC  The first time was better  We didnt have the WiFi for our unit available when we moved in  and it took five days for them to get back to us and have someone come out and fix it  Also there was a lot of construction in the building during our stay  Very noisy 
431824633739495643,The apartment itself was a nice place  Getting into the apartment was the problem  The lock didn t respond to the codes I received so I had to call them for an hour and try to figure out how to get into the place  It didn t seem like anybody checked on the place before I arrived  Check in was very unfortunate  The customer service was helpful overall  but it was tough to be in a hallway for an hour trying to get into the apartment  The place was mostly clean but some things stuck out  such as some spilled things on the floor when we entered as well as hair around the place  Also the chairs on the porch are kinda broken 
430377613698414054,not very clean  ceilings were scary  floors very dirty  pictures are deceiving  we ended up getting a hotel room for a night
389827791328552124,Great location and apartment layout  problems  with cleanliness and access  The floors were very dirty  Large clumps of dust dirt  Rugs not vacuumed  No soap for shower  Bedding felt unclean  Access code to building did not work and our call for assistance was unsatisfactory  We loved staying in the place in       but it has not kept up its standards  Because of its great location we may stay again but are uncertain 
409403551006996402,We only had a hot shower one of the four mornings  So if you like to shower in the morning do not expect a hot let alone warm shower  even after running water for       min prior to shower   It was literally freezing cold    The inside is clean and has all the basic necessities  For us the location was just OK as there was no grocery stores or food places within a few blocks  Uber rides were relatively in expensive and easy to catch    I personally would not stay here again but I have read other reviews that really enjoyed it 
759673144,Do not stay here  This apartment was filthy   Bathroom was not clean  Soiled tissues make up wipes in the toilet  empty travel size soaps in the showers  hair all over the floors  grime build up along sink faucet  Dried up contacts and hair found on the bedroom floor  Ashes on terrace floor  Only   outdoor chairs were clean enough to use  Tons of grime on the refrigerator water dispenser  Oil stains on the stovetop  I notified Zencity about this when we first arrived and requested someone to clean immediately  They wouldnt send anyone until our last day  Sunday  when we were checking out Monday    I requested a refund for at least the clean fee and never received a response  Worst Airbnb experience Ive had by far    dont stay here  This apartment was filthy  I sent a message on may   th about compensation and you never responded   completely unprofessional  I would never recommend Zencity as a host 
759668899,PROS   Convenient location  Easy to check in and check out  Spacious interior  It was nice to have   bedrooms    to each person   CONS   This unit was very grimy  especially the bathroom   there were hairs in the shower and other bathroom nooks and crannies and I dont think the tile had been actually wiped clean in some time  The middle bedrooms doorknob was broken from the inside and one of us got locked in the bedroom  I communicated the clean and doorknob issues to Zencity before check out  Furniture was sparse and I ended up moving a side table from the living room to a bedroom to serve as a nightstand  There was only one mirror in the entire   bedroom unit and it was  a waist up sink mirror in the bathroom  Unit is on the  rd floor so may not be the best choice for those with mobility issues  Hi Zencity Im sorry to have to rate cleanliness at   but this unit could really use some TLC from housekeeping  Our stay otherwise was nice 
410805392398471516,The apartment unit itself was really nice and in a great location  Very clean and everything in unit was advertised  The check in process  however  was awful  Zen city sent detailed instructions on how to check in  however  these instructions were null and avoid since the intercom system didn t work  which is the very first step  After calling  apparently this was a known issue by the host and I was instructed to just try to follow people into the building and elevator  Improvements are seriously needed to simplify this process  I enjoyed the apartment and it was a as advertised  The check I m process needs serious improvement  Encouraging people to just follow other into the building can lead to unsafe situations 
389844576716973255,The place is clean and located in a great area    The only negative is the call box into the building was broke and we were only able to enter if we napped to catch a tenant leaving  This was a huge inconvenience but other than that the place was very nice  Please replace the call box other than that it was a nice stay
389789668416303616,Great place walls thin don t turn tv past    or you will get a noise text message The walls very thin i had the tv on volume    got a noise complaint before    pn
759316889,No hangers  No patio furniture  Upstairs neighbors are very loud playing music at  AM  Bad music  at that   Master  shower has one unworking nozzle  No hangers    Like    WHY  You can get a dozen for a dollar at the Dollar Store  Also  there are no TVs in either bedroom  No balcony furniture  Seems the owners went cheap to offer this spot as an AirBnB spot 
759262150,Quick note  this was our first time using Airbnb  Some of the negative things we experienced may be normal by Airbnb standards  but to us they seemed a little odd  especially booking from a company that has many Airbnb locations  We expected things to be tighter    The apartment was nice  quaint  and comfortable  and its location was very convenient  It was wonderful to be located directly across from a park  Having kids ourselves  it was a delight to see families enjoying themselves each day  It was wonderful to have food  liquor  coffee and the L station all within a   minutes walk  Each morning I took a walk to a local coffee shop to pickup breakfast and coffee  You could see folks from the community out and about  families going for walks  dog walkers  exercisers and more  all with a smile on their faces ready to start the day  It was also nice being able to walk to the liquor store each night for a bottle of wine  It felt safe doing so  even in the later hours  This all  location wise   was quite fun and convenient for us  The apartment is also in a quite location making it easier to relax  not needing to hear the hustle and bustle of the city   Before our arrival we were provided with rather detailed instructions of how to acquire the key to get into the building  how to get into the apartment and how to access the WiFi  Being a very detailed person myself I really liked this    However  there were a few things we had issues with   Once inside the building and at the apartment door  it took us about    minutes to get in  The instructions said to type in the access code then press the  lock button   We did this over and over until we decided to press the pound   button  which then unlocked the door   We tried to log on to the Wi Fi   but the network name was not what was sent to us in the instructions or what was written on the black board in the main room  both of those were the same   After sifting through all of the networks that our computers were picking up  we noticed one that looked like an abbreviated version of what we were told  Once we selected that  we entered the password that was given and that did work   Upon waking up after the first night my wife went to take a soak in the tub  Unfortunately  she was unable to since there was no stopper for the drain  I messaged Zencity via the Airbnb app regarding this  asking is there was one in the apartment somewhere  We never received a response  We searched the entire apartment and were unable to located a stopper  This was quite disappointing since the point of our trip was to relax and one of the main points that lead us to select this particular apartment was the clawfoot tub  featured in the photos    At the time of writing this review  we still have not received any response regarding this    While it didnt affect us  we thought it may be useful for folks to know that the apartment is an  able bodied only  stay  Wheelchairs would be impossible because of the multiple floors of steep steps and narrow hallways and no elevator  Quick note  this was our first time using Airbnb   The apartment was nice  quaint  and comfortable  However  there were a few things we had issues with  The first was with getting into the apartment   Once inside the building and at the apartment door  it took us about    minutes to get in  The instructions said to type in the access code then press the  lock button   We did this over and over until we decided to press the pound   button  which then unlocked the door   After getting unpacked and comfortable  we went to log into the Wi Fi  The network name was not what was sent to us in the instructions nor what was written on the black board in the main room  both of those were the same

 I messaged yall via the Airbnb app  at      AM             regarding this  asking is there was one in the apartment somewhere  We never received a response and still have not  We searched the entire apartment and were unable to located a stopper  This was quite disappointing since the point of our trip was to relax and one of the main points that let me to select this particular apartment was the clawfoot tub  featured in the photos  for my wife to relax in  As of this writing    PM             we still have not received any response from the message I sent   We did like the location of the apartment  It was wonderful having it be directly across from a park  Having kids ourselves  it was a delight to see families enjoying themselves each day  Its location was also really nice  It was wonderful to have food  liquor  coffee and the L station all within a   minutes walk  This was quite fun and convenient for us  It was also a quite location making it easier to relax  not needing to hear the hustle and bustle of the city   While it didnt affect us  we thought it may be useful to display somewhere on the advertisement that the apartment is an  able bodied only  stay  Wheelchairs would be impossible  and there are many steps leading to the apartment  with no elevator   All in all we enjoyed our stay  There were just the first few things that threw a slight wrench into the overall stay 
393447232232011267,I would not stay here again   Lots of clean needs to be done to pass any hygiene standards      The code we were given to get in was the wrong one  the building was extremely hot  the place was filthy per our previous conversations and pics sent   The automation of info wasnt as appreciated as a personal fast communication we received from other AirBnB hosts 
539112855103479472,NOT a Zen experience  ZenCity does not comply with the Chicago Heat Ordinance which require landlords to keep daytime temps a minimum of    degrees  As a result when I arrived the pipes were frozen   it was in the single digits during my trip  No water in the apartment until the middle of the next day   And I was unable to stay warm in the apartment  I was denied my request to control the temperature  they control the Nest thermostat  And my requests to speak with a manager went unfulfilled   I do not recommend staying here  Need to align your policies with the City of Chicago Heating Ordinance  Your lack of compliance with the law made my trip miserable 
758372706,Check in is smooth and the location is really good  However  the apartment is not that good  The screens of the window are left on the floor without being assembled  some light fixtures don t have light bulbs  the plug in is left on the floor  The bathroom is not clean  as there are stains on walls and the bathtub  Speaking about the bathtub  the water keeps dropping though the tap is turned off and there re hairs in the bathtub drain  Also  the shower caddy seems to be used for a long time and is left with stains  One more thing about the window  the shades  are translucent and they can t provide privacy  Overall  it seems the apartment hasn t been well refurbished and soon opens for reservation 
757324986,Overall the unit was nice   However  the walls in the bathroom were visibly dirty in the bathroom and it took   weeks and multiple reminders from me for someone to come clean them  I ended up just clean the built up hair from both the shower and sink drains myself  While all of the customer service representatives I interacted with were very pleasant and responded fairly quickly  actually fixing issues was much slower and less satisfactory  I think this is a systems issue for Zencity  not an issue with any individual staff member  It took   weeks to get my bathroom clean  the walls were disgusting  I sent pictures and requested that they be clean on    April  had to follow up multiple times  gave permission multiple times for a cleaner to come into the unit while I was gone  the next day  and it didnt get clean until    April   and I had no notification they were coming that time   It was also unreasonably frustrating to get the thermostat set so that I could adjust it and not be freezing in the unit 
407203948518632834,The stay was good other than the group of kids across the hall screaming and fighting all night  Also it was raining in the bathroom from a bad leak and you would get soaked while trying to take a crap  And supposedly maintenance was scheduled and decided to let himself in without knocking or anything  and I didnt know who he was and just pointed at the back of his shirt and said Im maintenance duh  the stay was good other than the group of kids across the hall screaming and fighting all night  And the random maintenance man that tried to let himself in without even knocking and the leak that was dripping from the ceiling terribly onto you while you were sitting on the toilet  those issues should really be resolved before rented not while someone is paying good money to deal with random maintenance men coming in and out interrupting our stay and raining in the bathroom  So Ill pay the    but I think I should get a little money back for my inconvenience 
756185468,Thank ya for the chance to stay  Check in process and clean after previous customer could be improved  It was ok 
426769567428030176,    Thanks for the stay but you were sending me so many text that was false because the time you texted I was never there and I did not have a baby with me
446388955424994568,Overall the apartment was decent and its in a pretty nice spot  I travelled from Indiana and had asked several times about how the parking worked and never really got a clear answer but was offered a  pm early check in which I accepted  I asked all of my questions between  a  p and all of the responses came overnight so I essentially got the response the next day  not a big deal until I had problems getting into the apartment    First off  the parking garage isnt available until you check in so you have to park on the street temporarily  check in  then move your car into the garage  The front desk staff was less than helpful and literally handed me the keycard and said  Im sure you can figure it out   not really Zencitys fault but they could provide more info in their check in instructions   From there I figured out that the ONE assigned parking spot is on the  th level which connects to the  th floor of the apartment building  The one keycard is needed to access almost everything   including garage entrance and exit  building entrance  elevator buttons  except floor    and so on  Not a huge deal but the one card created a few logistics issues  Check out is also a bit of a hassle because you are asked to leave the keycard in the room  but you need it to get out of the garage   so you have to get your car out of the garage before you go back upstairs to leave the keycard   Check in was a bit of a nightmare  as I mentioned earlier Zencity offered early  pm early check in which I accepted  I was able to get the keycard  park  and get up to the apartment  with a ton of my mothers luggage I might add  only to find that the   digit code I was given to unlock the electronic deadbolt didnt work  I reached out to Zencity for help but didnt get a response  We decided to put all of our luggage back in the car and continue on with our day  Later when we came back  well after the normal  p check in  the code magically worked   The posting says the apartment hosts    and with an air mattress this could easily be    I had indicated there would be   in my group yet there where only   towels  There was also only one dish towel in the kitchen  There were no hot pads or oven mitts for the oven  and there was only one cooking sheet  There was no standard coffee pot  just a french press  again  not a huge deal for me but it may be for someone   The  smart  thermostat constantly changed to some setting other than what it was set at  There was mold in one of the showers  the fridge is scratched and dented  one of the tables is damaged  the wall mounted toilet paper and towel holders where all falling off  the trash can was broke  the doors squeak and one of the chairs is so bent it doesnt sit level  For those that care  the apartment building has a rule stating only two persons per apartment in the pool   This may seem like a lot of complaining but I spent the most Ive ever spent on this particular Airbnb and I feel like there were a lot of little issues that all added up  Its obvious no one lives here permanently and so many of the little things have gone unnoticed  Need to improve communication  All responses to my requests happened overnight  When I had an issue checking in no one responded  Also provide more info about parking   you have to park on the street for a bit before getting the pass to the garage  Parking spot     is on the  th level which connects to the  th floor of the apartment building  If you offer someone early check in the keycode needs to work at that time 
531182884843389393,We picked this unit thinking it would be nice and in a nice area  the area was not bad  However  the unit it s self was run down  You could tell they tried to give  luxury  upgrades to the unit  We arrived on       the unit was not clean pass first glance looking  In fact the last time the unit had been clean was       and the property manager forgot to wipe it fully off the wifi board when he did the walk through  The sad part is he knew the unit wasn t clean and tried to comment that he was checking behind the cleaners  Not only was the unit not clean there was bugs flying around in the bathroom and on the ceiling in the bathroom  the walls in the unit are thin so the neighbors walking and continuously barking dog are heard all night long  Literally the dog was barking from the time we arrived till the time we left  The windows also need to be resealed as they let in quite the dead as one on us now has a cold  We would turn the heat on and the rest of the unit would be warm but the bedroom freezing  To top that off on our second day we came back to the unit only to be staring at an eviction notice from the building owner stating they were evicting zencity and all occupants in the zencity unit from the building  This was the Worst Airbnb experience the host was not communicative at all and we were very uncomfortable leaving our things there upon receiving the eviction notice  We dealt with an eviction notice and an unclean unit  The floors were gross  there were bugs flying around in and on the ceiling of the shower and the window seals let in a bunch of cold air making one of us get a cold  The walls are super thin in the unit and we constantly heard noice from those above us  The neighbors dog barks a majority of the day 
423922437042042624,Great location  The apartment is small  bathroom  is very small and it needs to be remodeled  Overall is OK 
755903385,Unfortunately didn t have the best experience with zencity this time  I ve stayed with them a few times before  Love the locations and price for the most part  but in general the spaces aren t really clean  This last time there was loose hair all over the Airbnb  even in the shower drain  I took pictures and sent them to zencity  as they requested and they did nothing for me      clean fee  dirty Airbnb during a pandemic  I just feel it could be handled better  Anyway  I m not saying dont stay here but in general don t expect it to be as nice or clean as in the images 
755859619,Beware  This listing is located directly over a very loud bar that is open until at least   a m  While I very much appreciated ZenCitys efforts to find an alternative place to stay for my second night  the description of this unit gave no indication at all that the apartment is located above a VERY loud bar that was open until   a m  when it then turned rowdy customers out on the street to continue the loud partying until   a m  The floors were vibrating because the music was so loud  This resulted in me getting about   hours of sleep before a very important  day long business meeting  It was a nightmare  In addition  there was no hair dryer after I doubled checked the listing before packing my bag for the trip  Finally  the entrance to the building was blocked by HUGE boxes left on the staircase  I literally had to wedge myself and my suitcase through the door and climb over the boxes to get to upstairs to the apartment  Very dangerous and completely ridiculous  While I very much appreciate your staffs efforts to find an alternative place to stay for my second night  the description of this unit gave no indication at all that the apartment is located above a very loud bar that was open until   a m  when it then turned rowdy customers out on the street to continue the loud partying until   a m  The floors were vibrating because the music was so loud  This resulted in me getting about   hours of sleep before a very important  day long business meeting  It was a nightmare  In addition  there was no hair dryer after I doubled checked the listing before packing my bag for the trip  Finally  the entrance to the building was blocked by HUGE boxes left on the staircase  I literally had to wedge myself and my suitcase through the door and climb over the boxes to get to upstairs to the apartment  Very dangerous and completely ridiculous 
754800731,We were disappointed that the apartment was not as clean as we had expected  The front bedroom bed sheets had not been changed  There was no top sheet  creases that looked like someone had just slept on them and there was hair on the pillow case  I was going to put fresh sheets on the bed  but the ones I found in the little freestanding bedroom cabinet were in a ball on the shelf and also had hair on them  The bathroom door was filthy  and there was toothpaste on the wall   The entry to the building was filthy as well  I wouldnt rent this airbnb again  They dont post photos of the tiny bathroom  most likely because they couldnt get a decent angle for the camera lense due to the size  It wasnt as clean as I would have liked  not terrible  but definitely not as clean as a bathroom should be  The grout is filthy  the door had splash marks of some kind down it  there was toothpaste on the wall  and the paint around mirror that acts as a door of the  medicine cabinet   where the extra shampoo is kept  is completely worn off where you open it  It wouldnt take much to touch up the paint every once in awhile to make it more presentable  Its obvious the owners have no pride in the place  It was easy to get the key out of the lock box that is attached to the door of the building  That being said  the tiny entry to the building was not only filthy  it was full of old mailers and boxes  Its actually a hazard  If I could post the pictures of the tiny entry and the narrow  dirty staircase that runs at an angle  I would  The bedroom that looks over Belmont was not clean before we arrived  There was no top sheet and there was hair in the bed and on one of the pillow cases  There were creases on the fitted sheet which looked like a sheet after someone has slept on them   I looked under the fitted sheet at the mattress pad and it had disgusting stains  I found extra sheets in the little freestanding closet  but they were dirty as well  It truly was disgusting  Needless to say we didnt use that bed  When I complained to Zencity regarding the dirty sheets and mouse poop in the kitchen cabinet  they kindly offered a  touch up   However  I truly didnt want one of their cleaners back in the unit when we were not there  and since we were not going to use the dirty bedroom  or any of the kitchen amenities  we decided it best to turn down their offer of sending someone in to clean   They did offer a refund of our clean fee  which we accepted   That was very generous of them  Location is good  and street parking was easy and plentiful  but noisy at night due to it being directly on Belmont 
754720654,Worst experience traveling ever with Zencity   Never going to use Air BnB again   st time last time  Never will I use Air BnB again  Chicago is a dump 
411535612816934968,horrible  dont do it  horrible customer service
411504373879130889,ok place
752870507,My experience with Zencity is exactly why I avoid staying with corporate AirBnBs  While the location of the apartment and customer service were both good  there were many things about the place that were an issue  especially cleanliness  When we arrived  we noticed that the floors underneath the couch or bed hadn t been clean  there were some old food wrappers found even   there were leftover pizza crumbs on the kitchen counter and work desk  some cobwebs on the ceiling and when we swept up before leaving  we even found ants  Additionally  there was a lot of water damage to the ceiling in most of the rooms and the bathroom even had some mold growing above the bathtub  The bedroom door doesn t close completely and will lock you out if you try to do so  As far as the kitchen amenities  be sure to bring your own water if you book here because they do not provide a water filter and there is only hot water from the sink  This all reflects the fact that THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL APARTMENT  This is a corporate owned space that is just trying to make as much money as possible with the least amount of effort  The day before we checked out  we received an email offering to extend the stay by a night for      We considered this because of the location and requested the extension  only to receive an email saying they would allow this extension for       When I declined and sent them a message about this email discrepancy  they changed it to      stating that it incurred the extra     because of taxes  what kind of tax is        Anyway  I could not recommend staying here unless you want to overpay for place where you have to live with ants  mold and re wash all of the dishes because they are coated with dirt  aka the dishwasher does not work properly   All in all  the effort is not worth the price  Please see review for feedback While the location of the apartment and customer service were both good  there were many things about the place that were an issue  especially cleanliness  When we arrived  we noticed that the floors underneath the couch or bed hadn t been clean  there were some old food wrappers found even   there were leftover pizza crumbs on the kitchen counter and work desk  some cobwebs on the ceiling and when we swept up before leaving  we even found ants  Additionally  there was a lot of water damage to the ceiling in most of the rooms and the bathroom even had some mold growing above the bathtub  The bedroom door doesn t close completely and will lock you out if you try to do so  As far as the kitchen amenities  be sure to bring your own water if you book here because they do not provide a water filter and there is only hot water from the sink  This all reflects the fact that THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL APARTMENT  This is a corporate owned space that is just trying to make as much money as possible with the least amount of effort  The day before we checked out  we received an email offering to extend the stay by a night for      We considered this and requested the extension  only to receive an email saying they would allow this extension for       When I declined and sent them a message about this email discrepancy  they changed it to      stating that it incurred the extra     because of taxes  what tax is        Anyway  I could not recommend staying here unless you want to overpay for place where you have to live with ants  mold and re wash all of the dishes because they are coated with dirt  The effort is not worth the price  
390483435013961892,Check in directions were not accurate   Place was dirty and worn   Smelled terrible in the entry way  Bed linens has stains on them  microwave was dirty and the floor was dirty  Couch is cheap and uncomfortable  No pillow protectors  so gross  My son didn t stay with us for it was gross and we left unsafe    Overall  the listing description and pictures do not reflect what you really get   Don t believe the listing  I contacted the company and they do not care about making us feel better about our experience    Hostile neighbors left us feeling unsafe    THIS PLACE IS A BIG NO  I have shared our experience and you don t care
394195264447111102,Don t get me wrong  this apartment is nicely remodeled  the location is perfect  the building is secured with gated parking and smart locks on every door  However  we contacted Zencity within    minutes of arriving at our reservation to inform them that the smart lock on the door was broken and wouldn t allow for the door to lock  We were consistently told that the maintenance team was coming  however the maintenance team never arrived  We checked in with them every few hours and we did hear back from them each time   However  we never got a response on how we could fix this ourselves or an ETA of the maintenance team  We even asked to be moved to a different rental or reimbursed in order to find a different rental property on our own  We were left there and received no assistance  It was incredibly frustrating that this company would leave young women alone in a city without the ability to lock their door  It put us on edge  and their lack of caring or urgency was not appreciated  As well  this unit was definitely not clean  There was an obviously used wash rag in the bathroom on the counter  previous renters trash found on the couch  and old food  rice  all over the floor next to the bed  Don t get me wrong  this apartment is nicely remodeled  the location is perfect  the building is secured with gated parking and smart locks on every door  However  we contacted Zencity within    minutes of arriving at our reservation to inform you that the smart lock on the door was broken and wouldn t allow for the door to lock  We were told that your maintenance team was coming  however the maintenance team never arrived  We checked in with you every few hours and never got a response on a fix or an ETA of the maintenance team  We even asked to be moved to a different rental or reimbursed in order to find a different rental property on our own  We received no assistance  It was incredibly frustrating that your company would leave young women alone in a city without the ability to lock their door  It put us on edge  and your lack of caring or urgency was not appreciated  As well  this unit was definitely not clean  There was an obviously used wash rag in the bathroom on the counter  previous renters trash found on the couch  and old dried food  rice  all over the floor next to the bed 
752801382,This is above a bar and VERY loud   Do NOT book this place unless you are cool with no sleep till well after  am   The host never responded and only gave me back    bucks when I canceled my reservation after the first sleepless night  I had booked for   nights    It was awful   And  there was a nasty hair folded into my towel   AWFUL experience   It is above the bar and very loud I had a huge hair in my bath towel Host never responded when I complained about the noise It is above a Bar It was above a bar and I had paid for   days and only got    bucks back after cancelling when I had no sleep the first night
751478140,Great place  beds are comfortable and the space feels bigger than the pictures  The description does not point out well that you will hear the music from the bars directly below the unit  and it is even louder on the weekends  The street facing bedroom will also get all of the noise of people outside the bars  Noise from bar directly below
388407207013831327,There was no water pressure on Kitchenette Sink  Bathroom Fan doesnt work  bathroom sink and shower did not drain well at all   Our  nd morning there was no hot water at all  The bed frame is weak and wobbles pretty bad  Also there was a big barking dog across the hall   The apartment smelled like other peoples cooking with very little ventalation  The TV didnt have regular Live TV   The A C workred great though  and the bed was comfortable minus the wobble and loud skweaking  Overall the stay was just fine  however we would not stay here again  Thank you  No water pressure on Kitchen Sink  Bathroom Fan doesnt work  bathroom sink and shower did not drain well at all   Our  nd morning there was no hot water at all  The bed frame is weak and wobbles pretty bad  Also the barking dog across the hall was  very obnoxious  Not too happy about those things  but overall the stay was just fine 
391309981900164694,Make sure key work before
751212575,This apartment was very suitable for a few days stay  It is on a pretty quiet street  The owner was slow to communicate access information but once I contacted them they emailed them immediately  Fortunately we called them during their office hours  Everything was pretty good  but the bathroom sink was a problem since it took so long to drain  The lobby was messy  The instructions were not completely accurate  WiFi address in instructions didn t match the actual requirements to log into the router  I had to comp tact host after checking time to get access instructions  Once I contacted them they immediately sent to details  Checkout instructions came after I had already left  I put the key back in the lock box then after I was gone I the instructions they emailed me said leave them inside  The apartment was clean  But the bathroom sink is extremely slow to drain  It took the sink probably   minutes to drain  Late  I had to call after checking time to get access instructions  He
391955223855147231,No parking was a bummer   bed frame was broken to the point where half of the bed is completely unusable  Otherwise cool  Bed frame was broken and honestly a danger to your guests  Check in took    minutes as I had to troubleshoot the key box malfunction with customer service  No parking in the middle of a busy city was a pretty big bummer 
391246782829916198,this large apartment offers a comfy bed  stylish digs  and is in a great location  The parking isnt great and we had a less than super clean experience  My wife and I enjoyed your check in process and the location of this Airbnb  It was very stylish  Our stay was made poor because the apartment had not been clean thoroughly before we arrived  There was an old mask on the counter  dirty dishes in the sink  hairs in the towels and on the countertops  and a bunch of trash in the trashcan  The lack of hot water was forgivable but the cleanliness was not 
749232037,the property was not clean at all  Zencity offered me an immediate refund  Outside of being disappointed with the room  and having to find a new place same day  I received good service from Zencity  Absolutely filthy  Didn t match the pictures online at all  The art on the wall in the main online picture isn t even there in real life  I don t understand how that was clean  and how someone is expected to comfortably stay there  Should drop the price to     bucks a night

412226036693028039,Just be prepared to haul your luggage a long distance  possibly up   flights of stairs  The elevators to the garage  the garage your advised to park in  were broken and had been for months according to staff  The roof top that is advertised is for  residents  only not Airbnb guests  All in all this was a disappointment  Not recommended for older individuals or anyone with knee issues 
389803661036936376,The only toilet broke in the apartment on our first full day  there were   guests  which was already tough to share one bathroom   Zencity was not responsive for an ETA for a fix or any help throughout the process   they did not fix the bathroom or provide us with any sort of solution or remediation   Ultimately ended up not having a usable bathroom  On top of that  the wifi went out and we were unable to use any of our devices 
426105579108828353,Good spot if you re on a budget  Block away from Whole Foods and bus stop  driving distance to downtown 
424735266569927297,Though the location of this unit is perfect and had potential to be a wonderful stay the unit was not clean and we needed to move to a hotel   Immediately upon entering the unit  we were hit by a strong cigarette smell  After walking around in     degree weather waiting for check  in we needed to shower  One of us hopped in the shower and we soon found out they there were no towels in the unit  Not even a hand towel  The  shower was filthy and was covered in the last guest s purple shampoo  The purple shampoo was in the tub and the shower curtain  The shower curtain was covered in mold and extremely dirty   We needed to dry our selves off with back up sheets which were in a closet that unfortunately also had stains    Gross   In between the sink vanity and the cabinet there is black mold which is a health hazard   The bedsheets had hair on them and appeared as though they had not been washed  The carpet was covered in crumbs  and the floors were covered with dust and debris in some sections    The couch pillows were stained   The kicker is that there was a  last clean  sticker by the wifi code  The date on it was over   weeks before our stay   Though the bed was made and the trash had been taken out it was very clear that the unit had not been thoroughly clean in between guests  Which is shocking as it is listed as  enhanced clean    We immediately tried to get in touch with the host and they did not get back to us for hours  until air bnb cancelled our booking   and processed a refund   When that happened  they immediately contacted us   What was extremely frustrating was that all of the other comparable units in the area had been booked and we were unable to relocate with another unit in the central west end with a kitchen or access to a washer dryer  We wound up getting the very last room at a hotel in the area  Needless to say  we reshowered    On a positive note  the doorman was fantastic  Our plane landed at    and they watched our bags for us until check in  The building staff were extremely lovely as well    Air Bnb also support was easy to work with and made it clear from the beginning that we were protected in this situation   I would avoid booking with this company 
409410054542563934,Good location for what we wanted to do while in St  Louis  This particular rental could be made better with a moderate amount of updates and refreshes to paint and furniture  This rental was a  big miss for us  The following were issues we encountered     Light out in bathroom    Inability to control air temperature  Please provide standup fans as an alternative  It was very hot and uncomfortable     Paint the walls  The pictures online appear are very different from what actually is  The walls are very dirty      Paint on bathtub    Shower and sink did not drain    Perhaps invest in a new couch  It is worn and stained  We didnt even sit on it     The lock for the door is not secure  Anyone could break it in easily  There was a guy pounding on the door next to us  screaming in the middle of the night at whoever was inside  You could see peeks of the outside through the crack of the door itself  It was scary 
452849703405296795,The A C wasn t working for the first day and a half of our stay  and it was extremely hard to get a response from the hosts without going through Airbnb first  The hosts had the maintenance people come on the second day with no warning  and we had to cancel plans we had because the maintenance people were given no instruction on how to get back into the unit without us there  The key FOB given to us did not work to access the unit  even though it was supposed to as specified in the check in instructions  On our last night of our stay  we were locked out of the building because the keypad screen was frozen and the key FOB couldn t grant us access into the building  I could not get ahold of the hosts until I finally reached out to Airbnb support  The hosts did nothing to help  They just kept asking for photo and video proof that we could not get into the building  We waited outside for   hours just to get back into the unit  The only reason we even got back in was because of a resident walking her dog  This will be the last time I book an Airbnb from this company 
431819302523250702,Just didn t meet my standards  Property is old and the clean crew sucks  I got to one unit it was dirty  Communication suck and once I got in touch with somebody I was told I couldn t get a refund so they moved to another unit in a different building cleaner but old and the shower curtain was nasty dirty
745621661,The apartment overall was fine  There were handprints on the window and stains on the couch  Unfortunately had a period of no WiFi while I was there and the host didn t respond until     am  Other than that  it was very cute  Check in was quick and easy  Street parking is terrible  Better off paying for a lot  I would book again though  There were handprints all over the windows and liquid stains all over the couch  There was also stains on the back of the couch  The WiFi went out at     pm and when I tried to reach out she didn t respond until     am  Unfortunately I was trying to do work on my laptop and wasn t able to complete it because I didn t get a response
434712008449621044,We got there and the electric lock wasn t working properly   The code they gave us didn t work   We called and did get it all worked out but it was kind of a pain   The AC wasn t working and they had floor units but they really didn t do much   It was hot in there   The location is excellent but the AC being out in August made it a rough stay   I messaged Airbnb to send someone to check it out but never got a response  The AC in the place was not working and the electronic lock was not working properly when we got there   Overall it was a decent experience but I don t know if I would recommend it to anyone until the AC gets fixed
745593501,I wish they would have spent more time setting up this place before making it available on Airbnb  TV wasnt set up  No lightbulbs in lamps  Price tags on decorative items  Also  we were only given two towels for the two of us for the entire weekend  No washcloths  No hand towels  I also had to ask multiple times for check in information  They finally sent it an hour after the scheduled check in 
438333860454118131,BEWARE  READ AND BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS      I have rented many Airbnb s  This is by far the worst experience I have had  I wished I believed the negative reviews and steered clear   to note for everyone  the host ZenCity is a large property management company that specializes in marketing and AirBnB and drives their costs down by offering terrible management services   here are the Key issues I ran into  They are all common themes amongst reviews     the digital locks malfunction OFTEN  we were locked out of the property for an entire evening  We called the host  a call center in the Philippines is who answers  and we were on the phone with them for   hours  in the rain  with my   and    year old daughters  to argue with them about the problem and they never sent anyone to help us  We gave up and got a hotel for the night   We made videos and provided to the host on how their new wifi   digital only locks were not accepting input     service is terrible  if you have an emergency  liked a family of   with young kids being locked out for the entire night due to a wifi lock not working   there is no actual owner   people available  ZenCity  the host  is a large property manager and you only talk to call center representatives in the Philippines   When we eventually had to get a hotel for the night  the host even argued   declined to reimburse us for the hotel  Luckily Airbnb is handling this for us      the property is filthy  Crumbs on counter tops  sticky floors and hand railings  hair on rugs  stains on towels etc  even trash left on the rooftop patio    the property is run down  The clothes dryer doesn t work  the toilets run  the outdoor furniture is moldy  literally     the property stinks  like cigarette smoke and dust   All in all  it is house is a run down dump with worn out trendy furniture that is run by a large company who don t really care about the property  their service  or you   It s better suited as a party house for a beer pong match and not a place any family  especially with younger children should consider   And to the host  shame on you  Your business model puts the end consumer dead last  We were locked out ALL NIGHT because of malfunctioning digital locks and you had no contingency plan for emergencies  What if one of my children had medication  What if we had an infant and needed formula  diapers etc   It disgusts me how little you think about the peoples lives who rent your homes  This is a terrible business model offering fully outsourced services with no real ownership  and one of the reasons AirBnb has a bad name amongst homeowners  You should be thrown off this platform  As discussed  the property was very dirty  the clothes dryer did not work  and the lock malfunctioned and there was no physical key available   you were unable to have anyone help us while locked out
394927800831001657,We spent an hour trying to enter the apartment because the lock was broken  so we just sat outside on hold with all of our luggage after traveling in July  then when we finally got inside  they hasn t clean from the last guests
394161658425472554,The actual host answered everything great   The operation host  Zencity  was rude and did not take care of problems   Wished I could have talked with the host instead   Location was great  Place looks like it says  The clean company needs to be replaced  I talk to several agents  some acted like they cared  One was down right rude  I sent pictures with the problems of the hair balls  long strands of black hair in every room  the one bedroom bed was actual broken on the bottom  bedroom closest to street   By the way my daughters are blond and I have very short grey hair  The dishes and silverware were disgusting  Asked if there could be a discount on the clean  since I then vacuum and picked up and re ran the dishwasher   Was told I had to wait at least a week to see if they would counter   As of today that still has not happened  The one that was rude told me that the cleaners had sent pictures and it WAS clean  I told her that I had sent pictures also   I am not unhappy with the place  just that IT WAS NOT CLEAN and felt very much that Zencity was rude  Thus the rating   Should have seen that coming by the other viewers 
745552250,if it wasnt for how dirty the place was    it was a close location to university chicago medical center and walking distance to the lake    to bad the place was filthy bed was full of hair  fridge was gross  definitely not covid    clean
745466347,Nice places but very poor communication  They have no thermostat so hopefully they get this worked out  I would love a return phone call  And some customer service to deal with these issues   I ve been trying to reach someone about my stay for   days  Supposedly booked two studios bc they didn t have anything to sleep two people   Even was told they couldn t offer one w a couch  One place ended up being a full apartment w couch and bedroom and could have slept    Also had no thermostat in hmeither room and the place was insanely hot over a warm Chicago weekend  Also no lights in master bedroom  Key pad code did not work  Got a return call hours later w a new code Absolutely impossible to reach  Miscommunication about the rooms  Very unhappy  Still have yet to get a return phone call  I paid for two rooms when I didn t need to  Was told both were studios and one was a full apartment that could have accommodated   people
745436565,The location was perfect  And the beds were heaven  I wish there were more comforts  like nicer shampoo or soap  paper towels etc     and please trash the rug that was there     The intercom at the front door didn t work as described  but once I got on   it was fine The apartment was really comfortable  although a bit smaller than what it seemed in the pictures   but no big deal  The bad thing was the rug  which she d like an old dog   the entire apartment was full of lint  if you sat down anywhere  you d be covered in it  I d definitely suggest trashing it  and maybe getting a new rug
745074287,The condo was grossly misrepresented  The condo was not professionally clean  carpet was not vacuumed and kitchen floors were not mopped   stove and vent for the stove was dorty  dead bugs on the floor  bug trap with a lot of dead bugs inside of it  horrible smell of smoke and other orders  extra pillow had blood stains  stains on comforter  urine stains on the bed skirt that looked like a small animal urinated on it  and more  I have pics and video to prove  The claims show up much better in the video  The location was great but the place was too nasty to stay  It was my first airbnb stay and it was horrible  Left and stayed at a Marriott hotel instead  The location was grossly misrepresented  I have video evidence to prove and I want to share with you  Could you please provide an email so I can do so 
745040993,Good location near Whole Foods  Apartment was clean but there was an empty cigar box under the radiator and mint box on the counter  so not clean well enough because there was still some garbage  Host was communicative when I locked myself out of the apartment  but did not respond to my inquiry on how to find the washer advertised on the listing  I found an empty cigar box under the radiator and an empty mint box on the kitchen counter when I entered in the apartment the first time  Its clear someone clean and vacuumed  but they missed some spots  I never got a response from the host regarding the washer advertised on the listing  Not all amenities listed were present 
445586200193083109,Bad experience  The reviews are      accurate  the walls in this unit are made of paper  You can hear water flushing and feet stomping like they are inches away from you  The entire unit was so poorly constructed we thought the door was going to come off during our stay  Absolutely not worth the price we paid for it  Would not recommend  I am blown away by what we paid for this unit  Over      a night for this unit was outrageous  You need to have someone check out the door frame on the entrance  because it is about to come off the hinges  Will not be recommending this unit or your company to anyone

431124064888094698,Cute apartment  Right in downtown 
744329601,This place is in a pretty building near the lake   Our price was great compared to a decent hotel in the area   Definitely more space and options than a hotel   BUT  kitchen was not nearly  fully stocked  and Im not talking about food  theres not an actual coffee maker  hodge podge of utensils and a couple of goodwill pots   four plates and four bowls and some mismatched glasses   Threshhold between the kitchen and living area had nailheads sticking up and was not secured to the floor   The odd shaped bathroom toilet is awkward to use as it looks    There was insufficient heating control and it was very hot without opening windows   Poor responsiveness when asked questions about local TV and temp control   There was one tiny tube of shower gel for   people   Solid  reliable wifi   Dont expect vacation level amenities   Some details need to be looked after better   Once stay begins responsiveness wasnt what it needed to be   IF its a great price  its better than a hotel for a basic stay  Nice location   Nice price   Almost great clean  but there were icky crumbs in cabinets and a piece of cereal in the living area  otherwise well done    but price varies throughout the year so sometimes  not as competitive against hotels   Temp control was really bad   Some radiator controls were laying on the floor  broken  One bed was completely unacceptable it was so hard   Almost no comfortable place to sit  Kitchen was kind of a joke when called FULLY STOCKED   No soap for shower   WHoever staffs  Zencity  does not know enough about the unit and does not give quick  helpful advice   TV heating questions were answered flippantly  Solid  reliable wifi  appreciated Kitchen is not  fully stocked   virtually not dishes  Junk pots and pans   Only a press coffee maker   Apartment temperature control was terrible  Some of the maintenance was BAD   threshhold between kitchen and living area was not secured and DANGEROUS  We were only given ONE Key for   people Kitchen   I have photos   Crumbs and debris in empty cabinet PRE Stay it was fine   By e mail messaging  sometimes host did not respond for several hours AND was unhelpful Excellent compared to the COST of a hotel   HOWEVER  Amenities were substandard   Only ONE tiny tube of bath gel  i e   SHOWER SOAP  in the entire unit   Some of the radiator controls were broken it was HOT and we had to open windows even though it was about    degrees outside   Ktichen was barely operable virtually no pots and pans no cooking oil  maybe not salt and pepper no coffee maker  but billed as FULLY STOCKED   No advice on how to access any local programming  NEW WEATHER  on Television   Just a kindle fire TV box full of pay apps   Threshhold between kitchen and living area had sharp edges of nails sticking up  toilet in angles bathroom is almost unusable to sit down for anyone taller than       At least one bed was awful   hard as a rock   Never slept on anything that terrible that wasnt a floor 
744328105,We were headed to Chicago to visit colleges with my daughter  The location was perfect  The place looked too good to be true   and it was  The bathroom shower was clogged so we stood in dirty shower water  I notified them right away and there was no response until late the next day  We went out and bought Liquid Plumber and prayed it would work  It sort of did  but still wasnt draining properly  There was a yippy dog that barked most of the daytime that we were there  Luckily  it stopped at night  Then while we were trying to sleep  water pipes were ticking all night long followed by swooshes of water  We were supposed to be there for   nights  but couldnt stand it  The lack of sleep was getting to us all  We ended up leaving a day early and spending the night at a hotel  Unfortunately  this place only had   review when we booked  so I trusted that itd be a great place  Do yourself a favor and book somewhere else    Unless you plan on getting wasted and passing out at this place so you dont mind any of the noises  On the upside  the appliances and kitchen were nice and clean  and the place had a cute deck out back to hang out  The location is awesome  but parking was hard  We ended up doing SpotHero which worked out better  If you stay in this area or downtown  dont bring a car  The public transportation is awesome  You can take the L almost anywhere  still waiting for reimbursement for inconvenience and the liquid plumber we bought  Really disappointed in the delay and lack of response from your company  overall  the place was clean  but the bathroom shower was not  It was clogged and left us standing in a pool of dirty water when we showered  I emailed and called about the clogged shower and there was no response until the next day  It was so gross that we had to go out and buy Liquid Plumber and pray that it worked  The clogged shower  a barking dog all day  creaking floors from the person above us  and loud pipe noises all night long  Wasnt worth it  We even left a day early because we couldnt take it 
392713923370032756,The property was in a great central location  however the parking was horrible  Checking in was a nightmare  I had to reach out to receive check in information as it was not provide it before hand  Then after    hours on the road get to the property and the code does not work  After calling customer service I was on hold for    minutes just to be told they would call me back in    After    minutes I called them back just to be told to download an app to enter the property  The app did not work as the last person was still connected to it and no way to disconnect them  So for another    to    minutes we were given code after code to try entry none of which worked  The final code which was    digits long finally worked  Once inside all of the blinds were broken and the shower did not work properly  I had to call customer service several times during my stay  the only rep that tried to resolve any issues was Mariano  I hope I spelled that right  This property is listed as an apartment but it really feels like a college dorm  I would not recommend if you are looking for an apartment 
435469625434765239,Ok  so I am going to start with the biggest issue  On the day I was leaving  I found a dead bed bug in my clothes that I picked up off the floor  I immediately messaged Zencity to tell them about this and to ask if they had previously had a bed bug issue or what the deal was  I messaged them on      and it is now     and they still have not replied  This is terrible customer service  Please READ ALL THE REVIEWS  I wish I did  If you read them all  the complaints that people have are valid and      true      Communication is non existent  They send you form messages and there is not a human to check the inbox apparently      The place is dirty  Both beds had hair in them  And it reeks of cigarette smoke  All my clothes and luggage smelled like it after returning home it was that bad     The photos online are either photoshopped or very old  The walls are filthy and covered in patches and different colored paint  It looks really run down for the price you are paying      The stairwell is super dirty and sketchy  Multiple steps creek and sound like they may fall in at any minute      The neighborhood is the only nice thing about this place  HOWEVER  please note that it is not convenient to get downtown and to the major tourist destinations  Maybe it was pre Covid when an Uber Lyft didnt cost     each way  but now it is not  Like I just said  Ubers Lyfts were very expensive to get downtown and the subway is a    minute walk  Plus  once you get to the subway many popular places require you to transfer trains and then walk about    minutes after you get off the train  So in short  it took us       minutes to get anywhere which used up a lot of time and was also just really frustrating      Oh and this one didnt really matter  but it is principle  They sent a message saying to  enjoy the snacks they provided us  but there were no snacks lol     So again  read all the reviews  the things people are saying that are negative are true  I would not stay here and would not rent from Zencity  Those that had a positive experience must have very low standards  I messaged you about finding a bed bug over a week ago and you still havent answered  Luckily  as of right now it seems like it was just a dead one and there wasnt any live ones that left any eggs   but it is still really bad business that you never answered me  I gave ample time for a reply before resorting to leaving you a bad review  I would never stay at one of your places again 
744317898,First off  the location was perfect  We were walking distance from a lot of landmarks  restaurants  stores and bars and a short Uber ride away from surrounding neighborhoods so you definitely dont need a car when staying here  The pictures represent the space well  but it was a little smaller than expected  The views from the balcony are great   The one  and very important thing  we didnt like was the level of cleanliness of the apartment  With COVID  I expected the space to be spotless with the advertised thorough clean they provide but it wasnt  Upon arrival  we saw hair from the previous occupant was all over the shower and sink in the bathroom  The floor was also dusty  This made me call into question the cleanliness of everything else in the apartment  which left me and my partner uneasy    Also  the walls are thin and we could hear the banging of our neighbors door every time they walked in and out of the apartment    Overall  if the cleanliness issue is resolved  I would consider staying again because the location was great  Definitely suggest a deep clean of the apartment  The bathroom was not clean and still hard hair of the previous occupant all over the shower and sink  The floor was also dusty  During these times  cleanliness is very important and expected 
744107375,Beautiful views and GREAT location  near John Hancock and Water Tower    However  cleanliness is an issue  An easy resolution to this would have been responding to me after you knew no one came to clean as you said they would   The apartment was beautiful and we would have loved to book it again  but obviously we will not return to this property  The view was amazing and so was the location   My daughter and I were able to walk pretty much anywhere we wanted to go as the apartment is about three blocks from the John Hancock Building  The sheets on the sofa bed were stained in multiple places and there was a used pillow on the floor under the sofa   I sent multiple messages regarding this and the rug in the living room needing to be vacuumed   Zencity replied saying they would send someone out that day   IF someone showed up   the sheets were not changed and the rug was not vacuumed   That evening when I emailed back I received no response   I emailed two more times and still received no response  Communication was great until I put in a second request to have the apartment clean properly   After that  I received no additional responses   It is really disappointing because the view and location would have brought us back repeatedly 
744080451,A few things to note if youre renting this stay   Hosts are very responsive and helpful  Check in was very easy  The walls are very thin  You can hear the people above you pretty clearly and when the toilet flushes or shower runs in unit above its pretty loud  Location is awesome  close to Chicago Ave and shops restaurants  Recommend bringing your own pillows as the ones provided are pretty thin  Hi  I know i texted this  but the bathroom cleanliness was a bit disappointing since the last two reviews mentioned the bathroom was not thoroughly clean  Also  the fridge smells odd and inside of the oven needs to be clean   Pillows were also pretty thin uncomfortable  Would recommend replacing the couch as it smelled of smoke and there was a moderate hole in it  not in photos   Lastly the listing stays there was digital keyless entry I believe  but thats not the case  All in all  had a good visit but think a few minor updates could have made it great 
394198768634024671,The location was great  Could walk or scooter all over downtown  BUT  we couldnt get into the apartment twice   Really bad lock issues  Also  because they couldnt get a code to work we had one Bluetooth opener and   separate people staying so had to coordinate when we could all get in   We spent over     hours being locked out   So  if theres other places in the area I would probably go there instead of this  but it works if youre not picky and just want a great location   It wasnt super clean either  Not being able to get in twice and have to wait for over       hours was awful   Getting in touch with someone was hard too   It was a little dirty in the bathrooms but the location was perfect  
395597678232404998,smaller than picture but overall is clean and okay for the price  Also right above the train station  Refused to help me with any problems 
392214637291954530,The unit was absolutely filthy  When we checked in there was hair in the shower  a filthy stove  shockingly dirty glasses  dish ware and cutlery  dusty vents  and a pungent smell of cat litter  There is also a neighbor who smokes on the deck and you can smell the cigarette smoke in the kitchen  The entrance foyer is filthy as well    We reported the issues to Zencity but they were not very helpful in resolving these issues  When we decided to cancel the reservation and request a refund  Zencity was not helpful at all and we have taken the matter up with Airbnb    Avoid this place and the management company    Do not book with Zencity  They will take your money and not refund you  The unit was absolutely filthy  The stove had grease marks  the was hair in the shower and on the sink  the neighbors smoke and the smell infiltrates into the unit  the carpets were stained  the walls were stained  the building entrance was filthy  I wouldnt recommend the unit or Zencity to any one 
394191218910189439,The location was great  We had wifi issues and found what we think could be a bed bug on the mattress  The issue with the wifi password was huge  My guest and I needed wifi to work and I constantly told you all that the password was wrong and no one listened  We also found a bed bug when checking the mattress 
743180613,I would give this place a        but since the reviews can only be left in full numbers  I am giving what is a VERY GENEROUS     stars  If this listing was more properly advertised  I would not have as many problems  but it is not  Under the amenities of this listing  it lists there is free street parking available which is not the case  Once I had already made our booking  I received a message from the staff informing me how to purchase street parking which was limited to   hour sessions  I had not been planning to use my car during the stay once we arrived  so being limited to   hour sessions was incredibly inconvenient  Fortunately  I was able to get a paid space in a lot that was a    minute walk away  however  if I had known this was going to be an issue in the first place  I would have chosen to stay elsewhere  Additionally  upon arrival at the apartment  we were quite off put by the state of cleanliness  The floors were notably dirty    I was sure to always wear socks during the stay  The walls in the bedroom area were also quite dusty  Also  the staff was not aware of the correct name of their wifi network  so there was no internet until day   when I finally figured out the network MYSELF through the process of elimination and plugging the given password into random networks  I will say this is not the worst experience I have had with Airbnb  however  I was overall incredibly dissatisfied with this stay especially when comparing it to the expectations I had based on the original listing and the listings reviews  The cleanliness of the apartment is pretty concerning  There is noticeable dust on the walls and the floor is clearly not swept well   Also  you need to update the listing itself because it says the street parking on the premises is free which it is not  The wifi name you have on file for providing to guests is incorrect as well  The staff kept providing the network name as everywhere wireless  but the actual name was EWfiber com  ghz The photos made the cleanliness of the apartment quite misleading  Responsive  but did not know correct answers to questions at times  Would have been a good value if experience had been what was expected 
434750213198412092,So I really thought this was going to be a great stay  and if Zencity has responded to me I think it would have been  Starting with check in  they should tell you to park out front with your hazards on while you get the key and ask for a cart to load your things  I never figured out how to use the parking pass  so every time I went in the garage I used the call button and told them I didn t understand  and the garage let me out  Check out is also confusing  so I would again park out front with your hazards    Next  the smell  I failed to read other reviews and only looked at the star rating when I booked  but this place smells like rotten egg  I m not sure if it s a gas leak or just smells like that  but looking at other reviews  it s a persistent problem  That alone really didn t bother me  after a few minutes you get used to it  and the place is so nice  It looks super clean  has a cute view  nice people in the halls  and the location is just amazing    But  then I went to bed  And as soon as I laid down  it smelled like pee  So of course I finally message Zencity  They said they would send some one in to check if I allowed  I agreed if they let me know when because I have my dog with me  and they didn t reply for over    hours  I told them that was ridiculous  so they never responded and never came to look at it  I stayed here for   nights in a pee bed and never heard back from them OR AIRBNB    If they had come and made things right I really wouldn t care or be writing this review  because mistakes happen  But the lack of care on there part and on Airbnb s blows my mind  So yeah  I would highly advise not staying with Zencity  It s confusing  gross  and they won t respond to your problems 
410154686534955315,This host is VERY unprofessional    This place was very dirty  no clean service what so ever  I sent in pictures  spoke with   different people  they emailed and said they started a refund but ever contacted me or Airbnb  it has been weeks   I have yet to receive a refund  I called Airbnb and they told me that this host didn t even create a case to be refund  I have NEVER left a review on anything before that s how horrible my experience has been  Cleaning service horrible
449939310201031082,n a Check in and using the system to get into the building was challenging  would recommend tweaking if possible  The apartment was also not a nice clean as the pictures made it look   they could have been a bit outdated but the apartment was pretty worn 
742118402,If it is not spring   warm out yet  the umbrella won t be up on the patio so you won t have any cover if it s raining  The neighbors called in a noise complaint at     pm even though quiet hours are listed as   pm and we were simply talking at normal level and playing uno  Otherwise  the place was very nice and had a great location and the stay was good overall  We were disappointed upon arrival to see that the back porch  which in the pictures is represented as having a large covered umbrella area  is actually completely uncovered as the umbrella wasn t there  It rained one night  so we couldn t enjoy the patio at all  and that was what we were most looking forward to  Additionally  the air b b listing lists   pm as the quiet hours time  but we received an automated noise complaint at only     pm  while we were sitting around chatting and quietly playing uno  Must be some grumpy neighbors  don t expect to even be able to play music here past  pm  apparently  Otherwise  space was really nice and mostly clean and we enjoyed our stay  Thanks 
394117328500547245,We were very disappointed  The apartment was not clean well  stained bedding  nasty shower curtain   I was not comfortable  but Lysol and Clorox wipes helped    Positives  good rate and walkable location  We did not receive a  welcome packet   only a key  The apartment was not clean  The shower curtain and shower walls had mold mildew and stains  The bedspread had stains  I wish I had not stripped the bed before we left   The couch had stains  There was gunk on surfaces and remote  We went out to buy clean products  Items were in disrepair  the shower handle came off in my hand  the iron was busted  discovered after it leaked all over   the bathroom exhaust fan was caked with dust   The wifi did not work for our devices  We did email and received a prompt response with alternatives    Positives  it was a place to stay at a lower rate for a last minute trip  the door staff were friendly  the apartment was in a walkable location 
413004242274297283,I will say before getting into things that the apartment itself was not bad  It had decent space  a nice kitchen area  and a good sized closet  The neighborhood as well is a decent area all things considered  Thats basically where the positives stop  Getting into the apartment was frustrating and stressful  I received an email with basic instructions on how to get into the building  but took me several minutes to even find the apartment as the instructions on how to get there are clear as mud  Once I get there  there is an electronic keypad to get into the apartment  The code I was sent didnt work  I had to call up support who gave me a code to let me once  and then emailed me a code to use going forward  Once in I grab the FOB and placard to park in the lot  keep in mind you have to park on the street during this time  which you arent supposed to do   I get into the parking lot  and notice there are numbers on the spaces in the lot  and a number on the placard  but not a matching space number to the placard number  I call up support again  who after going back and forth told me that all they could do was suggest I call the parking lot attendant  there isnt one and it was nearly midnight   Eventually I just parked in a spot and walked around looking at other peoples placards to verify whether there was assigned parking or not  Once I parked I got back to get into the room  new code doesnt work  Call up again to get a new code  and the rep just gives me another new code  Next day  same issue  Im told eventually I need to download an app  which I really didnt want to do  but was basically told it would be the only way to ensure Id be able to consistently get access to the apartment  As far as the apartment itself  it was far from perfect  You can tell that the apartment has seen better days  There are several spots where the wall has been damaged and paint worn off  Multiple towels have stains in them  and when the AC kicks on you can smell cigarette smoke  Overall I dont think Ill ever get an airbnb from this company again  I will say before getting into things that the apartment itself was not bad  It had decent space  a nice kitchen area  and a good sized closet  The neighborhood as well is a decent area all things considered  Thats basically where the positives stop  Getting into the apartment was frustrating and stressful  I received an email with basic instructions on how to get into the building  but took me several minutes to even find the apartment as the instructions on how to get there are clear as mud  Once I get there  there is an electronic keypad to get into the apartment  The code I was sent didnt work  I had to call up support who gave me a code to let me once  and then emailed me a code to use going forward  Once in I grab the FOB and placard to park in the lot  keep in mind you have to park on the street during this time  which you arent supposed to do   I get into the parking lot  and notice there are numbers on the spaces in the lot  and a number on the placard  but not a matching space number to the placard number  I call up support again  who after going back and forth told me that all they could do was suggest I call the parking lot attendant  there isnt one and it was nearly midnight   Eventually I just parked in a spot and walked around looking at other peoples placards to verify whether there was assigned parking or not  Once I parked I got back to get into the room  new code doesnt work  Call up again to get a new code  and the rep just gives me another new code  Next day  same issue  Im told eventually I need to download an app  which I really didnt want to do  but was basically told it would be the only way to ensure Id be able to consistently get access to the apartment  As far as the apartment itself  it was far from perfect  You can tell that the apartment has seen better days  There are several spots where the wall has been damaged and paint worn off  Multiple towels have stains in them  and when the AC kicks on you can smell cigarette smoke  Overall I dont think Ill ever get an airbnb from this company again 
494924543399064041,Pros   good location  park nearby is really great  property overall as described in the pictures Cons  check in was a nightmare  we had to wait      hours until some person would come and let us in to the building  no available free parking nearby  not possible to turn off heating of the apartments  so if its warm outside   inside might be really hot
741755073,Pros   The location is the best attribute in my opinion  The neighborhood is quiet and seems safe  There are a lot of restaurants  bars  stores  etc  within walking distance  The townhouse itself is nice  as depicted in photos   Plenty of towels and spare sheets  etc  Washer and dryer are a nice amenity to have  The patio and grill are a nice feature  charcoal grill  you will need to buy your own charcoal to use   Check in and check out is super easy  Parking situation was easy to figure out and I had no issues  or tickets     Cons  Communication feels template and or computer generated sometimes  I asked a question that didnt get answered  I personally had no issues but if you suddenly have a specific question for the host during your stay  you may not get an answer  The comforter in the master bedroom smelled like body odor in some spots  I wonder if the bed sheets were ever washed  The other guests did not complain about their sheets  however  The WiFi connection was spotty    Overall  The location is great and I enjoyed my stay  Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance  I was generally comfortable  Generally  the temperature defaults to warm   If youre a stickler for cleanliness then this may not meet your standards  The pictures are mostly accurate except for the patio roof deck  The patio furniture and the patio itself are worn dirty from natural weather  The wood is a little warped  It seems neglected  The WiFi was real slow and sometimes not working  Bed sheet in master bedroom didnt seem washed  Everything else is as advertised  The comforter in the master bedroom smelled like someone slept on it before  body odor  and it hadnt been washed since  The other sheets are suspect  in regards to being washed   None of the other guests complained about their sheets though  Communication is clear but they seem like template and or computer generated responses  I asked about what we need to do before check out  like what to do with the towels  sheets  etc   but I didnt get a response  Instead  I got a template response    min before checkout  It was basically a reminder to checkout by   am and dont leave anything behind  Its not a big deal   but if you have a specific question  it may not get answered  Overall it was a good stay  My rating is based on the relationship between the price and the feedback I provided above  cleanliness  location  communication  etc   
395595053921992307,Honestly the place is not as nice as it looks in the pictures  The location is great  and its spacious  but thats about all it has going for it  The rugs were filthy  and several parts of the wall molding were broken  The kitchen had a funny smell  we ended up buying an apartment spray because it smelled strange every time we came back  and when we opened windows the windowsills were covered in dust  soot  If it wasnt as pricey Id say its a good deal  but for whats basically the same price as a hotel room  youre better off with the hotel  Itll be much cleaner  The rug in the living room needs to be thrown out  It was filthy  The bedroom rug was also dirty  Several walls were dirty as well  The kitchen smelled strange  not sure if it was the washer dryer  or a sink issue  The back door also had a broken hinge  and there were several broken pieces in the apartment  The window sills were also very dirty  The code to the building was also wrong so we had to wait several days before getting the correct code  we had to enter through a different building and use the garage entrance  
394934424250866490,I would not recommend renting this property  It was not clean  The tub and sink in the bathroom were slow draining   There was no coffee pot and very sparse kitchen utensils  It was a very nice large space but very poorly maintained  There was a large living room and dining room but no dining room furniture  Our check in process was very disconcerting  There was no key in the primary box and no key in the back up box  The key finally found was in the clean service box  This whole process took     hours  The check in process was very difficult  You have that info in your records  The unit was not clean  The bathroom sink and tub were slow draining  There was no coffee pot in the kitchen and there were very sparse other kitchen utensils  no hot pads and more  The dining room had a very small cafe table and   very small chairs  There was no dining room furniture  The most worrisome thing however was the condition of the door lock  It was a dead bolt but the space the dead bolt went into was larger than the bolt  The bolt did lock deeper into the door but the door was very loose and we believe it could have been kicked in easily 
439779430423011040,Out stay was well  The loft is as shown in the picture  Just letting you know that your shower head is leaking and the water shooting out is hitting the vanity lights 
741312577,This place was filthy   Whoever clean it prior to our arrive did an awful job  Had to demand a refund from Airbnb  because the owners stopped answering my calls after I requested a refund  which lead to several other issues   There is only one tv in the entire apartment  The bedrooms were small and crammed   Parking was horrible   Not the best location  Dogs were barking non stop 
395667004517403836,The apartment is in a nice location near Barnes Jewish Hospital  the Central West End  a walkable neighbor with lots of coffee shops and restaurants  and the great Forest Park  one if not the largest city park in the US  The building is the Moncler  one of the first high rise of the CWE that has been partially renovated  The apartment is spacious and well kept  The bathroom needs some updating  The main issue was that this apartment came up on the website when I requested   adult guests  While it was clear that there was only   bedroom  it was not clear from the website that the sofa was not a sofabed  The sofa in the living romm was not in any way a substitute for a third bed  Moreover  there were no sheets  pillow  nor comforter even for the sofa  When I called to ask how come there was no third bed  requesting either a change or a roller bed  the answer was that I had not read the website accurately  I guess that would imply that when I asked for an apartment for   adult guests one is going to sleep on the floor  Initially  they seemed to be favorable either to a change of apartment or to a roller bed  then they said that management had approved only to deliver a comforter and sheets for the sofa  My point is that this apartment is not in ANY way appropriate for   adult guests  Overall I would recommend not showing this apartment for   guests  only for   
397045690415138179,The only real issue here is the lack of free parking but if youre willing to pay a few bucks a day or not needing to park most of the day  its a decent walkable area to be in  Unit itself was fine as a place to sleep  Better off just getting a hotel probably The lack of free parking should have been highlighted more up front in my opinion and the front door code for the building didnt always work   The space was fine generally  Mostly just issues with parking and getting in a few times along with a  broken dryer
394937427473892736,Me and   other guests just completed our stay here and felt very mixed in our review    Pros  The location is awesome and the apartment complex is quite secure  If you don t have a key fob you can t access anything within the complex  We felt safe within the apartment  It also had a parking spot which was very helpful  It was within walking distance of the power and light district as well as many cafes and restaurants  The beds were quite comfy    Cons  Unfortunately we had a lot of issues with Zen city  We quickly realized they are a large company that are in it for the money and not to help guests  When we arrived the access code for the key didn t work  After calling they were able to quickly help us get a spare  Once we were inside we found that there were only   towels for   guests for   nights  This was obviously an issue  I reached out asking if they d bring towels and while they responded quickly and assured us they would be bringing towels ASAP and it was a priority we never got towels despite asking and hearing the same response each day  This was very upsetting as we felt they were just dragging us along when we would have been understanding if they had just said they were unable to provide more towels  We had guests using hand towels and paper towels to dry off and zen city never made an attempt to help fix this  We felt that the service  the apartment  and the cleanliness were not worth the high price that we paid to stay here  It did not seem very clean  the bedding had stains on it  there were dust bunnies everywhere  and the apartment was not very homey and incredibly empty except bare basics  We tried to be very understanding guests  When we arrived the code we received to access our key didn t work  it said there was no key with that code  Upon calling we were able to get the spare key  no big deal  However  when we entered the unit we only had   towels for   guests for   nights  I contacted zen city Friday at   to ask for more towels and we were told they would be delivered to us ASAP  However  they were not  I contacted again on Saturday and on Sunday and each time we were told that the towels would be delivered to us ASAP and it would be a priority and it was not  We had to use hand towels and paper towels to dry off because only two guests had towels  It would have been one thing if we were just told that you could not provide more towels but you kept jerking us around saying you were bringing towels  It became very very frustrating especially for the ridiculous price that we were paying for the unit  The unit also did not appear as though it had been vacuumed and appeared as thought it was minimally clean  The bedding also had stains on it  Overall we are very displeased with the service of Zencity  While communication was quick  it was all empty words and nothing was ever done or completed 
413736143501139329,Fine place Thank you
396338559509505990,Not accommodating I know you are a big company and it would have been really appreciated had you helped us out with our incident and at least considered a partial refund 
410005905448481302,Arrived and the unit had not been clean after previous guests  It threw a massive wrench in our vacation plans as they would not respond for hours  We had to get a last minute hotel  cancel our reservation and seek a refund through Airbnb because they just left me hanging for over five hours saying they were  looking into it     Im sure the experience would have been smooth if the place was clean  And it probably is     of the time  But in a pinch  they are not on site and their support communication was absolutely horrible 
425264745742039598,Worse air bnb ever  Location was horrible  customer service was even worse  Could not talk to anyone for a while  room and gate key fob was lost  Will never come back again    Worse customer service ever  
410827481757861464,Decent overall stay  We got a good value during the week  Were rushed out at checkout  Was told    and someone knocked and walked in at  am and came back   more times before     We had an   am check out  We had someone WALK INTO our room at around  am and then come back knocking two more times before   am  When they came back again a  th time around    we just grabbed our stuff and left  We were overall pleased with the space  found hairs in the pillow  but cleanliness was okay  Checking out in such a sour manner just kind of ruined the experience for us  It was our first Airbnb experience and we didn t love it because we have never been rushed from a hotel  They know the checkout times and generally leave you alone until then 
431882935889991667,Lots of spiders    in the corners and spider webs   Definitely need to dust   The shower liner is so nasty    like brown at the bottom  When checking in   I walked in circles for about an hour looking for building      and there wasn t a building like that    it s actually        hour and a half before I was due to checkout   I was locked out for    mins bc you disconnected the door thing   Overall wouldn t recommend to anyone who doesn t like to walk far and or an unclean house 
413774736244229283,       decent spot  good eats around the area  nice people everywhere u meet  the tenants of the building seem to be a little unwelcoming but other than that good all in all
468767106532339202,I had few issue during my stay  The internet was not working  This was my second time staying at Zencity  The first time it was pleasant experience but this time I was not happy  The place has bad smell and the place look older and smaller that the pictures  Also the internet was not working and I wasntable to work 
439760282626857397,The apartment fit the description  location was great  decorated very nicely  Check in was all digital  However  it was incredibly dirty with sticky floors  hair  and generally dirty shower  We did not feel comfortable using the shower at all  Generally I am not picky about such cleanliness  but this was excusable  We could not get in contact with Zencity during our time  The apartment was incredibly dirty  There was calcium build up and hair in the shower and sticky floors  It was disgusting  We could not get in contact with you the entire time 
411519019287523803,This apartment condo is in a good location  However  they need to have a better relationship with the front desk  No one was there for check in for at least    minutes when me and   other couples arrived  We were eventually let up by a random tenant that asked if we wanted to use her key fob to go upstairs  The instructions are slightly incorrect on how to get into the room as well  While there for my short stay I saw one roach and one waterbug in the space  They need to do a pest control check in before new persons occupy the space in the future   Overall nice space  but need to update procedural check in standards and cleanliness checks  Please review cleanliness standards in the apartment for pest control reasons 
485526235041436828,This was my first AirBNB experience  I was really unsatisfied with the service  The code they gave me to get in the building did not work  The second one did  That issue was solved fairly quickly  The second day the sink in the kitchen backed up from the drain  I didnt even use the sink  Nasty water was spilling all over the floor  I called them and maintenance came the next day but did nothing to fix it while I was staying there  He said he did not have the correct tools and they would be sending someone else  I never saw them  The last night of my stay the keypad on my door to the room stopped working  This was the real mess of this trip  First  I had to walk to a convenience store to buy a  V battery to try and get it to work in case the batteries were low  This was after midnight  so it was tough to find one open  My phone was running low because I had no access to my charger in the room  The guy on the phone had me download an app to try and work the keypad over Blue Tooth  This did not work either   He told me to go down to the front desk and ask for a key  but there is no front desk  After an hour and a half of trying to get in  I asked it there was anyone he could call that had a key to the second door in the unit that just had a key lock  I guess there wasnt because no one ever came  He said he would try and contact someone but never did  Four hours later he called to see if I had gotten in  I felt like he just left me with no room  bathroom  or my belongings  I would not stay at another ZenCity location  Here are a few suggestions  On check in  make sure you send the correct Front Door code  This one did not take too long to fix  so that was good  Two  make sure maintenance is kept up on in the apartment  The kitchen sink backed up through the drain twice while I was there  Maintenance came but did nothing about it during my stay  Nasty water was pouring all over the floor with no way to stop it  Maybe if you provided an emergency maintenance number or something  Third  make sure the door key pad works to the room  I saw a couple of reviews that said they had an issue and the person I called for my issue also mentioned that it had happened  If it is already a known issue  why hasnt this been fixed  I got back from a concert and the door would not open  The person I called did try to help me at first  We tried downloading an app for Blutooth access and I had to walk a mile to a store to buy a battery to try to make the pad work  Both did not work  The person I called eventually stopped taking my calls for hours and left me waiting in the lobby without my things  a room to stay in  or a bathroom  He was supposed to be trying to contact someone who could come with a key but he did not  My phone was running out of battery because my charger was in the apartment  If that had happed  I dont know what I would have done   I was eventually able to get the door open after physically moving the pad on the door   Four hours later he called me back and asked if I had gotten in  I said I finally did but no one ever came to help  I had to be at the train station early to come back home and if I had waited on him I would not have made it  I did not get to use my last night in the room because of this mess 
411579499437125152,Great quite area with parking included  Not big truck or trailer friendly  The entry when we asked that there not be entry was a big deal with us  We even called to say we did not want entry tell we had returned  The parking pass was not a big deal since we had already stayed a day and half with out it  If it is required it should be in the room upon check in 
413719495617975526,The apartment was fine  although our experience was less than satisfactory due to misinformation in the Airbnb description of the property and a complete lack of communication from the Host  First  we specifically booked this unit because it was listed as having a washer and dryer so we could clean some clothes in the middle of a long trip  It did not have a washer and dryer  and our communications asking the host about this during our stay were completely ignored  I made multiple attempts to communicate with the host  starting immediately after we arrived for our two night stay  and other than a non substantive  we re looking into it  I heard nothing  Second  the unit was listed as being three blocks from public transit  It was much further than that  and it was a hike and took nearly an hour to get to the Loop on transit  If you want a decent unit close to the University of Chicago and don t need anything from the host  this is a fine unit  But the listing was inaccurate on several points that were critical to our experience 
392702763982248106,My stay was great as far as the location  The parking was horrible  I spent most of my trip finding somewhere to park at the building I stay in  The apartment was nice on the inside  and the check in check out process was easy 
391997737013091703,This third floor apartment in an older building has a few issues  but is in a great location  On the positive side  this is a great location  roomy space and comfortable beds  The biggest issue during our stay was that the lock on the door to the outside of the building was broken and not repaired when we reported it  We received a response immediately  but it was not repaired  The second most important issue is that the electricity seems to be shorting throughout the apartment  overhead lights flicker and lamps go off than come back on   could be a fire hazard  Additional issues included not being told that this space was on the third floor and there was no elevator  a very strong order of marijuana smoke in the apartment throughout our entire stay   an air purifier would help  This is a busy street  very noisy at night and the windows are in poor repair so they dont close all the way making it difficult to sleep   Basic amenities like coffee would be really appreciated 
394881744221459174,Check in was listed for  am  When I arrived at      am was told I couldnt check in until  pm  Wasted my day waiting around in a thunderstorm  Customer support was useless didnt have the ability to check me in or fix any problems its all automated  Others had the same issue  Stay somewhere else avoid Zencity properties  booking was listed for  am check in I showed up at      am was told couldnt check in until  pm  Waited   hours when Zencity called me back said I could check in it didnt work they finally canceled the reservation after I wasted my day hanging out in a thunderstorm  I will never use a Zencity property again  Their support staff is useless  They didnt have the ability or knowledge to fix the problem 
394900868829102414,The building is only secure in the front  any joe could walk in the back door without a fob  The entire building smelled of dog urine  Dog urine found in elevator and in hallways  The apartment was clean but that was the only thing that was clean  Parking was too far away and not convenient for a family with lots of luggage  The trashcan in the parking garage on the first floor hadn t  been emptied in probably a month  Wasn t       sure there wasn t a body in it because it about made us vomit when we got out of the car and that was on the third floor  One of the bedrooms had a busted window and they put  tape and a plastic bag to cover the hole  Well it rained  so we couldn t sleep in the room because it was hot and humid  The tv sound was awful had to turn it up loud to hear which wasn t all bad because it drowned out the dogs barking in the hallway  I have never been happier to leave my vacation and would have if there would have been other vacancies in town  Zen city and Airbnb should take this place off there bookings list  I will never use them again  Changed my dates and zen city said it was fine and Airbnb dropped the ball  Then we had to stay an hour away from the city because everything was booked up  I did get a refund but thats besides the point 
395647276104276906,I think it s in a great spot   Easy access to a lot of places   The stay wasn t the best and communication wasn t the best either  I would just say make sure it s more clean next time  Very homey though  
410778548841716759,It was an ok stay  the kitchen was nice and the WiFi was service decent the bathroom was very much my esthetic as well
423904127806481655,Disappointing  To start with  their  parking options  are expensive  Finding the key was like something out of an Indiana Jones movie  Once we finally figured out how to even get in  the apartment is lack luster  The bedrooms have no TV  the living room has a small TV  WiFi is spotty  the shower faucet in the small room was nearly falling out of the wall  the light switch in that same small room was cracked  the chair in the living room had a broken leg    To finish off my stay  the host accused myself and my guest  both    year old sober men  off  peeing the bed  and claimed after our stay a  noise sensor  was missing  It was like they put lipstick on a pig  Do not recommend 
412224857651781824,Buyer beware   My airbnb had no hotwater and I had no response from ZenCity  There was never any hot water and no response from ZenCity on the issue 
453533336551619299,Dirty shower and bathroom  Temperamental door lock and wrong main door code  Charged me twice so I suggest you check your bank statement  Got locked out in the rain when code didnt work  The shower was scary dirty  And got locked out of room  tricky lock  Only good thing was the person on the phone who tried to fix things 
410812416415243772,The place looked great  Had a bit of a stench but nothing terrible  One thing though is we got there around  pm not knowing check in was at    We went back and read through and I gave them a quick text asking about checking in early and they never responded  I walked into the building and there were people still in the apartment when check out was at     Now that Im thinking about it  it was probably the host clean the room before our stay  but I would have liked to receive an answer to my question  We just left our suitcase in our car and did our activities for the day  Once we came back it was as if no one was there which was a relief  The question was never answered though and all of their messages were auto generated  It would be nice to have an actual person in charge of the account in case of questions and emergencies  I would have liked to have a non generated answer when i had a genuine question
440600198977244229,This is my first and only bad review I ve written on Airbnb   The AC did not work  which on its own isn t the end of the world  What happened next though is unacceptable   I called on night   and was told someone would be out the next morning  They also said they would call me with updates  Neither happened   Called on night    exact same conversation on the phone  They said they would call me back with updates and that someone would be out that afternoon  No call  and no one came   Same thing the third night     I m pretty sure every person I spoke to was informed not to call me back since it was   different people and they all seemed sincere  so very likely the owner manager told them to leave me hanging for whatever reason   It was pushing    degrees outside and I was sweating the entire stay    A part of traveling is feel safe and secure and I don t think these owners take their tenants security seriously  If you say you are going to call someone back  then call them back   You ignored me on   occasions
414507479429724354,Close to the lake 
395429878561905968,They double booked and never notified about it  I couldn t get inside the apt bucause somebody else was in there already They double booked the apartment and i had to find out while trying to open the door while the other renters were in the property
440589354111739794,Would not recommend
398489002619774140,Not what I expected Dryer broken  Among other things
403609811726599044,The apartment itself was pretty okay  great location as everywhere we went was within a    minute drive  The dishwasher does not work though so prepare to do the dishes by hand as there was not much silverware  The apartment building though was disgusting  there was dog pee right by the elevator for the last   days we were there and general trash and wet stains all around the floor  There appeared to be no reception people or workers there at all  a garbage man let us in without any identification so anybody could walk into the building and the passcode needed to get in didnt work at all and the building could only be accessed by the key fob inside  Zencity didnt reply with any helpful information when I messaged them about it except for the same info as the previous before you come message  Also the parking garage is a bit of a walk from the building which was a bummer  This wouldve seemed more like a     a night apartment if it wasnt for the central location  the apartment building was disgusting and i wish we wouldve known about that before booking  As far as the apartment itself  the dishwasher didnt work and very quickly we found other peoples hair just around the floor as well as broken glass by the boarded window  Also the dishes there already did not seem clean  some even had food still on them 
402794691005281512,We stayed at Zencity for a total of   nights   This place is an old building  like all of the buildings in this area  and the management converted this into an Air BnB    It is a safe place and we love the neighborhood with walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores   Parking is a little tricky but we had no problem with finding a parking space at it is on the street and required parallel parking    There seemed to be a bit of confusion with the offer for a late check out   First  we were told that we had to check  out at    a m  when we asked if it is possible to have a late checkout   We were told no because there was someone checking in to the place on the same day   Later  we received an email that offers a late check out for an extra       We sent a request but didnt hear from management so we called  was on hold for a long time   We were approved for a late check out after   phone calls and a long hold time  Our only complaint is the awful smell in the stairway coming up to the third floor where the apartment is   There is also smoking fumes  not only from cigarette smoking but also from strong marijuana smoke coming from other apartments through the vents or chimney   I have asthma so it was making it difficult to breathe   I called the management and they offered to clean the apartment with ozone  I am not sure what it is  and it would take   hours to clean   I bought an air freshener to mask the smell on my last night there and didnt bother with the clean   Other than that  I love the area and the place is spacious for   people   I wouldnt recommend this place to someone that couldnt handle the secondhand smoke from cigarettes and marijuana   Your clothes  bath towels will smell like that too  Thank you for responding to my request regarding the apartment with the smell of cigarettes and marijuana   There seemed to be a bit of confusion with the offer for a late check out   First  we were told that we had to check  out at    a m  when we asked if it is possible to have a late checkout   We were told no because there was someone checking in to the place on the same day   Later  we received an email that offers a late check out for an extra       We sent a request but didnt hear from management so we called  was on hold for a long time   We were approved for a late check out after   phone calls and a long hold time 
402184230204706699,The front lock on the building was faulty  Luckily a resident let me in  I did inform Zencity of the issue
440523281431427211,Location is great  Airbnb wasn t has clean as expected  leftover garbage from previous guest  didn t seem to be vacuumed  bathroom was dirty  sink covers for bathroom were covered in hair from previous visitors  Maybe we just had an off clean before our arrival  but I was not impressed and when I communicated there was no response  This Airbnb is a nice location  Unfortunately the cleanliness of the Airbnb was not good and the communication pertaining to this was nonexistent  Rooms had garbage left underneath bed from previous visitors and crumbs on the floor  bathroom was dirty  a significant amount of hair was left on the sink cover  There was no coffee pot as indicated  there was a French press  which was fine  but something to be noted  Also  you have no control over the temp in the Airbnb it was    degrees and fairly warm  Overall the best part was the location 
396372999836896478,Great location  and check in was very easy but we had some issues during our stay  The clean job wasnt the best  The appliances  microwave   dishwasher  did not work for over half of our month long stay  The team at Zencity is quick to respond but they say theyll get back to you and then often dont ever follow up until you reach out again    The space is cute but should note that its a little smaller than it looks in pictures   the couch   tv are so low to the ground so the room looks bigger 
398554998563513015,The unit itself was fine   Communication with and assistance from Zencity was extremely poor  The unit itself was fine   My only complaints about the unit are as follows   One  initially entering the building with the access code provided was nearly impossible   I was only able to gain access when another resident let me in   This is the second time I have stayed at a Zencity location and had difficulty with the building access code  although in both cases the elevator code and door code for the individual unit worked     Two  the bed in the unit was very uncomfortable   It was the same type of bed as we had in the last Zencity unit we rented in KC  we knew from that experience how uncomfortable these beds are    Because we were staying for a full month  we had to purchase a foam topper  at significant additional expense  to make the bed acceptable   Third  the unit was equipped with a sound sensor and we received  alerts  when we were allegedly being too noisy   We received  alerts  when we were doing nothing more than running the washing machine or watching TV at a normal level   In fact  we received an  alert  once when no one was in the unit   We received no complaints from our neighbors   Clearly  the sensor was set at too sensitive a level   The repeat  alerts  were frustrating     Our biggest complaint related to communication with and the ability to get assistance from Zencity staff   Because we had a month long rental  it was necessary for my son to have a prescription  which he receives by mail   delivered to the unit we were renting at the Cambria apartment complex in KC   The tracker indicated that the package had been delivered to the units mailbox and when he tried to retrieve it we discovered that he had no key to the mailbox and no way to access it   On Friday June     I reached out to Zencity using the phone number provided on email communications   The woman I spoke to said she would work on getting us access to the mailbox but that they might not have the situation resolved until the following week   When I had not heard anything by the next Tuesday  I called again and spoke with Mariano   He seemed responsive and said that they were aggressively trying to resolve the problem   I spoke to Mariano throughout the week and while he was always nice  no progress was made   At the beginning of the following week  when we had not yet been provided a key     days later   I began pushing for a clearer explanation of the problem   It seemed to me that either the Zencity property manager in KC was unwilling to come to the site or that Zencity did not have a key   I was never able to get a straight answer as to why this problem could not be resolved   I pointed out that we were nearing the end of our rental period and thus the problem needed to be resolved promptly   I was promised that the area manager would deliver the mailbox key to the apartment by July    which did not happen    When I tried to call and find out why this promise had not been fulfilled I could no longer get anyone to answer my call   I assume that the call center had caller ID and had grown tired of dealing with me 
415142287600623543,Same as last time   robo company that only gives robot responses  You did nothing to help my experience
412968444270069472,Unit itself is not bad  We received a message    minutes before our  pm check in that the unit would not be available until       after we had already paid for transportation for a  pm arrival  They claimed it was due to a late check out  but the clean crew didnt even arrive until        Wifi information is not accurate  We had to contact the property multiple times  attempted   different wifi network password combinations before they finally sent us the correct information    It was a frustrating stay  but would have been much better if Zencity was better at communication 
521792201182108758,Could not get into the building the whole stay  Had to have tenants let us in every time we went out  which made leaving a chore  Tenants stated that this issue was known and nothing is ever done to remedy the problem  Upon arriving to check in  was also unable to get the key out of the key box  Had to call and have somone open it remotely  Pictures online are deceiving  What looks like a upscale loft is actually an subpar apartment  Hardly any furniture  and what was available was very uncomfortable  suggested parking options were deplorable  Somone backed into my brand new vehicle  Parked in an alternative lot with no issues afterwards  Silver lining was a decent location  and a clean decently stocked apartment  Could not get into the building the whole stay  Had to have tenants let us in every time we went out  which made leaving a chore  Tenants stated that this issue was known and nothing is ever done to remedy the problem  Upon arriving to check in  was also unable to get the key out of the key box  Had to call and have somone open it remotely  Pictures online are deceiving  What looks like a upscale loft is actually an subpar apartment  Hardly any furniture  and what was available was very uncomfortable  suggested parking options were deplorable  Somone backed into my brand new vehicle  Parked in an alternative lot with no issues afterwards  Silver lining was a decent location  and a clean decently stocked apartment 
398539194385343855,To start off  this is a long post but the place itself is decent  The check in process was complicated because our access code wouldn t work to get our keys so we had to call Zencity  They only give one parking permit and one key fob  The key fob is used for the entrance  elevator and studio  Upon arrival  our bed had a broken leg and had been zip tied together previously  If you sat on the bed  it would pop the broken leg out and the mattress would fall to the ground  We work nights so it didn t affect us until the next day  We called and needed a place to stay to sleep and the bed fixed  They gave us a place to stay after some arguing  They said to stay until our bed was fixed  We went there and slept  I woke up at  pm to someone entering our apartment  I then called and they said we had to leave immediately or we would be charged for the night  They hadn t fixed our bed and they didn t until  pm  After the bed was fixed with replacing some missing bolts  it was a decent stay  I wouldn t recommend the company to anyone  Every place we have stayed at under zencity has been poorly cared for and something is always wrong 
441281933324279270,This was one of the worst experiences Ive had on airbnb    For the past year  me and a group of friends have been traveling around the US and staying in various airbnbs  This was probably the   th airbnb we stayed at and weve never had as many issues as we did in this one    This airbnb is managed by a management company that is impossible to communicate with  When we arrived on our first day  the wifi was not working  We emailed Zencity about this immediately  They did not respond for hours and then told us to  restart our devices  even though we had left a detailed description of the wifi issues  including the fact that it was occurring across multiple devices and we had restarted the router     This back and forth went on for an entire week  We had no internet and were unable to work from home for that whole week   Every time I messaged or called Zencity  there was a new person responding who had no context on the situation and was completely unable to help  We asked them to reach out to the ISP and it took them   days for them to finally do that   just to tell us again to  restart our devices   They told us they would send a technician over on   separate occasions  Each time  we had to leave the location we were working from  because the airbnb had no wifi  only for the technician not to show up    For an entire week  I was email  calling  and messaging Zencity to try and get our wifi fixed  They responded to messages once every couple hours at best and again  it was a new person each time    The apartment itself was fine  Some of the furniture was broken and wobbly  There was also a lot of dust which aggravated one of our guests allergies  It didnt look like they had clean in a while  It was incredibly minimal  There were also many lights that were out or flickering    Overall  I would not recommend staying here unless you plan to be mostly outside of the apartment for your entire stay 
394130249825770565,If your looking for cleanliness DON T stay here  While staying at this location we had issues with the wireless lock and needless to say the whole time we stayed Friday   Sunday we couldn t lock the door which caused a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety    When we contacted Zencity regarding the issue they could of cared less and never sent out a maintenance team to get the problem fixed  I spent   hours of my vacation dealing with this issue along with the cleanliness of the place  Missed out on a group tour because of it as well    In my opinion not worth the stress or headache  Pictures don t represent the property in its current state  Make sure all your equipment is working properly  Locks  washer and dryer if advertised are useable  Have a maintenance team on call in case any issues come up  Very disappointed that we could t lock our door during our stay and no one came to fix it
394908924973071467,The location and layout of this apartment was great  We flew into Midway and it was about    minutes from the airport  but a straight shot  The apartment comfortably fit   people and had adequate amenities  The space was clean and welcoming  We did have difficulty accessing the building  but the support staff communicated with us constantly until it was resolved  We also had problems with wifi in the apartment which unfortunately was not resolved during our   day stay  There was adequate parking near the building and it was close to many eateries and community events  I was in frequent contact with the support team about the wifi problem  The router required rebooting and this needed to occur remotely  Unfortunately  we did not have wifi during the entire stay  We had to use hotspots on our phones  Myself and my sister are students and this affected our ability to submit assignments and meet deadlines  Also  there was no building key available  Mariano worked tirelessly to support us on this issue and we were eventually provided an access code  Prior to this  we were unable to all travel out of the building due to concerns with entering again  I suggest having staff follow up on these two things for future guests 
397826169222041242,Our overall stay was okay  once we were inside of the apartment  While we understand that the area outside of the apartment cannot be controlled by the host  we think it s important for others to know what they should expect    On our second day in the apartment  we arrived back at the apartment at the end of the day to find someone had been in the apartment and left a parking pass that had not been there prior to then  We were very unhappy that we were not contacted prior to someone entering our room and we were not even notified afterwards that they had done so  Upon contacting the host  they confirmed that this happened and apologized  Having no prior notification of this made us feel uneasy the rest of the trip  knowing someone could easily walk in without notice    The other concerns that we had were that when we walked into the apartment building  the first thing that hit us was the smell of marijuana  We hoped this was a one time occurrence  but unfortunately  it was every single time we went in and out of the building  The hallway on the   th floor where the apartment is located was dirty  with trash on the floors that stayed in the hall for the duration of our stay  It also smelled like garbage  The elevator we rode up in on our first day had visible vomit on the floor and as a result  smelled disgusting  That smell remained in that elevator for the duration of our stay    Inside the apartment  when a neighbor would apparently smoke  the cigarette or marijuana smell  depending on the moment  came through the vent in the bathroom and remained    We certainly understand that the neighbors cannot be controlled  but it definitely hindered our stay and made us extremely uncomfortable    The apartment itself was older  but had been updated nicely for the condition of the building  The linens were clean  but for three days and two people we would have preferred more towels for the stay  We made do  however  The apartment was very clean and the kitchen was well stocked with matching and clean dishes  and it appeared that there was care taken in renovating the apartment  The bed was comfortable enough  The view out the window was very nice  and we could see a part of the arch    The host was quick to respond to our questions and concerns  until we left the apartment  Once our reservation ended  we no longer got a response from them  Check in was easy  with very specific information with access codes and having free garage parking down the street was helpful  We sent you a private message of our review but have not heard anything back on it so we are going ahead and submitting our full review 
441273632819315003,Inaccurate listing  Unclean shower  No pool  No parking  No front staff   All floors had the trash overflowing  Apartment looked nothing like the pictures  Construction was going on in the neighboring apartments and it felt as off they were hammering for    hours of the day  I ve stayed in about    Airbnb s in my life  friends or mine  and this was by far the worst I have had  No thank you
409389942983916254,Pros  Perfect location  easy check in  square footage  and bed quality    Cons  lack of amenities that were supposed to be included like a hair dryer or coffee maker  as well as a general lack of amenities   e g   only two forks and very few kitchen items   The noise monitor in the living room tracks your sound level and makes it virtually impossible to use the space at all   While talking in normal voices with the TV on in the background we received multiple calls messages  all before the stated   quiet time  began at    PM  saying we needed to quiet down  It felt like we were unable to use the space we paid for for anything other than sleep  so we ended up having to spend more time out of the rental than we would have liked to   Overall  an okay experience  Would be a great option if you re only looking to sleep in the rental and not use it s kitchen or living spaces  Pros  Perfect location  easy check in  square footage  bed quality   Cons  lack of amenities that were supposed to be included  e g   hair dryer  coffee maker  causing us unforeseen expenses  and the noise monitor being in the living room makes it virtually impossible to use the space at all   While talking in normal voices with the TV on in the background we received multiple calls messages  all before the stated   quiet time  began at    PM  saying we needed to quiet down  It felt like we were unable to use the space we paid for for anything other than sleep  so we ended up having to spend more time out of the rental than we would have liked to 
420195457411830317,The apartment is nice and in a great location  Thank you for allowing us to stay  The apartment was clean but not deep clean  the walls and floors are dirty  even a book had food droppings on one  the only oven mitt had food on it  the blinds were broken   Its over priced for the clean fees that was charged 
399214111520463670,i will never stay with Zencity again 
450692444694052861,The good  It was walking distance from City Museum  Busch Stadium  and Union Station  and the bed was comfortable   The bad  WiFi information was wrong  and I had to find the router to connect to the WiFi because it took hours for them to reply to my message  There were several little shards of glass in the shower  And this is out of their control  but the elevators were filthy  think vomit  
547875872750906421,Great place to stay
414417996713726753,Overall i would not recommend   the place was not sufficiently clean  internet and television were not working  trip hazzards leading into the kitchen  drywall falling apart    However the location was great with some good restaurants in walking distance  Salt and smoke was the highlight of our stay We appreciated your hospitality     However  the television would not work  leading into the kitchen is a MAJOR trip Hazzard the place was not sufficiently clean pubic hairs in the shower  and a mound of dust on the vent right at front door   we absolutely loved the location  Salt and smoke was a   star    But overall from the drywall being cracked and falling apart to the floors being uneven and seperating and the trip hazzards  Unfortunately we would not stay again and would respectfully not recommend it to other travelers  With it being      for two nights we at least expected a clean environment and the internet to work so we could enjoy movies once we were done exploring the city 
399991461459564821,Operated by a large company remotely so any changes to your plans  such as early check in  may result in significant confusion at the actual location  Awesome location but parking IS a challenge  Staff at this location were friendly  The check in process was unnecessarily difficult due to it being handled remotely  Better communication between Zencity and the actual location would make this smoother 
392753545543977280,Cockroaches  filthy stained couch  wobbly furniture  shower in first floor leaks  gnats insects were present daily in the basement bathroom  code was changed twice by Zencity without notice to me and I got locked out twice   One of the two washing machines was  not operational and both dryers were out of order during my one week stay   I reported everything to Zencity and they offered me a partial refund of the clean fee for all my troubles  I paid over        for one week    Ridiculous and worst experience Ive ever had with an AirBNB rental   In the grand scheme of things  the fact that there is no coffeemaker is not a huge deal  but pointing it out in case  any of you consider that an important part of a rental   It was more of an annoyance that there wasnt a coffee maker given all my family and I dealt with  but some people are serious about their coffee so throwing this in for good measure   Other than the location of this rental  this was really the worst apartment rental ever  and I never give bad reviews  I just dont return to products or services that Ive not been happy with but this one seriously needed to be reported   Please review the many messages I sent during my stay regarding all the issues I reported   getting locked out because the code was changed more than once without telling me  cockroaches in the apartment that I reported and no one sent to address until the day before my departure  broken  wobbly  filthy furniture  etc   Its all in my messages and in the refund request I submitted along with a detailed explanation of what I reported during my stay 
434689750063584065,This apartment is located in a good area  the parking was a little tough to figure out but once we found we could park on the street behind all day that worked  Just a heads up the apartment smelled heavily of cigarettes and there is no mattress pad  The price is reasonable BUT bring a candle       Also the company absolutely cut communication once we were checked in  was definitely frustrating  After we checked in all communication was cut off between us and you  The place smelled heavily of cigarettes and there was no mattress pad  Also a little dirty
434791285825146910,The condo is very well laid out and bright  Furnishings are very nice  Bed is comfortable  Location is downtown and close to great restaurants  One grocery store downtown a few blocks away  Parkade is across the street  Gym is very good  Pool area very nice   We had several issues though     Poor communication with management  Messages sent were answered much later or not at all  If there was a crisis we would have been left in the dark      One fob provided  Needed for elevator and room of course  Very hard to plan around one fob and   people  I asked for another and they replied much later that it s not possible      Fob for parkade was fine  But a strip with barcode is provided to enter and exit parkade  Instructions only say to use at entrance and exit  Could NOT find scanner  Asked management via message  Was told to use at entrance or exit   Had to ask another vehicle leaving parkade  You in fact have to hold barcode up onto windshield  Scanner is on ceiling by exit  Impossible to see or know without being told      Bed was sloppily made  Toilet was not clean  No cleaner or brush to clean it  Floors dirty  Walls had several foot prints  hand prints  Paintings missing on walls  Lamp not working      No coffee maker or kettle in a beautiful kitchen  Asked about this and was told to feel free to use anything else in kitchen  Coffee maker would be a great plus  A toaster would be great too      Limited towels  Only one in kitchen      Huge walk in closet    hangers      Dryer sensor is not working  Dryer kept turning off and on  Condo is a great space  Here are the issues     poor communication  and delayed replies     fob with scanner was not explained as seen in text to you  Have you actually gone into parkade to see how it operates  We had to ask another vehicle for assistance  It is NOT clear      cleanliness  bed was not made well  Floors and toilet were dirty  No toilet brush or cleaner to keep it clean  Walls were covered with hand prints  Foot prints as well  Paintings or pictures missing on walls  Lamp not working      kitchen is advertised but not equipped with a kettle or coffee maker  This would have been great to have  Toaster would also be great  Why offer a kitchen      carpet was not clean or vacuumed enough      not enough kitchen cloths or towels to dry dishes      one fob for a couple   We had to plan our departures and arrivals around   fob  Not convenient at all      no hangers in closet      something wrong with dryer  possibly the sensor 
397764876220943899,It was a cool space to stay overall  A couple things prevent me from giving it a higher rating      The worst part of the experience was getting into the place  The code for the keypad did not work  so we had to call the host  He tried giving us a new code  which also didnt work  We ended up having to download and register for the Igloo Home app through which we were able to use a bluetooth connection to open the lock  It was a big hassle that took half an hour to resolve  which is not something we were in the mood for after driving all day and having plans for later that evening       Air conditioning was mediocre at best  You can only turn the thermostat down to     but the apartment never reached that temperature  It was a little sticky all the time  If you like to sleep in cooler temps  you might not like this place       Some of the furniture and appliances were worn out or broken  dont expect to be able to sleep on the couch   Not a big deal  but the worst part of this is they tried to charge us for a tear in one of the duvets  The tear was already there prior to us using it  It could have been worse since there were many things there that need repair that they could have tried to blame on us 
532591835594492521,Great location and a very large space but it lacked a few things  The internet was not turned on when we arrived  the French Press had broken glass so we couldn t make coffee  we couldn t use the fireplace  and only   towels were provided  Overall the unit was okay and worth it for the location 
464963391778048606,I could not gain door buzzer access to the apartment building to even check in to my Airbnb this company rented out  They then told me They refunded my money  But it s currently being investigated by the Airbnb resolution center as a scam  I have course have yet to see my       I have yet to get the refund for the room that I could not gain access to  The resolution center with Airbnb is currently investigating it as a scam 
423203679214939295,it was okay for a last minute stay  the blinds are broken in the living room  the window sill in the hall needs some work  the bathroom door doesnt shut right  the front door didnt lock right  their towels looked dirty glad I brought my own  and the oven looked as if it hadnt been clean in months
428909576474329750,There as no hot water in the shower and they did not send anyone to check until mid afternoon the day before I checked out  There was someone else s hair smeared on the side of the shower  I had to call them to get the door passwords because they didn t email me anything in a conformation  Literally a borderline scam  Don t go here
547166553620997671,Outside of the tv  this place is amazing  Year round I can see this a great place to be in Chicago  The view is absolutely amazing   The bedroom didn t have a tv  Kinda thru me off  Then the tv that was there did the bare minimum  At the very least add a smart tv in there so people can AirPlay off of there phone  But outside of the tv situation I d be more than happy to come back 
426616785531471045,Im not sure if this was just an anomaly  but my reservation was delayed an hour for clean  so I dragged my bag to a museum to kill time  When I returned  the intercom system did not work as detailed by Zen  I could not get into the building without looking like a suspicious person  and I certainly could not leave after that because I would have to rely on strangers going in and out  So I talked to Zen on the phone and the guy was very helpful  but there was only so much he could do  apparently  So I dragged my bag to a local restaurant and waited another   hours while a repair crew was supposed to remedy the problem  Nothing was changed when I returned  so I asked for a full refund and canceled the trip  Before canceling  I was supposed to have contacted AirBnB directly  which I honestly thought I had  So when I got home  I did receive a refund from Zen  but not from AirBnB  So another hour on the phone was spent with a different helpful person  but you could sense they didnt want to give me anything for all of my trouble  After persisting  I did get a full refund and a small credit toward another AirBnB in the future  Im not sure my time was worth all of this trouble  I appreciated the support I received on the phone  but ultimately I had to cancel the trip because it was far too long to wait to even get in to the building  which never happened 
441973090966685516,Great setup and location  You can tell that this is purely a rental property that doesnt have a devoted caretaker  There are some things that need attention  The couch is quite used and looks unclean  There are clean surfaces but underneath beds is dusty  The sink in the bathroom had a broken plug  The first check in box  to access the lobby area also took   times of me relaying the entry code to actually work  I thought I was going to get stuck in the foyer at  am  I would appreciate my clean fee back considering the state of the living areas  Pictures were sent but I received no further communication 
399973998379977938,Location was great  apartment was large but sparse  Couch is broken  Disappointed that the unit wasnt that clean  used towel was left in the bathroom  couch was dirty and broken 
436934744418829221,This trip was uncomfortable and the accomodations were disappointing  The unit looked nice but still had cheap leaning furniture  The air unit needs to be fixed it blows hot air and the wifi barely works  I didnt appreciate the way the company handled the communication with us either  I would suggest renting another property  its not worth the hassle  It takes almost an hour to connect to the host  Maybe the worst rental Ive stayed at and Ive been all over with Airbnb This trip was uncomfortable and the accomodations were disappointing  The air unit needs to be fixed and the wifi barely works  I didnt appreciate the way your company handled the communication
397022111505613223,Alright so I booked this a few days before moving in  Couple of key issues that prevent me from giving this spot a higher score     First  and most importantly  be warned that the bedroom does not have an AC unit  Considering that AC as listed as an amenity  this was really strange for me  Communication with the host did ensue and after A LOT of back and forths I did finally manage to get a fan for the bedroom  but it still wasnt enough for the hot Chicago summer days  So I cant really recommend this spot for the summer     The floor is pretty gross  I would probably not walk around in the apt barefoot if I were you and instead purchase sandals or slipper like I did     The kitchen doesnt really have much in it  I was there for    days so I did want to cook a few times and there were no pans large enough to cook say a decent   serving of pasta  Had to bring my own stockpot and pan from my old place  Not bad if you are just doing the basics however   frying eggs  cereal etc     Laundry is NOT in unit  you need to pay for it and to do that you need a laundry card  I personally did not get a laundry card during check in and hence had to communicate with the host once again over   days to get my hands on one  When I did  there was only   bucks in the card and no way to recharge it   I will say though this apartment has its benefits   the security is pretty solid  nice lobby and great location  plenty of closet and storage space too and a lot of living space for   to   people  you could probably fit       in here if you really wanted   Would recommend this if it wasnt spring summer and you were only staying for like     days please add an AC unit to the bedroom for future tenants
439760199387659154,I was very disappointed  A couple days before checking in I had contacted the host for any possibility of checking in earlier  check in is at  pm   they didn t get back to me  So the day of check in we ended up arriving       assuming everything would be ready for us to check in  Unfortunately that wasn t the case  the receptionist informed us that she didn t have the key to the apartment  since they were still clean it inside  We received the key       mins later  Once we went inside the airbnb we expected it to be clean However   we took a look inside   it was very dusty   shower did not look clean  I would recommend if cleanliness is not top priority but location is  Also communication with the host sucks 
414479599700528994,City life  crowds  burnouts  first responders  Everything was good except that it was dirty  Ended up having to go to Walmart for a mop and other clean supplies  If you re not okay with the downtown life  stay away  I love the noises of the city so area was fine 
397068103111519851,OK Quit dumpster diving
397093362575612359,Good location  even though a lot of the businesses where closed  Im guessing because of Covid  Good space for the little time we actually spent inside the studio  Hi there  the studio was ok  it was accurate to what the pictures show on Airbnb but the bed was very uncomfortable  it was like a ditch in the center  Also we found some weird insects crawling in it and my girlfriend got a rash in her back and we think it was because of it  The room definitely needs to be fumigated specially since its in an old building and a lot pest tends to grow  Other than that the space was perfect for the trip since we didnt spend much time in there other than sleep 
439086227763761950,Our check in was terrible  the code we got to unlock the door didn t work which left us strained for    mins outside of the door  We called the host for help multiple times  no answer  I had to call Airbnb and they helped  The apartment was in a nice location and nice inside however the temp for the place was locked at     and it was above     and miserable to sleep in this summer  The tall ceilings make it extremely loud and with little conversation we still got a ridiculous noise complaint at      at night  The lack of help we got for check in  the lock not working and the building being      was not ok  The temp being set and locked at     is ridiculous especially with the big windows 
395580335603637763,Apt is clean and just like pictures  Check in process was terrible and there was no communication  Apt is clean and just like pictures  Check in process was terrible and there was no communication  The instructions for getting into the apartment did not work  We had to wait at the door until a security guard walked by and let us in  There needs to be a revision of your instructions of how to get in specifically for what to enter at the intercom screen 
454356758634030972,Wifi in the apartment needs some work  Overall it s an okay experience  Great location tho  Please consider working on your wifi  Overall it s a pleasant stay  Great location 
399269034794213762,Easy walking access to the Central West End   Off street parking was available without much of a hunt  The shower drain backed up really bad and the shower curtain was gross 
454389446662874766,I would not stay with zen city if given another choice  As other reviewers noted  it s impossible to get into the building without asking for help from a resident  When we finally made it to the unit  there was no fob  We cancelled the stay at that point since we couldn t leave and reenter the building or unit easily  The check In system makes it impossible to have a relaxing stay 
454258654691386875,Unique Place to stay in St Louis 
400258213703610011,I was never able to access the unit  The kiosk that dispensed the key  was malfunctioning or the battery was low  Either way I couldn t get in  And according to the receptionist  it s common occurrence  so for ZenCity not to have a backup key with the receptionist is poor planning at best  There was no offer to compensate me for future stays although they had me in limbo until midnight  Just a horrible experience overall  I will say I ve stayed with them on previous occasions and those stays were pleasant  This was extremely inconvenient  And I believe you guys should have offered me a free stay for the inconvenience  But hey      
396389720826695251,Unless they fix what they are saying  Don t trust this company  Place was dirty  no pillow cases  just not a place or company I would use again      Coming from someone who was born in       raised in Hyde Park  Father a huge professor head of the foreign language department at U High laboratory schools  I have the email from zen city showing I was to leave the keys on the table  Since there were only Two tables in the entire  what use to be a one bedroom turned two  Normal logic would say put keys on coffee table  Which was what we did  Until that is resolved  I will not give a good  or bad review 
400659522955631200,Shower drain did not work as well as toilet flushing  Brought it up with the owner and they ignored me  Also window AC couldn t keep up with the heat
423157471331079154,The unit is nice and the area is decent  some nice restaurants within walking distance    Please do not rent this unit  Our unit had   bath towel per bathroom  no shampoo soap and a dirty rag hanging in the shower     Zencity is an awful  awful management company  I requested early check in for noon  it was accepted  I got to the unit at        There was no fob in the lockbox  instructions followed perfectly  I called Zencity and messaged on the app and sent an email to their email address on their website  I spoke with a woman and she said she d call me back in five minutes  I waited   hr and    minutes and called back  A man answered  He told me he was also going to call me back in   to    minutes  Nothing  I waited until      as maybe they forgot about the early check in  Still no fob  I tried calling  and Zencity blocked my number from getting through    I used my brothers phone and got through and eventually after   hours of waiting  someone helped me    Everything negative about the unit posted in the reviews is true  The kitchen dining table chairs are not safe  they collapse if you lean back too far  The couch is ripped    These are all easily fixable things but Zencity is horrendous and doesnt care

400669361732048761,N A I m writing to you regarding our recent visit to your property at     W Belmont on          Although the room was clean and as expected upon arrival  we were very quickly disappointed and upset for the remainder of our stay  We ran into a huge issue when we realized that the AC was broken  No matter what approach we took to turn it on  it remained completely shut off  This made our nights virtually unbearable  It was in the   s in Chicago and we had to try and sleep in an     degree room throughout the evening  Opening windows only made the problem worse as it didn t cool anything down and the train noises woke us up just as we were able to fall asleep    I reached out to your company to come and check out the AC unit on     in preparation for our second night  I received a response asking if someone was allowed to come in and take a look  I responded that we d be out of the room for most of the day and we re expecting someone to come take a look while we were out  However  after returning home we realized no one had been in the room and it was just as we left it  AC unit still broken   We were most upset that we were told someone would come fix the issue and no one did    This situation is unacceptable and we are planning to write about our experiences in an online review  We would consider not posting anything if you can give us some sort of refund for our stay  It s not fair for us to pay      for a room where we were only able to sleep   hours each night at the properties expense    I look forward to hearing back 
423945244996413243,Not the best check in procedure and they were not able to find a solution  It took them over   hrs to try and get us in  We were never able to check in because the keys were not in the location we were told  It took them over   hrs to figure out a solution and by then we had already made arrangements to stay elsewhere 
412495207845666813,Fuck this place they will still your money  They will purposely leave you in pending status for review  the minute you book another airbnb   pay for it  they will ignore your withdraw or cancellation request for booking   charge your account then send you checkin instructions   the address to the property  Key word the host here will do this directly after you cancel withdraw your booking request also   I believe airbnb helps them because there waz no withdrawal option for this host but I was able to withdraw with no problem with another host who took to long to respond    leaving me with no other option but the cancellation request   I sent a message because I thought it was odd that the withdraw request was not available   note this was all done before any acceptance  address of property   check  in information  They still took my money told me I dont get a dime back  so I paid      for two airbnb   only stayed in one of them for two days  I could have stayed home   paid my mortgage for that amount  my husband   I just had left his step dads funeral   we were sad   flustered   decided to get a airbnb for a couple of nights because we didnt want to bring that energy home to our kids  this host will fuck you with no vaselune   airbnb will help them In order to leave a review I had to enter atleast   star bur this airbnb did not deserve that  I never stayed at this property didnt go nowhere near it  They left me in pending approval status   waited until I booked   paid for another airbnb   withdrew   canceled my request to book with them to accept me   send me checkin instructions and stole my money out of my account  Airbnb helped them steal the money   the said a host has    hrs to respond to a request   thats fine but if a customer cancels or withdraws before a location or checkin instructions is provided   airbnb   the host knows that another airbnb has accepted   you are using their airbnb instead  A FULL REFUND IS A NO BRAINER   So fuck this host   airbnb the fraudulently scheme to still potential customers money   they refuse to give it back  I know I am not the only person this has happened to I can see a class action suit coming for Airbnb in the near future   I promise to be the first in line
426790844217863241,The checkin instructions are not valid for this unit   Ava sent me a message with the instructions  but things fail on the first instruction   I immediately messaged Ava Zencity  and never got a reply   After about an hour  a clean lady in the building took mercy on me and walked me up to the unit to try the  rd instruction   That worked   Once I had the key  I could come and go as desired   The unit itself is very boutique ish   In most cases  it was very clean sterile   However  there was some kind of padding or tissue that was very wet on the nightstand   It also looks like someone kicked in the bottom of the bedroom door     Ultimately  I would stay here again if the entry instructions were updated and accurate  The checkin instructions are not valid for this unit   I messaged Ava yesterday when I tried to get in   She still hasnt replied   It took me almost an hour to get past the front door  and that was just because a clean lady decided to help me   None of the tenants were willing to assist   That hour was critical  causing me NOT to be able to attend the Negro League Museum before it closed at     The cleanliness comment   There is some kind of wet pad or tissue or something on the night stand  and there was a little bit of other clutter that looked like it had been left aside   The card key is on a lanyard  but has tore away from the lanyard and is a lost card waiting to happen   Lastly  it appears that somebody kicked in the bottom of the bedroom door 
540610377359932149,The place was in a great spot and the people in the building were helpful with directions  I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the unit  It wasn t disgusting but definitely noticeable  Overall it was good  not great  If someone had taken the time to ensure the counters were wiped off throughly and crumbs weren t left in the drawers i would have no complaints  Really great view  The unit was not very cleanly  I there was trash left on the floor by the bed and obvious stains   mess on the counter tops  The silverware drawer has crumbs in it and there window sills also could use a wiping down  I expect a lot more especially with how high the clean fees are  These are not things i had to look hard to notice  I would highly suggest you review the process for how your cleaners are  clean  because it seems like someone came and picked up  not clean 
395645893702887245,No room number posted outside of door  hard to find room  Also  the code to get in the building didn t work  Security guard had to let me in  Code to get into building didn t work  Called and messaged about issue with no communication  Security guard had to let me in  Also  room didn t have room number listed outside of door so it was hard to find 
400731467030343198,DON T DO IT  We booked an apartment with Zencity for our    year anniversary  When we checked in  there was no fob left in the unit which allows access to the building enables the elevator  After messaging through the app  calling and waiting on hold and messaging calling through Instagram  We finally got someone to answer and we re told they would call us back  Got no call back when we were supposed to and we re forced to get a hotel room for the first night  We were told the second day at around noon that a fob was left at the front desk but when we asked the front desk  no one had been given anything  After that Zencity refused to communicate with us despite multiple phone calls and messages  The apartment was what we expected but if your trip is important  don t book with Zencity  I can t believe after leaving us without a place to stay the first night that you would continue to ignore communication attempts until after the trip was over  Terrible customer service and really surprised that you conduct business this way 
446961481308115528,This apartment needed a lot of repair  I d call it a fixer upper   It was very disappointing and we did not stay  not even one night   The cleanliness of this apt was very bad  Grime on doors and shelving  hair along the hall floor and baseboards  crumbs and dirt on the kitchen floor  fingerprints and smudges on the mirrored side table and glass coffee table  The large rug looked worn and stained and the venting in the bedroom was thick with dust  lint and sticky grime   No pride in this apartment   The walls showed wear and tear  ceiling was damaged  had stress cracks and the paint was sloppy  thick  gunky  caked on and chipped in places   Ceiling  light over table had three of  five working bulbs  Entrance way and another light fixture also had missing or non working bulbs  Electric light switch in hall did not completely covered the hole housing the electrical wiring   a gap between plaster and hole   The inside front door knob and lock also was ill fitted  and did not make one feel secure  In addition  there were three different doors gate to enter the apt  This was very cumbersome and would require two hands  The directions to entry gate did not include the first code at all   The instructions also directed guest to walk  up  the steps which was on east side of building  when they should have said walk  down  the steps   the west side of the building    The balcony looked appealing but the doors to access were so heavy making it difficult to open  Also there was a bad smell ruminating from below the pool looked to be the color green   algae   I sent many pictures to the the host in hopes of receiving a total refund  To this date I have only received about a third of it   My husband would have preferred to sleep in our car rather than to stay at this Airbnb  We checked into a holiday inn and the next day found another Airbnb  Very disappointing  Unable to stay at this Airbnb   The apt needed a lot of attention  Cleanliness was very poor  grime  hair along floor and baseboards  crumbs on kitchen floor  stains on surfaces  dust  noticeable finger marks and prints on side and coffee table  soiled carpet  venting in bedroom  thick with dust  lint  sticky grime   This apt needed a lot of repair  No pride in this apt  Walls were damaged  ceiling had stress cracks  paint was gunky and sloppy   many places were marred and chipped   Ceiling lights had missing bulbs or light bulbs were burned out    Three codes for three different doors gate required to get into this apt  Very cumbersome  Host had to troubleshoot problems over the phone to guide us into entry  Instructions to access apt were not accurate  no code for gate  directions to first gate were incorrect   The balcony looked appealing but the patio door was heavy and difficult to push open  There was a bad smell from the pool directly under the balcony and the pool looked to be green  maybe algae   I sent many pictures to the host in hopes to obtain a total refund   We simply could not stay at this Airbnb  My husband and would have preferred to have slept in our car  instead  we found a hotel room and then another Airbnb  This place needs a lot of attention and repair 
423188199130559957,The place was very nice   clean  Beds were comfortable  But the customer service part was horrible  We got locked out multiple times  had to wait outside for over   hours to wait for someone to bring up a keypad to back into the building  Other then that everything was great  Please work on communication with customers  we waited for   plus hours  to hear something back from Someone  Also we were locked out of our Airbnb multiple times   had to set outside with our children   had to wait over an hour for someone to drop off a key pad to get in the building 
426745038575969516,We stayed for a week and appreciated the ease of entry  the air conditioning  and the location    The kitchen was clean  although we did not cook while we were there    We had the following issues with the place     Bed broke when we sat on it   wifi went out for two days  meaning we could not work there  it was a work trip    when I sent several notes asking for wifi to be restored  they were ignored     Overhead Lights flickered in bedrooms and kitchens  and light switches in bathroom worked only sporadically   When someone came to fix  they said theyd need to send someone else  no one else came   Lights were never fixed     The coffee table was completely broken   the shower curtain in the bathroom is filthy  there is grime on the walls in the bathroom  I notified them about all these things   The bed was fixed quickly but no other items were addressed  Hi there   We stayed for a week and appreciated the ease of entry  the air conditioning  and the location    We had the following issues with the place     Bed broke when we sat on it   wifi went out for two days    when I sent several notes asking for wifi to be restored  they were left unread     Overhead Lights flickered in bedrooms and kitchens  and light switches in bathroom worked only sporadically   When someone came to fix  they said theyd need to send someone else  no one else came   Lights were never fixed     The coffee table was completely broken   the shower curtain in the bathroom is filthy  there is grime on the walls in the bathroom  I notified you about all these things   The bed was fixed quickly but no other items were addressed 
473175746462350992,The location of the property is ideal but it is in an old building that needs a lot of maintenance  If you are someone to whom cleanliness is important  this is NOT an option for you  The attention and communication with the hosts was bad and slow  The attention and service was not as desired and an important message was never answered  The property was not clean  the kitchen and living room floors were sticky the day we arrived and some of the windows  including the main bathroom  had cobwebs on them 
490530066485791228,Location was good  Check in was good  Place was so dirty and gross  But honestly was an easy stay 
443404215284026783,Great little place to stay  Only downfall I had was no available onsite parking 
401459322736006025,This was by far the worst experience I have ever had when trying to book a property  I have actually booked with Zencity several times and have had great experiences  There properties are normally in great areas  clean  well designed  and the staff is normally nice  professional  and responsive  But this time was nothing like that  I can t say much about the property itself except that the parking situation is horrible  I can t speak about the unit because I never saw it  I booked the property the same morning as check in  I requested an early check in  This request was ignored  Around   o clock when I still had not heard anything about my booking  I called them  I spoke with Andrea  she should honestly find a different profession because hospitality is not her thing  she advised that my booking was just then being reviewed and approved my stay  I received a confirmation email  my card was charged  Upon reviewing the confrontation email I found that there was not any check in instructions  I called back and spoke with Andrea again and she advised that check in instructions are computer generated and that I would have to just wait until that happened  Mind you it is after   o clock  When I expressed my displeasure with having to wait and not being provided a proper time expectation  she told me that the delay was my fault for waiting so late to book  as tho the booking I made that morning never happened  not one time during my interaction with her did I get an apology for anything  I then wait an hr in     degree weather with no response or check in instructions  I then call back and I m advised that the property has been double booked and there were no other properties available for me  I then tell Andra that this posses a huge problem for me because I used my last bit of available money to book this property and did not have the means to book another property while waiting on a refund from them  She offers no solution other than assuring that I will get a full refund  At this point communication between her and I completely breaks down  Which is then followed up with a note from her expressing how upset she was by my word choice and tone during our last conversation  Again  no empathy  apology  or real solution to my problem  I get a lecture  Fortunately  I was able to speak with Airbnb and they provided excellent service  I was issued a coupon to cover that nights stay at a different property  So around   that evening I was able to check in  relax  and forget about the anything but Zen experience  Andrea needs better training  She lacks empathy and comes across as robotic

427454081251080479,I will never book w  Zencity again after this TERRIBLE experience  FIRST OFF  was given wrong check in instructions so I was not able to gain access to the building  Called customer support which then they told me to ask someone nearby to let us in   already looking sketch  The man who let us in was a  maintenance man  with no badge or uniform  This same  maintenance man  was ironically going to OUR room   His purpose was unclear b c we were told the room would be accessible after   and this was after       He said it was  just to checkout the room  and his English was hard to understand   Meanwhile he was speaking Spanish on the phone with someone else the entire time  We approached the room to find that it was NOT Securely locked and cracked open      We knocked  I closed it and then put in our code to make sure this was our right room     It was and when we entered  IT WAS NOT EVEN THE ROOM PICTURED  the soap was knocked over on the island  sunglasses on the table  NO KEY FOB for building and garage access  The  maintenance man  just did a lap  flushed the toilet    and asked us if we were good with it all while still speaking Spanish and what seemed to be reporting to someone on the phone  I was not okay with what was going on and my girlfriend and I were pretty sketched out at the whole situation  We went back to the lobby   played phone message tag with a Zencity rep for about    min and they had no explanation for really anything  The concierge at the front office of the apartment was not surprised that we were having such trouble w  Zencity   their building  After being told that they had no other rooms available  AKA the room we originally booked  and after I figured out the room lock malfunction that was causing the door to not completely lock unless held tightly while lock was automatically locking  I felt safe enough to stay here but later regretted this choice after discovering how dirty the place actually was   Hair   debris all over the carpet and dirty surfaces   BUT WAIT THERE S MORE   Next day they also tried to charge me     for a WASHCLOTH that WE left behind because it had makeup stains on it       this whole company is a joke and everyone who had anything to do with our room should be fired 
452367761874978508,I wish I could leave   stars  You can t get into the building without someone walking out  The place wasn t clean when I got there and it honestly looked like someone else was staying there  Dirty tampons in the trash can  beds very recently slept in  wet dirty towels on the floor  there was even a knife out on the counter  The host didn t keep in touch with me and was very unhelpful with my problems  Do not book here   If I could leave   stars I would  Instructions to get into the building weren t accurate  The place was a mess and disgusting  And the communication with the host was terrible  Thanks for making it a terrible experience
439853358833202486,the place is really clean and accurate to the post  it would have been perfect  But  they have a fob you need to easily get in and out of the building and to use the pool  gym  and parking lot  For my stay I couldnt find the fob anywhere in the apartment  I texted and when that got no response  I called to let them know  Zencity said they would bring me one and never did  So  its nice but you may or may not be able to use the amenadies you pay for 
399768053679975236,The location of the apartment is great  but because the apartment is right next to the street  it was very noisy at night  which is why we didn t sleep well  The apartment is good  The only thing we are not satisfied with  a red flag  is the noise  Two of the three bedrooms are facing the street and there was the loud noise of vehicles for the whole night  so we didn t sleep well 
414488845096480414,A true disappointment     First off  the building staff were absolutely wonderful  The ladies at the front desk were so kind and delightful  truly wonderful people  I do not believe they are associated with Zencity   I really dont like writing bad reviews  Ive had Airbnbs in several countries  as well as having stayed in Chicago a handful of times  and Ive never had a bad experience enough to warrant a negative review  That being said     Check in was not smooth at all  We were told a  PM check in  and by      the place was still unavailable due to being clean  The place is tiny so I cant imagine it took that long to do     The apartment was missing toiletries and basic kitchen items  where was the salt or pepper    No body wash or shampoo outside of liquid hand soap  Yes  we should have packed our own  that one is on me  BUT still kind of took us by surprise    We found a porn DVD between the couch cushions  Im not a prude by any means  but come on guys    if this place was  being clean  for an hour and a half  Id imagine the couch should have at least been looked at   The  what I assume used to be  white rugs in the living and bed room were stained  as were the decorative pillows on the sofa  The shower had hair on the walls before we got in  It just did not feel clean at all  especially considering the high clean fee Im paying     Parking was a nightmare during the weekend  but once you found a spot it wasnt too bad of a walk  Expect to pay      day if you stay at the lot to the south east  and know you wont be able to take the car out from   PM  AM   At the end of the day  this apartment had all the charm of a lousy hotel room  but without the amenities like getting more than   towels  access to toiletries  or coffee  and costing much more  Just did not feel cozy or particularly well looked after   The view was nice  Check in was a mess  the upholstery around the apartment was filthy and in need of urgent clean or replacing  and we were caught off guard by the lack of basic kitchen ingredients or toiletries  It was a real disappointment 
547796632309778362,Arrived at  pm and unit wasn t clean had to wait until     pm until housekeeping was done asked for a late check out at   pm instead of   am and was asked for     more dollars when I was inconvenienced at check in time   Kinda unfair in my opinion the place was kinda cold with the AC unit in the window being for heat as well  unit was clean and building was secure but I wouldn t stay here again though  I don t think it was fair I was asked for     for an extra hour at check out when housekeeping didn t finish clean until      on check in day and the unit was very cold 
401416630651037598,A nice  clean apartment with good space and comfortable beds   The kitchen is VERY sparsely equipped but  if you dont need to use a kitchen  this would be a good place to stay and far preferable to a hotel  The unit was decent and as advertised  however there were several problems        The kitchen was woefully under equipped   There was no coffee maker  there was a coffee grinder   dont know what to do with that   there were   forks  a few knives and a handful of spoons  most of which were demi tasse spoons  not particularly useful    There were three of us staying there   We wouldnt have been able to make a meal there  or serve it  with the equipment provided   We also had to go out and buy a sponge and towel to wash the few dishes we did use   Interestingly enough  we were provided with a mitten shaped cookie cutter and an offset spatula   Flatware would have been far preferable       The bathroom tub was treacherously slippery   I think that might be a real problem for someone and a potential lawsuit in the making       The only other complaint is a small one   the floors were unbelievably creaky   Yes  I know  it is an old building and they are old floors   They were  wake one from a dead sleep  loud though   Once again  that is just a small complaint and one that probably has no solution    We did find the apartment clean  the beds comfortable  and the space easy to use   The directions for entry were confusing to read  there were several different codes for the main door  but we had no trouble getting in   In spite of the complaints  I would stay there again   I would just be prepared to know that the kitchen was fairly unusable 
399957204863189338,Not many complaints but if you leave anything here  don t expect them to be able to find it  It ll most likely get stolen by someone lmao
415845679485628490,I am really disappointed with my experience at this place  From a quick glance  everything seems updated and modern in the building and unit but when looking closer this place is definitely having some serious issues  I have listed some of my concerns below      The overwhelming smell of sewage was present in our unit as well as in other parts of the building  It seemed to be coming from either the bathroom or laundry room or even both  There is something seriously wrong with it  We tried closing two of the doors to the laundry unit and it didnt help  This was definitely the worst part of our stay      The communication regarding the sewage issue wasnt the best  We wrote in to notify them of this and they offered to have the clean crew come again but it wasnt an issue of clean but of the piping and drains in the unit  They didnt accept any responsibility for this and said it was the building maintenances responsibility  However  if you are renting out a unit I believe its YOUR responsibility to ensure that the standards are acceptable   We stayed there from Friday to Tuesday and the awful smell never went away      The keypad on the door to the suite was a little difficult  The code was pretty long and even when entering the code correctly and pressing the lock icon sometimes the door wouldnt open    From a positive perspective  I really liked the location of the building its only a few minutes away from some great restaurants such as Vin de Set and Little Fox  The key fob made it really convenient to access the parking lot and entry into the building  The unit had some stylish touches and was updated 
452815089270963123,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE   NO AIR CONDITION    Unfortunately  I would have rated this apt   stars  but I had no AC from day one   the apt stayed at     I called and messaged Zencity for all   days  but nothing was ever done  They would always tell me they would message or call me back with info about someone coming to fix the air  but never did  Beautiful home and amazing location   but very risky to stay here with how their customer service is  Beautiful home  but with no AC   poor communication on how to get the AC fixed was very frustrating  I worked most of the days  but coming home to sleep in a hot apt was horrible  I called multiple times and left multiple messages from day one but never got a response  I hope I can be refunded something for this experience
445671704315744033,Id like to first say that the inside of the apartment itself is great  very clean  and minimalist  We enjoyed the stay no matter what  and this was my partner and I s first solo vacation  so take this review with a grain of salt  I do however have a few things about it that I feel others should know BEFORE booking     PARKING   For some reason you arent allowed to park in the parking lot  despite several slightly confusing signs saying there are specific spots you can in the parking lot itself  You basically must try and get a spot on the street right behind  theres a bar in the building so good luck  OR park a block or two away across a busy intersection  The walk from those blocks to the place isnt exactly a walk in a park  but we didnt die or get broken into  so it wasnt terrible     OVERALL LOCATION   Yes  the location in terms of vacation hotspots is great  You re   minutes from the Plaza and      minutes from anywhere else in the KCMO area you d want to go to  plus you re    minutes away from Overland Park  Unfortunately  you still have to drive       minutes to the nearest grocery store  and you re on Main St where there must be a Fire Station nearby  If you re not used to first responders howling by right outside  this can be jarring every    minutes at night  The location of the building is smack dab in the middle of hefty construction and run down buildings  so it s a little scary for two    year old women walking a few blocks in the dark  but again  we didn t die  OVERALL  we had a great time in KCMO and the parking and location were the only things we had issues with  but for the price  we got we probably wouldn t have gotten anything much better  I feel like anyone looking at this place should know about the parking situation before booking as I would have heavily appreciated this  but we still had a good time  I think people would appreciate knowing about the parking situation before booking the space 
441949388397067924,The people that work for Zencity were nice  but a couple the perks to staying weren t well outlined    Washer  dryer is in the basement of the apartment complex where you pay for it separately    The WiFi didn t work the entire time we were there  We talked to   separate people and gave them permission to stop by while we were gone on day excursions    It wouldn t have been a huge deal if I didn t have work to do that required it 
415854932272187243,The apartment is the same as it looks  on the photos but the couch is old and uncomfortable  But the location is good  The apartment was looking tidy but it was not clean  There is a construction going on in the building and it ia not convenient for people who need to rest 
396372145021500877,Apartment was dirty with a stained dirty rug and furniture covered with stains  It was a good location on Division  but I would not recommend this place  Your place needs a good clean  The couch and chair and rug are dirty and spotted    We were delayed check in by   hours and then had no hot water for over    hours  We received a     refund for the late check in  That amount seems ridiculously low    You need to get some silverware in the kitchen  There is one butter knife and only large serving spoons 
402856855819493922,I ve never given a bad review for an Airbnb as I ve always had great experiences   until this one   I rented this place only because it was the closest one that I could find to where I needed to be for my dates  When I arrived  the lockbox didn t have a key for the unit I was staying in and the  back up  lockbox was completely empty   I messaged the host but didn t get an immediate response   After finding a phone number  I was told to go ahead and use another key   Once inside  and starting to unpack  it became obvious the place wasn t too clean   The floors hadn t been vacuumed and the carpet in both bedrooms was badly stained   The worst part was the pre programmed Nest thermostat   It was     in the unit when I arrived   I turned it down to     hoping to get a good night s sleep   It took until   am before the unit finally cooled down enough to quit running  but as the temperature quickly began to rise again  it soon became apparent that Zencity had programmed it to shut off once the initial temp was met   To override the programming  you need to have a   digit pin number which Zencity wouldn t give me    They assured me they could re program it remotely to max out at       When I arrived back to the unit later that night  same story   back up in the high    s   The next morning  I decided to cut my losses  pack up and stay elsewhere   I messaged Zencity about the uncleanliness early on  and no one responded at all   Finding a parking was nearly impossible each night   I will credit Zencity with having comfortable beds and the linens were clean   The wifi and TV seemed to work fine  but I didn t stay long enough to use either much 
486936551918363385,I was truthfully disappointed by my stay here  I had a feeling this might happen given the mixed reviews  I stayed for a little over a month at this apartment  Starting with the positives  the location is pretty good  Youre at the edge of Hyde Park  but close to a bus stop  Youre also walking distance from food options and Trader Joes  and the lakefront  Theres a doorman       The apartment was larger than I expected with two large bathrooms  I only used the shower in the bedroom and it worked fine   Building is relatively quiet and lots of natural light too  Bed is decently comfortable  Unfortunately the apartment was not clean upon my arrival hair was still in the shower  hair was found in sheets  I had to pay to wash the sheets again   dishes had stains  etc  Apartment needs major maintenance  its unacceptable to have tenants stay in an apartment where the walls and the ceiling have cracks  This needs to be fixed  Additionally  the pots and pans were entirely scratched up  There were also no simple cooking necessities such as olive oil or S P  so I bought some and left it there for future tenants  Lastly  there was NO WiFi for my entire stay  I reached out to Zencity numerous times regarding this issue from the first day I arrived  A representative did get back to me each time  but nothing was actually followed through  For example  the first representative asked ME to reach out to the network company for a technician to come fix the issue  I did and no one followed through  I reached out to Zencity a few more times  I cant tell you how many times I was asked to turn the WiFi off and on again LOL  One time they asked for a friend stay at the apt while I was at work until a tech could come by  and no one showed up all day  I followed up with Zencity only for someone to tell me no one ended up coming  obviously   Nevertheless  the WiFi was never resolved  For the price I paid  which was a lot   this was unacceptable  I hope all of these are fixed for the next guests  Really disappointed by this stay  The apartment was not clean upon my arrival hair was still in the shower  hair was found in sheets  I had to pay to clean the sheets again   couch had crumbs  coffee table had stains  dishes had stains  I rewashed all the dishes I used   etc  Apartment needs major maintenance  Its unacceptable to have tenants stay in an apartment where the walls are cracking in the ceiling and the sides  this needs to be fixed  Additionally  there needs to be more utensils  the pots and pans were entirely scratched up  this is carcinogenic  Last but not least there was no WiFi for the entire month I was present  Each time I reached out to fix this issue  sometimes attempted to talk to me and act like they were going to resolve the issue only for another representative to message me about something else and the topic to change  Nevertheless  this was never resolved  I am planning to let Airbnb know about my experience here  It wasnt terrible  but its not acceptable for the price I paid 
402155113644125072,Good location but terrible communication
402816776800152010,Great neighborhood  Thank you
445601114864919653,first and last time I will ever stay at any Air BnB  To be   we couldnt even have dinner and have a conversation in our unit with out getting a noise complaint   mind you  we didnt even have the T V on nor the Radio     cant have guest come up to the unit   What kind of rules is that  what are we kids 
441271798531504837,Do not recommend this company for anyone  The customer service is absolutely AWFUL  We were locked out of our Airbnb for two days without given any alternate to access the building  When trying to reach out to the host  it took several phone calls which led to being told I would get a call back which never happened  When requested a refund  I was ignored  No surprise since I was also ignored while I was locked out of the Airbnb building during a thunderstorm  Terrible customer service  Terrible communication with guests  Terrible all around and will never use as a host again 
445603810287300020,Thin walls Everything was amazing  The price  the view  the location  However  the Wi Fi sucked  Horrible  Thin walls  Neighbors complained about the volume  It never was over     Plus  we couldnt really watch tv cause the Wi Fi 
530457002209117018,Heads up for those looking for a long term stay  Do not rent from Zencity  More suited for short term stays  This is my honest review    Cons    The building is very old and was not clean very well  The hallways constantly smell like sewage  and the walls are thin  so you can everyone around you     The washer and dryer listed is actually in the basement  and is for all residents in the building   They do not have reserved parking for Airbnb guests here  It s     night for      month for the closest garage       minutes walk  and street parking is rarely available    Their is no central heating and cooling  just a window unit that doesn t have heating capabilities   The host did not provide a space heater  so it got very cold in the apartment     The microwave did not work and they never sent anyone to fix it    Communication was poor  and they would always say  we ll send someone to fix it    There are two very yappy dogs next door  which I know they can t do anything about    The gym was also under construction  They recommended another building that was a   minute walk    Pros    The location is about a       minute walk to Barnes    The view from the apartment was great   The guys at the front desk were awesome    I was supposed to stay for   months  but left after    days due to my experience 
400003030097578667,TV instruction Air conditioning and heating instructions No coffee maker just a French press Few things we disliked    It was clean but the smell of pine sol was very strong  The area rug and sofas were very dirty  old stain  the upstairs coffee table was broken and very dangerous  Really bad  A garbage bag was at the back door which was very unpleasant   In  the main  bathroom  the towel bracket was loose   The bathroom downstairs has a leak I m not sure from the shower or the roof  Also a description on how to turn the TV on would be nice and there was no knife  even for butter  My intention is not to be negative but you need to fix these things  
505797739159547762,Do not recommend booking with Zencity    if you need anything from them  they will not help you  We    couples  booked this place for a Friendsgiving trip  We arrived in the evening  and the next morning  I immediately notified Zencity of an issue in the kitchen  clogged insinkerator and rotting fish smell from the sink  presumably from a previous guest that cooked fish and tried to put it down the insinkerator   Zencity said they would send out a technician to fix the issue  but never did  They then  escalated  the issue  but again there was no resolution  Nevermind the fact that they never fixed the issue in the first place which negatively affected our stay  now that weve checked out they try to charge us for  unexpected clean  in the kitchen    A  How is it  unexpected  given that I alerted you immediately  we corresponded about it B  How is it our fault that your team failed to come and fix the issue promptly  when I clearly stated in my messages  have all the screenshots to prove it  that  you should send someone out ASAP to avoid further damage   I am beyond angry and frustrated  I have been a stellar airbnb guest throughout my   years of joining Airbnb  go read the    positive reviews that other hosts have left about my stay   and have never had trouble with hosts  Zencity  I am sorely disappointed by our stay  The morning after our check in  I immediately notified you of an issue in the kitchen  clogged insinkerator and rotting fish smell from the sink  presumably from a previous guest that cooked fish and tried to put it down the insinkerator   You said you would send out a technician to fix the issue  but never did  You then  escalated  the issue  but again there was no resolution  Nevermind the fact that you never fixed the issue in the first place which negatively affected our stay  now that weve checked out you try you try to charge us for  unexpected clean  in the kitchen    I am beyond angry and frustrated 
430339516025826032,This was far and away the worst experience I have ever had with an AirBNB  Zencity provided us with an incorrect code to get into the building  We proceeded to have to stand in the rain for    minutes while they got us another code  Once that was resolved  we went to the room to find that there was no fob for us to access the amenities in the building including the pool and parking garage  We called to ask that we get one so we could access these things and we were told it would be delivered to the front desk in the morning  They proceeded to not have one delivered and subsequently told us they would not be able to provide one  We were staying for four days and that is unacceptable  We filed a complaint and they did not respond within the    hour window  They had every opportunity to make it right and they told us they would not even make the effort to deliver on the things promised in the listing  We will not be staying with them again  You should resolve the issue with the fob  We should not have to stay for   days with no access to the amenities in the building  You also need to review your email being sent to ensure it is correct  We stood out front in the rain for    minutes because the entry code for the building we received was incorrect 
441312726140126047,yay thanks there was several things broken and also there wasnt any laundry soap or shower or bath stuff lamp was broken   I wasnt very satisfied this stay  also the fact the code to get into the building didnt work and I didnt hear back from zencity about anything to really assist with the problem which was extremely upsetting for me because I had my children with me there 
486157634827850347,The worst Airbnb experience I have ever had from start the finish  DO NOT BOOK WITH ZENACITY  We had issues with every part of the check in process which caused us to miss reservations and added stress to the entire trip  When we arrived  the voice box wasn t working but luckily a postal worker was able to let us into the building  We didn t have the key fob to get into the elevator  and zenacity wasn t responding to help so we were able to find a random person to let us up to our floor  THEN the key pad into our unit wasn t working  which took zenacity over an hour to figure out until we could finally get in  Our problems were supposed to end here  as there was supposed to be a key fob in our unit which would allow us to get back into the building  but low and behold no key fob  I contacted zenacity several times throughout the weekend but we were never provided with a key fob so we had to rely on other people coming and going to get us into the building and up to our floor  Following the stay  we had reached out to zenacity to give a chance for them to rightfully compensate for the entire experience  but they have stopped responding altogether now that they have our money  I will never book with zenacity again and you shouldn t either 
425382164553096093,  flights of stairs to get to the rental  It s very small  You hear sirens all night to where it s hard to sleep  Not the best area to stay in 
522493208244801311,It was a very last minute stay for me  The location was nice  close to everything  safe  Easy instructions to access the building and room  The water pressure was good and hot  It was very nice having a washer and dryer in the unit to wash clothes  The building was quiet  Had a smart tv with Netflix and Hulu on it  The only complaints I have is that the window blinds don t block much light at all so it was very bright in the room  This was an issue for me since I work nights at the hospital  The other complaint is that it was very dirty on the floors  lots of dust bunnies and debris that needed vacuumed  and the vacuum didn t work so I couldn t vacuum it myself  Everything was also rather dusty  Cleanliness just needs worked on but the rest was as described and helpful  I know it was a last minute stay but I did expect the place to be cleaner  when getting there the floor was dirty with dust and debris all over  everything was dusty  And the vacuum didn t work so I couldn t vacuum and mop it myself either  It is also very bright in that room  I d recommend some curtains to help with the light  Everything else was good for the price and it being last minute  The building was quiet  The water was hot and had good pressure  It was easy to get in and out  the location was safe and close  You were helpful in providing areas to park  My only complaints were the cleanliness and the brightness  Thank you again 
424546214837995692,The location was great upon arrival first impressions of the apartment was great until night fall there was no air of course I communicated this to the host and they reassured me they would set the air to cool off the unit  Well day two still no air also we noticed the washer and dryer set washing working only because there was a smell in the kitchen and that came from water sitting in the washer for a while which caused it to stink and I communicated this with the host as well and they sent a bogus nose complaint automated email which did make sense because at the time they sent it everyone was trying to sleep so the whole stay just became a headache the air didn t work at all not did the washer and dryer and we got no help with any of our issues so I don t not recommend anyone booking this location communication is horrible  Well it s horrible when you have complaints  Communication is key I was being communicated with up until I had issues
416589934843952774,No private or safe parking was offered  Street parking in the area is very sketchy and I had my car broken into twice including busted out windows  When I raised the concern responses took a few days each time and they weren t too concerned with the lack of safety and my car getting busted into  Not offering safe parking is a huge mistake  In my stay  my car was broken into twice because you don t offer a parking spot on site  Had to park on street and had my windows busted out in two separate occasions  When I raised the concern no communication back was received other than a  tough luck  message  Not happy with that 
404259227689354248,Horrible experience  After driving a whole   hours  we arrived and our entrance code didn t work  We messaged and after a whole   hours we ended up having to get a hotel room  When we messaged this company for a refund they didn t even bother to reply  DO NOT BOOK HERE  We arrived and our entrance code did not work  We drove over   hours and we didn t receive a response till a whole   hours after we messaged y all  We were tired and had already had to get a hotel for us to rest  Horrible experience experience and we requested a refund and no response was made 
455806907067233772,This experience was the worst   From accessing the building  Instructions are not clear and confusing   I was let in by guest s    Having    seconds to make it to the elevator  because you don t have the fob yet in room     To arriving to your room only to finding out that your suite doesn t have a fob key   Because of all of this  I was left in a building where fob keys are used to operate the elevator and even the stairwell if you needed to move from floor to floor    I called and called all three days to not only receive little to no help but I was offered     off my stay  UNACCEPTABLE     Day    Friday    I arrived late in the evening and didn t make a call to Zencity  The next day  I did   Day     Saturday    I made   calls to Zencity about this issue  I was told the same thing over and over  They ll call management to get this resolved  When I had to leave the building  I could take the elevator to the  rd floor but couldn t come back up to my suite  Which  was on the  th floor  I had to either ask strangers to let me in  Or  ask the security that was his post to help me  I eventually had to cancel all my plans  I called additional   more times from the lack of call backs to only receive a message saying  we re moving you to the third floor  However  without a key fob  that was impossible  No staff  no random people were moving around the building in the late evening  I was then told to stay where I was   th floor  until staff arrived in the morning    Day    Sunday    I called multiple times  The issue was still not resolved  I could not move up and down the building with the fob key   Check out day  Monday    I was told there s no staff over the weekend so there was nothing they could do about it  My issue was basically brushed off by everyone the entire weekend stating the same thing   I ll call upper management to get this resolved   At the time I was ready to depart  I went to their  staff office  to find out that because this company is based out of California they had to call in and report issues  There was nothing I could request on site  They would have to approve it  At this point  I ve talked to   reps on this day and I would think they should ve placed a call immediately   The ONLY reason why I had so much communication with them is because I KEPT CALLING    The company AirBnb stated that after I was having issues  I should ve called them directly for a refund  I never seen this posted anyway  Supposedly  guests that experiences issues only have    hours to report directly with them  Or  you stuck only requesting a refund with the host    Out of       they decided to refund me     from an issue that caused me anxiety  lack of movement  no accessible to my suite  and prepaid cancellations of plans    Do not book this lockbox    With having no staff to assist guest that arrives to a room with no fob key is a NIGHTMARE    The worst experience ever 
442679497700604115,This was a terrible experience  honestly  My friends and I had to stand outside and wait for someone else to walk out so that we were able to get in  There was no key fob in the apartment  the woman said we wouldn t need one  We went out to a club  came back and were stranded outside for   hours because we DID in fact need a fob  The intercom was broken  They had to place us in another home for the night  forcing us to leave our belongings in the other apartment for the night  Aside from that  the man I spoke to on the phone BLOCKED MY NUMBER and I had to call from another phone  I ll be requesting for a full partial refund  However  the places were beautiful and clean  Just very unprofessional       
455818825092522181,what you see is what you get   Theres one TV in the living room no local channels  the place seems to ha e an echo so dont talk to loud or youll get tons of noise complaints   and if youre coming with alot of things walk a stroller to carry your things to save you the troubles to get to an from the garage      other than that its OK 
418856772583766389,There were pros and cons  Ill start with pros  Pros   onsite gym  full kitchen  lots of channels on tv  furniture decor nicely styled   elevator  Cons   dirty bathroom  tub not draining properly  window a c units very loud and turning on off all night long  right next to hospital so ambulances all night long  no parking  which is stated in description  but REALLY inconvenient for travelers who are driving   Did not get instructions for check in   had to ask twice  Then  message that was sent seemed like a bot automated message without key code several hours after original check in time   It was ok for me because I was on the road and arrived very late  but if you wanted to check in right at    it would be a problem   It was very late when we got in  so I had to call the  host   which is a company with different employees   I got a message from someone different each time I sent a message through airbnb   At first attempt of calling unable to get through or leave a message for anyone  Second attempt reached someone very nice  but he was unable to send key code  He called back right away and was able to unlock key box from his end  which was great  but after a long day of traveling and poor communication from Zencity  it made a bad ending to a long day  After all that  the unit  which was nice looking  was loud and had a hard time sleeping due to ambulances coming to the hospital all night long  Unfortunately  we would not stay here again  The bathroom was not clean  It appeared tidy  but the tub had clearly not been clean out  Bunch of little hairs like someone had shaved prior to us being there  Also  tub not draining well  Even with draining problem  I was able to clean tub before I showered though  This  along with the key card issueis the reason for my review 
415921011973905353,BEWARE  Our check in instructions for the lockbox were inaccurate and we were unable to get in  I sent multiple messages with no response  When we called  we were given a completely different set of instructions to open a lockbox that was supposed to have several key fobs I side  The lockbox was completely empty  When we called a second time  the person we spoke to didnt know how to help us and promised another person would call us right back  We never heard back and had to find and pay for a hotel at       pm

433268745238270645,Good things   Location  kitchen  This place was not well clean   I didnt see toenails like Ava but certainly plenty of hair  dust   Im honestly not sure if the cow rug was every clean   The shower is abysmal   It has no more pressure than someone gently spitting water at you and it doesnt drain all that well     Although this place is listed as a single level home you should know that it takes   flights to get up there and in classic Chicago fashion they would likely be considered out of date with building code these days   Once you get up there it is great to be above the street but it is no quieter at the top than at the bottom   I lived in Chicago for years and got used to the train  but if someone decides to be loud on the street in the middle of the night you will hear every last thing   The biggest complaint   Got a message from Zencity that we the property manager owner was going to be coming our last day for a tour   I responded and said that was not okay to have anyone in the place while we stayed   Im not hyper crazy about Covid but also not a fan of having someone s  I dont know in the only place I call  home    Got no response so messaged again and got told it was mandatory and they were coming   Contacted Air BnB and they agreed that was not okay   Got a call from zencity and I told them explicitly no to anyone in the place   They repeatedly asked if i would not give permission and said i did not give it   only at the   th hour  about    min before the  visit   did they call me to tell me that they postponed it     I would not stay here again   I would easily choose any of the other locations in the area over this one
419564019111147944,Weekend stay  Somewhat close to powerlight district  However  a long     blocks  The apartment was just like the photos  Pretty basic  We were worried about the check in process and key fob issues based on other reviews  However  once we got in the building and got the key card fob  in the room  all was well  You need that key card to not only get in the building but use the elevator up or down  So checking out and leaving the key card in the apartment was tricky  Value vs amenities was off  Pool hot tub closed  Entertainment  pool table  area in the photos  CLOSED  Many live there with barking dogs    I felt the place was a bit overpriced based on what we observed  EDIT  WE WERE JUST CHARGED      for dirty rags and marks on pillow cases due to womens make up    UNBELIEVABLE    DO NOT STAY HERE    REPEAT   DO NOT STAY HERE  Although there is little you can do about this but the barking dogs in the apartments are far from pleasant for a stay  We were also not aware that the pool and hot tub area were closed  That was a bummer as well   We thought the value of amenities vs cost associated was a bit off  Way too much to pay for a tiny efficiency with barking dogs and no parking with no hot tub  pool and living area was also closed  Should be disclosed   ARE YOU KIDDING ME    I WAS JUST CHARGED      for dirty rags and pillow cases   WHAT A JOKE    Its makeup  Wash the damn things before charging a guest this ridiculous amount        SO INCONSIDERATE    NEVER AGAIN   Review will be changed to reflect 
429664084045689643,The place wasn t as clean as it should ve been according to their clean standards  The pin I was given to get the key didn t work so I had to call and get them to open the key slot  The place wasn t clean to the standard it was made out to have been  There was hair in the shower from the last people that stayed  There was a piece of cat food under the bean bag style chair  There were stains all over the bedding  The window ledges were dirty  It was an okay stay and the place did it s job but it definitely wasn t as nice as it was made out to be on the description 
431073048165907414,Overall  the apartment is great for a place to check out  Incredibly soundproof for being next to the train and the Lakeview location is great you can walk or bike anywhere    My husband and I s issue is with ZenCity and communication  The AC went out for   days while we were staying and getting a response or maintenance plan was virtually impossible  We messaged through the app  we got the same cookie cutter response from   different people and after responding  never got a follow up  and calling ZenCity directly  sat on hold for    minutes before giving up   We had to have Airbnb attempt to contact  which got maintenance to our place  but we never received a heads up which would have been appreciated  Fortunately it wasn t as hot as it could ve been  but coming back to an    degree apartment after walking around Chicago all day isn t awesome  Improve communication and response times or ease of contact 
444184441599275558,This is a horrible place to stay  The place smelled like smoke it had cigarette burns on the carpet  the paint was chipping in the window panes   The elevators and hallways were dirty and smelled like pee   It s not a loft it s a community apartment living  This is a horrible place to stay  The place smelled like smoke it had cigarette burns on the carpet  the paint was chipping in the window panes   The elevators and hallways were dirty and smelled like pee   It s not a loft it s a community apartment living 
424646315950082642,There were no keys to get in as described by the host  We were allowed into the building by a neighbor and the apartment door was unlocked  That is when we found out about the scam and called the police  The host did not respond to any of our messages the day of the arrival  We got scammed  The place was unfurnished  The furniture you see is virtual  We had to find another place to stay and completed a police report  Watch out for scams 
447777504763908159,Sorry  but we cannot recommend this place  As another guest noted  we too were bothered by the constant smell of marijuana in the building  The entryway lobby was filthy  and not totally secure  as anyone could enter the lobby and elevator from the adjacent restaurant  The apartment was dingy and in need of a deep clean and an overall paint job  A large broken window was shockingly  repaired  by simply attaching plexiglass over it  the drapes were falling down  paintings and hardware were missing or missing parts  The kitchen equipment provided was comically cheap and sparse  Altogether  not a welcoming nor comfortable place to retreat to at the end of the day  A great idea  But sorry  this did not at all match what we expected from the listing  what view    nor rise to our expectations of cleanliness or care about the accommodation  To be fair  were not sure what you can do about neighbors use of marijuana  but the odor was pervasive and constant and unpleasant  especially in a non smoking building  And we of course realize that you cant do anything about the streets around the loft being more vibrant   Covid did shut a lot of small shops and restaurants  we clearly see    But we found the apartment to be      Dingy   It really needs a deep clean and a paint job  rugs were dirty and plainly not vacuumed on arrival  the oven was dirty  the hallway is dark  the street entry and lobby are unkempt and filthy  empty flower pots are also really sad    We could not tell that there was any special  covid  clean      In poor repair   The broken window shockingly  fixed  by attaching plexiglass over it  drapes falling down  missing hardware  bath lights out  painting missing from the wall  kitchen sink and toilet missing small but noticeable parts      Cheaply appointed   Silverware comically small and cheap  teakettle   a french press does not equal  coffee maker   a cutting board would have been nice  all the floor lamps were wobbly 
413753408860162276,A C was out entire stay   Was able to leave last day and get a partial refund   However location is great   recommend having a filling insured vehicle for the area though  
399952451731489102,WE DONT RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY  We had several issues with the apartment      The apartment is not kept well  It was dirty mainly in  the kitchen area and the rugs    The racks in the oven can t be pulled out which almost caused a fire in the apartment      The garbage disposal did not work   and the phone number they provided to use during our stay never responded      The kitchen does not have enough utensils and kitchen rags  The pots are old and dirty  the silverware was dirty  They do not provide you with soap in the showers there is only hand soap in the sinks and one of the dispensers did not work   The garbage can was dirty abs broken  The bathroom s trash cans did not have bags to help with hygiene      The  areas in the deck are for private use only and not open for airbandb customers as advertised   We were told to leave the area by upset  residents     A few outlets did not work    The overall feel is of an unkept apartment   it was not a pleasant stay   WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APARTMENT We had several issues with the apartment      It was not clean  mainly the kitchen area and the rugs    The racks in the oven can t be pulled out which caused the gravy of my meat to spill catching the oven in flames    a very dangerous experience      The garbage disposal did not work   we called the number you gave us several times only once someone answered who said somebody from management will call is back but this never happened  We spent the weekend with the sink full of dirty water    One kitchen rag is not enough    You should be embarrassed to have those old pots and pans in a rental apartment    The silverware was dirty      The description of the apartment said that the roof top was available yo is but when we used it a resident came upstairs and said that the area was theirs and was private and we could not use it  You misinformed us     There was no soap to shower 
428193659753155920,Don t reserve an early check in  they will accept it to have your business and once you arrive they will give you the run around until   pm  the normal check in  The place is nice but that s the end of my compliments  The place smelled like smoke after I had to wait   hours into my reservation to even get in  They never gave me a parking pass yet they charged me afterwards for the missing parking pass even though I told them there was none when I showed up  I literally had to write a note and leave it on my dashboard to stop my car from being towed  This is a company not a person and if anything is incorrect don t worry about them fixing it because they respond once or twice per day  and if you call they will get off the phone and say they will call you back and frankly it s       that they call back  Worst   day stay I ve had anywhere in saint louis 
416659688569156506,Great place to stay at if you re looking for a place to rest and sleep at after being out in the city all day  It was difficult to find free parking   just gata be patient and look around surrounding streets  Hii over all our stay was good  Thank you for hosting us on such a late notice  Below are just a few suggestions    parking was very difficult to find  if you could provide at least one parking permit that would be easier or just provide clearer instructions on where to find parking and what streets you suggest   either replace or deep clean the carpet and curtains  it would make the place feel cleaner   need more towels  at least    I think you only provided      maybe have locked perimeters on the thermostat if possible    to prevent it from completely turning off  and returning to a hot Airbnb   Thank you   
416802803247894691,Host doesn t respond when there are issues   the patio is not usable Since you had to refund me because host didn t respond to Air not working   patio can t be use with garbage   lawn not kept up  Directions to get in were not easy to follow
745654642,Nice place to stay Took while before giving me the code
420207831767978996,I ll start with the good and say that this is indeed an overall nice apartment in a beautiful little neighborhood   However  I m pretty disappointed in how the place is equipped  The internet did not function whatsoever after day    I spoke with another tenant of the building and she said her internet was down and the landlord did not respond    The kitchen had   sets of silverware  no cutting board  no kitchen shears etc  The coffee table was broken and you could barely set anything on it  There were no curtains on any of the windows  only blinds which made it difficult to sleep past daybreak  Overall it was the most Ive ever spent on an airbnb and they lacked basic necessities 
402092297703172241,Overall we had an okay stay in our unit but it is not a place we will book again  I don t recommend because of the lack of simple things  things that were expected but not provided  In the pictures it shows the roof top but the four sections of the roof with seating was for other apartments  They did not correspond to this unit  There were many problems  The sheets did not fit the bed so they constantly slid off to reveal a plastic over the mattress through the night  The bed sheets and pillow cases and comforter were not clean  They smelled musty  We had to wash them ourselves  no laundry soap included and no toiletries  Dish soap was placed in the shower as shampoo   The disposal in the kitchen was broken  they came to fix that but did not fix the other issues   The kitchen trash was broken  the stove was very dirty  floors were dirty with particles and hair  They messaged saying we needed to turn down the noise because there was a complaint but there was no loud noises from us because my baby was sleeping in the room with the door open during that time  There was also no good check out instructions so we didn t know where to place our trash  Some suggestions  Sheets that fit the beds  include toiletries and not dish soap in the shower  add trash bags to bathrooms  include directions for check out and where to throw out the trash  clean linens  kitchen  and floors better  All were dirty in all rooms 
402092163141954099,Apt itself was nice size and layout  Very close   convenient to be able to walk to the Union Station  sculpture garden  Blues Museum  City Museum  and all places downtown   Washer and dryer worked well  Plenty of paper products    A few cautions       Rooftop pool is NOT a pool  It s an oversized hot tub  We would have left had we been able to because this was a prime reason we chose this place       Only one key is provided   We really needed two sets of keys for our larger party  This was a huge inconvenience  It was also a safety issue when it came to being evacuated for a possible fire on the last night we stayed       The swipe card never worked for the garage  We had to push the button and wait to be buzzed out everytime  sometimes backing up     cars behind us with ppl honking at us because we couldn t get out       Upon arrival the range did not work  We didn t find this out until we bought frozen food to cook for dinner later the first night  No range meant we had to order in food       which is not we expected to do nor what we d expect from a highly rated  AirBNB  Range was repaired the next day  to their credit  Rooftop pool is NOT a pool  It s an oversized hot tub  We would have left had we been able to because this was a prime reason we chose this place    Apt itself was nice size and layout    Chairs at the table are terrible   feel like they re going to break   Need two sets of keys for larger party  This was a huge inconvenience  It was also a safety issue when it came to being evacuated for a possible fire on Weds night    The swipe card never worked for the garage  We had to push the button and wait to be buzzed out everytime  sometimes backing up     cars behind us with ppl honking at us because we couldn t get out    Upon arrival the range did not work  We didn t find this out until we bought frozen food to cook for dinner later the first night  No range meant we had yo irder in food       which is not we expected to do nor what we d expect from a highly rated  AirBNB    Appreciated having plenty of paper towels and toilet paper as well as the washer and dryer  as expected 
404346929424552810,Couch is disgusting
445590494922332389,The positive  the location for this apartment is fantastic and the neighborhood is very walkable with great restaurants and shops    The negatives     the apartment was not sufficiently clean when we checked in which included us having to wash sheets and towels before we used them due to smelling like smoke   the ac went out during our stay   ZenCity is a corporate management entity that owns numerous apartments and they were far less responsive helpful than I ve found individual owners to be  I rarely give less than a     star rating as anytime I ve ever run into an issue owners are always extremely helpful in resolving  I also offer owners a lot of grace because as a previous host I know things sometimes go wrong that are out of their control  ZenCity was horrible and I d recommend staying away from any ZenCity properties  I certainly won t be booking with them again  Did not address issues with us having to wash  clean  sheets and towels because they smelled like smoke  Toilet was not appropriately clean  Bathroom sink had significant mold  AC stopped working on Sunday  Garbage disposal and stove oven were not working due to breakers being flipped  Kitchen floor was sticky  Shower corners and door track dirty  When I called about the apartment not being clean appropriately I was told the clean crew would come back and they never did
465171825310985289,An okay experience  Booked as a long term rental  It was spacious  the beds were comfortable  and it was a good location  However  communication with the hosts proved to be quite the challenge   The water heater was leaking so we notified the hosts the first week of our stay  It did not get fixed until two months later  During this time  maintenance people entered several times without notice or announcing their presence  The hosts asked us once for our permission for maintenance to enter  but they asked this when maintenance was already in our apartment  Toward the end of our stay  we awoke one afternoon to the lock on our front door having been changed from the keypad to a lock and key  however  no key was left  We contacted the hosts about this and didn t find out any information for   days after multiple attempts to contact  Turns out there was an issue with the hosts paying rent  so the building s people changed the lock  But they didn t come to change it back for   two days and we had to contact the hosts multiple times again for any information  Overall  the hosts communication was a bit of a challenge  but it was a fairly nice place to stay  I would recommend communicating with building maintenance to improve getting consent to enter the apartment  I would also write a different check in note for long term stays for tasks like where to take the trash  Additionally  the doors to enter the building each have different codes  This  the one we were given for our door was not correct 
489866381103582691,unclean bed sheets  thin pillows  low quality mattress  promised three times to send cleaners fix problems and nothing  dirty stove  no trims in kitchen or bath  basic unit that feels like a mattress on the floor of an abandoned unit  you all are a scam 
420245250882015962,It s not this unit but the people outside of it have no respect for the building and it s people
443457097762548255,Very creepy building  Pretty sure it s haunted  And I didn t even think I believed in that kind of stuff 
424627139802255385,When we arrived at the Airbnb for our   night stay the check in was a nightmare  The code to get in using the front intercom system didnt work  We stood out there for a while trying to get in until someone let us into the building  Luckily the apartment code worked and we were able to get into the apartment  The apartment was very basic  and it was average for cleanliness  After looking around at the Airbnb  we looked for the building FOB that was supposed to be in the apartment  but it was also missing  After talking to the customer service reps we found out that we wouldnt get the FOB till the next day at an unknown time  So while I stayed inside the building my partner was on the phone with the CSR to try to reset the front intercom system code so we could go out to do things with family  But the reset didnt work  So we had to cancel our evening and morning plans and had to make adjustments to the rest of the next day to make sure we would be able to get back before the office closed to pick up the FOB from them   Then when I reached out to the host to get a partial refund for travel issues that made me have to cancel my important family plans  they never responded back  I will never book with this company again  I had high expectations for this company because they had several properties and they were a business  But my experience and response from hosts that directly rent out their property have been far better than this one  Please make sure the front door to this building is accessible by the guests or put in the info that they need to arrive before the office closes so they can get in  Also  the apartment door auto lock is very finicky  getting it fixed so guests dont accidentally walk away before it locks would be a good idea too 
444201988306916251,The area did not feel safe  and the apartment smelled like weed  I was unable to stay  Unfortunately I was unable to stay here due to the smell of weed and having a history of lung issues  The place really needed vacuumed  the window was open   broken  and I was stopped by two people in the dark just trying to get into the building  I ended up having to pay for a hotel for my stay and am hoping this money will be refunded to me  Thank you 
420998211748510644,The blinds were torn up  There s holes in the door lol  The shower is so loud in the larger bathroom  The wall behind the sink seems to be falling apart   The microwave didn t work at all  Had to use the stove to warm up food   Other than that the place is comfortable and updated  When I arrived there was no key in the key box and it took    mins to enter the unit but other than that the location is perfect and again the place is comfortable  Cheaply put together but it s still comfortable  You guys should fix the minor cosmetic issues  And replace the broken appliances  The blinds were torn up  There s holes in the door lol  The shower is so loud in the larger bathroom  The wall behind the sink seems to be falling apart   Other than that the place is comfortable and updated  When I arrived there was no key in the key box and it took    mins to enter the unit but other than that the location is perfect and again the place is comfortable  Cheaply put together but it s still comfortable  You guys should fix the minor cosmetic issues  Other than that thanks for having me 
414486240550508289,RUN   Not only is this listing not COVID clean  it s not even a half step above  enter at your own risk   There were hair clippings in the toilet  yep  those hairs   some sort of dried crust on the kitchen countertop  a dirty towel on the bathroom floor  HAIRS AND STAINS on the bedsheets  used tissue in the bathroom trashcan  and a filthy area rug in the living room  After hustling for a different rental  I left the same night as I checked in  I immediately communicated with Zencity   They offered a  touch up clean  and     off future stays  Bless their hearts   I ve been an Airbnb guest since       staying in a variety of rental types   extra bedrooms  basement  apartments   guest houses with multiple private bedrooms but shared bathrooms  This is the first time I ve straight up vacated and requested a refund   I also sought support from Airbnb but they ve got zero cares   If it were possible  I d post photos in my review because there are plenty and they are gross   At this point   I m out       and for real  Airbnb has provided nothing but ghosting   Maybe they own Zencity  Zencity has made it clear that accountability and veracity are at the bottom of their priority list   The  review  that some unknown respondent stated my refund request was currently under has lasted much longer than the promised  we will update you as soon as possible   That was sent to me on July      If someone that hasn t communicated with me is reading this and would like photos  I m happy to send them   Refund my fee  I did not stay in the apt 
400776904164588975,This is my first and last attempt with an air BNB  I had to waste nearly four hours of my time and skip out on plans due to the fact I was trapped in the building  No intercoms systems worked and a tenant was nice enough to get us in and to the room where a key fob was supposed to be  When we arrived there was no key fob and when I called the for the second time about issues getting in and not having a key fob I was argued with u til I provided a picture showing no fob  Without having the fob I couldnt leave the building because I wouldnt be able to get back in  I was told I would relieve a call back and instead waited an hour and had to call back myself  I restated the issues as we had no key fob and was told that someone would be working on it again  After another hour of wasting my time I have asked for a full refund 
405697887201500486,  Not clean Couldn t get in room code did note work   Dirty towels Dirty bathroom  Dirty bed
420925985155845235,Ummm    Let me start with the positives   The location is great  the morning sunrise view is beautiful  finding food  as long as you arent  looking for late night bites  is not hard  there is a gym in the building and when I need help with the internet acting wonky the host was responsive  Now for the BS  the couch NEEDS TO GO  Not only is it worn out  it is uncomfortable to sit on  The microwave  was dirty and so was the refrigerator  The air conditioner barely cools the apartment  so beware  Due to the fact that the kitchen was filthy upon arrival  Im  almost certain the rest of the apartment received a half way tidy up  although the description of the unit stated that the apartment gets an enhanced and thorough clean  Especially because its COVID pandemic time  you would think they actually clean the place thoroughly  The are no basic commodities like  soap  shampoo  lotion  band aids  body wash  an iron  a mop  a broom  clean supplies  extra toilet paper  extra paper towels  pots   pans and sponges  When I complained about the uncleanness I  was NOT met with an apology  nor a returned portion of what I paid to stay there  As a matter of fact  I didnt get a response at all about my concerns  I am still trying to figure out where do I complain to further escalate the matter because  this was a huge issue  Especially because when I asked if I can check in about an hour or   earlier to decorate the apartment for my mate because the trip was a special trip  I was told I couldnt  because the clean service had to clean the apartment as another guest was checking out earlier that day  Also  the ceiling  in the bathroom and bedroom  a badly cracked and the plaster and paint are hanging  Im probably missing other details but this pretty much covers how unsatisfactory this unit is  Zencity is not where you will find your zen  as areas of zen are usually clean  This is apartment isnt  as welcoming  as the description details  Might I suggest actually  having a clean  service clean the apartment before renting it out to guests  Also  youight want to get a new couch that couch has ran its course There was no pool and if we had access to one itt wasnt  in the building  we checked  Also  when your guest is inquiring  about the cleanliness of property  it would be much obliged if the host actually responded instead of ignoring the inquiry altogether  Lastly  there is absolutely no good reason why any unit should be rented unclean to any patron 
566016870485731805,The only decent thing about this place was that it was warm  had a decent location and had a roof over it  The check in process was HORRIBLE  arrived at night to find several lock boxes to try because they gave us the wrong code in the instructions  luckily in one of their pictures the correct code was there  The instructions that were sent suggested that there should be more than two keys  so while looking for the second key  the first one was tried on the door which it DID NOT OPEN after trying several times our fingers became frozen and we sat back in the car to regain warmth  After trying to call message the host and support until almost  am to which no response was given  I re read the reviews to see another stayer left a helpful tip  the door sticks and to jiggle the door knob while trying to get in  Luckily this worked  I messaged the host letting them know we got in  The host messaged back later the next day nonchalantly saying they re glad we got in  Not offering to do anything for the inconvenience   Then after getting inside and being beyond exhausted seeing that there was dirt all over the shower  walls and ceiling  As well as floor boards coming up and stains on the floor we felt beyond cheated and wanted to leave right away  Support began messaging me on behalf of zencity to which I thought it was zencity so when I reported everything to them they said they couldn t do anything because I didn t report it to zencity on the first day  KEEP YOUR MONEY AND STAY ELSEWHERE    Your place needs updated  needs to be clean thoroughly and needs better check in instructions 
488588797676240420,Room was ok  Beware of area  This part of town can be rough  Someone on the street came at me  took at wild swing at me  while I was walking to pickup chinese food in the middle of the day   Just be vigilante in this area and keep distance from people on street  I haven t had this problem in any other area or city  The area is just not ideal  the room is nice enough  except the blinds could be replaced with a curtain to blackout street lights  Room did have a particular odor  Not sure if it was bad just not fresh 
405764530821970557,Check in was off to a rocky start  the key box was empty and the key was locked inside on the armoire  I waited   hours until someone finally answered the phone  He told me it was  no problem   It was     degrees out  I begged to differ   Room was okay  could use some TLC with stains and rust  The TV has no sound  The kitchen is minimally stocked and tiny  my dreams of cooking at  home  weren t possible to realize  The neighborhood was well located  the street felt pretty safe  parking was easy and they let me extend my stay which was cool 
401439174436207317,This seems to be a hit or miss as far as whether you are going to get a clean place to stay I have read several reviews that were positive and several that were negative  I enjoyed the location however the floors were sticky  and the shower had mildew all around the bottom  The building smelled of weed every time you walked in  The apartment had sticky floors  the shower had mildew all over it 
445630373350599797,This place was grossly misrepresented in the photos and description  When we arrived the place looked like it was barely  if at all  clean  The surfaces were dusty and dirty  the couch cushions and pillows were stained  the blankets smelled terrible and musty  and the kitchen counter and floor had multiple fragments of broken glass   not something you expect to deal with when you re spending over      night  We spent the morning of our first full day clean and throwing things in the wash to feel comfortable in what was supposed to be our home for the weekend   thank god there was a laundry setup in the unit     On our second night my partner and I went out to celebrate our anniversary and returned to our hallway floor covered in water and disgusting brown water leaking from the ceiling  right outside of our bathroom  We alerted the host immediately and were told by one of the Zencity reps to take whatever extra towels and sheets we had and place them underneath the leak to absorb the water until it could be fixed  We spent the rest of that night livid because we kept hearing a steady drip of the water from the ceiling and had to pass this mess and have water drip on our heads each time we wanted to use the bathroom    By morning the leaking had stopped thankfully  but our experience was already ruined  I of course requested a refund from Zencity and was told they could only refund the clean fees and     for the ceiling leak  which felt like a major downplay of the issues and a lack of taking responsibility for the state of their unit    I would absolutely NOT RECOMMEND this Airbnb rental based on my personal experience and will avoid the Zencity company at all costs    The only positive to this unit was the location  which was walking distance to food  shopping and public transportation and felt safe at night  Otherwise I would suggest looking elsewhere  The Airbnb unit was grossly misrepresented and quality control was lacking  Management took little responsibility for the fact that the unit was filthy  had broken items  couch cushions  toilet seat  kitchen drawers  broken glass and dish   and sprung a leak halfway through our stay 
457155926758331953,The unit was DISGUSTING and Very Dirty  Not at all like pictured  Very disappointed
421039024998180281,This was my first experience with airbnb and Zencity specifically  Zencity offered great communication prior to the trip  However  when I arrived with my young daughter we were unable to get into the building with the code  After a few attempts  an individual from the building came out to let us in and told me to just push the door hard because the door was broken  I should have left after this incident  but I decided to give it a shot  We traveled up the elevator  that looked like it hadn t been vacuumed in months and smelled like weed  and got to the apartment  Once we got inside  the wear and tear of the apartment was evident  The only lock on the door was not secured and left me feeling unsafe  I called Zencity to cancel the reservation and ended up booking a hotel for our stay  This apartment may be great for singles looking to enjoy St  Louis or a quick getaway  but it did not provide me with the safety and security I needed to travel with my daughter  Please check the security of this location  The outside door to the building and the apartment lock are not secure  This needs to be addressed for security and safety purposes 
402148936204590236,Entry instructions did not work and assistance never came  Multiple noise complaints for normal TV volume  Great location  As I mentioned I could get into building for    minutes in the hot sun  Multiple sound compliant for TV volume  Unacceptable 
447796166110493151,So let me start off by saying  the apartment itself is beautiful  But  this was probably my least favorite place Ive ever stayed  I think it would be OK for a short stay  but I definitely wouldnt recommend for a long term stay  The kitchen is minimally stocked in the way of kitchenware  There were absolutely no pot holders oven mitts and only one thin kitchen towel  and no kitchen rags  There was no parking pass when I arrived  I sent multiple messages about it  and Id read the other reviews about the host trying to charge for the missing parking pass  so it wasnt until I sent them a message that they better not try and charge me for it that they brought me over a parking pass  My key fob stopped working to get into the building  and the area with the trash cans  within a week into my stay  and when I messaged the host about it  they didnt even try to solve the problem  So thankfully  someone else who lived in the building gave me the code to access the building from the parking lot door  The apartment is also ground level  and the street is right outside the window  So you can hear cars drive by  and people walking by as well  like  you can clearly hear their conversations as they walk by   Having been to St  Louis before  I didnt necessarily think this was a  bad  neighborhood  but my car did get broken into in the gated parking lot  Ill close this by again saying  the apartment itself is beautiful  but I would not stay here again 
447051506806371227,Place was clean  Only suggestion to add is a coffee maker and to fix the dishwasher  it didnt seem to be secured so it would rock back and forth when open  I was nervous the bottom shelf was going to roll out and the dishes would break    Parking is on the other end of the block with assigned spots   Customer service was fine up until Sunday  which it quickly went downhill  I had extended my stay an extra   days a few days into my stay and because of that the code on my door changed between Sat Sun  I was emailed this Thursday but did not see it until Sunday when I was already locked out  more so  the code expired    hours after it was sent so I couldnt use it regardless  If you plan on extending your stay  make sure you keep an eye out for your new code and use it ASAP so it doesnt expire    I was not able to get into my unit for   hours on Sunday  I called  the number listed for Zencity       times without any answer and unable to leave a voice message  I also left multiple messages with my phone number to please call me ASAP for Zencity via the Airbnb messenger without response  I then reached out to Airbnb directly  who also tried to contact Zencity via phone  email  and messenger and then instructed me to stay at a hotel for the night  Zencity called around   PM  which at that time I was already in my hotel for the night  I was told they were incredibly busy all day and thats why I was  not contacted sooner  which I find difficult to believe that if they are that busy they dont ask for more help or have some sort of emergency line   Furthermore  the days following I asked to speak to a manger multiple times and have not received a phone call or message from them to discuss any type of reimbursement  Im here for work  so the inconveniences on Sunday morning were after having worked night shift  I felt very stranded without anyone to get help from and by the time they called Sunday evening  I had been up for more than    hours  Luckily  I did not have to work that night as well  Very disappointing customer service  would not recommend this place  Place was very clean  Only suggestion to add is a coffee maker and to fix the dishwasher  it didnt seem to be secured so it would rock back and forth when open  The bottom shelf might roll out and cause damage to dishes    Customer service was fine up until Sunday  which it quickly went downhill  I had extended my stay and because of that the code on my door changed between Sat Sun  I was emailed this Thursday but did not see it until Sunday when I was already locked out  moreso  the code expired    hours after it was sent so I couldnt use it regardless   I think if a door code is going to be changed  that should be something that is verified with the tenant to ensure they have access via phone call or ensuring that they respond back to the email   I was not able to get into my unit for   hours on Sunday  I called  the number listed for Zencity       times without any answer and unable to leave a message  I also left multiple messages for Zencity via the Airbnb messenger without response  I then reached out to Airbnb directly  who also tied to contact Zencity via phone  email  and messenger and then instructed me to stay at a hotel for the night  Zencity called around   PM  which at that time I was already in my hotel for the night  I was told they were incredibly busy all day and thats why I was  not contacted sooner  which I find difficult to believe that if they are that busy they dont ask for more help or have some sort of emergency line for those locked out of their unit   Furthermore  the days following I asked to speak to a manger multiple times and have not received a phone call or message from them to discuss any type of reimbursement 
406502098910372713,Not the cleanest spot but for the value and location  its worth it 
406480780979108928,Need to change the smoke detector batteries   Overall  nice place to stay   especially location  the check in process was stressful b c I had to call and get the code on a spicy hot day in July I was ready to relax 
452182529335378270,The location is great  Bed very comfortable  Nice spot and clean  Had some issues with my arrival  it seems that they gave someone else same instructions apt  They finally offered me a different one with same conditions and everything was good except for the shower that was dripping all day long  I was really upset with the inconvenience on my arrival  and also with the issues I had to deal during my stay    After all  I appreciate you guys solved the issues 
420293560960818490,We loved the place  the staff was incredibly nice  told us places to eat and things we should go do  The only thing is parking is absolutely terrible  just be prepared to add about a    minute walk to get to the building  Parking is very scarce and usually involved street parking where cars block everyone in  Overall the location was only about    minutes from everything and made it very easy to get the day started  We loved our stay but it was absolutely terrible trying the find parking near the place  Each night it took an extra half hour to find parking and even then we usually had to walk about    minutes to get to the building  Which is unfortunate because we will not be wanting to stay in this place again
449985344097438012,We arrived late  It was quite frustrating to have to follow a bunch of complicated Steps to get upstairs before you could even Park the car   The room itself was mostly clean  but the building was gross  Ever time we had to use the elevator  there was a different form of either vomit or urine    Probably won t choose this again 
447036610146286633,The apartment was okay  pool was closed  has been closed for a longer time   There was lot of construction work going on and therefore noisy  Also the fire alarm went off three times on one day  because of all the construction  A lot of the pans were dirty  There was no dinning table  only a small desk with a single chair  For a fair bit of money you do not get all that much value 
401456948073724638,The place is nice   the area was great  but whoever does the clean doesn t properly keep the place up  There was hair in the shower  old urine stains that even I couldn t remove with clean product   The place didn t look properly swept or mopped   Also  upon checkin communication was horrible and the entry code didn t work  Zencity replied with another code that didn t work as well  Once I let them know the issue I never got a reply back until after I was already in the building  I waiting until someone finally walked out and then entered the building   Zencity did offer an extra hour before check out which was appreciated   but I didn t like standing outside with a little one and pregnant late at night  Communication and cleanliness needs to be better   The place needs to be deep clean    the rugs also need to be switched out  The place is nice  but not properly kept up  Whoever is doing the clean isn t doing a good job  Also  Communication should be better for your guest upon checkin  Thanks a lot 
465173083594982397,Quite dirty and rather bare bones overall  Probably would not stay here again  For example  there was hair in the tub when I arrived and the shower only gets lukewarm 
570305909924971135,its worth the money hard to find a place to park hard carrying stuff upstairs it was clean
416598284158932783,I travel frequently for work and personal reasons  and nearly always stay in AirBNB s  Often  I will not stay in multi unit properties such as this for various reasons which I will outline   Zen city is unable to control the experience  whatever is happening inside of the unit they can handle  outside of the unit is a different story    This complex is full of young kids smoking weed in the hallways  playing music loudly on the roof and disrupting sleep    Zen city did nothing to correct this and in fact only said  we are sorry     I could go off about this place   but  it served its purpose 
416571804255379199,Please make sure the internet works after you check in The internet did not work which was a big deal breaker  I tried to email the company a few times and didnt get a reply it was very frustrating 
447106087974283936,DONT BOOK HERE  They made me feel totally unsafe by cha going the locks in the middle of my reservation and not communicating with me  I came back from the store to a new lock on the door and they never told me they were going to change it and all they offered was an apology  They literally changed the locks in the middle of my reservation  Totally unprofessional
426797369048113249,DO NOT BOOK  For starters  there were NO TOWELS in the entire unit  The closest thing was a single  un absorbent dish towel in the kitchen and a roll of paper towels  Naturally  I messaged Zencity  a company that  hosts  this listing and many others  about this problem  very matter of factly and simply requesting they provide towels  I received no response  The only other message I got after the initial check in was a stock message stating they hope I enjoyed my stay and to leave a positive review  Laughable    To name a few other problems the unit itself smelled bad when we walked in  I sensed mustiness cigarettes and my husband sensed the smell of a dead animal  Take your pick  The rug in the living area was filthy and had visible debris on it  The bathroom sink was chipped  the shower liner had a disgusting brown film  and there was what I can only imagine were dirty linens left in the bedroom hamper  There were half used individual sized bottles of shampoo and body wash left in the shower  It was appalling and by far the worst Airbnb experience we have ever had   Despite the good location by the park  the listing  and presumably any listing hosted by Zencity  is NOT WORTH IT  It is completely unacceptable that there were no towels in the apartment and I did not receive a response from anyone about my inquiry  I will be spreading the word that Zencity is unreliable and awful 
418158986427520885,Upon booking for the Airbnb we reached out to the host from Zencity And we asked was a unit available and was the issue with the door fixed per the reviews we were reading  They replied back yes everything should be good if we wanted to move forward and book  We booked and got ready to head to the space  Wednesday the   th the first night was great no issues no problems we were able to get into the apartment with no issues  Thursday the   th my brother was laying on the couch in the front and looked over to someone trying to get into the apartment  Luckily we have a chain on the door and the guy looked over and saw him on the couch and said he was sorry he didn t realize the unit was being rented out for the weekend  I told him we were only here till that Saturday  He said OK he introduced himself as a realtor and he was actually doing a apartment tour on that specific unit  He had people outside the door to show the unit and ask would it still be OK if he showed the unit  My brother then told him I was still sleeping so Right then wouldn t be the best time  He said thank you and he left  The Host Was notified and they tried to say it was not a realtor when in fact it definitely was  The next day we were greeted by the maintenance people early in the morning they were surprised when my brother opened the door and saw we were there  We informed them that we would be here until that Saturday  They said ok and went upstairs to a different unit  Not anytime was a  Leak  mentioned  A couple hours later another duo of maintenance guys came through and My brother answered the door again and they were shocked as well to see us there I take it the message wasn t passed along that we were there renting till that Saturday  So my brother explained the same thing to those maintenance guys they said cool and they went upstairs to another unit  During this time around when The first set of maintenance guys came through  the host sent an offer and asked if I would be willing to check out a day early and take     refund because there was a  leak  in the building  me and my brother respectfully declined and said we were comfortable in the space that we were in  At no time did the host say this is an urgent emergency and at no time did the maintenance crew that we saw and greeted at the door state that it was a leak in the unit  nor ask could they enter the unit to check and see if it was coming from The unit we were staying in  We replied to every message in a timely manner in which it was sent to us  Around   o clock the maintenance crew showed back up to the unit and when My brother opened up the door The one maintenance man said they were told we were leaving at three and in no way did we ever say that to anyone  The maintenance guy said no problem I m not going to harass you all when you all have proof that you all are allowed to be here  During the time we contacted Airbnb and they stated no one Has been in communication with them to cancel the Airbnb so do not worry about it  During that call I started to receive messages from the host with a bunch of slanderous lies and disrespect  The person messaging at the time  Gary  was extremely rude  disrespectful And sent very threatening via messages as well as phone calls  Gary attempted to lie and say we never opened the door for maintenance  he lied and said we were rude to maintenance and we were smoking weed in the unit  All of thee above were lies but Gary continued to spread the lies via Airbnb messenger  My brother went outside after Gary continued to lie and spoke to the maintenance and both men Kevin and Raul stated we were never rude or disrespectful to them and they didn t know where that lie came from  They also stated we definitely Opened the door for them and no weed was ever smelled  Gary proceeded to threaten us by calling the police from   PM to almost      PM in which we were not worried by any means because we did nothing wrong  Turns out there was never a leak in the building we spoke to other residents in passing  The host never canceled the Airbnb until almost   PM that day AFTER I already contacted Airbnb to have the reservation canceled myself  But they were lying While we were on the phone with Airbnb saying they spoke with them and had already canceled our reservation and we knew it was a lie  All of this could have been avoided if Gary had not lied and been disrespectful  We found out someone rented out the unit and they were not supposed to rent it out on airbnb  they were trying to get the unit make ready for actual residents to move in  So  instead of the host just saying that him being open and honest he tried to lie and then lied more and thought threatening us was going to make him get what he wanted  I do not recommend this unit or any unit this company puts up if this is how they run their business  On top of everything else Gary was standing outside the whole time texting and being disrespectful as if we didn t know who he was with bright red hair  Not once did he come in introduces self or even be brave enough to face us  he of course like most cowards hid behind texting 
407885842361714627,An ok place to stay 
453632418108471913,Lots of small issues with the cleanliness of the space accumulated to a less than ideal stay  I had to call another clean company to clean and the host wasnt responsive  Disappointed  While the cleanliness issues I had were small  the sum of their parts were disappointing  This was exasperated by the lack of responsiveness from the customer service team 
421701686597636252,I will start by saying that because of the price and prior review  we anticipated there would be some kind of issues with the condo  We were right  But while I have complaints about the condition of the place  the price is commiserate  Except the clean fee  that should be refunded    I ll start with the pros  The condo was ideal for my husband and I and another couple  We each had queen beds and separate  full bathrooms  The location is in the business district  and we were able to walk to get coffee  Schnucks grocery store  restaurants  and even a boozy milkshake at the restaurant attached to the building  But that s about where the pros end    For the cons the place just felt dirty and the decor   I use that term liberally  was sparse  Think the hotel rooms from Schitts Creek   It was a good thing the Schnucks was nearby because we immediately needed to purchase clean supplies  Clorox wipes for the win     The walls are full of holes from prior occupants and discolored from who knows what   Ew  The floors  all of them  were covered in crumbs and some type of sticky substance  bring flip flops    We used one of the extra sheets to cover the couch because Clorox wipes are not made for fabric  There is lint literally seeping out of the electrical outlets in the en suite bathroom    Speaking of the bathrooms  there is a reason no bathroom photos are posted   The shower in the en suite bath is tiny and both shower heads needed to be replaced years ago they basically spit water on you  Again bring the flippies   The towels also had a mildew tinge to them which makes sense given the overall lack of cleanliness  I just held my breath when I used them    I think another reviewer mentioned the a c  I can confirm it is not back to       We all sweated during the night and outside was in the low   s when we were there   It wasn t intolerable  but it definitely wasn t replaced or fully fixed    In summary  the bare furnishings and overall lack of style are commiserate with the price  I ll even give on the a c because it wasn t totally broken   But the lack of clean is  inexcusable  particularly in today s Covid environment  You should really consider patching the holes  a fresh coat   look into a new clean service
444874346943327126,Unfortunately  the cleanliness of the apartment was a huge disappointment  There was a dead bird on the balcony and cigarette buds all over  The rug and surfaces looked like they hadnt been clean in a while  It was gross 
409416831130855962,Wifi didn t work and loads of other things were inaccurate on listing  Agency that handles unit was unprofessional that when we needed help  Also big safety issue  front door to building did not lock half the time   Don t stay here   I have reported all issues in a formal complaint 
429639436913043307,I would never stay here again  Unit was not in good condition  Shower was unsafe as no handle to hold onto  No deadbolt lock for door so anybody could have copied the keys and entered while I was there or out  Location was excellent but the condition of the unit was poor  Size of the unit was good  Unit two flights of stairs up  The unit is in terrible condition  You should remodel the unit  Location is good  The shower is a serious safety issue as no handle for safety  There is another safety and security issue which is huge  the keys could be easily copied and past customers could have entered when I was sleeping to harm me  or rob me  No dead bolt lock once inside  I feel like you took advantage of me as the condition of the unit was terrible  I would never stay at a zen city unit again 
417341857847754239,I would probably stay here again  but    As the previous reviews stated check in was not smooth  Another resident allowed me entrance and to use the elevator  The door code did work   Parking was difficult and has to be paid for during the day M F  This is included in the listing  but the only open lot I found was   blocks away  Also  the pictures of the skyline were definitely not from this unit as all you can see are neighboring buildings  And I don t think they met the Airbnb standard of clean this visit perhaps an isolated incident   THE GOOD  the place is in good repair and the bed is comfortable  It s actually a cute little unit  The building is quiet during the day  I work nights so that s important to me   Once checked in entrance is easy peasy  just keep your door code handy  I didn t get to use the amenities during my stay  but they offer quite a few  There was hair in the shower and food on the potholder  Yuck   I paid for two extra days because I work nights and when I went to check in was unable to enter the building as your check in process is not functional  When I messaged about my issue the reply was not timely  which I needed it to be so that I could go to bed for work that night  and impersonal as your representative did not seem to understand that my check in date was actually the day before   This was rather upsetting 
449962262724379052,I arrived around     pm on Thursday only to find that the floors were still filthy  there were clumps of hair and dried blood in the shower and   of the pillow cases had a blood stain and dirt on them  I reached out immediately to Zencity and stated that since it was so late Id stay the night but wouldnt be spending the rest of the trip there and that they needed to refund my money  I used my shirt as a pillow case  I woke up to an an email stating that they were sorry for the inconvenience  I had to reach out numerous times to get a real response instead of a canned one  They still hadnt come uo with any kind of solution by  pm Friday  After    hours they still couldnt come up with a way to make things right  It became very frustrating because the only form of communication with them was email  My guest and i ended up having to clean out the disgusting shower just to be able to use it so we could continue our vacation   There were some emails back and forth and all they could tell me was that my refund request had been sent to manager  Tomorrow will be   week since i sent the inital email and i have yet to hear back from a manager or anyone from Zencity  I wont ever be staying with them again and i think Ill stick with hotels from now on  At least at a hotel there is someone on shift to communicate with  Provide a contact number and not just an email   Dont email canned responses 
403592879111663123,The Checkin process was not had described on the procedures received  I would suggest you arrive during office hours so the leasing agent can help you get in  I was told there would be a key fob in the room once we arrived but I had to reach out to Zencity since one could not be found  Zencity was very responsive to this problem and handled it within an hour  Additionally once we arrived there was used  dirty towels in the bathroom separate from the clean towels provided  Luckily there was a CVS near by that we stop to get clean supplies since I felt like the Airbnb was not clean after see the towels 
569595726551460120,I would be worried to rent from them their impossible to deal with over the phone they are also very quick to assess fines for matters with her for an excess of any damage they also have piss poor security and allow people in your room that you don t want Allowed unwanted guests to answer the apartment and cause damage and then try pin me for those damages when I price them of the person and if they were not supposed to be on the premises   Company days is an unlawful merchandising business practices and is due for a good lawsuit
568861528178811406,A really cool loft in an old  restored factory building  Convenient location to everything we wanted to do    The issue is Zencity  The unit was overall very unclean  floors  dishes  counters   We also didn t have any towels in the unit and it took Zencity over    hours to resolve this 
420993082504940697,Was notified a couple of hours before check in that my stay was canceled due to a lost key fob  When asked about my refund they said I had to cancel the reservation myself  So   Iwent to the cancellation page and clicked the tab for host needs to cancel   which a request is sent to the host   I noticed a day later that the request hadnt been taken care of so I messaged them and they said they never got a cancellation   I them what process I used and they said they couldnt cancel I had to    there was no option that wouldnt have taken all of mypayment so I told them I sent another request and they still refused   Air bnb had to be contacted to settle the matter unfortunately with this whole process wasting multiple hours of my time that I should have been operating my business   Shady Practices
419487659501712116,There were some discrepancies in listing and our stay  The apartment smelled like smoke even though it is listed as no smoking  There was no shampoo  conditioner  or body wash in apartment after listing states otherwise   Also some surfaces were sticky  and dirty rags stuffed into corners and furniture  Some other inconveniences were difficult parking  loud neighbors traffic construction  broken elevator  and very poor shower pressure  Check in out was easy and location was close to everything we liked to do  Thanks for letting us stay  there were a few discrepancies between listing and actual stay 
400008042427436241,The location is great and the owners are prompt in their communication  however  the rest of this listing was not as advertised  The owners are not accommodating to any minor check in requests and the furniture and fixtures are broken and dirty  The owners need to invest in this property significantly to bring it back to the standard of when these photos were taken  This listing was not as advertised  The furniture and fixtures are broken and dirty  For example  the bed in the back bedroom broke   times  just by sitting on the edge  The coffee table was old and wobbly  the couch was dirty  the bedframe in the back bedroom was stained  Every single light flickered to a point where the lights were unusable  I am extremely dissatisfied with this listing 
425283166743807479,Great location  Quiet neighbors   If adjust days from request  include Day and date  Fee is too high for amenities  Provide shampoo and conditioner at minimum  Customer service was slow to respond and not helpful  Adequate and good location  Great location  Quiet neighbors   If adjust days from request  include Day and date  Fee is too high for amenities  Provide shampoo and conditioner at minimum  Customer service was slow to respond and not helpful  Adequate and good location 
404330857769987543,This place was a nice quick place to stay and it was in a nice area  but the communication was absolutely TRASH  We couldn t get into the building when we were staying for an hour  they don t communicate back  and there was no key or key fob to enter the build or to use the elevator  The customer service line tries to belittle you when your seeking help due to them not having everything together   They knew they had extra key cards in the P O  Box yet tried to make me wait to the next day for a key to enter the building  The stay space is pretty nice other the a few poorly constructed parts but i find myself wondering was the  cheap convenience stay worth all of the inconvenience   
414404200305484043,Please listen to the other reviews and run from this place at all cost  They don t even know which property they have you in at a given time and a fire was almost started while visiting their location due to their own negligence  This place is dangerous and Airbnb just a not concerned with them using their platform to trap people into booking with them  Please run  Please listen to the other reviews and run from this place at all cost  They don t even know which property they have you in at a given time and a fire was almost started while visiting their location due to their own negligence  This place is dangerous and Airbnb just a not concerned with them using their platform to trap people into booking with them  Please run 
465884039682633326,The check in process was not good  We never received codes for the two doors and had to be on hold with air bnb for    minutes before we got assistance getting into the building and our unit  The left side window was left open and could not close so we had to shove a blanket in the gap to keep the cool air in  Also only   of the   bathroom lights worked which left us showering and getting ready in a pretty dark bathroom  The whole building smells like marijuana  The unit was overall nice  It had a comfortable bed   dishes and cookware  Roku  the proximity to attractions and the grocery store was great  The unit itself was fine  The check in process was not good  We never received codes for the two doors and had to be on hold with air bnb for    minutes before we got assistance   The left side window was left open and could not close so we had to shove blanket in the gap to keep the cool air in  Also only   of the   bathroom lights worked which left us showering and getting ready in a pretty dark bathroom  The whole building smells like marijuana  The space itself was nice  comfortable bed the location to attractions and the grocery store was great 
425356137533397923,The location on the check in wasnt very accurate  The doors that we should have entered should have been better marked  When we booked the hotel  we read a lot of the reasons comments about being able to get in  They were mostly true  The first time we couldnt get in unless someone let us in and swiped their badge in the elevator  Once we got to our room  it was easy to get in and then we had the key fob to use for the remainder of the trip   location was great  The pool and workout room was closed because it was under renovation  which not conveyed to us before booking the hotel doll we were very disappointed about that  We could have stayed on other locations that would have been a bit cheaper that didnt have one  Otherwise it was clean and nice  Fix your initial check in process  Fix your listing to say that gym and pool are not available due to renovations 
409413247369622278,My girlfriend and I recently went on a trip to KC and decided to try an Air B B  This is something that her and I have done before and have always had positive experiences with  After looking at a few different places  we landed on this posting and decided to book it since it was close to some bars and not far from the venue  The pictures looked amazing of the place and even though there was a review of it smelling like cigarette smoke  we still decided to give it a shot  Let me just say  the pictures were taken at the right angle with the right lighting because it looks NOTHING that in person    As soon as you open the door to the building  you are blasted with a strong odor of cigarette smoke  Once in the apartment  the smell is not as strong  but almost everything is filthy  The floors are stained and look like haven t been clean  The couch is completely stained  and she would not sit on it  There is a very small hallway that leads to the bedroom and doors on both sides  However  both doors are off their hinges and just hanging there  There is also burn marks on the wall next to the stove  I wish I could say that this was the only thing wrong with this listing  but nothing compared to what we found    While looking throughout the apartment  she came across a used needle sitting on top of the trashcan in the bathroom  My girlfriend and I decided to leave the place immediately as we now felt unsafe there  but not before she also found a dead cockroach in the air vent  We ended up finding a nearby hotel and calling the people who run the listing  At first  they promised as a full refund over the phone and that the place was unacceptable  however  the next day they messaged us and asked if they could send a clean company over as recompense  We told them that after only spending about    minutes there and finding everything we did   that there was no way we would stay and had already booked a hotel  They then proceeded to tell us that since we denied the clean company  they would not be able to give us a refund  Thankfully Airbnb customer service was able to help us and we eventually got the refund   My best advice I could give you is to stay clear of this listing  Spend the extra cash on a hotel so you do not have to deal with what we did 
428900532860475106,Check in was not fun  The fob did not work  but they did get us a new one  The parking place was small  our vehicle stuck out  but we were thankful it didn t get hit  The room was smaller than expected compared to the photos  There were no small appliances except a coffee pot  The freezer had an ice maker  however it did not work  The location was great  but we weren t very happy with the apartment  The headboard was lopsided due to the fact one side was not connected to the wall  It really needs more appliances  like a toaster  blender  mixer etc 
445561849991538562,Not bad  looks better in pictures 
401403694185843052,Customer service with Zencity was terrible  The listing is the opposite of what the apartment actually is  This apartment is not equipped for long term stays  The kitchen was not a full kitchen  It had a limited amount of cutlery  barely any cooking pots  the dishwasher didnt work  and the bed was immensely uncomfortable   enough to give us back pain for the remainder of our stay  When we first walked in  it smelled like gas in the apartment  The HDMI cable didnt work and kept glitching and popping  When we tried to watch TV shows in the living room  we couldnt sit on the couch for any time because it was so uncomfortable and very disgusting   along with the carpets   Overall   the price does not make it worth the stay here  Hello   a couple of points that we think you can improve on   We felt like you werent very flexible or communicative with us  Initially when we wanted to cancel due to flight issues related to COVID  and there was no flexibility  Later on  we reached out about issues the lock code and never received a response  but luckily that issue was resolved quickly  Lastly  we reached out about forgetting something in the apartment  and we received no word back  even after we suggested going back and grabbing it ourselves   You had listed that it was a full kitchen  comfortable bed  equipped for long term stay  The kitchen was not a full kitchen  It had a limited amount of cutlery  barely any cooking pots  the dishwasher didnt work  and the bed was immensely uncomfortable   enough to give us back pain for the remainder of our stay  When we first walked in  it smelled like gas in the apartment which got us nervous the first few days  The HDMI cable didnt work and kept glitching and popping  When we tried to watch TV shows in the living room  we couldnt sit on the couch for any time because it was so uncomfortable and very disgusting   along with the carpets   We dont think that this airbnb was valued at the     K we paid  We will be reaching out for a refund of some sorts because of how deceptive the listing was 
450630025494810931,  Apartment is fine   Area feels unsafe at night   Not very smooth checkin process   Strong weed smell in building   Lift was filthy like a bathroom   Parking space was far from the building and kinda unsafe   host was responsive though
566654120870059214,It was okay just not really what you would expect to get out of a place to stay  It was not very clean when we got there and they messed up our check in so we had to wait an hour after we were supposed to be able to check in before we could even get in the room  Overall it wasn t the worst place I ve ever stayed but I wouldn t recommend it unless it s like your last option  It wasn t super clean  the bathroom and kitchen were pretty gross when we got there and the blinds are basically all broken 
430339618703945715,Zencity agents were very pleasant and quick to respond to questions before and issues we encountered with appliances after check in  Unit is spacious in side  A great location on a quiet street with on side free parking   Unfortunately  I feel we were victims of false advertising regarding the rooftop deck photos which were an enticement for our booking  What we encountered were an unusable deck with  A peeling deck surface with some rotted boards  A couch with filthy  moldy cushions  No umbrella as in the photo  Dirty plastic chairs  A round orange storage table in the photo that was faded to a salmon shade and filthy inside  Obviously no maintenance had been done in years   The kitchen supplies were sub minimal  The listing is for six people and we had   coffee    forks  spoons  knives and plates  Plus steak knives   We only had four guests so we did not need to share mugs  Whether home or away most people will use more than one utensil or plate on many days   We did move the cushions on the sleeper couch and it Wes full of crumbs and debris  Obviously  not used or vacuumed in some time   Unless these issues are addressed I would not recommend spending the money   Kate Zencity agents were pleasant and quick to respond to my questions and the issues we had with the refrigerator and dishwasher  Unit location was great with plenty of interior space  quiet street with free parking   Unfortunately  we were victims of false advertising regarding the rooftop deck  The lovely photos on the listing of the deck are years old and were an enticement for the booking  What we encountered was an unusable deck with  A peeling deck surface with some rotted sections  A couch with dirty  moldy cushions  No  umbrella as in the photo  Dirty chairs  A storage table originally orange but faded to salmon shade and filthy inside  Obviously no maintenance has been done for years   Additionally  the kitchen supplies were lower than basic  Listing is for   guests and we only had   coffee mugs  six forks  spoons and plates total  Fortunately  we only had   guests so did not need to share mugs  In normal everyday living  whether home or away  most people will use more than one utensil or plate a day   Finally  when we moved the cushions on the sleeper couch to be used if there were   guests they had obviously not been moved or vacuumed under in a long time   Kate Grask
404357670517825263,When we arrived at  pm  the temperature in the apartment was    degrees Fahrenheit  only   of the windows had screens  and Chicago in the summer has tons of flies   mosquitoes  so we couldnt do anything but turn on the AC and wait  at   pm  it was still     we eventually had to restart the furnace to kickstart it     An hour after we arrived  a maintenance person arrived to fix the dishwasher without warning   at  pm  FWIW  the dishwasher mostly did work for us as long as we ran it on normal  not express  but the lower rack was missing some wheels   The back yard shown in the photos as a nice place to hang out was filled with weeds and construction debris and completely impassable  The back stairs hadnt been swept in months or maybe years  there was serious grime on the side of the bathroom sink  cracks and peeling plaster in the walls and ceiling of the bathroom and living room  a tile in the bathroom was held in place with electrical tape  the floor was too dirty to walk barefoot  and when I lifted a couch cushion to retrieve a pen I had dropped  it was clear that it had been a looong time since that was vacuumed   And oh yeah   there was no back to the building  just tyvek paper waiting to have siding replaced   Sheets were thin   dingy polyester and pillows mattress were not even ikea quality   We tried multiple times to contact both Zencity and Airbnb support  The hosts were quick to reply before our stay  but rarely replied before     hours while we were there  even in the middle of the day    I have stayed in Airbnbs around the world and never had an experience like this  On the plus side  the location really is great   close to the      transit and restaurants  We tried several times to report issues during our stay and got only late responses and zero resolution  You need to do some serious work on this apartment before renting it 
427448282730772396,Poor communication  no central air conditioning and there are roaches  Great location near the water  Great restaurant nearby  Close to a lot of things  Overall won t be staying at this particular place again but loved the area  Very poor communication  not a great way to end the trip 
419539829548910530,Its okay     stars   Its a place to sleep  thats about it   Couple of things to be aware of    No Access to Rooftop social area  This was an issue because the apartment itself offers limited seating   a couch that barely fits      bar stools  and a small   seat table   Also  the view isnt of Chicago   just a back alley    Could be cleaner  Expect to wear shoes or slippers while inside   The floor was filthy   expect to wash your feet if you walk around barefoot  Showers need scrubbed  you can tell its been awhile   Like I said  its a place to sleep   although a bit pricey   Wouldnt rent again for the price   Check in and check out were simple  Great place for a short weekend getaway   Couple of things of note     The apartment is listed as sleeping as     it clearly only sleeps     The two bedrooms are fine      however the couch is not sleepable and shouldnt be listed as so    Please dont show the rooftop in pics if its not accessible  that was one of the reasons we chose this location  The apartment has limited seating for lounging and socializing  the couch barely fits   grown men  and we were looking forward to hanging out on the rooftop    Apartment needs a deep clean  The floor is filthy   you couldnt walk around barefoot without your feet turning black from dirt  Also  the showers need a good scrubbing   you can see how dirty the grout it    Blinds need fixed  The cent blind in the living area is severely broken   Blinds in the bedrooms are twisted and dont function properly    Ice maker on fridge is broken
427452189132891098,My girlfriend and I arrived at the air bnb around   pm and saw a man carrying a weapon directly outside of the building  After he left we tried to get inside which was very confusing and took us roughly    minutes  We weren t aware that the parking was located off site and was a good      minute drive away from the apartment lined with bars and groups of men  We decided after driving to the parking garage that the safest decision for us  as two woman alone at night  would be to park in front of the building and move it in the morning because of the parking meters  When we got inside it wasn t messy but it wasn t clean  It smelled like weed  there were stains on the couch and bed bugs  We contacted the hostess immediately  who was very professional every time we communicated  and informed them that we would not be staying the two nights that we had previously reserved  They did an inspection on the room and claimed there were no bed bugs despite the bites we had both received  We made it clear that we had already booked a hotel and would not be returning  They refused to give us a refund but told us we were safe to stay there  Essentially we paid      to walk into a building where we felt incredibly unsafe the entire time  use the bathroom once and leave with bed bug bites 
415222011467830587,The location is good and the apt is livable   For two older adults with bad backs the bed was not comfortable  but a younger person might be fine with it  location is great  place was ok  if a bit tired  Bed was not very comfortable  but we were happy that the air conditioning was good  needs a new shower curtain and a thorough clean
446286455166828586,First and foremost  this place is not a luxury studio  You are paying for location only  Check in was super easy  the door staff helped and were super nice    It sucks to complain about something on public reviews  as i worked in the service industry for over a decade and know sometimes they are not true  However  I can t say anything positive about this place  and many issues were stated in previous visits by others  As was said in some other reviews  the place was dirty  The floors were gross  there was dirt hair dust everywhere  The bed frame was either loose or broken  so every move you made was super loud  There are two bedside lamps connected to one switch  and only one of them worked    Additionally  as said in some other reviews  the internet did not work  There was no WiFi connection available or searchable  and the tv also did not work  I tried to reset the router  and I changed the remote batteries but still did not work  After contacting the host about these issues on Friday  I got no response again and no one showed up to address them  With nothing to do while in the place  almost no service  could not use laptop too   I ended up not staying one night and left a night early  I finally got a response from the host about issues when I notified them I had left and checked out a day early  I offered to send videos of issues in addition to the pictures I sent the resolution center as well   This place is in a great location  you can walk just about everywhere downtown  but that s about all the good things I can say about it  For the price of Air BnB s now and the cost of       for a five day stay  it was one of the worst values I could think of  I have asked for a refund  but you definitely find better stays or equal value or with better hosts around the city  Stay away  there are better places and hotels in the area  This place isn t a luxury studio  It was dirty  the floors were disgusting  One of the two bedside lamps worked  the bed frame was either broken or loose as it was super loud  The internet and Tv remote didn t work  so I literally had nothing to do while in the air bnb  I couldn t use my laptop  and barely had phone service  I didn t stay one of my nights and left a night early  After contacting you about the issues with the place on Friday  no one answered until the day I left when I told you I was leaving  For the price of Air BnB s now           Really   and especially this one  this was an absurdly poor stay  I could have stayed at the hotel around the corner instead and had no issues  The location is great yes  but you cannot call this a luxury studio at all  I won t ever use Zen City again  and I asked for a partial refund through the resolution center  but am going to ask for a full one due to lack of communication from a host about issues and I didn t even stay the whole time  As I sent in a message before  I have videos of said issues too  couldn t upload them in the resolution center  
431792757119163463,It was OK  Nothing special it s an old building remodeled  The place Wasn t clean well  I had some issues in my stay with the noise sensor  I kept getting text messages saying that I was to loud when I didn t even have the TV or the radio on  We were just talking  Location is Good because you re  on the Gold Coast and a lot of things nearby  I had an OK stay  Just upset that kept getting those messages about a noise complaint when there was no music and no TV  We were just talking  Hopefully you guys can fix that because it s unpleasant 
470249460456670904,The property location is good and unit is cute overall  as long as it s clean and maintained   The unit wasn t ready on time  but the company did notify us that they d need additional time to clean  Even when we got in  we found some things that weren t clean  The Zencity employee did what he could to help address things we saw  We later found that the fan light in bedroom was missing a battery so we couldn t use the fan without the light  Also  the AC was set such that it turned off in the middle of the night  There s a setting to fix so we were able to do so for our last night  Lastly  the pool and workout facility were closed which wasn t known until we checked in  Hi  I understand that you had a group prior to us that stayed for a long time and left a mess  I d recommend planning a longer time to do a thorough clean after a party like that including checking to see that everything works as appropriate  Also  the fan light in bedroom needed a battery  You may also include in the property description if the pool and or workout facility are closed 
471708111414102288,I got there  they don t have on site parking which is stated  so parking was interesting  The guard wasn t very helpful on getting upstairs  It isn t clearly stated how to get upstairs  there s multiple elevators but only   for the lofts  which I only found out by a nice bystander  I get upstairs only to be greeted by feces in the toilet  and hair all over the apartment  In the sinks  the counters  on the floor s   and of course when I had to check the beds  it was there  I contacted  Zencity  and they responded quite quickly saying they d send a clean crew  So I left for dinner in hopes by the time I walked back it would be solved  However  this was not the case and when I attempted to contact them  they were not as responsive  No clean crew arrived so I was left to wash the sheets myself after driving     hours  Took me til     pm to finally sleep  They charge     for clean fee and when I asked for a refund they initially declined and then resulted in giving me     wish has not yet been given back    weeks later  Nice location but disgusting attempt to sell an apartment  Highly do not recommend  Maybe under new management  Zencity is terrible 
531221790034969989,Zencity   was the absolute worst experience ever  I have so many complaints where do I begin  My initial   p m  check in  didnt happen until after   p m  due to the fact that I never received instructions as they indicated after two attemptsof contacting  Zencity   they sent the information at      p m  I was charged almost       when found out later that the price was     per night  Guests arent allowed to control the heat  and that weekend iKC was inclement weather   so it was freezing   Excessive dog barking throughout the night  dog feces in the hallway all weekend   the elevator had trash in it  the downstairs foyer was filfthy with cigarette butts and leaves lying around   All which I have photos and shared with Zencity and AirBnB  The mist disturbing   was when we tried to lay down and found hairs in the bed  and decided to change linen  When changing the linen  we noticedmultiple stains on pillows andmattress cover   The mattress was in fact flipped upside down   to hide the portion that was the most soiled  I immediately contacted Zencity support   with my concern and he instructed me to send photos   I  sent photos of the pillows   mattress cover   hairs in the shower  the wall  damaged blinds and nose matter that was on the shower curtain   He offered to send someone up in the a m  to clean  but it was already after   a m  and we were beyond tired  Seeing my frustration   he offered to move us after a hour of going back and forth and also stayed how he would request a full refund  The unit he moved us too  was cleaner  but freezing as we can not control the heat  I have complained to Zencity and AirBnB   multiple times and sent over a dozen photos   multiple times  Even though I was subject to a dirty unit  I still clean and took photos   so they are dated and times stamped  so no one can ever say that I was a poor guest   I have requested a refund  in which the offer was     off next stay  I will never stay in Zencity properties again  So declining that offer they told me a     refundis all they can do for     dollars After all the BS we were subjected to  that was the ultimate disrespect   Zencity   was a horrible host  that only cares about their accounts and not the guests       I  suggest anything other than Zencity Out of all my years of traveling   this was by far the worst experience ever  My initial reservation was booked for another unit  but the dates conflicted  so I requested to cancel  Zencity   mentioned that I would be penalized     for a cancelation so I did request for another unit  that could accommodate those dates  The new unit was more expensive  yet smaller  but once again I would be charged a     cancelation fee  so I had no choice but to accept   The day of checkin was scheduled for          at   p m  in which upon check in  I would receive instructions   I didnt receive those instructions until almost   p m  and that was after two attempts of contacting Zencity staff   The late check in was the first issue  Secondly   after arriving back to the unit after our New Years Eve plans  we were prepared to lay down for the night  but when the sheets were turned down  we saw multiple hairs in the bed  Seeing that therewas spare linen in the closet   we attempted to change the sheets in which the pillows and mattress cover was heavily stained  In fact the top of the mattress was flipped upside down  because of how soiled the cover was  I instantly called Zencity support in which he asked to send photos  I not only sent photos of the soil mattress cover and pillows but the extremely long hairs in the shower  and on the wall  The most disturbing photo was the snot that someone blew on the shower curtain   I made my complaint and frustration known to the support and told him that this was totally unacceptable  He did mention that he received the photos and how apologetic that he was  He did mention that he could send a member to clean the unit in the morning   but it was already after   a m   and we wanted to turn in for the night  so he offered to switch us units  due to the fact that it was so late  I only accepted because I already had so much invested into this unit  and being New Years weekend hotels were almost obsolete   After changing units we didnt lay down until almost   a m  Third complaint came from me searching for the Zencity customer support   I noticed that the unit we were staying in  was advertised at     per night  when I was charged almost          for a weekend and was told that the unit was more expensive that the original      per night unit  I had booked  So that was a whole other issue  The list of complaints can go on and on  Guests arent allowed to adjust heat  and need a access code  to use  The entire building was filfhty  from trash in the elevator all weekend   dog feces in the hallway  excessive dog barking all times of day  the downstairs foyer was dirty  cigarette butts  lying and around   and the place was just nasty  I took photos of everything that I mentioned and sent to the support team  making complaints and asking for some compensation   for such a horrible stay  They had the nerve to offer me     discount on a future stay  I will never stay or recommend Zencity to anyone   by the way I stayed in the KC location on Main Street  I did request the help of AirBnB  and displayed all photos of everything mentioned   So I am still waiting on a resolution   Final response fro  Zencity was a offer for      which is around     of what I paid for the entire weekend        I had the worst experience through Zencity and I recommend everyone to consider all other possible options  before booking with Zencity  to avoid the disrespect that I received 
571803248732316080,The location was great  The price was good for the area  But the bed was hard and uncomfortable and the bed frame squeaked loudly with any movement   The unit is sparsley decorated but clean  The location was great  The price was good for the area  But the bed was horrible   It was a plastic matress that was hard and uncomfortable   The bed frame squeaked with any movement and kept us up all night   We contacted Zen asking for them to fix the bed   but didnt hear back until  am while we were asleep  By the time we got their reply in the morning saying that someone could come by we were already checking out  The toilet didnt fully flush and the shower fluctuated between hot and cold  The sparse decorations made it feel cold and uninviting   Would you consider refunding us for one nights stay

485488215027582976,Zencity support is almost exclusively text based   The front line staff are responsive  but cross your fingers no trouble happens  We were sent the wrong  unit entry code for our arrival at  am  and theres no phone number to call to get instructions on how to handle this   No text response in the middle of the night  had to google a number   Fortunately  someone answered and was able to reprogram the door code remotely to let us in   The wifi didnt work  but they were able to give us hotspot substitutes   Laundry wastewater from another unit in the building backed up into our kitchen sink  we reported it  and the next day they asked us to make the unit available to plumbers during our prime stay day  One of the beds had linens that reeked of human sweat  Fortunately there are plenty of clean sheets available  so we changed the sheets and put the smelly ones in the hamper for housekeeping  They offered late check out as a kind of apology  then retracted the offer on check out day   Otherwise  it is as described  Good location   Zencity staff on phone and text are pretty capable   as far as they are allowed to be   and kind  but the set up is frustrating when things go wrong   Hope you all have a better experience than we did  Im actually shocked that Zencity had another guest check in after us without the time to fix the wastewater back up plumbing problem   This is a health issue   Some OTHER apartments laundry soap wastewater backed up into the units kitchen sink twice in the first days we were there  Loud gurgling noises  then     inches of laundry soap bubbles  We declined to have maintenance come while we were there   we had paid for our time in the unit  and were avoiding the kitchen sink   but the next guests would be unaware of this  health  issue   The wrong entry code for our  am arrival  the non working wifi  and the sweat smelly sheets are a bundle of bad news  but the plumbing is a health concern   Moreover  since new staff  all nice and professional  by the way  and Im grateful for their kindness and for Arvis help at  am to reprogram the door  take over different shifts  theres no continuity  I reported the sink problem on Friday afternoon  didnt get much response until a proposal for a fix until Saturday morning when we were asked for permission to do the work while we were paying for the unit   I was never told that the wifi work around  which did work  thank you  was the final fix   The sweat smelly sheets went without comment   All in all  this felt very corporate greedy  not like a customer focused airbnb experience   AND I have learned theres no way to communicate directly with management   cowardly corporate greedy   And I paid about      for this experience   Sheesh 
561572539449677992,Great location  This space needs a major deep clean  Walls in all the rooms are so dirty  Basic space  a good option if you plan to be out and about and not looking for a very elevated  curated and aesthetically pleasing space  The walls in every single room are so dirty  A deep clean and repaint is need  immediately

465967388332051244,Very disappointing   Positives  size and great location Negatives    very dirty  refrigerator full of crumbs bathtub shower stained and dirty  floorboards filthy  ceiling fan blades covered in thick dust   bathroom ceiling half painted and stained  No drain stop in sink  doors and all woodwork in very bad shape  light fixtures with bare lightbulbs  furniture minimal at best  entryway to building very rundown The positive aspects of this unit were the size and the location  We were very disappointed in the cleanliness of the unit  The refrigerator was full of crumbs and the toaster had crumbs on it  The ceiling fan blades were covered in dust  The floorboards were filthy  The bathroom ceiling was half painted and stained  The bathroom sink did not have a drain stop  The shower was dirty and water rust stained  There were hairs in the toothbrush cup   The doors and door jams were in very bad shape  Light fixtures had no covers just a bare lightbulb  The furniture was minimal at best  Also  the front door was ajar when we arrived 
555771110670108321,The unit is cute and the location is good  The unit is on top right on top of a bar that closes at  am   Monday and Tuesday night were not to bad but Thursday and Friday night was  a nightmare

531153741415245410,Bien ubicado  amplio  cuenta con lo necesario  le recomiendo hacer una buena limpieza  la alfombra necesita ser lavada  se percibe polvo y mal olor  En si al apartamento le faltan detalles de mantenimiento  pintura  Buena ubicaci n  edificio antiguo pero bien conservado  El apartamento tiene lo necesario  como se ve en las fotos del anuncio  Le sugerir a  reparar el ba o de la entrada  el agua se sale de la tina hasta la puerta del apartamento  generando mal olor a la alfombra  En general la alfombra del apartamento necesita ser lavada  se ve sucia y de mal olor  en general ser a bueno hacer una buena limpieza 
492823353341692555,Do not book here  They are at the point where they have so much success that they don t care to make sure their guest are heard  I booked this last minute because i needed a trip back to my hometown for a family emergency  I had forgotten my ID  I didn t need my ID since my husband is the one driving  Not to mention I contacted them saying if the application itself was all I needed to present at the door and they said yes   I have photo evidence of this chat  I made the mistake to not bring it but my husband could present his ID  They did not let me in the room  I was left without a place to stay and the did not refund my money  I filed a refund and still no one has reached out to me  Do not book here  They are at the point where they have so much success that they don t care to make sure their guest are heard  I booked this last minute because i needed a trip back to my hometown for a family emergency  I had forgotten my ID  I didn t need my ID since my husband is the one driving  Not to mention I contacted them saying if the application itself was all I needed to present at the door and they said yes   I have photo evidence of this chat  I made the mistake to not bring it but my husband could present his ID  They did not let me in the room  I was left without a place to stay and the did not refund my money  I filed a refund and still no one has reached out to me 
551422072693909217,There were bugs in the shower  but other than that it was a pleasant stay  Thank you for hosting  It does seem like there s a slight bug problem in the shower 
550768658228486429,AVOID AT ALL COST    the place was filthy when we arrived  It was superficially clean but the whole flat needs a deep clean  The bathroom was dirty  the soap dispenser was not working  how expensive is a replacement     the blinds in rooms were covered in thick dust  the dishes  pots and cutlery were grimy  the dishwasher dirty  the vacuum cleaner clogged  the bedsheets had hairs on them and looked used   general TLC needed  the ceiling tiles were broken and looked like they were about to fall down  It s an old building and a flat and really needs some easy fixes     the central heating was loud and one bedroom and the living space did not get any heat  no extra heater available  awful in winter    there was ice in front of the main entrance  so it was a struggle each time to go in and out without falling and breaking your necks   the communication with Zencity was half decent  they replied when they wanted to  not when you needed them to communicate with you   frustrating checkout  in the end we were lied to  told there was another booking when there wasn t  and told no late checkout was available even though they offered it first in an email  Then basically kicked us out without any reason other than  instructions from higher levels  even though we repeatedly requested some assistance  Felt like this was vindication for complaining about the filth and coldness from the start of our stay    An absolute disgrace of a company to deal with  it s really not worth the hassle    I will give credit where the credit is due     the flat was pretty and nicely furnished if you don t consider the layer of muck on top of every surface and the general state of being worn out and things not working  eg the record player    great location for public transport to city centre and not far from the O Hare airport     great location for some local caf s  food places  even vegan food  and a Target I was happy enough after the apologies and a partial refund for giving us the flat in a filthy state and having it cold   Got really frustrated after being spoken to like a total idiot for asking for a late checkout  First you offered the option  Then denied it to us  Then lied for the reasons  Then said you didn t need a reason  just instructions from  higher levels   didn t help us out with storing our luggage for a couple of hours  then threatened me with a bad review and charging more money   An absolute disgrace of a company  you should not be in business for how you treat your paying customers 
567351637356888319,Not great  dirty and not well maintained  This rental was disappointing   It was soooo dirty  from dust so thick on top of headboard  chipped paint throughout the unit  no coffee maker  front door keypad loose  problems connecting with WiFi  someone parked in the parking space and key fob didn t work with entrance on Dolman   If you are paying someone to clean  they aren t doing it   It really could be a nice place but it needs much attention 
474602095889029913,The apartment was nice and well appointed  However  the host failed to provide us with a fob to enter the main building after hours  We requested one multiple times and he never provided one and in the end did not even respond to our requests  I would not recommend zencity to anyone  The first night we were able to get in the building only because one of the tenants let us in  We were very disappointed with tour lack of response  We communicated with you that the fob was missing and you never provided one  We also told you we couldn t get into the building without a fob after hours because the code you gave us didn t work and the main door was closed  You never responded or provided us with one  This is not how you treat a guest or get good reviews 
566675639220969776,This place was ok  This is my first meh review for an Airbnb place I have stayed at and I think the sole reason for this is that this is a company who manages this property and not a normal person like I ve experienced with so response time with any questions or concerns I had was almost non existent  For example I messaged them at   am and didn t get a response until  am the next day so my issue didn t get addressed or anything  My only other complaint is that yes this place was not clean at all like very obviously not clean or at least not well  I wish I had taken times to read the reviews on that one  Location is great it s near by to a lot of good food places and park  It is what you make of it  Having better response times when messaging through Airbnb app and making sure residence is clean  Two biggest complaints but otherwise fine 
499290295548671582,They should do a better job at communication  I wouldn t recommend this location to anyone  It s hard getting in contact with your host if you have any problems  They are very rude and when I did have a problem they did not provide me with the help I needed neither care about my time or accommodate me for my stay  The temperature would not change because they have a control system on it so the whole stay I froze  It was an unhappy experience and rude customer service  Customer service was horrible  Do better at communication when dealing with your paying customers  I wouldn t recommend this location to anyone 
486256540917675341,This apartment has a noise monitor that went off regularly  even when operating the kitchen    The bathrooms both had separate issues that were never remedied when brought to attention    Overall stay was mediocre  but we left unsatisfied  and frankly annoyed unfortunately  The noise monitor is over the top  It was going off during times we weren t in the apartment  as well as when we turned the fan on to use the oven    Also listing that there are no basic seasoning  like salt  pepper  oil  would be helpful    Please have a more thorough clean crew  I sent multiple photos of hair in the master bathroom shower  One of the toilets were also not working in the guest bathroom 
566647946415128326,Overall  the stay was mediocre  Parking wasn t an issue as the street parking wasn t far away  The location was great  It was very walkable and everything by car was only      minutes away   The apartment building was old and had a smell to it in the hallways  The Airbnb looked like the pictures minus some cracks in the wall  I appreciated the stocked kitchen and bathroom  Also  there was a variety of streaming services on the television  The walls were very thin and you could hear neighbors talking or playing music after quiet hours  I let the host know and they were very timely with their response  I only give it a     because it was underwhelming  There was no additional effort put into the stay  Although the place was clean  there was a lack of attention to detail  For example  there was smudges around the light switches 
565989256240370895,I didn t enjoy my stay  Had to cancel and go to a hotel nearby  Beds wasn t clean  No heat  No WiFi  Cold air was coming in by the AC unit because it wasn t properly sealed  Can have cleaner bed sheets  WiFi that works  Working heat  Sealed off area around the AC unit so cold air doesn t come in 
531138285564340357,So many things wrong with this place beginning with the host  Zencity consistently takes over    mins to answer phones and even longer to answer text  The entry code was wrong as I saw other ppl have stated but I assumed that they had cleared things up  Took an hour to check in  The place Itself is decent enough but several issues  The bathroom has no sink  The only sink in the unit is in the kitchen  The door to the bathroom is a sliding door that doesn t want to stay closed and even when closed leaves Little privacy as there are huge gaps on the sides  The ice maker in the fridge doesn t work  This unit does not have controllable ac or heat  I informed Zencity that it was hot and asked them how to turn the heat down they told me to open a window  Temperature outside was     degrees btw  The thermostat said that it was being controlled at a central location so apparently they don t allow guests the option of changing the temperature  Also parking is across the street which isn t a huge deal when it s warm outside I suppose but in   degree weather with snow on the ground it s a huge hassle  The front door locks automatically but it is fickle and sometimes you have to reopening it and hold it closed until it locks  The fridge is so close to the wall that it is really akward to open the door  Also didn t smell great when first walking issue All this aside it s a decent place if u catch it for cheap 
500060125117707631,Poor WiFi signal
467361171223656880,Excellent location  No wifi entire stay  Kitchen amenities not what is listed  plan on supplementing if you use the kitchen at all and be prepared to do some clean first  Location excellent but that s a given   Email with checkin instructions came day after checkin  Had to pull up instructions online on website to know logistics  We had no wifi the entire stay  Reported it from very beginning service came next afternoon had to check unit next door was never seen again and connection never came  Kept checking  With added in fees for service expected things ready to use  Had to wash utensils in kitchen before use to get garbage off them  Amenities listed salt pepper and oil for cooking but not there  So had to add that to our to do list  Coffee press was broken  stem not attached to filter base of the press  Bottom drawer of refrigerator had crumbs from previous use as well as bar soap scum on the shower caddy even though only liquid soaps supplied  The sofa was horrible for back support especially if two people are sitting attempting to watch something  Removed the dust from the trim by bathroom radiator and kitchen back splash so I wouldn t have to look at it Overall a major disappointment at an excellent location
565043945080625905,Make Sure you call them and confirm that your stay   check in  is at a specific time and that no one is there clean your space and if they are there clean take pictures and at least meet the clean staffer   I didn t   very odd experience  Just on a respectable conversation of opportunity   When a guest arrives after the time allotted to check in   after traveling all day   your rental has to be ready to rock and roll and ready to accommodate the guest with relaxation   Check in time was  p  Arrivals     p Instead I find a clean staffer with all of her clean supplies scattered in the dining area with a response    It will be a minute     Ok   my check in is  p    Well you can set your stuff down and will be done in a minute    With all do respect I don t feel comfortable with you in here while I have all my stuff    Well you can leave and come back in     minutes    Sure I will contact the host and take pictures before I go   Do what you need to do I m Running behind    Contacted the host   respectfully they were really responsive  gave me a solution to the top apartment  beautiful place    Then I could let help to notice there were gnats in the bathroom trash can and on the couch   I would love to see this place really get all their attention to details figured out with communication and a slight better clean job  It s a beautiful place but needs to buckle up a lot 
564533096663115201,The code were were given to access the unit was incorrect and we didn t hear back from Zencity when we reached out to resolve the issue  We had to cancel the reservation and find other accommodations at the last minute  The code we were given to access the unit was incorrect and we never heard back from Zencity  We had to cancel the reservation and find other accommodations at the last minute 
563763682817062110,The check in out process was very simple  Overall the place was nice but the entire floor and the room itself smelled like cigarette smoke  We walked in and the place immediately smelled of cigarette smoke  Also the blinds were broken and the curtains to close the window got stuck on the track    Mostly just the stench of cigarette smoke was off putting 
563118442473057390,Check and confirm all details first Overall  I will say this  We have stayed in MANY AirBnBs over the last     years  and this was  by far  our worst experience yet  The unit itself to look at was decent enough  but given the area  parking issues  and the multitude of issues  it was in no way enough to make our stay pleasant  I should have known better than to secure a place run by a conglomerate  Details are outlined below   I did mention my first impression wasnt awesome  and that was an understatement  First  the description of the place definitely says free street parking  At the very least  this is very misleading  At worst  a complete lie  Very little parking to be had at all  plus I spent almost as much parking as I did for the space  Second  the entire place smelled like smoke  Not as much in the unit  but the entire building  After we settled in  we kept finding things that were either subpar or completely unacceptable   Ill start at the beginning  As we came to find out later in the day  the front door security is rendered useless during the day  as anyone can enter the restaurant and gain access to the foyer through there  without the use of a code  Once you reach the unit  the  coat hooks  at the front door were both literally falling out of the wall  Pretty big oversight as a first impression  Bathroom was the first stop  as we had just gotten off the road  Toilet wont flush  Having some experience in these things  I was able to get the flush valve going  but had to mess with it every time we used the toilet  It needs to be replaced  The outlet by the bed only works when the light switch is flipped  Again  Im no stranger to this type of thing  so I figured it out  but most folks will just be frustrated  Needs to be put in the description or welcome blurb  Once we settled in for the evening the first night  we wanted to cuddle in front of the TV for a bit  The couch is HORRIBLE  Not comfortable in any way  unless you grab all of the pillows from the bed and drag them out to be strategically placed  Then we couldnt get the overhead lamp to shut off  as the footswitch is broken  Tried  and finally succeeded getting the curtains closed  but one side only went so far  Mainly because of the joint in the rod holding them up  but if the wands werent missing  this would have been easy to overcome  I know Im leaving a few things out here  but that should give you plenty to go on    Thanks  but no   John
562329828490401140,the shower   kitchen water was cold my car got broken into   the doors were locked   other than that great stay   nice heat   nice space
489827352422920317,This is probably the worst stay I ve ever had with Airbnb Although the property was extremely nice Good luck having Managment or ANYONE from Zencity accommodate anything they promised      I got locked out of the apartment took   hours for someone to return my call and unlock my door      located right next to a busy street  you hear literally every car passing by to sirens and semis      wash and drier did not work   I was there on business for a   day trip  let Managment know the first day They weren t working   they told me they d have maintenance come at a certain time   they showed up   hours late missed work meetings and had zero clean clothes  Didn t address the situation from day    didn t even return my phone call Now   days after the trip still no phone call when I was assured by Andrea and Eric  Managment  they would look into the situation and get back to me    Being an Airbnb owner in several states I would be appalled if my management treated guests the way zencity treats theirs Highly do not encourage you to stay with this property This is probably the worst stay I ve ever had with Airbnb Although the property was extremely nice Good luck having Managment or ANYONE from Zencity accommodate anything they promised      I got locked out of the apartment took   hours for someone to return my call and unlock my door      located right next to a busy street  you hear literally every car passing by to sirens and semis      wash and drier did not work   I was there on business for a   day trip  let Managment know the first day They weren t working   they told me they d have maintenance come at a certain time   they showed up   hours late missed work meetings and had zero clean clothes  Didn t address the situation from day    didn t even return my phone call Now   days after the trip still no phone call when I was assured by Andrea and Eric  Managment  they would look into the situation and get back to me    Being an Airbnb owner in several states I would be appalled if my management treated guests the way zencity treats theirs Highly do not encourage you to stay with this property
562280687402653773,That bathroom sink is wild  The faucet comes out enough to barely provide water to the actual sink  It s such a much if you need to wash your hands 
561751477559912722,This was a nightmare  The access code did not work  and I didn t get a new one until an hour   half after checkin time  after I finally got in we noticed it was freezing and NONE of the radiators worked  It is the middle of winter and freezing outside  so I reached out about it and they informed me that Maintance would come in and fix it that day but then hours later after no show from maintenance  they said that they would drop off a space heater the following day  the Wi Fi router did not have a power cord so no Wi Fi or apps on the tv  THEN we notice someone trying to get into the room  it s   people and they say they booked the same place for the same dates we booked it was unacceptable so we left
405028033571141954,This property is not adequately represented in current posting   Shower  lighting  basic supplies  and back yard area    Check in process was    minutes  Positives are the workmanship of the home is magnificent  Communication and check in was not good   Representation of back yard and loft area was very misleading  Ice maker not working  Refrigerator freezing food  Front door lock  Only   towels provided   Upstairs shower was unsafe and misrepresented in pictures   Ceiling fan not operable in master  as well as lights  Laundry room had no soap   Old food and alcohol left in refrigerator   Ants in kitchen sink and cabinet 
563067419664364458,Checkin was tricky but the host was very responsive   The microwave didnt work so that was a bummer   Good deal for the money 
562370592354817448,The apartment is different than the one shown in the photos  You can only access the access the gym  not all of the amenities in the building  and it was certainly not as clean as clean as youd expect with COVID precautions 
562290945548863093,I initially booked another place before this one but while I was on the road there they switched up my reservation to a completely different place which is this one  The room was really nice but that was it  I couldn t find any parking  my first room couldn t open so I had to go to another room in which I couldn t stay the rest of my nights in because I had to move back  well Atleast I was suppose to but i never got a call back  Really didn t feel like it was planned well on they re part  No one really knew what was going on
561029385819850870,Terrible experience never even got into my unit to stay due to locks not working and keys missing  They told me to cancel my reservation and they would give me a full refund but I only got    dollars back out of     and I never got to stay  We had nowhere to stay and had to go back home  I had the worst experience  I never even got into the unit due to missing keys and a lock that would not unlock  I jumped through every hoop  sent video repeatedly as they suggest and still never got into the unit  I spent almost     dollars and they told me to just cancel my reservations and I only got    dollars back  I will definitely be calling everyone I can to tell them to do something about this 
560931705320115207,Good location  nice coffee shop downstairs  Place needs some TLC and maybe better clean  Easy check in with the exception of the key kiosk being out  Quiet place in a good location but definitely need some TLC  The place was not very clean  floors had obvious dust and bed was not very clean

555029411408263289,DO NOT BOOK WITH ZENCITY IF YOU LIKE TO LIVE COMFORTABLY  If you re looking for something up to par  nice and clean then this is definitely not the place you want to book  Now if you are accustomed to project living or low income living then you ll feel right at home but other than that just don t do it  Trust me  They tried to charge me      for a key fab that was returned to the key cafe  The bedding was stained  Had the nerve to be white on top of that lol  The appliances don t work hence the microwave was broken the last time we were there but I didn t know it was the same exact unit because they relisted it as new so the reviews could go away I would ve never stayed twice  The review will not be positive  The reason you all took the listing off and relisted in the first place  You get what you pay for I guess  Cool for the price if you like to do things yourself like clean and buy things to wash dishes  The couch has more stains than a toddlers tshirt  The duvets are stained  There was nothing here to clean with  The vacuum doesn t work  Microwave doesn t work  Pots n pans have stuck on burnt food  ZENCITY is the slumlord of air bnb  Experience wasn t the best but again you get what you pay for right  This was trash  But you all knew that already  The cleaners spot clean  All around bad experience  Don t book  Save yourself the time and frustration and just some book with ZENCITY like EVER  The shower makes a horrible noise if you try to take a hot shower  The unit above it does the same thing my guy and I laughed every time we heard them shower because it was so loud like well at least it s not just us  You can t adjust the heat so you have to bring a space heater if the temp is low  THE SLUMLORDS OF AIR BNB  THAT NEVER FIX ANYTHING BUT ALWAYS WANT MONEY  Zencity is the slumlord of AirBnb  You need to hire cleaners who actually clean  You need to replace the furniture that is stained worse than a toddlers tshirt  The blinds are broken in every area of the apartment  The microwave doesn t work  The sheets duvets were previously stained n washed  The pots n pans have wore to the point the next step is disposal  I m upset my son booked the same stay next week which is horrible due to the experience and the only rep that is within your organization willing to help anyone is Clifford  Ava Jemima have done nothing to make the situation better  Do better as a whole this place is trash  I would have never booked it if I had known it was the same listing I stayed back in August and had the exact same experience  THE WORST  THANKS FOR NOTHING  And the place you didn t even want to sit on anything without first putting a sheet or something over it  Disgusting

553617631843988013,This apartment was a really good value for the money  Great location  and incredible amenities in the apartment complex itself  an indoor basketball court  gym with pelotons  multiple working stations with apple computers  a great little cafe and coffee shop and a small convenience store are all in the lobby   The building elevators from the parking garage were down  so our only access in to the building and to retrieve our keys required us carrying luggage up and down a few short flights of stairs that we werent expecting  Parking Is     day  but was very convenient  Figuring out the main elevators was a bit confusing  you have to scan in to the elevator AND when youre in the elevator you have to scan again  pushing the standard call button doesnt work for apartment access     The apartment itself had very comfortable beds with great privacy  I couldnt hear my coworker at all in her room  and there were great kitchen seating areas and amenities to cook  The apartment itself has some obvious damage wear and tear and some minor cleanliness issues  but for the price  it didnt bother us    Last thing to consider is this unit is managed by a corporation  not an individual  so communication wasnt very clear after check in  We got  canned  responses that made it clear our messages werent actually being read  We didnt have any major issues  but this would have been frustrating if we had    All this being said  Id still stay here again  Hi  The value for this stay was great  but there were a few issues with the unit that should be addressed     There was a very strong odor in the entryway kitchen area  It smelled like cat urine litter     The sink in the smallest bathroom does not work  There is either a significant clog or some other damage     Communication with your team wasnt very clear  It was obvious to me that people werent reading my messages before replying  For example  when I communicated that I was checking out a day early  the response was  looking forward to hosting you soon    It was very clear my messages were not being read and addressed appropriately  Last  the elevators are down from the parking garage  so there is no easy accessible access to the apartment  we had to go up several flights of stairs   While we could manage  someone with a wheelchair could not 
551511047688228865,first the good  super clean  awesome location  right next to free trolly stop   view is beautiful   the bad  for four guests and two bedrooms only one key and fob  you need fob to get into building and use elevator  I asked host and they said extra fob only if we were staying    days  the second bedroom had window into the living room and the curtain only covered    percent of window  the water pressure in second bathroom was super low 
550060381437867597,I will never ever rent an Airbnb from this company again the check in process and the communication with Company is absolutely horrible and their customer service Isn t much better  I had to stay there because my house was being worked on the first time they gave me a late check out but then locked me out of the unit    minutes before and I couldn t get anything out for four hours unfortunately I had to stay another day so the next day they gave me a two hour late check out but the housekeeper was there at    o clock and I had to leave so they did absolutely nothing for all my hasslesCommunication between your housekeepers and yourself is key and don t lock people out of the unit just because it s after    o clock I couldn t even get to my phone to call anybody worst experience ever Check in is horrible the process takes forever  My suggestion would be also if you re gonna let somebody have a late check out to actually give it to them don t Lock them out before they even get a chance to get their stuff out
510144271019327650,Nice place but area a little rough 
445647890647160678,  There was rats     I would like either half refunded back or full refund   I was difficult for us to sleep with them running around  
428281784073549266,Got locked out multiple of times because the only way to get in is a call telecom which unlocks the first two main doors to the building which didn t work many times during my stay I contacted the host and didn t get a response the entire stay or at all for that matter  it was a very upsetting experience I have stayed at multiple location by the host and has been a loyal customer this was a very bad experience never got an apology nor any acknowledgement about the situation
485536166956809915,Forgot very important and meaningful items and I m sure whoever clean the room after we left took my items didn t report they were lost and found and NOBODY bothered to help  This was a terrible experience I forgot very important and meaningful items here and  no one was answering or bothered to help  Very very poor service  
417314396329983227,This apartment is in a great location if you want to be accessible to Hyde Park  The neighborhood is walkable with lots of restaurants and coffee shops close by    Check in directions were clear and easy to follow  The wifi was strong and reliable the entire time  I appreciated the nice TV  the shower supplies and the extra towels that were available  The building also has laundry at the end of the hall which accepts credit cards  which was super convenient    That being said  it s clear that while the unit does get routinely clean in between stays  it has not been deep clean in some time  The corners all have built up paint flakes and dust  there are mysterious stains on the chair and in the fridge  and I encountered a couple of bugs as well  Some surfaces are sticky   Also  the bed is loud  very squeaky  and quite uncomfortable    Overall  it s essentially a college dorm  It will be a safe and mostly quiet place to sleep  work  and do light prep in the kitchen  However  don t expect a fancy type of stay from this unit 
543526569455603831,The location was great  pretty much within    minutes of anywhere in the city  Parking was really simple as there s plenty of free street parking around  The place wasn t exactly the cleanest but it was liveable   The last posted  clean  date was       and I stayed in mid Jan   There also was no shampoo or conditioner despite the listing saying there would be which is fine just a minor inconvenience and would ve been good to know beforehand 
499241197840902303,I was locked out of the building one night for   hours until someone who live in the building let me in  The call box outside didn t work so I was locked out
477536047335566343,We stayed for a doctors appointment and we live   hours away  The check in process was awful and communication sucked  Check In time was at   and didn t get check in details about where the apt was or the   codes you need to get In until almost    Then when we got there  the code for the door didn t work  we had to call the doorman  We got up to our apartment and the code they gave us for the door went off  They had given us a wrong code  no one responded until I had to call the immediate service line to get help which proceeded to take over    minutes so at least an hour just to get into the apartment  While it is a nice and spacious apartment  it was enough to where we won t be using this host again 
560194096824992861,This place has so much potential  I want to start with the good things    the check in Instructions are super clear  and walk you through step by step  The unit itself was immaculately clean  and it was decorated cutely  The building it s in was nice  clean  and an amazing location so close to everything    First issue  I sit down on the couch and it was still SOAKED from whatever the cleaners used to clean it  not a big deal in my head im like at least it was clean throughly    second  the living room tv is plugged into an outlet that is on a switch by the front door  not normally a big deal but this switch also controls every overhead light in the space so you cant turn the lights off without turning the tv off  so if you want to watch tv you will watch it with every light on   supper annoying    third  my first night at  am the smoke detector starts chirping and wakes me up  i message the host and they send someone over while i was gone  i get a message saying   we have stopped the smoke alarm from chirping but in the process lost all power in the living room and kitchen   my jaw dropped  so i messaged back saying    am i supposed to sit in the dark or    they then let me know that they ran an extension cord for the tv and that they arent sure if they can get the lights working before my checkout    i finally get back to the unit  guess what  smoke alarm is STILL chirping  i have no lights  etc  i ended up calling the host snd they couldnt do anything  i found the breaker box and at least got the lights to turn back on  how did their own staff not check to see if they popped a breaker  then lied about the smoke alarm    two nights with no sleep  a useless host  etc   it sucks because this place has so much potential but i have zero confidence in any one on their team except their clean crew 
499955046289146141,It took over an hour to get checked in as the door code provided was inaccurate  The room was not very clean  the bathroom had hairs in tub  on back of toilet  etc   The smell was terrible and they had left the windows open to air it out when I arrived 
521061893914366667,The access into the building was non existent  Other people let me into the building  The whole apartment was dirty  Stains on the furniture  Hair all over the bathroom  No garbage bags  No salt or pepper  The soap was just water   Someone walked up and down the hallway speaking loudly on their phone all day long  The people right above the apartment were fight so bad  I could hear cussing and sounded like someone being beat  SThe access into the building was non existent  Other people let me into the building  The whole apartment was dirty  Stains on the furniture  Hair all over the bathroom  No garbage bags  No salt or pepper  The soap was just water   Someone walked up and down the hallway speaking loudly on their phone all day long  The people right above the apartment were fight so bad  I could hear cussing and sounded like someone being beat 
558701422989874004,Check in could be better code was wrong and I had to wait outside apartment for about       mins  Not sure what issue is with carpet but it had a darkish tent to it when I checked in but host felt I stained carpet with chewing gum and I don t chew gum and have never had a bad review for cleanliness so that doesn t make sense  Also the tub is peeling and should be fixed  Great location plenty of silverware and plates also has Netflix and nice kitchen  Check in could be better code was wrong and I had to wait outside apartment for about       mins  Not sure what issue is with carpet but it had a darkish tent to it when I checked in and the tub is peeling also just a few things that could be changed  Not trying to be malicious in any way I appreciate your communication as well as plenty of dishes and forks  Thank you

492051826911315690,Ive stayed here previously and it was a pleasure  This time around not so much   During my stay  The heat didnt work while it was    degree weather   When I called for assistance  the assistant asked me the temperature inside the apartment and hung up on me   There were no replies to my heat related questions on the app during my stay   Outside of this experience  the airbnb sufficed  But this ruined a good stay  Ive stayed here previously and had a great stay  This stay was not the same  The heat didnt work while it was    degrees outside and the person meant to assist hung up on me   This was a terrible experience 
555821201434739689,I do not recommend this Airbnb  I wish I could  The Host is just simply bad  The location was decent  These are some of the issues we encountered during our stay  a shower that didn t give much more than a trickle  A smoke detector that beeped at night when lights were turned off  A dryer that did not dry its contents  And a strange electrical wiring arrangement that turns off all of lights  lamps  TV  speaker  and apparently the smoke detector too with the flip of a switch  So no mood lighting  When I reached out to the host the morning after our first night about the shower and noise  we got a response that they couldn t be fixed until the next day due to a snowstorm  I said this wouldn t work for us because these were not small issues we could work around  No response  After some back and forth with various people from Zencity  but mostly me being totally ignored every time I reached out for an update  over our   night stay NOTHING was fixed while we were there  A complete lack of care  I didn t feel like I got my moneys worth  that s for sure  To top all of it off  I reached out an asked for a later checkout and no one ever replied after multiple messages  I received an email the night prior asking if we wanted to extend checkout to  pm  Instead of replying  they sent their clean team they failed to communicate with  I did finally get a reply when they asked why were still in the unit  And they even went through the effort of trying to charge us     for late checkout with Airbnb  This is what they do instead of addressing their guest needs  Zencity needs a lot of help on what it takes to be a good host  Most definitely not a legitimate SuperHost  Communicate with guests and promptly fix issues without excuses  Your guests are what keep you in business and you need to do everything you can to ensure you resolve inquiries in a timely manner  You were overall not a good host  not because of the issues but because your lack of communication and compassion  If our issues continue to go unresolved we feel like we aren t important as guests 
487638247678394012,The unit was not clean  I arrived to trash on the floor in the bathroom  dirty walls  rugs not swept  The internet is google fibers free plan   Mbps down   Mbps up  very rough to use for basic work needs  Free parking was easy to find all times of day within a block of the entrance  Support takes multiple hours if not days to get back to you and they can t do much besides pass it along to their manager  The phone number provided for around the clock issues just tells you to try again  no one answered  Not worth the price  had a terrible experience  Have support that can actually help  Clean units before guests arrive  Internet that actually works not some terrible free tier service 
552173294336810447,Apartment is great for short term stays  Host responded to my questions promptly early on  There was just an issue with the heating system  It is window unit in the living room that never reaches the bedroom so when nights get cold make sure you bring extra blankets and maybe a space heater  Since it is an old building there is a chance that the pipes will freeze so you might not get to take a shower  The host did respond to attempt to fix the issue sending a maintenance man but he said there was nothing he could do  When I did arrive a lamp was missing and there was already damage done to the apartment so it wasnt properly being maintained  It is good for a short term stay     days definitely not long term 
549972777289436449,Great location and really easy to check in  The couch smelled a little funky so I bought some fabric refresher and that helped  Check the key fobs I couldn t get into the gym
549337804225588041,No free washer and dryer and make certain you got the right door code The no free washer and dryer the sliding door open the cigarette butts and contact wrappers all were not ok and the inability to check in cause wrong door code everything else was great
526807488094425215,This is a  functional  place to stay  Your expectations need to be measured  It is not a luxury building or sophisticated apartment  it s a place to get a decent night s sleep  I was unimpressed with the way the apartment was presented  visible dust  dirt  hair  The paint job is very patchy and makes the room feel more neglected than it is  It s quiet  especially considering it s proximity to the train  Heating works perfectly  It s a solid   star place to stay  I wouldn t stay here again  Hi   So  I don t like leaving negative reviews  but this property is pretty lackluster  It was incredibly dirty  hair in the bed  stains on the towels  visible dust and dirt on the floor  I wouldn t accept this room if it was presented to me in a hotel  but I know Airbnb would a different  I think the bad paint job and sparse furniture didn t help the feeling that this was a neglected apartment  The pillows are very poor quality  almost unusable  The location is great  I was upset that the check in process wasn t smooth  but you did call me with     an hr to help me out   It s definitely a   star experience  I ve stayed in better places for less  but the holiday season is always more expensive  The WiFi is great  The heating works well  There was no laundry detergent 
534115104136814144,If you want to visit the Hyde Park area  then this apartment is in a great location  The apartment is very roomy  however  we were disappointed with our experience because the apartment had several issues  mostly minor   but they sort of added up to a negative experience   For example  the water in one of the showers did not work  the controls on a couple of the radiators were not functioning  a maintenance worker came and fixed one but for some reason did not fix the other   the carpet needed clean  the coffee maker was left with moldy coffee grounds  and the French press was cracked  we were told that we would receive a new one but never did   With some more TLC  this could be a great apartment 
532655337805887211,Harassed us about every little thing   kept telling us to keep noise down despite there being   of us   no TV no music  Unit   D has the most amazing miserable neighbor who bangs on your wall and leaves nasty notes under ur door   I have screen shots I kid u not  we actually had to pay for   places to stay bc it became so much of a headache Harassed us w texts about noise when there was   of us no music no tv  and we were kept up by noise not making it  We actually had to pay for   places to stay bc we were so uncomfortable
529738055211789647,The internet was very intermittent and slow and only worked in one room and the host did not respond to messages about it   Otherwise  fine place and great location 
526811505425249900,The place is nice  It s close to BJH hospital which is good for traveling medical professionals  however  The bathroom flooded one morning  It took    hours of conversation before they would even send a maintenance man  Said maintenance man never showed  The next morning the bathtub filled with feces after I flushed the toilet and the entire bathroom flooded again  I have yet to hear from them regarding this and I messaged them    hours ago 
551463371190488732,The home was accurate however  the home could use some improvements  The toilet seat was not attached to the toilet which made the toilet not usable  The home was full of gnats and the walls could use some clean and a fresh coat of paint  I was glad everything was so close but if I am paying for a clean fee I expect the home to be up to par and not full of bugs and broken furniture 
550773476213881398,The building management along with the people at the front desk have nothing to do with zencity  so that whenever there is an issue  e g  with getting into the apartment  you can call and leave a message and hope that zencity would reply  Also their code generation system is messed up

539123121163616016,Check in took me    min  I was on calls with different Zencity representatives since there s no doorman who was going to accommodate me  at least it was said in host s instructions  Originally I booked an apartment for   days and decided to prolong it for   more day and did it through airbnb  Zencity confirmed  and charged me  On a day   I wanted to leave the apartment to get some fresh food and drinks  and since there s a code doorlock  luckily and thankfully to my tenant experience I decided to check if the code is still valid first  And it was not  I texted Zencity through Airbnb to get a new code  which they sent to me in an hour  and it didn t match too  After I said about it   they just ignored me  I had to stay in the apartment and drink tap water until the next day without any possibility to leave it cause I wouldn t be able to get it again  I couldn t get a delivery too since I d have to go to lobby  and leave an apartment  Thanks to God I didn t leave it and checked the code first cause I could spend the last night in a lobby  But they didn t forget to remind about      charge  if I d leave it after       am     times  Apartment itself was okay  nice and clean  but the service is terrible  It s not the experience I d like to have when booking a fancy apartment in a city center
546946150493646226,This Airbnb is located in a beautiful location  in the heart of the Central West End   Cosmetically  the unit appears unfinished especially in the bathroom   For those who love Sports  Channel   aka Fox   is not available and neither is the Fox Sports streaming app  so NO BASKETBALL AND NO FOOTBALL  Upon  entry I noticed that the blinds were broken  as though they were strategically cut  The same goes for the blinds in the kitchen  they re barely hanging on   There are some dust bunnies    but overall the unit was fairly clean  If you need a decent place to sleep  access to a kitchen  laundry  a bathroom  and Netflix  this space will satisfy your basic necessities  The space is being utilized well  in that it s being rented out via Airbnb  However  the outcome of the renovations do not seem complete   The apartment building is aged  which is ok  but within the unit s bathroom  for example  one can still see stucco or whatever material was used to resurface the walls is not done well  It s uneasy on the eyes  making it seem dirty  The renovations appear rushed and unfinished  The blinds were broken when we walked in  The apartment could be cleaner and the sheets smelled unclean 
528977611999045275,Keys were missing at first location  but they moved us to a second within a few hours  Both locations were clean and well kept
