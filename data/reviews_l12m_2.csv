453554269058855194,Couldnt get into the building for up to     minutes because they didnt think to send me it ahead of time and their costumer service didnt seem to know the code either  This was after a long drive pushing  am and a struggle to get a later check out with this company which ended with us purchasing an extra day  The purchase was fine  money talks  but you would think a business that seemingly had a tight schedule would be in order  Well just getting into the building was the beginning of my woes  Come to my room and open the door    its a mess  Dirty and lived in is the vibe this air bnb must live by as a company motto  Mind you  our check in is scheduled to be no earlier than around   ish the previous day  So they didnt even try to clean it with the extra   hrs we were driving to St Louis they had  The most they could offer me was to sleep in the filth and theyll have it clean the following day  They showed their benevolence by granting us an extra hour to stay in their bnb before leaving  At this point Im fuming and ask for a refund  didnt even stay  we just went to a best Western two towns over  Refund hasnt been pushed yet and its been   days since exposed to this joke  management must feed off the bad reviews Im sure youre aware of the quality I was exposed to  Including how long its taking you to issue a refund and its just an overall bitter experience 
449995501773233746,When we arrived to check in the door was propped open and the lock for the door has been installed backwards  with the keypad on the inside and deadbolt on the outside   I immediately contacted Zencity and they said they would escalate to their manager and report back  They did not report back and I had to call back to check on someone coming to fix it  They said no one could come that day  Our options were to relocate to another Airbnb for one night and then move back after the lock was fixed  It was not possible for us to move and then move back based on the plans we had made for our visit so we had to prop a table against the door that night since there was no lock   Zencity did not come correct the lock until the next day at  pm after I had to follow up with a call and messages  After that we had two service men visit to remove air conditioning units without warning or our permission   The health and safety concerns and lack of responsiveness from Zencity was unacceptable    The Airbnb was only partially clean  The only positive note I can share is on the location  The location was great   walkable to the arch and Cardinals game   We will never stay at an Airbnb hosted by Zencity again 
449293641601574565,The communication with ZenCity staff was terrible  The unit I rented in St  Louis at The Bordeaux had a malfunctioning central air unit  This is a top floor unit with no shade  the temperature was in the upper   s on the first day    two windows could not be left open because their screens were missing    From the moment I checked in  the thermostat read    degress  when I turned it down to    degress  it said it would take    hours to achieve that temperature  After waiting    hours with no change to the temperature  I started looking for the HVAC unit   found it in a closet  The fan was blowing air in the apartment  but it was not cooling the air  I noticed that the unit had no filter   then I noticed that the filter was sitting on the floor  between the unit   the wall of the closet   it was completely packed full of dirt  Id estimate that it had not been changed in more than a year  so the maintenance of the building may have been weak for quite a while   There were plastic wrappers   spare parts sitting on top of the water heater that appeared to have been used to repair the HVAC system    it appeared that someone may have abandoned a repair job mid way through the process   then the unit was rented before the repair was finished    In my case  it was late August  extremely hot in St  Louis   although I did sleep in the unit for one night  with no a c  with the windows open   sweated all night on the sheets  I was not willing to do it two nights in a row  I was left so frustrated by the complete lack of assistance  I didnt even want to be there   Three ZenCity staff responded  late  to my texts or calls  all asking about the nature of the problem  None ever followed up to ask me what I wanted done about it  or to tell me what was happening  One employee suggested that he could control the temperature remotely  asked me what temperature I would like it set at   then never followed up  The temperature never changed   neither did the thermostat  There was no obvious indication anywhere that the thermostat could be managed remotely  If so  that feature also did not work    The ZenCity staff communicated through text   email  outside of AirBnBs messaging app  despite AirBnBs guidance to only use the messaging app  so they would have a trail of evidence to troubleshoot any bad experiences  I sent multiple messages through the app  as well as directly to ZenCity employees  who ultimately never did anything to help me  After the fact  they never followed up to apologize   After receiving no assistance the following morning  I checked out early  with temperatures forecast in the mid   s  AirBnB quickly issued a refund for the second day   a partial refund for the first     Although ZenCitys reviews on the AirBnB site were ok  their reviews for the same property on other websites were generally worse  This was probably the worst vacation experience Ive had anywhere in the last    years   The paint in the unit was badly chipped   scraped by furniture  inconsistent with the photos  The check in process is complicated  The nature of the lock system is such that you could easily be locked out of the unit    reliant on ZenCity to help you regain access to your things   The HVAC was obviously not operational  The worst thing  though  was the customer service   lack of responsiveness when I had a serious problem  which made it impossible to stay   finish my trip  Ive never left a negative review before  but this was truly a  very bad experience  As I repeatedly said in my messages to ZenCity representatives  the temperature in this apartment was miserably hot     degrees     the a c unit was not working   had obviously not been maintained  But the problem was  after    hours  no one had sent maintenance staff to check out the problem  offered to accommodate us elsewhere  or anything else  I was repeatedly asked what was wrong   then I never received responses about what would be done   nothing ever changed 
449200908082774156,Very disappointed in my stay with zen city  I ve stayed with zen city before   I also used to live in the building so I was anticipating a similar experience  However that was not the case at the start of our stay  You d think that using digital locks is a good idea  when it works  But when it doesn t work  it can be a catastrophe  The reliance on technology without a clear contingency is not a smart way of doing business    It was   am and we had arrived at the apartment only to find that the digital lock had malfunctioned  inhibiting us from using the code to enter  We called customer service and they attempted to help us get in using new codes and digital codes but to no avail  I appreciate all the help Oshane provided however this was unacceptable  We were informed that there was no other way into the apartment and that there were no keys to enter the apartment  We were told that we had to travel to a different building  Mind you it was   am  As we were leaving  we were stopped by the front desk who ultimately found a way for us to enter    The next morning we were unable to leave our apartment without a way to re enter due to the broken digital lock  The locks were eventually fixed hours later    The apartment was ok  There was construction every morning and from time to time the bathroom sink would gargle and backup with old water  smelled unpleasant   A few stains on the couch  Furthermore the internet that services the apartment was not equipped to handle working from home     I requested compensation from management but my calls have done unheard  This is most frustrating as our experience getting their affected our trip thereafter and we ve been ignored by management  I demand compensation  Very disappointed in my stay with zen city  I ve stayed with zen city before   I also used to live in the building so I was anticipating a similar experience  However that was not the case at the start of our stay  You d think that using digital locks is a good idea  when it works  But when it doesn t work  it can be a catastrophe  The reliance on technology without a clear contingency is not a smart way of doing business    It was   am and we had arrived at the apartment only to find that the digital lock had malfunctioned  inhibiting us from using the code to enter  We called customer service and they attempted to help us get in using new codes and digital codes but to no avail  I appreciate all the help Oshane provided however this was unacceptable  We were informed that there was no other way into the apartment and that there were no keys to enter the apartment  We were told that we had to travel to a different building  Mind you it was   am  As we were leaving  we were stopped by the front desk who ultimately found a way for us to enter    The next morning we were unable to leave our apartment without a way to re enter due to the broken digital lock  The locks were eventually fixed hours later    The apartment was ok  There was construction every morning and from time to time the bathroom sink would gargle and backup with old water  smelled unpleasant   A few stains on the couch  Furthermore the internet that services the apartment was not equipped to handle working from home     I requested compensation from management but my calls have done unheard  This is most frustrating as our experience getting their affected our trip thereafter and we ve been ignored by management  I demand compensation 
441993811701557684,Not responsive  passcode was not sent until I stand by the door and make a phone call and test code and change the code and test it again  It was    outside  I have to wait for them set the passcode instead of they set it up before I arrive   In the morning I make up my mind and prepared to go to school for my first class in new semester  the door of the building is broken  and it is broken for a long while  which they did not mention at all  My Uber cancelled my trip to school and charged me    dollars for waiting  The only way out seems to be the path through the dumpster and yes  it is    outside  I did not go to my first class due to it  Assuredly I asked help from host  not body replied to me  I have to walk all the way through that dumpster and detour to the door of the building and enter the passcode and the people inside of the building can get out   Nobody will help you when you were in trouble there  And room is old I can accept that as the price is relatively low  For cleanliness  you can tell the hair of others in the towel  etc  And people lives in upstairs is quite active   Location is ok  but I would recommend some else to live if you need food and water 
431808837862449605,Very unprofessional and in person know when the situation arises and they think by switching you to another room that they rectify the issue but they don t and their system is very automated so you only get to talk to him and if you press the right selections when you call the host number  Stay with a private house do not use in city they are running more like a business than a personable ran Airbnb The fact that I was not reached prior to me arriving to the unit even though you say you tried she still mean something in regards to me being compensated for the inconvenience and poor communication by the same city staff the reps on the phone we re very nice but it seems like they were not given the correct information to even let me check in timely and the new unit that they try to move me to and I asked for compensation by a partial refund and didn t get it the second unit that they move me to was a smoking unit so it smelled like smoke and it was much smaller the bathroom was very small and didn t have much room for me to move around and I m definitely not pleased I will not be using Sin City again unless they resolve this issue they try to say that they would not give me a refund and I do not think that is fair because I waited almost an hour before I could get in the new new room The fact that I was not reached prior to me arriving to the unit even though you say you tried she still mean something in regards to me being compensated for the inconvenience and poor communication by the same city staff the reps on the phone we re very nice but it seems like they were not given the correct information to even let me check in timely and the new unit that they try to move me to and I asked for compensation by a partial refund and didn t get it the second unit that they move me to was a smoking unit so it smelled like smoke and it was much smaller the bathroom was very small and didn t have much room for me to move around and I m definitely not pleased I will not be using Zen City again unless they resolve this issue they try to say that they would not give me a refund and I do not think that is fair because I waited almost an hour before I could get in the new new room Due to the rep not knowing the access codes and giving me the wrong access code which lock the door
427448767978231621,Everything was nice   Just like the pictures    The only negative things we found was the apartment smelled like smoke     really the whole building did   We found ashes on top of the fridge   Lastly  there was a book on the table in the living room and it had nude pictures in it   which I felt was disgusting if someone was staying there with children   Overall it was a decent place to stay   Beds were amazing and it was great pricing for the stay  Everything was real nice   The only negative that I found was that the building smelled like smoke especially inside the apartment that we had  We actually found ashes on top of the fridge   lastly  there was a book on the table in the living room that had nude pictures in it that I found inappropriate if children had been staying there   Other than that  everything els was nice  
426082917545708712,I was disappointed with my stay here  The unit had a bad smell as soon as we checked in and I immediately alerted the host  however while their communication was good  it was not followed up by action  They offered ozone treatment etc  but did not actually do it even after I told them to go ahead to schedule it  All the window AC s were terribly dirty and had the red light on requiring clean  Walking on the floor bare feet left you with black soles  All this also I told the host but nothing was done about it  Cleanliness is a big thing with me and this unit failed completely in meeting my standards  The sofa was dirty with stains on it   and the whole place looked tired and shabby  This unit is not worth the price we paid 
426039602752521685,We were very dissatisfied with our unit  We had to call to get a code for the outer door  The apartment was unlocked  The trash cans had not been emptied  A water bottle and trash was on a windowsill  The trash cans had not been emptied  Dirty towels were left in the laundry hamper  There were no hand towels and wash clothes or towels for the kitchen  There was no coffee or filters  I called the hostess and she seemed rather uncaring  She offered a one bedroom unit for the three of us  That obviously would not work  She wanted pictures so I sent them  We clean the washer which smelled horrible because it stays closed all the time   The lint filter in the dryer was stuffed  We stayed up till midnight washing linens so we could sleep  The sheets on one bed were on sideways  The next day someone changed all the sheets and left clean linens for the bath and kitchen  They emptied the trash but did not sweep  Hair is in every corner  It was advertised as three bedroom and two baths  The shower in one bath did not work   I cannot believe this unit can be charged for  I will never rent from Zencity again  
421730432257979730,This place was not kept up and kind of dirty  The pictures made it look much better than it actually was  There were things hanging off screws in the walls  dirt coming out of the bathroom vent  a red and brown stained tub and shower curtain  black marks all over the walls  the place just didnt feel kept up  It definitely seems like a place that a corporation owns and no individual actually sees it  Some more upkeep of the property would be beneficial  It just didnt feel like it was in good shape    and it felt very dirty 
419508958412733068,The building has significant challenges including urine and feces in the lobby  elevator and hallways   This happened each day we were there   The lobby was clean but the elevator and the area outside the elevator on floor    were never clean  they would just partially dry then new urine feces would be present the next day   Main entrance security door not functional   Little or no security or housekeeping staff   Several barking and snarling dogs   Garbage chute and dumpster not maintained and garbage all over   Parking lot pedestrian entrance security not functional  No parking pass or fob in unit at check in and took     minutes to get one   This is exacerbated by further complicating the multi step process of getting in the unit and getting ones car parked   Window coverings on all three windows were damaged and non functional   In one bedroom half of the window covering was missing   The beds were nice and clean   The main area rug and furniture were grungy  i e  it was vacuumed and dusted but also stained and worn  The building has significant challenges including urine and feces in the lobby  elevator and hallways   This happened each day we were there   The lobby was clean but the elevator and the area outside the elevator on floor    were never clean  they would just partially dry then new urine feces would be present the next day   Main entrance security door not functional   Little or no security or housekeeping staff   Several barking and snarling dogs   Garbage chute and dumpster not maintained and garbage all over   Parking lot pedestrian entrance security not functional  No parking pass or fob in unit at check in and took     minutes to get one   This is exacerbated by further complicating the multi step process of getting in the unit and getting ones car parked   Window coverings on all three windows were damaged and non functional   In one bedroom half of the window covering was missing   The beds were nice and clean   The main area rug and furniture were grungy  i e  it was vacuumed and dusted but also stained and worn 
416588299992540836,No free parking        great location The bathtub backs up and needs to be snaked or plunged  filter in AC needs changed  When you advertise     night and it ends up being       thats very misleading  And the parking situation needs to be said Up Front  not after Ive already paid for it  because that added more  
410795323784027518,We had to call literally    times but we finally got a hold of someone on the   th try  the original passcode given was wrong and we were giving so many wrong pass codes after before getting a correct one which kind of made us hesitant to leave afraid we would get locked out and not be able to get a hold of someone  Outside of the actual room we stayed in the building smells horrible  like urine 
409416308001109015,This was a bad stay for me  I expected to fully enjoy my weekend vacation  but yet found out that I would end up dealing with clear procedural failures of the property owners    On the Positive    the place was clean and welcoming  On the negative  Be prepared to find somewhere else to sleep if any situation happens to your room key  and you get to the facility during the off hours of the front desk attendant   After a night out on the town  my key FOB fell out of my pocket in the uber during the ride home  Shortly there after  my cell phone died  Thus I was limited to contacting the Zencity through the buildings call box  However  come to find out  the building has no front desk support  nor anyone available to let guest gain entry into the building  Therefore  using the call box  transfers you to other front desk attendants located in the apartment buildings near by  I attempted to call Zencity      times using the call box and received no reply  Finally I tried the front desk and was able to reach the   other nearby front desk workers  Who again noted  that they would be unable to  provide me access  One attendant was able to reach a Zencity representive on the hotel landline after I walked over there to meet him  Although  the rep was  sympathetic and understanding to my situation  he still could not provide me access to the building nor the room  The      on call building technician was called repeatable and never answered the phone  Thus  the only result for me to gain access to the building would be waiting until      am until the front desk representative got to work  This resulted in me sleeping on the sofa of the adjacent building for several hours until  am    When  am came  I approached the front desk which was able to open the lobby doors for me  but had no idea who can or how to access the spare room key   SN  I was finally able to charge my phone and confirmed the FOB was left in the Uber at this time  However  the driver would not be available until the afternoon to bring the key   The attendant contacted the      tech who finally picked up and came  However  for some reason he forgot to bring the key himself and I was told that he wont be back for an hour  Now its closing in on  am  and I was finally able to reach a Zencity rep over the phone who can provide me a solution  The rep was able to remotely open a lock box that for some magically reason no one else knew excised  and contained a secondary master key that would open my guest suite   Ultimately  this was a horrible stay for me  I will never stay with this provider  or do I recommend anyone else making that choice  Not negating my responsibility of losing the  key FOB temporarily  However  I did not foresee the only solution would be to sleep in a neighboring buildings sofa as the solution  It was one of the most embarrassing feelings watching people walk by possibility thinking who is this bum on the couch  knowing I paid a considerable amount for a bed  Furthermore  I happy that i attended this vacation by myself and not with my family  I cant even imagine paying for an AirBNB only to watch my kids sleep on a couch for hours because Zencity does not have a plan in place for lost keys   Lets be real  you can purchase a cheaper hotel and ensure at least they have a procedure in place to make accommodations for entry  at the minimum  unto the property    Like I said earlier the place was clean  but the service was beyond poorly planned and executed  Develop a process that allows people the ability to enter the facility and access the property
405060395372112854,Trust these reviews  Just dont book here  The unit was FILTHY  Hair on the bathroom walls  Toilette had a dirty ring  Dirty rags in the bathroom  Rug was FILTHY  Wall were filthy  Obvious ceiling leakage in the kitchen  The unit you see here is NOT the unit you get  The only plus is the location  Yall are dead wrong that place is filthy and those pictures are not of that unit

401414424379579121,The apartment appeared very similar to the photos posted   It was tidy and professional   However  it hadnt been properly clean   There was a significant amount of dirt  food scraps  crumbs  etc  on the main carpet and entry way  empty bottles of shampoo conditioner in the shower  and a lot of hair in the bathroom     I wasnt happy   I emailed management and they said they would send someone over to clean   Nobody ever came   To make matters worse  management sent me an email asking if I would like to pay      extra to have the space  freshened up    I expected it to be fresh in the first place   I shouldnt have to pay extra to have a clean space     The building is located right next to a hospital and extremely loud ambulances and sirens drove by all night long   I was shocked at how loud it was and had to wear ear plugs and keep the AC running to sleep through the night     Parking near the building was also a nightmare and added an additional headache and cost to the stay   I wouldnt stay there again or recommend it to a friend 
401348577714519732,My bf and I booked this during our drive to St  Louis  roadtripped east to west   nd stop  so excited to stay based on location and since it was labeled super host  When we arrived it was around       and the check in app didn t work door man had to give us a key  When we got up there it was absolutely gross  Stuff on the bed and floors  black hairs   Had taken pics and sent to zen city in which they only would refund me     of the clean fee which was literally only       I messaged regarding my concern again hence we didn t even stay there that night  And no response not even the small refund  Moral of the story I had to reach out to Airbnb directly  Poor communication I appreciate the efforts however your communication was awful and required me to go through air bnb directly  Very disappointed with what you considered clean and a fair refund 
399962045938654133,We did not enjoy our stay here  The bed was extremely uncomfortable and bedroom was very hot and customer service refused to help the AC issue  The building smells of smoke constantly  although a  non smoking  community  Appliances were not working and the window shades offered no privacy or light darkening  The d cor and location were nice  but not worth the other downfalls  We had an awful experience here  The bed was extremely uncomfortable   especially since the bedroom was not cooling properly  No one helped me when I complained regarding the cooling issue  Also  the washing machine and dishwasher were not working  The washing machine would start to run water then quit  the dishwasher would not close the compartment that the pod goes in  The hallways smelled bad of cigarette and marijuana smoke in the building  The blinds in the apartment do not provide privacy or block the light 
397108227618219405,This place was unclean 
397084702670784592,I had a terrible experience    Problems      The  smart  lock on the door was unable to lock itself  This left us with no way to lock the door from the outside  ZenCity had no solutions for this  no interest in helping us  and after an unbelievably Kafkaesque conversation with ZenCity we gave up  We had to take everything with us in our car the when we weren t in the apartment and just leave the apartment sitting unlocked the entire day       The washer was broken  In the midst of our   hour attempt to get ZenCity to do ANYTHING about the lock  we decided to wash some clothes  The washer filled with water and then promptly stopped  The dryer wouldn t turn on either  Now  we are sitting in an apartment we cannot lock with a washer full of soaked  dirty clothes  It was around this time that ZenCity stopped responding entirely  We had to wring our clothes out in the sink and go to the laundromat at the crack of dawn the next day    The short of it  the apartment is fine if everything works  But if it doesn t  no one will help you  And you will drive yourself crazy trying to get even a response from ZenCity  And after hours of sending messages  ruined clothes scattered around you  you will get a two sentence response like     Sorry to hear you are having trouble  Just know that this is not the usual experience of ZenCity guests    Well good for those other guests  Maybe they can come over and help me wring my dirty clothes into the sink 
395596908058192483,My wife and I took a family trip with our two small children to St  Louis  The place itself is not bad at all and its in a great location  However  it wasnt clean well and we had a particularly negative experience to mention  Our first night there as we were going to bed  I noticed a wet spot on my side  It was not wet on top where the comforter was  it was deep in the mattress and fitted sheet  I smelled it and it was definitely urine  Thankfully  I found a waterproof mattress cover in the closet and put it on  otherwise I would have been on the floor  My wife emailed the rental company that night and they got back with us the following day  They said they would clean the issue and have it taken care of that day  We came back that evening after being gone all day to find new sheets on the bed  However  the urine stain in the mattress had not been clean and was still wet and seeping through the new sheets  We called them back and asked for them to address the issue asap  They told us we could leave and get half off the second night  and still have to pay for the clean fee  but with two little kids and it being late  this was not an option for us  I put the mattress cover back on and we left the next day  I subsequently called their company at least   times and could never get through to a manager  They kept saying they were reviewing our complaints and after about   weeks  they were willing to give us a discount on our stay  The whole experience was quite unpleasant  I do appreciate them ultimately making things right but their communication with guests and ability to address problems is quite terrible 
395592082470553448,My stay would have been great if I was a ale to conduct business as usual during my stay  Not only did I not have Wifi  as listed   but I had to jump through hoops to contact customer service and when I did  they couldn t help  I didn t get a follow up until   am the following morning after sending a message at   pm    Elevator also didn t work so I had to climb up and down   flights of stairs with my luggage My stay would have been great if I was a ale to conduct business as usual during my stay  Not only did I not have Wifi  but I had to jump through hoops to contact customer service and when I did  they couldn t help  I didn t get a follow up until   am the following morning after sending a message at   pm 
394161655659142143,The elevators in the building can be expected not to work  The entire building is old and unmanaged  The trash by all other residents gets piled up by the only exterior door that works and you have to walk over it to get in the building  There is no parking that is offered by the tenant  The room is hot  one ac unit is not enough  It is close to everything in the central west end  but at the price point  I would have spent a significant amount more to have something nicer or I wouldve been happier in a hotel  I would highly suggest a better clean method  The amount of dirt and dust was outrageous  If you arent going to add an AC unit  I would suggest mentioning that the room can get quite hot  If its going to be the bare apartment that it is  at least have a luxury item so people have some things to overlook  Coffee  coffee pot  some decently comfortable seating  ect 
392749197746024366,Ive been using airbnb for years and this the worst experience Ive had this far   Zencity was absolutely awful at communication   The wifi didnt work and when I asked about it I got multiple different wifi networks with a different passwords every time they responded  none of them worked   I was never able to connect to wifi and missed out on work and money due to this   When I notified them of this and the fact I was filing a complaint they stopped responding completely until they gave me checkout directions   The place smelled like rotten eggs  there was throw up on the wall in the kitchen  and there werent any towels left to shower with   I had to go purchase towels to shower   Awful experience  do not stay here

560137753833391184,I wasn t very happy here  There s a smell in the building and lots of drug deals in the elevators and will take place regardless if you are there or not  The parking location is down a couple blocks and hard to access  There were roaches on the walls and on the cabinets  I sent pictures but no actions were taken and they weren t addressed via phone text or in the app until I followed up  I always have a good reviews so this is a first for me but wanted to let others know  Pretty disappointing overall   The shower head is not secure  there are roaches  I sent pictures  Lots of drug deals and smoking  The door to the patio doesn t have a lock  Seems like someone could drop climb the balcony but maybe that s just me  It was an odd feeling to know it was unlocked though  This was my second multi day stay with Zencity just this month 
768349281,Overall  our stay was a mixed experience  There are many great things about the unit  It is clean  well decorated  and well stocked with amenities  The location is central and there is great access to street parking  Further  the rooftop patio is wonderful   we ate many meals up there and admired the views of the city and the park  However  there was a very serious issue with our stay  When we turned on the oven  the apartment filled with gas  This not only meant that we were unable to cook  but it was also dangerous  Despite bringing the issue to the host s attention on the first night  it was not resolved at any point during our week long stay  Further  much of the communication we received from the host was irrelevant or unhelpful to solving the issue  We were disappointed with the inability to cook and concerned about safety  but had the issues been resolved we would have recommended the unit with enthusiasm  We really wanted to like this apartment  However  the broken and dangerous oven  alongside the lack of helpful communication and especially the lack of resolution of the issue meant that our stay was significantly negatively impacted  In the future  it is important to test and make sure that the appliances function prior to people coming to stay 
767272683,We were extremely disappointed by the apartment   It was very dirty and in a substandard condition   The amount of dust and dirt indicated that the apartment had not been properly clean for a substantial period of time   There was a large hole in a bathroom wall where there had been a plumbing repair  but no effort had been made to patch the wall   The blinds were broken and filthy  many of the mirrors are so old that you cannot properly see in them  the carpet is filthy and needs to be replaced  and much of the furniture is extremely worn and dirty   In addition  the pictures posted in the advertising by Zencity are of a different apartment and not this one    The apartment does not have cable as advertised but only offers Roku   The Wifi is problematic as it is often goes out   The only positive is the location of the apartment but this is of little solace  given its condition 
766674561,Awful service  Had to wait over an hour in the lobby as their check in instructions were incorrect  only to get a call back that there was a key at reception to which no one at front desk knew about  Lock didn t work properly for the rest of our stay despite advising Zencity 
764836595,All I can say is the furniture was what was in the picture  The place was filthy and in need of proper maintenance   They said they were sending maids  they didnt  The mgmt company is in California and hard to reach  does not flow up like they said  Listing is wrong with amenities  parking  etc  Im wondering who wrote the ad  if they have ever even visited the place    it was just the worst AirBnB 
763826154,for three nights it rained while I was in this Airbnb and because of the rain I really couldnt get out and enjoy the attractions around the city  the Airbnb television did not work the first night had to text and ask for someone to fix the television which wasnt fixed till the next day  and that really wouldnt be a problem if this wasnt portrayed as a five star establishment type Airbnb       for three nights not worth it  not worth it at all  then when I finally did get the television to work the next day at      in the afternoon I get a call from ZinCity telling me that someone was complaining about the music being too loud LOL now there is no external speakers in this hotel room I was only listening to the music on the television that was broken the day before  and due to the fact that I cant get out the apartment and enjoy the attractions Im listening to music in the apartment at      in the afternoon and someone complain       for three nights  again definitely not worth it stay away from this place unless youre an old couple coming to see a Cardinals game LOL for you guys to be charging as much as you do to stay in this Airbnb you need to accommodate a little more and be a little bit more open to people listening to music at      in the afternoon  we thought this was an Airbnb not a nursing home
762863724,I had a terrible experience with Zencity  Our shower was clogged for days and my family wasn t able to shower  They took forever to respond and had the audacity to try to charge me an extra      at the end of my stay  DO NOT stay here  You are so inconsiderate having the audacity to charge me      even when our shower was clogged for days and you didn t respond in a prompt manner 
762621025,Living space itself was well kept  Unfortunately when we went the neighbor was being evicted and had apparently left things in their apt  next door to rot   The smell was horrible and seeped into this Airbnb as well  Location is on the rough side of town  even when I asked for directions we were warned away and while waiting to use the entrance call box we were told by other residents not to stay out late in the area  This in conjunction with the parking space being at the other end of the block led us to cancel our stay 
761570837,Expect only a bed to sleep in and cool coffee table books   No customer service  no salt  pepper  coffee  inadequate soaps   Dont do it  The customer service with Zencity was vastly inconsistent with the usual customer service of AirBnBs  it was absent   I could not reach a person by phone and when using the phone prompts was cut off   There was no response to email messaging  When we entered until we left   days later the place held a mysterious sickly sweet odor  even with the window open all day   There were none of the amenities which would make the kitchen or bathroom really liveable   No salt and pepper  no coffee or tea  and only enough soap and shampoo for one shower   The coffee table books belied the quality and usual  but lacking  warmth of an AirBnB   I would not consider staying there again   BTW   after many dozens of stays globally  Ive never been so disappointed 
760652666,If you are looking for an easy  quick check in  THIS IS NOT THE PLACE  We got in late  were met with a code that did not work  and were unable to reach anyone through the number listed  The parking a is a   minute walk from the apartment building and the address is not accurate  In addition  bathroom and kitchen floors were sticky  However  if you don t care about any of that it is a convenient location  Some suggestions     Make the check in process less complex  We had difficulty with one of the codes working and therefore had to call  twice  with no response   In addition  the address of the entrance is not clear   address was on Olive St but actual entrance was not     Improve communication  We were unable to reach anyone when we had difficulty with check in  The number given brought us to an automated machine which was extremely unhelpful  especially at       at night      Provide a very explicit warning that the parking is a   minute walk from the place     improve clean  Shower floor and kitchen floor felt sticky
757539015,Positives   Great location  walking distance to many restaurants and barnes jewish hospital  for those who work there   Blackout curtains  comfortable bed   Negatives    Only street parking is available and you can only pay for two hours at a time so I received several parking tickets   Unit was dusty when I arrived but I also checked in a day late and the AC was on so it could ve just been the air filter   Almost halfway through my stay my washer broke and when I reached out to the host  my initial message went unread ignored so I had to follow up few more times to finally get a response  The maintenance request took a few days to be addressed  but then it broke again  The second time the maintenance guy came by  he said there was a major leak so I should not use it  This is extremely inconvenient bc I stayed a little over two weeks and I was unable to do laundry at all including my work scrubs  So by the time I checked out  I had to travel with a bag of dirty laundry to my new destination
757335244,It was hard getting in   out of this place   Oh   they only gave us one key card for   ppl  by the way it was super cold   Only have access to one tv   Well at least it was really clean Only one tv in living room   one key card for multiple guests  It s hard to get in   out of the parking area as well     it was really cold
756595826,Please read  If you like beautiful  neat and clean surroundings  this unit will disappoint  I could never recommend this place to anyone at the price I was charged for three nights  I stayed Thursday  th Sunday  th  so I got the weekend rate at      night in addition to the other three fees which brought my total to nearly       Allow me to tell you what I received for        There is no parking  so you have to park on street  We are fine with this  You have to enter three codes to get into the apartment  The second door requires a bit of force to get open   all the while it s buzzing annoyingly loudly    Upon entering  there is an awful stench  In the living room  the couch is horribly stained and the pillows flat and lifeless  My sister was going to sleep there but I wouldn t allow it  so I slept with my mom and let my sister take my room we were four total   This was not the plan for sleeping arrangements and was a major inconvenience to me  The blinds are almost all bent and broken   something we have never allowed in our homes  There are also no curtains  on any of the windows  There was tissue inside the second toilet and a jacket hanging on the chair in the first room  The back room door is broken and you can see inside the door  There is no lock and the door does not shut   The oven is so dirty and black with burnt food that wasn t scrubbed away for months  The kitchen trash can  fridge door  and stove tops were not wiped down properly  The floors were not properly clean  There were ants all over the apartment and mainly were seen in the kitchen around the sink and behind the toaster    The shower curtains were not clean  Both were stained and one of them had a spot of what appeared to be blood  The master bath soap dish in the shower had soap residue in it  the tub drained slowly and the sink drained even more slowly    The paint job on the walls is unacceptable  It bleeds onto the baseboards  The walls are also very dirty  Like someone with dirty hands touched them and no one bothered to wipe it off  There is also an uneven texture to the walls  It s not aesthetically pleasing in the least bit  Where the wall meets the floor  there is another lining that is not true base boarding  and it s falling apart and full of what appears to be wood dust    I have taken pictures of everything and will be in touch with the Resolution Center about the lack of cleanliness and poor condition of the apartment  I was mainly in communication with Alejandro and he gave me the runaround for three days and I was completely ignored for an entire day  He offered to send a cleaner over on Saturday at  pm and we were scheduled to leave the next morning at  am  We also had already clean and there was no point  I am pursuing a partial refund  which the  team of managers  has so far agreed to refund the     clean fee  We left the apartment clean and used our own sheets  Hopefully the apartment gets more than a ten minute clean job before the next guest  Please refer to past messages and read my full review  I ll put everything there  I m disappointed in the communication  I was clear and asked to have a productive discussion so we can handle matters in private  You all are well aware of what the unit looks like  so I was hoping for an honest discussion  but here we are   I complained because your unit is sloppily painted  the only couch is stained with God knows what  and your broken blinds have not been replaced  etc  Barely anything has been done to keep this unit aesthetically appealing for guests    My family and I all live in very beautifully decorated homes and the furniture is always clean  dusted and we would never leave up broken or bent blinds  This was upsetting and embarrassing to walk into  I ve lived in a historic home before and I ve visited dozens upon dozens as I am from Charleston  SC and many homes downtown are very old  but they are charming and beautifully renovated and kept up  so there is just no excuse    I feel you re attempting to get away with doing as little work as possible and it shows  It s carelessness  I will be sending in all pictures and pursuing the refund I requested 
755891372,Didnt check in until    pm    A M  before able to retire for the night  Only to be rudely woken by a representative of Zencity  asking me to confirm a   A M  check out at      the next morning  Calling back to back until I answered   i did not leave the room after entering the apartment  I paid for a room to shelter and rest after an   hour drive and a    a m  photo shoot that i needed to be well rested for in a room I purchased the until    A M   Please consider another BnB service if rest  respect and  appreciation for yourself and traveling companions is a priority   Didnt check in until    pm    A M  before able to retire for the night  Only to be rudely woken by a representative of Zencity  asking me to confirm a   A M  check out at      the next morning  Calling back to back until I answered   i did not leave the room after entering the apartment  I paid for a room to shelter and rest after an   hour drive and a    a m  photo shoot that i needed to be well rested for in a room I purchased the until    A M   Please consider another BnB service if rest  respect and  appreciation for yourself and traveling companions is a priority    id like compensation for the inconsiderate treatment as a guest of Zencity  
755628143,Very dirty found blood  and pee stains on beds  Blood spots on all sheets   the  new  sheets in the closet There was a hole in the wall and owner asked for permission to have the maintenance guy in the room and I said no but came back to the room and the hole in the wall was patched 
755096202,I m usually pretty flexible with Airbnb s and understand and don t rate very harshly  But I found this place disappointing  There was no hot water  and I was on a work trip for one night and needed a shower  that s pretty unacceptable     the floors were all super sticky  and just dingy overall    I shot them a message asking a question  and they didn t respond until after I had already checked out  After all fees this place wasn t worth       it s like a hotel room  but worse and the same price  Sorry
434802452466556430,There were A LOT of stains on surfaces  i e  the curtains   one of the sconces in the bedroom was broken  the blinds in the bedroom were broken  the kitchen faucet handle was broken  there was NO cold water  closet doors were off their track  we could not change the thermostat for the whole apartment  only able to control a window unit  and ended up having to have the bedroom window open just to keep at a decent temperature  There were A LOT of stains on surfaces  i e  the curtains   one of the sconces was broken  the blinds in the bedroom were broken  the kitchen faucet handle was broken  closet doors were off their track  and the fact that we could not change the thermostat for the whole apartment was absolutely ridiculous  We had to have the bedroom window open just to keep at a decent temperature  FIX YOUR PROPERTY
752392313,First I was a bit upset after I had rented this place for      a night and then see after I had rented it that the price had dropped down to     a night  i have screen shots     The location of the building was not in the location of the map provided  Was in a bad part of town which lots of gun shots were heard  If there was not a private parking lot I probably would not have stayed there   Building reeked of pot smoke all the time  I thought it was a non smoking building  People who had dogs allowed them to go to bathroom on the roof top patio  Nice seeing dog turds on the fake grass   The last night we stayed there which was a Monday night  Young folks had a party on the roof right above us that went until     am   Blaring music and screaming  In the morning the patio was littered with beer cans and wine bottles   The place was clean as advertised 
428887659327831464,It is a clean place but it is very confusing on how to enter the building to get the key fob  Luckily  there was another dude from Minnesota there to help out  Also  they claim that we are being too noisy which we are clearly not  There must be a sensor or something in the room  Last  there isn t any good onsite parking so you have to park far away or find a spot on the side of the street where you won t get towed  We will just get a motel next time with good parking 
750377504,By staying here  you run the risk of not being able to get into the room because you either do not receive check in instructions or the instructions you receive are incorrect  You also risk not having a safe place to park if the parking lot is full despite being promised a parking spot  We were told we would have one unassigned parking space  There were not enough parking spaces for all of the cars in the lot  We were instructed not to park on the street because we could get towed  We ended up parking in the parking lot in the driving lane  which was not a parking spot and put our car at risk of being hit by other cars  Someone else pulled into the parking lot after us and had to park in a handicap spot because there was no other option   The person was not handicapped  Door code provided didn t work  We had to stand around until someone left the building  which is not exactly safe to have people coming into the building though an open door I didn t realize this was a corporate run Airbnb  It was apparent once we arrived I had to ask for check in instructions  I didn t receive them until almost two hours after my check in time The price was listed reasonably but then with all the added fees  it was much more expensive than we had planned on paying
422968065983512439,We arrived at night and the checkin was easy  the place was nice and clean  We were happy with it  We were woken up early on the loud noise from the construction site right across from the apartment s windows  Contacted zencity and after many phone calls and messages they provided a list of their other apartments that I can relocate too  The problem is all we re booked and not available  After many calls and chat messages on the second day  I was told to cancel which I did and got back      out       Note   zincity knew about the construction site and noice  the are building a building next to the apartment and it has been going on for a while and will go on for a while too  I had to rent another apartment from Airbnb for an additional       Zincity is my black list and will not rent from them even if it is free  You are by far the worst host I ever had  You are money hungry and you do not care about your guests  You failed to report the the noise coming from the construction site right across from window  This is something you new about 
748324227,The location is convenient if you re interested in spending a day walking around or eating at the many restaurants  However  this stay was too expensive for what it was  The clean fee was     to fit the host s  obsessive standards  but there was plumbing issues with the bathroom sink and shower that could have been fixed with clean the drains  The Wifi was very laggy  and I felt the host wasn t considerate leaving only one towel for two adults  both registered for the stay   It may be beneficial to add either a filter on the facet or even just a cheap pitcher in the fridge for drinkable water  Too expensive of a clean fee for bathroom sink and shower drains to not work properly  WIFI lagged tremendously  Only one towel was provided for two adults 
747819996,This unit needs more attention to detail  The sofa is stained  the microwave didn t work  there was no coffee pot  there were dirty towels and tub ring in the shower  The clean tag showed it hadn t been tended to in a month and you can t adjust the air conditioning  which would be a problem in warmer weather  Otherwise  the location was nice and if the other issues were addressed  we d stay again  This unit needs more attention to detail  The sofa is stained  the microwave didn t work  there was no coffee pot there were dirty towels and tub ring in the shower  The clean tag showed it hadn t been tended to in a month  Microwave didn t work and there was no coffee pot  I have photos that show that apparently someone took a shower in one bathroom and left their wash towels and a ring in the tub  In the kitchen  the floor wasn t clean  The sofa cushions need a steam clean there are stains  According to the clean tag  the unit had not been clean for a month  Only communication was us being asked to turn the tv down  I can t imagine residents being asked to turn their tv s down  The microwave didn t work and there was no coffee pot  One bedroom door is  hollow  and open  you can see inside it  I have a photo that illustrates this 
746128699,Garbage place  garbage communication  Pictures are misleading  It s essentially a tenement apartment building with garbage all over it  someone had peed in the elevator  which was also covered in garbage   After our parking pass turned out to have no spot with the number on it and the landlord hadn t replied to and maybe hung up on several of our calls  we gave up and got a hotel elsewhere  I want a refund Area s gross  building s worse  We walked in  took one look  said this is gonna suck but we ll get through it  and then after our parking pass turned out to be to a nonexistent spot and the renter wouldn t respond  we got a hotel room in a better part of town  Again  front door broken open  no parking space with our number on it  no response to our calls  Very sketch  Lots of codes involved in the instructions but the door had been wrenched open and didn t require them  Lots of druggy looking folks coming and going  Elevator seemed to have been recently urinated in and was covered in trash  So disgusting I ate the hundred plus bucks they charged  ironically mostly in clean fees  and found a better place 
745656122,I would not stay here ever   It was very dirty   No parking   if there is it is very expense   Not what the picture looks like on site  Need to get a new clean team and do some maintenance   I well never stay there again   I well stay in a hotel  Parking was a nightmare    There was nothing said about the parking  There was a parking for the condo   Why dont you let renter use the card so many numbers to remember It was very dirty    I clean airbnb homes and I would not be able to leave it like it was   I took picture but they well not load on here    the stove would not work  we had to unplug and clean plug every time we used it   it would not stay on  need to do some maintenance on it   Showers where not good either need to work on them   Hardly anything to cook with but got by with what there was   The whole place need some TLC Just did not like For the cost it should of looked like the picture and let people know how much parking was and that a lot of the parking spots you could not go in and out and stay overnight
410857878910085119,Great room once inside  The check in process was horrible  We lucked out and met somebody who is staying on our floor that could let us in to the elevator and get us to our floor before getting our key   If we wouldn t have found them we would not have been able to get into the room  She also had a ZenCity Airbnb  She said it took her about two hours to check in  If they fix the check in process this would have been a five star review  We loved the room and the experience after the check in process  The directions to get into the room were unclear and also in accurate  The code we were given did not work  The only way we were able to successfully get into the room is because we happened to find somebody staying on the same floor as us since we needed a key fob to access the elevator  We got lucky bumping into another person staying there  If it wasn t for that person we would have never gotten to the room since there is no attendant in the lobby 
745412731,Honestly a nightmare experience  We arrived in the evening for a relaxing weekend getaway only to realize the apartment was not clean  Though it appeared tidy at first  we discovered that the bedding was covered in hair the floors had lots of dirt  dust  and hair  As we arrived in the evening and had no other accommodations  I spent over an hour stripping the bedding and picking hairs off the  clean  sets in the closet  The hosts couldnt be reached by phone  only by email  The next morning they emailed me saying someone would be by to clean  likely before  pm  we packed up all our stuff to make it easier for them to clean and went about our day  We arrived back that night only to find that no one had been by to clean  No explanation or response from the hosts  Even now  no one has responded about the situation nor the lack of follow through on their part  I am extremely disappointed and aggravated at my experience in this listing  The apartment was not clean and I spent more than an hour picking pubic hairs off of the  clean  sets of bedding in the closet  because the set already on the bed was disgusting and COVERED in hair   The sheets were wrinkled in a certain way that almost seems like they hadnt been changed at all after the previous guest  The floors and carpets had dirt and hairballs  I was told by Zencity that someone would come clean  likely before  pm   We gave them all day  No one came  Once again  we arrived  for the  nd night in a row  to a dirty apartment during what was supposed to be a relaxing getaway  I reached out to explain that no one showed up to clean and recieved no response  no explanation  nor an apology  I still have yet to get any response  The host said they would send someone to clean and they did not  The actual apartment inside the building was a bit difficult to find based on the instructions  The place was tidy  but the floors were visibly dirty  dirt and hair  and the bedding was a nightmare  The bedroom carpet had numerous large hairballs  There were     hairs  mainly pubic hairs  all over the sheets  comforter  and pillows  In combination with this  the sheets were very wrinkly in areas where they would be if someone had slept there and not changed the sheets  I spent at least an hour late at night when we arrived picking a strangers pubic hair off of the  clean  sets of bedding that were in the closet  Very difficult to reach host  Slow responses  if any  Promised to send cleaners and did not  Plenty of ovenware but no potholders  Bathroom sink was very difficult to use as the faucet was way too close to the counter 
744132789,It would have been ok if I would have had a place to park  if I had been able to enjoy music with my adult grandchildren  only   of them  and movies instead of getting messages about loudness when it was normal and when I arrived there was music blasting but when I entered my space I could barely hear it and that wasn t a problem  It just wasn t what I was use to  I meet them twice a year and this was my first at this place and I won t be returning  Couldn t enter upon arrival  No parking at night  Couldn t play tv loud enough to hear or music  I m in my   s hearing is not superb  Got a message to not park in handicap and I have handicap plates and a sticker
742657189,Strong discourage anyone from renting this unit  The unit stinks of stale cigarettes and marijuana smoke  Nothing felt clean  The walls are paper thin and the neighbors party and fight constantly  There was a dog that wouldn t stop barking  The door lock is improperly installed  The floor sounded like you were walking on a sound generator from a horror flick  The bathroom looked like it was designed for hospice and the toilet seat was broken  We tried cancelling our stay the moment we walked in  fully prepared to drive the   hours back home we had just driven  but Airbnb could not reach the host  We left the next day and cancelled the rest of our   day holiday  No one should ever rent this unit again  Entire unit felt  grimey   Smoke smell was on everything in the unit  Unit is neighbored by awful neighbors 
402181751369410737,Cons  Older building which has people living in the units  so management does not like people staying there through AirBnb  No direct communication through ZenCity before arriving  Questions were not answered  The check in process given was faulty and incorrect   A security guard had to let us in after some time of waiting in the vestibule  No toaster or kitchen towels  Few eating utensils  Horrible smell permeated the unit and building because on ongoing construction in adjacent building    Pros   Older building    was a hotel with Art Deco style  which was very cool  Bed and pillows were comfortable Towels were fluffy and soft  Would not recommend Hello   I am requesting that half of our stay be reimbursed  Please respond that you have received this message  From the very start  I had no direct communication with Zencity about the rental  I had asked questions through the app after booking before arriving that were never answered  The only responses were about check in and rules  My questions were never answered  The check in procedures were not correct and we were stuck in the vestibule with no way to enter the building or the unit  I tried calling but no one answered  We were about ready to spend the night on the ground in the vestibule   it was after midnight when checking in as our flights had been delayed   and we were rescued by a security guard who happened to be walking by and was able to allow us access  Once we got in and were able to use the key card  all seemed fine  You do need to know that the directions in using the keypad DO NOT WORK    The security guard even told us that the keypad is faulty  Even he tried the keypad and it would not work with the sent directions   On the day before check out  a strange and horrible smell started to enter the unit  It smelled like nail polish remover times     It started to burn our nose and throats  The hall did not smell  but the lobby and and elevators did  Our next door neighbor  who lives in the building  was also experiencing this smell  We were told that there was construction going on in the connected building and that the smell would dissipate  I called ZenCity and spoke to Karen  who seemed to want to help but didnt seem to really know what to do except call her manager supervisor  She never followed up with me about these calls  even though she said she would  We left the unit for several hours hoping it would be better when we returned for the last night in the unit  When we got back  the smell was even worse and the lobby seemed filled with a haze  It was intolerable  There was no way we could sleep in such a situation  I called ZenCity again  asked to speak to Karen  who had left and the person on the phone was able to offer money back for one night   We are still waiting to see if this happens  I have had refunds from AirBnb before  and they are very quick  if not instant  I was told      days  which seems suspect given my experience at other times  We had the inconvenience of needing to find a hotel for one night  which was more expensive and very inconvenient as we had to pack up  move locations  and unpack for only one night  At added expense  which was not counted upon for this trip  This inconvenience needs to be compensated  I am requesting that half of our stay be reimbursed  Please respond that you have received this message 
402144634257794923,Please be careful about booking your stay at this place  The listing states that there is a rooftop but that is a complete lie  My friends and I booked this place in order to have an outdoor space to enjoy and meet friends that are nervous about being in doors with COVID and we felt very let down by this listing  Prior to the booking we contacted the host company and I was told there was a roof top area for the building  Upon arrival and further communication with the host we were informed that this information was not true  Also the way in which the guest acquires the keys to the unit is very confusing and takes time to figure out  It is not user friendly at all  AirnBnB management will be notified about your false advertising 
741078738,This is an affordable apt building  there were trash bags and trash in front of the apt door  Also the apt has a strong cigar smell  Loud neighbors  I ended up not staying there  host didnt give me full refund  in times of Covid this building is not prepared for health safety  this is an affordable complex for elderly people it was difficult to find and the code plus speaking didnt work the common areas had trash bags and trash in front of the apt door  it is too expensive for the type of building
400714053609429884,Arrived and followed instructions for check in  but the apartment FOB was not in the apartment  This is a problem because without the FOB you cannot use the private parking  you can only enter and exit the apartment building from the front door by entering a code  and you can only enter the apartment by using a different and much longer code  Having a small child with us made all of this much more inconvenient  Plus  who knows where the FOB was  It didnt make me feel confident in our security that the last users may be walking around the city with the FOB to our rental   Communication about the missing FOB was extremely poor  First message went unanswered  after a second message hours later  we were told the FOB would be delivered  as soon as possible   That was the last we heard about the FOB  we checked out five days later without ever receiving it  or ever receiving an update   The whole thing was a pretty bad experience  and I would never book from this group again 
399994271853046732,Run away from Zencity    This management company is a joke  The apartment required use of a call box in the foyer to gain access to the building  It was broken  so entry was impossible  They suggested having a resident let us in  that works great if you can find one  and whos going to do that at      in the morning after an evening out  They made zero effort to fix the issue throughout the weekend and we ended up on the floor of my daughters tiny apartment  They were very slow to refund a partial amount  then sent a checkout message with an attached bill for an additional       Airbnb has done very little to advocate for my wife and I throughout this mess  Very disappointed as a consumer and shareholder  Sell sell sell     This is a disaster  The call box that is required tho gain entrance to the building does not work  I used the Airbnb chat function without reply  so I called the commercial number  Fortunately  after being on hold for a bit  Francis  picked up  His suggestion was to find a resident of the building to let us in and that they have been having issues with this call box for several weeks  Yet no one tried to communicate that beforehand  It was a complete disaster  We had to sleep in the floor of my kids tiny apartment  No effort was made to correct the issue throughout the weekend  Then the icing on the cake is that I got an email saying it was time to check out and there was another      charge   I NEVER SET FOOT IN THE APARTMENT         Your  service  is terrible  thank you for the stiff neck from sleeping on the floor 
399926417169251130,Let me start by saing checking in was a nightmare  It took us literally two hours to find a key they  placed  in a keybox  in the end there was no key in the key box  So they asked us to go to the room and check if ths door was open  we went up to the room and the door was open  the room was not clean there was trash all over the place  bedroom was a mess as well  so they told us all they could do for this ome night is relocate us to another building  so they relocated us to another building  We HAD TO WALK through kc to another location not only that they seemed to give me attitude about the fact that they had to relocate me and on top of that the relocation was only for that one night since i was going to return to the original room I booked once they actually clean it  The next day when i return to the room i dealt with the same issues again  and it was about half an hour until i was able to retrieve a key from this ridiculous key box  when we finally made it up to the rolm realize the door was not even capable of locking I sent them a message and they never got back to me about it  so I spent the whole trip taking my bags with me in and out so that i was sure they were not stolen  they also never got back to me about the door never locking  literally was ths worst booking experiance of my life  I highly do not recommend  on top of that small things like Old dirty dishes  no air filter on the ac that bothered me quite a bit  Never use zen city  thank you for communicating me the first night but I felt I could not trust you after I told you the door cannot even lock and you guys never contacted me back about it 
392023302329709668,I would be cautious to stay here  I arrived and never received the appropriate key card to enter the building and the gym  I was able to get a code for the exterior door  but was never able to access the amenities  even after communicating this issue to the renter several times on multiple days  The apartment had not successfully been clean and was dusty with dead flies in the window sills and the floor dirty  The toilet did not work appropriately and was never fixed during my stay   I had to go to the lobby to use the bathroom  There was also no hot water for the shower  which was also never fixed  I communicated all of this to the renter via Airbnb messaging and phone calls multiple times and they never fixed any of the issues  When you make commitments to communicate with guests  please keep them  You told me you would communicate to me what my refund would be  then never responded
391242754663117274,Cleaning staff returned the key   min after check in to the lockbox  was not masked  unit did not look like it was actually clean  air conditioner for room and living area was not adjustable  sofa back looked like it was broken and was not properly fixed assembled  no coffee pot or basic hotel Airbnb amenities  fob did not consistently work for the door  booked for a week stayed one night and cancelled and left the following day  first bad experience with an Airbnb after using for years 
389779075129777751,the bed is all messed up cheep frame pretty much slept on the floor there was literally no remote to the tvs I told support they no remote untill I left pretty didnt even stay my last night because i was uncomfortable nosy up rooftop party the bed is all messed up cheep frame pretty much slept on the floor there was literally no remote to the tvs I told support they no remote untill I left pretty didnt even stay my last night because i was uncomfortable
769272129,Not recommended  Check in is horrible  The machine does not work  And the code to get the key is invalid  Response is so slow  It took    minutes for them to confirm that the code is invalid because of the key is not there for pickup  And another     minutes for them to figure out a way to get me the backup key  I think this should be all set before the check in and they definitely can notice this issue earlier and fix it  Parking is also not easy and they did not mention it in the listing  instead they said free parking is available  And they will message you a picture with only     free street parking spots which is a few minutes away  And it is first come first served  So you probably have to pay for the street parking yourself  What s worse  the street parking usually has     hours limit  Host usually reply the message after   day or just ignore your message  You can expect your questions to be answered only if you call them and wait for a few minutes for them to answer the phone  Or keep asking the same question for a few times and wait for at least a day to get answered 
769032685,Zencity provides  terrible  customer service   The electronic lock of my apartment door would not lock  and after repeated  unanswered requests for assistance  I gave up and found other lodging     No refund  no assistance  no communication  no help  no apology  nothing  I have repeatedly tried to communicate with you  with no response from you   I had to vacate my apartment early because the front door electronic lock did not work   I have requested a refund of the last two nights of my stay  because I had left  and yet again no response    Youll be happy to learn that I am now traveling to the cities where you operate on a weekly basis   I used your apartment as a trial to decide if you would be my housing provider   You wont be 
768951166,Beautiful place clouded by inaccurate  information and urine soaked sheets    I booked a month long stay in this Airbnb  Prior to arrival  I messaged the host and asked if parking and the gym would be included  They assured me that both would be free for my stay  Upon arrival I was disappointed to find that in reality  neither of these amenities we re available  I had to spend an additional      lining up separate parking and finding a comparable gym   Additionally  the place was not clean  There was hair all over the ground and in the carpet  If you do decide to stay at this Airbnb  look at the mattress and comforter that they give you  Both are covered in urine  I took some pictures but I do not believe that I m able to post them here on Airbnb  I would highly consider staying somewhere else  I have friends staying in other Airbnb s in the power and light district  These places are just as nice and quite a bit cheaper  For the price you pay this place simply is not worth it 
768686849,It was a nice room  but I couldn t access it without the assistance of other people  which is frustrating during a night check in  We never got a key and scheduled to stay for   days   There was food crumbs under a coach pillow  a fork in the disposal  and we ran out of hot water once  I m not picky  but anyone reading this may want to know this if they have high expectations   I was not happy with my stay because I couldn t access the room I paid for without doing something strange  The problem was never corrected because they probably manage multiple properties and I am one person with one problem  Room should have a keycard Ran out of hot water on day   at night  but it wasn t a big issue  May be to someone else  There was food or something behind the coach seats  There was a fork in the disposal for some reason  The room is pretty nice  I wouldve stayed there if I could ve accessed the room without assistance from someone else
767841112,The apartment was nice and had perfect space for two people  It also had a fully working kitchen  including stove  oven  refrigerator and dishwasher  which was great  But overall we ended up having a bad experience  One of the main reasons we picked this listing was because it offered access to a washer and dryer  The key fob we got did not work on the door to the washer and dryer  Neither did it work on the door to the gym  We reached out to Zencity and they said they tried to reach out to the apartment management but got no response  They were not able to get us fresh sheets  towels  etc  despite this inconvenience either  Sometimes it was hard to reach them as responding to messages sent on Airbnb was slow and calling them resulted in long wait times  Also looks like calls are not well documented on their end because we first talked to one of the agents on the phone who said she will look into providing a reimbursement for the inconvenience caused  But next day  another agent said that they have no record of such a conversation  The space itself is fine  but I would not recommend this listing due to the poor customer service  I believe all the issues experienced are already documented over the messages that were sent on Airbnb  But basically it was the lack of access to the washer and dryer and lack of or slow response to questions 
764916412,This rental is owned by a very large company  reducing this to sort of a Residence Inn  but without any phone or on site support  not to mention an Escape Room like check in      Got a problem with check in   Stand there in the hall and email them     Now beyond that the clean was hot and miss   Candy wrappers on the floor  crumbs in fridge  personal lubricant in bedroom  etc    The TV remote did not work   The Internet would not stay connected   no fix it was a weekend    The neighborhood is rather iffy at night   And noisy   The unit is across the street from a night club that blasted music with the door open  And all guests there were frisked on the way in  Yeah that kind of place    The unit itself was actually pretty decent  Nice view  well laid out and nicely decorated    It is about an easy   mile walk from Westport  the Plaza and the museum   And close to     so good location to get in and out of town    But no off street parking and during the week that is an issue with parking rules in effect    Zen City as an organization is clearly highly dysfunctional  A shame  This unit has potential  For the love of God  make it easy to make a phone call to you 
763472996,At first  Zencity was just fine  I was able to check in easily  I was a little frustrated that there wasnt a key to use for the door  just a   digit code  but I got over that  What I couldnt get over was the long curly hair that was all over the bathroom floor  For reference  I have short straight hair  I sent them a picture of it the first night I was there and requested a credit for the clean fee  They questioned whether or not it was from me and eventually offered me a       credit  Customer service  while responsive  was a different person every time  They just dont have the same human touch that you get from someone who cares  I didnt leave scarred or anything  but I will avoid them in the future  The property was not clean and Ive been ignored in my requests for a refund of the clean fee 
761574435,I ve never written a negative review for an Airbnb before but my experience with Zencity was poor   When using Airbnb I expect small mishaps to occur  check in problems  something missing  etc   as it s part of travel and it s never materially affected my experience til I rented from Zencity  My fianc e and I were working from the building during the week and the WiFi was unusable  readings at several times were     mps download and    upload   It occasionally did work at a rate of roughly   MPs download and    upload but these times were unpredictable and lasted for under an hour and communication with Zencity was incredibly poor  I reached out several times to Zencity during the week regarding the WiFi problems and only occasionally received a response and no solution  The WiFi they gave us was the lobby WiFi which has its password posted in the lobby  There s a separate WiFi for residents that Zencity was not able to provide us  Upon leaving we mentioned our WiFi issues to one of the small restaurants in the building  all of which are great and I would recommend  and they said it was a known issue  The actual apartment was fine  the restaurants in walking distance were good  however having no internet connectivity is a deal breaker for me  and I would guess many others  at an Airbnb that mentions having WiFi 
760688724,This place is terrible they charge you allot for clean fees and the place is clean half fast with hair on pillos and foot prints on coffee table etc  I don recommend this guys at all  This  guys need to do something about the cleanness of their apartments  So far I love the locations and the buildings but the  quality on customer service and clean place  is very poor even though We pay a very large amount as a clean fee when the places is clean half fast  Also I m a repeat customer and a business man that have use their properties many times and I got back no respect so they  have lost a loyal customer and I ll make sure my colleagues don t use their properties  You guys need to do something about the cleanness of your apartments  So far I love the location and the building but your quality on customer service and clean please is very poor even though I pay a very large amount as a clean fee when the places a clean half fast  Also I m a repeat customer and a business man that have use your properties many times and I got back no respect so you have lost a loyal customer and I ll make sure my colleagues don use your properties 
759118899,Check in was chaotic because the intercom was broken so everything in the building was locked  including elevator access  Zencity  couldnt get a hold of the building manager  so we pretty much fended for ourselves for an hour to even reach our apartment  There was also no assigned or reserved parking for guests  The intercom was disabled so we couldnt even buzz in or use the elevator until a tenant just happened to walk by Said they would call back but only communicated with me through texts No parking provided by building
755366642,Was the absolute worst AirBNB experiencE I ve ever had  I couldn t gain entrance to the building because the apartment number wasn t in the call box  Then couldn t get to my floor due to no key fob  Had to take the stairs to the  th floor  Once in the room I was informed that the key fob was in the room but it wasn t  When I contacted customer service they took forever to respond which led me to not be able to go to work that night because I wouldn t have had any way back in the building  So I was stuck in the building all day and night because they didn t get back to until the next day  After asking for a refund things started happening but still not in a timely fashion  After  pm the next day I finally got a key fob  Never again will AirBNB with this company  Make issues a priority  Call box didn t have apt number in it so I couldn t get in the building until someone let me in  Took forever to respond to my immediate issues 
753498953,I wish I could give an accurate description of this stay but I was not able to access the apartment and therefore didnt stay  The codes that Zencity sends in the instructions for access to the apartment did not work  After contacting a Zencity representative  she was not able to to get the access to work either and promised a full return from Zencity  I am still awaiting return from Zencity and response from Airbnb  I am still waiting for a full refund from Zencity for inability to stay at the Airbnb because I wasnt able to gain access as the codes were invalid and when talking with a representative  she was unable to help and therefore we were not able to stay at the Airbnb  Unable to access I was given instructions to access apartment that were invalid and spoke with a member of Zencity that was unable to help as well Didnt get to assess because I wasnt allowed into the apartment
753354758,broken bed frame refused to fix properly the cleaners are rude and not good at their job broken bed refused to fix and only one key with SOOOO MANY DOORS TO GET THROUGH I was locked out so many times unable to get in for hours
750763350,Key fob was not in the room as promised and we were given an incorrect access code for the building  otherwise it was a decent place  The key fob for the front door  gym and elevator was not present in the room upon arrival  That alone prevented us from utilizing most of the perks of the place  and we couldnt really leave our room because the access code to the front door and elevator did not work  It would have been fine of we had the key fob  We were given the wrong code for the door  They did not get back to us until   in the morning with a potentially correct code 
750584625,I do not recommend staying here  I could not access my own unit until another resident of the apartments helped me in and used their fob to use the elevator  They took forever to respond  And then there was supposed to be a fob in my room so I could leave and come back as I wanted  There was no fob and they never got me one  My pregnant girlfriend and I were unable to leave because we would not have been able to get back in    I also talked to   other groups of visitors that were coming through zencity and they were also experiencing just as many frustrations  I was unable to get into my unit because their instructions on getting in did not work  The intercom and code did not work  After over an hour of not being able to get in  they set up another code for me to get in and that still didn t work  The floor was sticky and there were dirty utensils in the drawer 
748943237,We had a total of   people with no music getting noise complaints  We kept volume to a minimum  Left the same day in case of additional charges for noise because we wanted to be respectful  Overall disappointed we couldn t stay at the place I purchased  We had a total of   people with no music getting noise complaints  We kept volume to a minimum  Left the same day in case of additional charges for noise because we wanted to be respectful  Overall disappointed we couldn t stay at the place I purchased 
748501448,location is nice  bed was comfy  other than that the rooms seemed unclean towels were out of place and smelled dirty  also hair on sink and tub
748367538,Room was not clean and not equipped as advertised  Floor hadn t been vacuumed  Trash under the bed and dresser  Hairs on the sheets and towels  No duvet on the bed  no extra blankets  No coffee maker    Rooftop area is not as pictured  no cushions on seats  Both the rooftop bar and the lobby are still under construction and I never saw anyone at the front desk    Messaged the company through airbnb at   pm upon arrival and at   am the next day still had no response  Both times I called I was out on hold for    minutes before someone spoke to me and then there was no clear timeline on when the issues would be addressed  Ended up asking for a refund and leaving two days early  Would not recommend  Not inspecting the room before checkin  During Covid  Really   The lack of clean and the lack of communication were both infuriating  I didn t feel safe or comfortable during my stay  Please get housekeepers who thoroughly clean and have your manager inspect the rooms before arrival and please please answer the phone promptly instead of routinely having a    minute  hold  time before you even speak to a guest  Disgusted and disappointed  Rooftop was not as pictured  no cushions on chairs and no instructions on how to access  No signage on property to direct either  Hairs on both sheets and towels  Stains on pillowcase  Makeup stain on wall in shower  No can liner in bathroom trash can  Floors not vacuumed  Trash on floor under bed and dresser  Messaged the host through AirBnb immediately on arrival about the apartment not being clean at   pm and at   am the following day I still did not have a response  Called twice to try to get the apartment clean and both times I was on hold for    minutes before someone answered the phone  Apartment not as pictured  No duvet on the bed  no extra blankets or pillows  No soap in the bathroom  Coffee maker incomplete so it didn t work  Apartment not clean upon arrival  Host hard to reach  Will not be staying again  don t bother coming here 
747966333,Waited an hour upon arrival for the apartment to be clean from the previous guest  The host said he would make a few adjustments to the trip to accommodate but there was no follow through after that  I spoke to   different  managers  of the property and they were responsive but not helpful  I do NOT recommend staying here  Host Cleaning lady was an hour late  The host was responsive but unhelpful 
747838526,good location   however this felt like an overpriced hotel room with complicated entry and subpar amenities  check in was difficult   the intercom outside to get in was finicky and didnt understand us well   there was no fob inside of the room to get in easier  the bathroom door handle fell off as soon as we got inside   bad lighting and several of the outlets didnt work  intercom didnt register our voice very well  felt like an expensive hotel room   not very homey
746594978,Probably not the best place to book  First room I showed up to wasn t clean  so the put me in a second room  which smelled like cigarette smoke  Third room was finally ok  They upgraded me to a bigger room for the trouble  Room was a little dirty and there was definitely a lack of homey ness  This place would probably be fine for a business trip or if you don t plan to spend a lot of time in the actual room  Place is in a good location too 
744076658,No communication at all   Wrong key code delayed my check in about a hour and the worst part I was woken up by pest control at    am on my second day there and they came in and sprayed while I was there in a studio   Messaged the host and told him what happen he responded asking if they sprayed I told him yes and also let him know that me and my guest left and he never responded I even messaged again later that day after I had to go check in at a hotel and he never responded  Then finally on my check out day he sent me a message saying he hoped I enjoyed my stay  No communication at all Wrong information waited about    minutes till I actually got the key Old soap marks in bath tub left Did not respond Second day I was woken up to pest control at    am and they sprayed pest control while I was there
743796476,This far the worst AirBnB experience we have had    The description was wrong  and clearly this host has no quality control or check in  check out process to ensure this place is setup    No coffee maker   There was a French press  but no way to boil water    Not even a pot or kettle    We finally got a kettle after many messages    No cable Tv  Only Roku    No forks  we got some day     No designated work area      Dining table has only   chair    We only had   towels    hand towel    No oven mitts  basically you can t cook in this place   There is only   key   huge inconvenience    They keychain was a plastic straw     The bottom line in my opinion is that this is why some cities hate Airbnb    This isn t someone renting their home or subsiding their vacation home     This is a company whose mission is to complete  badly  with hotels     I would avoid ZenCity in all of their locations  Find a new business It too far too long to get responses and it was clearly nobody read what we said
742152406,YOU WILL BE SORRY if you book this loud dump at Roasters Block   Valet  trash stinking up the hallways for days at a time   RB issue not zen city s   Parking is not included although  zen city  will claim that it is  Rude residents slamming wrought iron pool gates throughout day and night  You ll need to bring your own detergents to clean clothes and dishes   I did   Boy Scout motto   always be prepared  Avoid this place like the plague  In case you insist to try it out be sure to remove the hidden listening device  I certainly did  Don t say you were never told  Worst ABB ever  I ll gladly spend more on a true hotel room then ever book a  zencity  property in KC St  Louis or Chicago   Nothing zen about it  Disingenuous and fraudulent  I never leave a property without clean up after myself  see the reviews of me as a ABB guest prior this until now  Was no point to do so  You should fire  kristy  the maid and take your listening device with you  Nothing  zen  about it  Parking pass that was stated to be included was nowhere to be found  Because  zencity  fraudulently claimed parking was included when in fact it was NOT  They attempted to state they were  sorry for the confusion  when truly only zencity is the confused clowns  Then they tried to con me into paying over a         extra    night stay  for parking several blocks away    NO THANKS     Pictures shown were of another unit altogether of similar layout   Parking Included  was a total lie and responses were condescending  Filled with dirt and body hairs that weren t mine  Disgusting    Place stank like vomit  Left the windows open the whole time  Faceless Boston based flunkies   internet company  allowed unit not to be remotely clean although chalkboard note stated that it was  Pandemic has every corporation claiming to be throughly sanitizing every thing but dirt was evident on every surface with a quarter inch of nasty dust nearly everywhere in this downtown  loft   BRUTAL Sloppy Well it was where they said it was  Right on Broadway  Loud as hell  racing cars  sirens all night every night  to be somewhat expected I guess as it is downtown  The loft building Roasters Block allows this unit to be used for AirBB because they cannot least if long term as anyone staying there hears nothing but slamming iron gates all day and night as it faces the pool courtyard  Pool was not open btw as it was last week of winter first week of spring  The Five people that congregated by the pool sounded like a riot gone wrong    nd floor right above stereo speakers made it worse  People who have rented it for a year have broken thief lease to get out 
741579687,The place is not clean  Communication with the host is poor  I sent my concerns as soon as I checked in along with photos of the unclean areas  they offered to send out a house keeper the next day but one never came to clean and the host stop replying to my messages at that point  Photos are enhanced  Bed slept ok  Apartment complex is old  The place needs a new vacuum cleaner and the sofa needs shampooed Floors needs vacuumed  tub needed scrubbed  oven is filthy  sofa has stains and ash on it  surface tops sticky Responded to my first message about the concern on the cleanliness of the place  then stopped replying  said they would send someone the next day and never did
741571260,I d rate this a     Only thing good about the place is  Great location   nice place   The Airbnb we booked said it came with parking   Once we arrived they informed us that it doesn t include any parking   They just forgot to update their website   That was a little annoying    Main thing we look for is parking included    We drove around for awhile to find street parking    Also another thing   you can literally hear everything happening around you    Rooms very nice as shown in photos    If you don t mind hearing everything around you   maybe not getting a promised parking spot this is your place  Update your website for accurate agreements   You could hear literally everything   Place was nice at least Site said parking but actually wasn t available  Update your website information  People book with parking included  Kinda confusing when the person helping you out doesn t live in the state we re staying in   Also have a back up plan when things go wrong 
555066079611721310,This unit looks good in pictures but the building it is located in is really not nice  There was trash all over the grounds including the entryway and elevators  The hallways smelled horrible and the smell leaks through the door into the unit    Zencity staff are very responsive via messaging but there s no way to tell via this listing how rough the location of this unit is  We will not stay here again  We were really disappointed with how much worse this unit was compared to the photos and description on air bnb    The apartment grounds had trash spread all over the grass outside  entryway and elevators  The hallways smelled awful and the smell leaked through the door to our unit    When we arrived  half the lights in the building didn t work  The sheets had stains on them and the unit was clearly very old    We didn t feel very safe in this location either    The listing doesn t address the roughness of the building or the area and we would not recommend this unit to anyone else 
554381501648889646,The bed was really comfortable and it was very close to where I needed to be but they charged me     for a dirty sink that was there before I got there The bed was really comfortable and it was very close to where I needed to be but they charged me     for a dirty sink that was there before I got there
497889865161733681,My car was stolen while parked in front of the entrance   This listing does not include parking in the garage or gated area   I should ve NEVER stayed here   What a mess  My car was stolen while parked in front of the building   Right next to the entrance   Unacceptable   
744687767,We had an issue with parking  If you book here  make sure you get your correct parking spot that is assigned to your room  Obviously we were disappointed in the stay  I hadnt mentioned to you yet that there was no hot water  The parking situation was frustrating to say the least  It definitely could have been prevented  I appreciate the gesture of reimbursement but it still didnt cover the cost of the tow and theres no way you could compensate for me not being able to get to work on the morning that it was towed  the time and resources it took for me to find where my truck was and go get it  It was      and they only accept cash  Im trying to communicate this to as directly and straight forward as possible without being unreasonable  I hate to say this was by far the worst Air B B experience I have had  I ill not post that publicly though 
744609744,This was a disappointing stay  We were supposed to stay   nights but left after the first night because the place was so dirty   We feel like this was falsely advertised for its cleanliness and the reviews all talked about how clean it was too  The place was dirty in a way that felt like it hadnt been deep clean ever  We reached out to the owners and they did respond and offer to have it clean for us but it wasnt one thing that was dirty  We felt too uncomfortable there to stay another night  The whole place was dirty  The description talked about how clean it was and that they were doing extra clean because of COVID  I feel like the reviews are false too because they all talk about it being clean and it was NOT   It was dirty in a way that shows it is not clean well ever   We actually left after the first night because we of the dirt 
504468560596773211,Gross  This place literally wreaked of human feces  It filled the lower floors and slowly the upstairs  We left because of how bad the stench was  We tried multiple times for them to make it right and refund us  even brought in Airbnb  they couldn t be bothered to respond in a timely way  They also wouldn t respond to Airbnb outreach  DO NOT STAY HERE  Or if you do  go in eyes wide open  You re paying for the photos  not the accommodations  Stay away    Worst experience ever  You should be ashamed of yourselves for how bad the smell was  how bad your communication is  and your inability to connect with Airbnb  Literally  if will disparage your company any chance I get 
744094927,Bathroom had a terrible odor  hair on pillows  dirty counters 
552857602859072002,Stay away from this place dont spend your money here very very outdated no Central air   The radiators made noise the entire time I was there  No sleep bed was not comfortable bathroom was disgusting they need to replace the sink and the bathtub and the flooring in the kitchen and the bathroom  I took us over   hours to get into the unit because the keypad was not working properly and no maintenance to help  We were sweating our butts off the first two days we were there because we could not figure out the radiators and no maintenance to help us The last day we were there they wouldnt come on at all so we froze and they constantly made loud annoying noises  The dishwasher is sticking out in the middle of the kitchen because it was not installed properly  The freezer and fridge were dirty and rusted Soooo many issues  This property needs major updates  unit is very outdated  radiators were too hot and couldnt figure them out and last night they didnt work at all  radiators were constantly making loud noises dishwasher needs to be installed properly  bed not comfortable  need dresser in bedroom  need new flooring in kitchen and bathroom and tub and sink need to be replaced in bathroom  and bathroom needs to be painted
742364970,Wouldn t recommend Bad door man Door man at building was a creep 
742151737,I would not stay here ever again  Terrible communication  cold water in the mornings  they towed our rental car from the garage for no reason  refused to put us in touch with the on site property management to problem solve the situation  the common areas and elevators were disgusting  there was a constant cloud of weed and cigarette smoke  and the building was routinely left unsecured  I sincerely hope someone with some decision making capability reaches out to me soon so we can rectify this situation before I need to take it further  Every time I messaged the host to voice a concern I was connected with a different person who was not up to speed on any of the issues that we were dealing with  It was even more difficult to get someone on the phone  Texting is not the most effective or efficient means of communication especially when you are working      days teaching and presenting to several hundred attendees   With regard to the hot water issues  we had very early mornings because of the conference we were presenting at across the park at the St  Louis Union Station Hotel  The second or third time that we notified Zencity about the issue we had explained that the water was cold early in the morning and would be fine later in the day  They sent another person to our rental while we were AWAY without notifying us that they would be there  and our personal items and equipment were un secured   Zencity REFUSED to put me in touch with the on site building manager so we could problem solve the issue of them towing our rental vehicle   The fact of the matter is  there is ZERO guidance in the rental or in the house rules manual with regard to a specific parking space within the parking garage  There was zero signage or warning about having your vehicle towed if it was in the wrong parking spot  The parking pass was visible on our vehicle and it had several numbers on it  not to mention that the garage is a key card key fob secured structure with garage doors  By the way  the key fob also had a number on it that did not correspond with the apparently  assigned  space either   In fact none of the numbers visible on the pass  fob  or apt  appeared to correspond with any of the parking spaces in the garage  The garage was never full and it did not appear that spaces were specific to the cars in the garage as every time I parked there I observed different cars parked in different spaces   Here is how the situation should have been handled   If I was parked in someones space then when that person contacts the building manager and let them know someone is in their space   The building manager would then see that the pass hanging in the mirror shows that the vehicle does belong in the garage  and furthermore  the driver must have had a key fob to gain access   They would then cross reference the pass number to find the Apt    that it belongs to and then Zencity would have reached out to us to say   Please move your vehicle to the assigned spot  XXX    Instead  someone gave the tow company access to private property and towed our rental car  We have been incurring late fees  towing fees  and daily rates since then  even though we have been gone since the   th  Budget still has not been able to recover their car from the tow yard  We also were unable to rent another vehicle because of this so we had to pay additional money to get an Uber Lyft to make our flights when we checked out   So now here is how I am rectifying the situation  Airbnb   Zencity owe my business SLC Squared for time lost  we missed meetings the day we had our car towed  so that will be at our normal hourly consulting fee   Budget Rental Cost  Tow Fees  Budget Administrative Fees  and Uber Lyft fees  Also  we are disputing the charges for our stay as it was not what we thought we were paying for   I will be providing invoices for the substantiation of those costs incurred from Airbnb Zencitys negligence and I will be sending a bill to be paid Net     Late fees will be assessed as necessary as we will be having late fees assessed to us until the bill to Budget is paid  If necessary we will pursue civil action  I would prefer not to do that The access points to the complex were supposed to be secure but it was hit or miss if the doors were actually secured  There were several instances where they would be propped open  The outside and common areas of the location was gross  The elevators would have trash bags stacked against them for hours on our floor  Whenever you were in the lobby or on our floor it smelled like cigarette and marijuana smoke  One morning there was a whole to go box of food that was strewn all over the elevator and it was not clean up until the next day and even then there was food that still remained from it  Also  smoke and smells would come into the listing through the vent in the kitchen  Every time I messaged the host to voice a concern I was connected with a different person who was not up to

524090834150844082,I did not check in to this reservation  Made reservation   hours prior to arrival   The strict reservation policy is a money grab  The location was not safe  I did not know this until I arrived   Did not feel comfortable here  Will stay away from Zencity reservations for the foreseeable future as well as pay closer attention to any hosts with strict reservation policies   Even airlines give a person   hrs to change a reservation before you are locked in  Airbnb has really changed not as awesome as it use to be  Guests pay attention 
521001525778760841,The thermostat  as other guests have noted  is a HUGE problem  My wife and I stayed in the middle of December  which it was cold  It took way too long for representatives to alter the temperature  You cannot alter it yourself because a password is required  Outside of this  it was clean and everything was accurate  The hosts have to alter this  I would not want anyone or their spouses sleeping in a jacket like my wife had to  The thermostat is a serious issue  There are other reviewers who have noted this  I stayed in the middle of December  which is the Winter in Kansas City  There is no reason why a guest should not be able to turn the heat up  especially when it is this cold outside  In addition  the apartment has many windows  which will cause even more of a draft  Honestly  outside of the thermostat and the detergent dispenser for the kitchen sink  I would have rated the stay fairly high  My wife had to go to sleep with her Nike jacket on as a result of how cold it was  The customer support staff took way too long to get back with us in terms of remotely altering the temperature  I did mot even feel a need to ask to turn it up again as a result of how long it took the last time 
512335728287728073,When we arrived  they could not find the key  We had to stand for a good half hour before they sent us to our room without a key  We then had to wait another hour for then to get us the key  Terrible check in to start with   Then the place was dirty  with food crumbs on the carpets  stains on the floor  a hair tie under one of the chairs  The bed sheets and towels had some hair on them   They were however very responsive 
471662771457822221,Getting inside and getting the key was like being in an escape room  maybe some people will find it fun  I didnt really  I asked if someone can help me secure my bags for the   hours before check in  early check in wasnt possible  and neither was anyone making an effort to just stash my bags  The apartment is so minimully decorated its incredibly uninviting  I was extremely dissapointed no one seemed to be willing to make any effort to at least secure my bags while I waited the couple hours for my room  I was told that the room was occupied the night before  but according to the chaulkboard in the room it was last clean weeks ago  The apartment is so barely decorrated that it makes it not feel hospitable at all 
531124280502654899,This listing was not as described at all  No washer and dryer  it was unclean  furniture was literally thrown in place  no coffee maker  if you see it listed as available it s most likely not available  Heads up choose the other place you were looking at 
469561786201500816,This place was really dirty I don t think it was clean at all  Would not stay here again  Building is under construction This place was really dirty I don t think it was clean at all  Would not stay here again
490575052972643293,For the price  the room had a lot of issues  No hot water  Toilet leaked and the heater was loud  Also it smelled bad  Not to mention you could hear everyone around us in the building  fighting  yelling  kids running around an lots of bumping from upstairs  I was not happy    The place had a foul sulfur like smell  Only had hot water for a few minutes the first night and none at all after that  The toilet leaked after flushing and the heater in the front room was loud 
455753526191253249,BEWARE   I really wish I could write a better review  We booked this place starting on a Wednesday that went through to Monday and had planned to work from the apartment during the week  Unfortunately  when we got there  we found the router completely disconnected from the wall and the power supply in the night stand  The Ethernet port was actually just a large hole in the wall  I contacted them multiple times throughout the stay  The place is hosted by a management company  Each time we contacted them  we were responded to by a new person who hadn t read the previous communication  We were told that our issue would be escalated to management on Saturday  But I guess they decided that since we were checking out Monday morning  we were no longer worth their time  Bc even after me reaching out several times  we never heard back  The location is amazing  I wonder if the actual owners of this apartment knows how poorly their place is being managed  Oh  and there is only one mirror in the entire three bedroom place  If they just put one more mirror in there  it would make the whole place better  I really wish this could ve been resolved without me having to write a bad review 
452834399380772005,The studio is fine and clean  but if you need any help don t expect anyone from this corporate company to support you or have any real human interaction  Customer service takes days to get back to you  Limited flexibility  Communication the entire tire was terrible  extremely delayed and my questions left unanswered  When I called I did not get a response  rates per night fluctuated grately and there is no humanness to the experience I will never stay at a corporately owned Airbnb experience  not only are you contributing to high rent prices ans gentrification but your customer service and value is terrible 
510918785130318501,DO NOT BOOK DO NOT BOOK DO NOT BOOK  First off the box that you have to put the code in to access building didnt work  I brought my work clothes and my childs clothes the dryer didnt work  I would have booked a nice loft on Washington if i knew the washer dryer aint work  The microwave didnt work when my daughter went to warm up her food  I didnt trip off of any of it i let it slide i didnt bother the host     THE SHOWER DIDNT WORK   That was a deal breaker for me i wrote them about it at     pm it took for me to call them around  pm for them to finally respond with NO SOLUTION  This was unbelievable i have never had issues booking an airbnb  I felt like I was in an apartment in the HOOD  And it stank when you walk in   I hope they refund me at least one night since they kind of did mess my whole weekend up  The only good thing about this place was that everybody was LOUD AF so it was cool that my kids didnt have to stay quiet  Fuck off
528327258849329299,the kiosk for the key did not work  my room was dirty  there was drugs and drug paraphernalia in my room  the floor was flooded from sewage water  they did not get me a new room by the end of the night  and the next day they accused me of breaking the refrigerator  I will never stay here again  I strongly suggested if anybody stays here that they do a walk through first  maybe before you accuse people of breaking things in an apartment  maybe you should make sure the door wasnt left open for housekeeping staff to come in  and perhaps it would be a good idea for you to actually check the rooms before checking in a guest  that way theyre clean and dont have drug paraphernalia  being forced to be around drugs is not something that I appreciate and not something that I should have ever had to deal with in my life coming to you 
525549931873763748,There was feces on the floor when we entered the building  We were in the unit less than    minutes   roaches took over the kitchen  We left immediately and they refused to give us a full refund  We sent pictures of cock roaches in our unit and feces on the floor as we entered the building  We requested a full refund in the amount of      and was only given     
495028752403261528,Needs better parking instructions  Host controls climate in apartment area  No television in small bed room area  just dinning area only  I was also told about noise complaint  Which funny that all happened the night of me canceling my reservations early  when in fact I did not have any loud music on and it was around     pm before   pm quite hours  You will do better just getting an hotel in that city  Area need to be climate controlled by person only  Needs specific parking instructions included  Faster response from host   Add television to bed room wall not just dinning area 
385402203993944298,Place was filthy when we arrived and reeked of marijuana smell  Toilet seat actually had fecal splash on it  Kitchen had dirty pans  Kitchen is poorly equipped if want to actually cook  Apartment is totally dead for Verizon cellular phone but at least provided wifi was reliable  We saw at least two centipedes and a couple mosquitoes in the apartment  Once we clean the apartment ourselves and the marijuana smell finally faded location was quiet and convenient for Hyde Park  Zen responds quickly to emails but no follow through on anything that needs action  Building code stopped working a full hour prior to check out time  Luckily one of us had stayed behind to let others back in  Our first and probably last Airbnb experience  Your leaving us a dirty apartment that reeked of marijuana smell for the first two days was no appreciated  Also blowing us off on our request for waive of clean fee is crap on your side 
530501881115048726,Cleanliness was not up to standards  floors  kitchen surfaces  refrigerator  sinks  furniture  and place smelled like smoke   The front intercom system was broken communication through AirBNB system  if we would ve showed up at  pm or after no entry would ve been granted  No parking pass  thermostat is controlled by nest and once again communication through the app to get someone on site to adjust temp  It s a basement unit so was dry no circulation and hot  very uncomfortable   The blinds do not close      and bc this unit is ground literally sidewalk level no privacy bc of this issue   No actual running kitchen water hope you like making trips to the bathroom to wash dishes  Terrible  Reference messages sent
455748720919576389,STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNIT   WATCH OUT FOR FAKE REVIEWS    This place was a dump and the photos of the unit are from years ago  The unit came with   less sofa then pictured in the description  It also came with a dog bed that was supposed to pass as a place for a human to sleep    Be careful coming up the stairs as the handrail is loose and some of the wall anchors are coming out of the drywall   Theres was dried blood on a few of the walls of the unit when we checked in  There is no WiFi as advertised with the unit  The place comes with the minimal amount of bedding blankets  pillows  many without covers   and towels    I made multiple requests to management and to improve our stay  Management usually took over a day  sometimes    to respond to any of my requests  I was told I could go out and buy the things I requested    The outdoor heater is broken  the record player is broken  the outdoor furniture is filthy and most of the pillows in the living room are stained  I could go on and on  stay away from this sh t hole  This was hands down the worst Air B   B Ive ever booked

510157780015856521,This was   without a doubt   the worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had    Zencity provided an incorrect door code and thus I was left stranded in a hallway that smelled of garbage masked with weed at midnight  After reaching out to ask for a new code  radio silence  I heard back from them at     am  which was just someone asking  If I had gotten in alright   without even including a new door code or any acknowledgement that their failure to provide the correct door code had left me locked out  I found a hotel with an available room  booked it  and when I woke up wrote to Zencity to request a refund and a cancellation of my two day reservation  which they refused to provide  They then said that they hoped to be able to provide me with a better Zencity experience  which clearly they did not want to provide or they would have answered my requests  I had to elevate the issue to Airbnb to get a full refund for my trip  Zencity has continued to refuse to provide a refund or compensate me in any way for the expense of the nearest hotel  I had a lovely trip  thanks to the Hoxton and the Ace hotels  I cannot stress enough how much I recommend avoiding Zencity when looking for your next Airbnb stay  Hello  I just wanted to   yet again   reiterate how terrible of an Airbnb experience this was  After you failed to respond to me as I was checking in  the response  at     am  did not even include the correct door code  And you ve continued to refuse to provide a refund  despite my requesting several times  AND I continued to receive messages from you as if everything was fine and I was able to check in  That is just terrible customer service  especially in hospitality  This is not to mention that getting into the apartment building felt unsafe and the hallway smelled like rotting garbage masked by the smell of weed

394900622998807163,I ll start by saying that I booked this Airbnb by mistake  My partner and I were traveling for a family member s funeral  and I thought I was simply sending a message  I had a question about parking  but the interface actually was a  Reserve  button instead of a  Send  button    I was on hold with Airbnb for over an hour before a senior representative said that it would be up to the host to refund me in full due to the mistake  Zencity is a company with no remorse for my situation  so they stood by their cancellation policy  I was going to lose out on a significant amount of money if I had cancelled so we decided it would be best to just go ahead with the reservation  The neighborhood  it s location to where we needed to be  and fairly easy street parking were the ONLY positives of this listing   We checked in around   pm because we were driving from NYC  We were tired from the road trip  and grieving being back in my partner s hometown  To say we needed comfortable accommodations is an understatement  We could not afford to find another place to stay given the circumstances of our visit   The apartment and building is dirty  dingy  and dilapidated  The chair in the studio is absolutely disgusting and looks to be covered in what were human fluids  I m assuming this was not checked by someone from Zencity after it was set up by whatever housekeeping company is used  The linens were not soiled and had been washed  but we still found hair  a giant ant  and light stains in the bed  dust and dirt on tables  headboard  windowsills  hair in the bathroom  the main rug is absolutely dirty and dingy  dust caked onto the ceiling fan  grease oil and food stains on the walls  The trash can in the kitchen won t close all the way  Dirty eating utensils in dusty kitchen drawers  I wish I could upload photos  We decided to sleep on top of the comforter because of how uncomfortable the mattress is and after finding a second bug  silver bug  the second night  The bed squeaks at the slightest movement and feels terrible    When notifying them about the condition of the apartment  their initial suggestion was to send a cleaner when we were not there  Were we supposed to repack our personal belongings  and lug it out and lug it back  In the middle of our visit  Or did they expect us to leave our personal things there while cleaners worked around it  Either thought is ludicrous    I requested a refund of some of the fees  and they refunded only the clean fee        I ended up buying a few sanitizing clean supplies to wipe down the surfaces that our stuff came in direct contact with  There are some clean supplies  but I barely wanted to touch anything in the room  The mop swiffer thing was as dingy and dirty as the apartment   Some of the hallway lights leading up to the room were broken  and the light sign right outside our door is broken flickering  The hallways and lobby smelled  Throughout our stay there were random pieces of trash throughout the hallways and stairway  The listing also said that this unit includes a washer and dryer  which it does not  There are communal W D on the basement ground level  When walking through the basement ground level to use the staircase by the apartment  the floor was littered with dead cockroaches  You can t make this up    On our last day night  we came back to the unit with the light switched on and we were POSITIVE that we had turned off every light  We think that someone at Zencity must have notified the cleaners to come that day thinking it was our checkout day  and they arrived  turned on the light  and quickly shut the door seeing that it was still inhabited  I don t know if this actually happened  but we KNOW we turned every light off    Please save your money  Zencity does not care about hospitality and comfort  They just want to get paid  We should have been given a more significant refund due to the condition of the apartment and building  It s absolutely disgusting  and makes it feel like you are really scamming people   On our last day night  we came back to the unit with the light switched on and we were POSITIVE that we had turned off every light  We think that someone must have notified the cleaners to come that day thinking it was our checkout day  and they arrived  turned on the light  and quickly shut the door seeing that it was still inhabited  I don t know if this actually happened  but we KNOW we turned every light off

Zencity  someone just copy pasted a message or pushed the  before  and  after  messages through   Low marks for impersonal service        Host does not know the property   For the conglomerate of Zencity  which apparently runs properties in Chicago  St  Louis  and Kansas City  they do not keep up with any changes to the property unless they hear about it from customers or residents   In my case      the pool had been closed by the health department   I had hoped to use the pool  as I had seen it on the photos   A kind update would have been appreciated     the original call box I was supposed to use for entering the building  at a side entrance  was disconnected and not operational   Signs had been posted directing people to go to the front entrance   Zencity customer service staff were clueless about this and asked me to text them photos    the address for the side entrance  where I was originally supposed to enter  was just plain wrong  promoting added confusion     the other call box screen at the front entrance required different codes  which I did not receive until the next day     of the two lobby elevators  one was broken down   Permanent residents did not know when the other elevator would be repaired     the area is frequented by a transient population pressing for handouts  presenting some safety concerns        Rough first day   Because of their lack of awareness  see      I was given the wrong entrance codes for the building   I spent  h upon arrival trying to contact someone  the mysterious  Ava   by text message on the AirBNB platform   I got in via a resident  who used their elevator key card to help me access my floor   The codes for my room were accurate  so at least I could get that far   However  the HID key fob they left in my room that was supposed to operate the HID panel at the building entrance  to release the door lock  was non functional   With neither a working key fob or working building entrance door codes  and no one getting back to me  I had to find other lodging that night   I eventually talked to a customer service agent by phone  but my issue was not resolved until the next day  after a    minute session over the phone    I only used   of my   prepaid nights there   A resolution for a partial refund is still pending on this matter         Residents and guests bad mouth Zencity overall   Every resident I met said Zencity was worthless and should not be running apartments there at all   Other guests using the space said the same thing   lack of response to concerns  no way to meet with or talk to a human about a problem onsite  bad key cards or fobs  inattention to building concerns  and other issues     Only   star for this property  because there are no zero stars  and because all the good things I listed above  I could get somewhere else routinely     Run away from  don t walk towards  a Zencity property   Regrettable experience  I had a very difficult experience  which can be re read on the AirBNB text platform as well as in my public review  While customer service reps were as helpful as possible over the phone  the business model you have as a remote host is not a suitable match under AirBNB  largely because you are reliant on text and email conversation  not in person communication   You are missing the point of hospitality   building relationships    I have requested a refund for the one night I was denied  as I did not receive a resolution for entering until the next morning   For the      apt at     McGee I noted the towel bar was coming loose at one end and the soap dispenser was too tall for easy use at the bathroom sink   Also  the tub did not drain well at all   Soap scum from bathing showering adhered to the tub floor and made the surface very slippery  a distinct hazard   You would do well to install an ADA bar to help with careful entering and exiting the tub  even if you clear up the slow drain   But  you would do best overall to discontinue your connection to AirBNB and pull this property off their site 
530722229389477117,expect the shittiest stay of your life  Ive stayed with you guys before and had no problems  The second time I made a reservation with you guys literally every part of it was fucked up  I was able to get through the front door of the apartment building but after that everything went to shit  Yall gave me the wrong code for the keycafe so I couldnt get my key to go any further than the lobby because you need a key fob for literally every door and the elevator  it took about   hours to get ahold of someone and finally get a key for me to use  So me and my girlfriend made our way up to the apartment  When we got to the apartment door the door wasnt locked  Instead it was open and when we walked in it was fucking disgusting there were used bandaids on the floor  the bathroom had someones hair all over the sink and toilet and shower  dirty towels on the floor  used wash rag in the shower  there was trash all over the apartment  and the bed was dirty and had obviously been slept in by someone  its was just disgusting and a horrible new years eve and experience all together
480457993936168432,Filthy and freezing is how I d summarize the stay  I have never had a negative Airbnb experience until this one  I truly feel like the other negative reviews were hidden or I somehow missed them this time   You ve been warned     Code they gave to the apartment was wrong  got locked out and took about    minutes before it was resolved  My booking also said it was for the rear apartment  but when we got there the check in instructions were from the front apartment  this matters because it s a busy street near a hospital   it was noisy     apartment was not clean  Floor was absolutely FILTHY like it had been weeks since it had been vacuumed  Dust on walls  grimy blinds  etc    biggest issue was NO HEAT  we called and messaged multiple times to let them know the thermostat was either set low  or the furnace was not working because either no air or cold air was blowing whenever the thermostat  said  it was heating  It stayed a frigid    degrees the entire weekend  They never offered to fix it    furniture was stained  greasy  broken  and basically was from a frat house or a dumpster    Terrible communication with Zencity  hours between responses  and no contact ever from the  host   If this was a much cheaper apt I wouldn t have such an issue  but this was an expensive stay for bare minimum  The worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had  Either you are ripping people off  or your management company is ripping you off 
526800151336643840,I had to step over trash to get on or off the elevator anytime I left the appartment   The elevator also smelled like a trash can   The fact that the appartment had a balcony was a deciding factor in renting the room   The balcony was directly about a couple dumpsters and a grease trap   This is the first bad experience I have had renting a Air BnB  I had to step over trash to get on or off the elevator anytime I left the appartment   The elevator also smelled like a trash can   The fact that the appartment had a balcony was a deciding factor in renting the room   The balcony was directly about a couple dumpsters and a grease trap   This is the first bad experience I have had renting a Air BnB

531895280767599934,My comments were private and intended to improve the facility  Hi this is private   I don t want to leave a bad review  Most of the problems involved technology  The communication when we arrived was poor because I kept getting incomplete texts and had to communicate through the website  It was cumbersome to do outside in the freezing weather  We were never able to access WiFi in the building  even though our hostess sent us additional options  none of them worked for either of our phones  The three legged chairs were dangerous  both of us nearly tipped over when we sat down  Finally  the turf between the parking lot and building was covered with piles of dog feces  We needed to walk across the turf to avoid ice on the sidewalk but it was almost impossible to avoid the dog poop  The trash cans were overflowing and there were no bags for guests to use to scoop the poop  As we were leaving in the morning we saw a fellow clean the grounds  but it was a mess the evening before 
527551838951602572,We were unable to check in and had to stay somewhere else over a simple key issue  Worst Bnb experience I ve had with a host  Customer service was unhelpful and had no clue what they were doing  Steer clear of Zencity Very disappointed with the lack of customer service and problem solving  Shame on your business
417351339552629567,Worst stay ever had   Too many problems to list  but to name a few   no way to contact host about problems  difficult to access  no internet  broken tv  and non working elevator  Worst stay ever had   If I could rate it less than zero  I would  All the problems are too many to list  but to mention a few  difficult to access  elevator not working  no internet  tv didn t work  broken chair   No way to contact host with problems

471657820683821106,We knew walking in that this place might not be the best kept apartment  but didnt expect it to be as bad as it was  bags over smoke detectors  air conditioning that doesnt work and windows that dont open  and overall pretty dirty  The location is perfect  perfectly in a wonderful neighborhood  and the building is great  Surprisingly the train is nearly silent inside with the door closed   If you can look past some of these things and have a moment to wash your sheets before you start your vacation it can be a nice spot to lay your head  Was very disappointed with both how poorly clean and maintained the apartment was and the response time and ability to help resolve issues  Our vacation was marred by the non functioning air conditioning and having to take some time to clean the apartment before we could get our vacation started 
541995361550282313,Everyone should know the building is not a safe place to be at night  There s a lot of drug activity  The main door is not kept locked when it is the key fob doesn t work to get you in  I have photos of coke or heroine bags outside the elevator door  Room      had their door open all night with a creepy man watching you go to   from your car  The shower road was broken   the hot water NEVER worked  I ran it for    min from faucet   shower   it was out  I was approached to buy drugs   was made fun of by the door man when he thought it was funny to make me wave up and down at a motion censor that wasn t their to open the door  There was no good apology   all they offered was a next stay discount   I ll tell you I ll never go back there ever  I ve stayed at several in many big cities all with their own problems   this was horrific  Save you re money   get away from that place  FrontDesk   Bradley s are so much better You already know my problems 
450697134729325628,I want to give a good review but I can t  The apartment itself is great  In a great location and the building has AWESOME amenities  if only you had access to them  The fob doesn t work to get you into the gym or many of the common areas   On top of that  the internet password was correct but it said no internet connection  I reported the problem immediately upon check in and it was unresolved all   nights we were there with no one trying to make it right  All I got was  are you sure you put in the correct password   And  did you try restarting to router   OBVIOUSLY I did both of those things several times   No internet no tv on top of the disappointment that we couldn t access the amenities  VERY disappointing experience and bad communication from the host  Take care of your guests when they report issues  Not having internet or tv is a major inconvenience 
476110021261682289,Home was beautiful  Check in was easy  Getting in door after hours sucked  The intercom did not understand what was being said  I was very clear and wasnt sure where the mic was  But it said speak into the mic  Oh well  moving on   They need to hire new housekeepers  They left dirty towels behind the bathroom door  Sewerage smell was coming from bathroom  Wasnt sure from where  Kind of hard taking a refreshing shower and it smells  That was a first  Did inform the owner and was told sorry and my next stay could be discounted  Not sure I would come back here  Check in was easy  The home was beautiful  Got to the room it was dirty towels in the bathroom hanging on the door  It smelled like a sewerage in the bathroom  Had to keep the bathroom door closed the whole time doing my stay  Did inform him by sending pictures  Had to go to the store to get clean supplies to clean and disinfectant everything  So i didnt feel clean here at all

542048171553561431,Be careful  They will try to take your money with false clean claims  All drains were clogged and the whole building smells like smoke 
480443927881216574,I canceled my reservations   days in advance  I was billed       The host is refusing to provide me with my refund  I contacted Mark with the Airbnb resolution center for assistance  He was to cancel my reservations since the Airbnb website would not allow me to complete the cancellation process  The host was included in the message thread regarding the cancellation process  Mark with Airbnb Resolution Center did not complete my cancellation  He is a failure at his job and actually blocked the entire thread regarding our conversation  I have an open investigation with Airbnb  I have reported both the host and Mark with Airbnb  I have been dealing with this issue for   days at this point and I have yet to receive a refund from the host  I would never recommend this host or any property associated with Zencity  I would also recommend that anyone dealing with Airbnb take screenshots of everything pertaining to Airbnb communication   Airbnb seems to be as shady as some of the hosts  I never thought Airbnb resolution center would actually DELETE BLOCK conversation threads and leave the customer holding the bag  Theives are everywhere      Since I canceled my reservation and you still owe me my refund I have nothing but bad things to say about you as a host  Pay me my refund  I have an active claim with Airbnb  She is conducting an investigation  My reservation was canceled   days before my check in date  I can t control the Airbnb platform and why I was unable to supply you with a cancellation confirmation  Mark with Airbnb Resolution Center stated that he would complete the cancellation process for me  He failed in providing me with a cancellation number which is again  out of my control  You received the same messages  from him as I did  I have reported his poor performance to Airbnb as well and he is part of the investigation process  You are well aware that you owe me my refund  You billed me          Give me my refund 
542073838966222509,communication with the host might be spotty Would like a refund  had to cancel this because our key fob wasn t available for us to pick up  so we had to find a new place to stay  what are the next steps for a refund
475384751691610939,Be ready to hike once you park  it will be at least two blocks  Give yourself plenty of time to check in  you will likely run into issues  I was very disappointed with our stay  Checkin was a nightmare where we were able to check into somebody else s room for two hours  I am not sure if that room was clean before the next guests arrived  I had revived an email that said if we  had any questions or concerns to let you know  Once we finally got into our room I expressed the concern of safety  I never got a response  We stayed four days with no response at all until an automated message on the morning we left  The tub did not drain at all  which I couldn t tell anybody because nobody got back to me  Nobody should have to stand in a foot of dirty water from the pipes while they shower 
529022727894276258,Do not rent this place unless you dont have much to carry   It is clean and very comfortable but to much of a hassle to deal with the key fob that doesnt work   Couldnt get downstairs to play pool like it is advertised in the app   One lady in the office was a snot to my husband but changed her when Iwalked in the office  There needs to be something done about the poor service with the key fob   I couldntget back into the garage after I parked    I wanted to bring in the rest of my things and couldnt get back to my truck because the key fob wouldnt work   Poor communication for sure 
514452863896288089,The last day we had there they kicked us out at    am and we didn t get to come back in till the day was over  Even tho I paid for it  Other then that it was okay but I will never pay for that again The last day we had there they kicked us out at    am and we didn t get to come back in till the day was over  Even tho I paid for it  Other then that it was okay but I will never pay for that again
473121320899293095,Very disappointing  Amenities listed  such as the gym  pool  coffee bar  games courts  etc were not available to Air BnB guests  Seemed to be the policy of Zencity to block  On site unaffiliated building personnel told us it had been that way for quite some time  Amenities were open  but we couldnt access Location is good  but price we paid was for the amenities  Zencity was not responsive at all during our stay of of   days  During our trip  only communication was that they were unable to accommodate early check in due to another guest  and check out instructions on the final morning  This was despite several attempts via phone and app to reach them starting   hour after we first checked in  very disappointed in the lack of response during our stay to the immediate feedback we offered shortly after check in of amenities that were listed not being accessible  further  feedback we received from the local leasing agent  who could not help is  was that this did not seem to be an error  rather  a policy of Zencitys to not offer access  this was directly contrary to the listing  as well as even the welcome communication we received day of with the check in info  Other feedback   better instruction on need to use the fob to lock the door when leaving would be helpful  and if was initially a little hard to find the lockbox with the fob  describe a bit better where to find it at  add a few more utinsels to the kitchen  like a coffee maker  cutting board  etc 
746165073,Location in CWE was great as well as the apartment concept   Apartment needs clean and updating   At the time of our visit  the microwave was not functioning  feedback already provided via messages between host and me directly hardwood floors do not appear to have been washed other than being swept or vacuumed in quite some time   some surfaces appear to have been wiped  but others had not
743368844,This may have been an insolated incident being that the entire apartment wasnt clean  but it was unacceptable that this company didnt have cleaners available the day of my check in to come and clean  They were scheduling for next morning clean which meant I would have to sleep in a filthy apartment  I cancelled and am awaiting a FULL refund  Ended up spending      extra dollars to book a last minute hotel room  Disappointed from this experience Please refund me  This may be an isolated incident  but it was unacceptable for me to stay there and I must let other positions know truthfully of my experience Apartment looks like what was in it  just a lot of wall scuffs and sagging furniture Hairs in bed  shoe prints and debris in shower  should and water stains on counters and living room end tables  floor not swept or mopped  sink dirty in bathroom  no trash bag in bathroom trashcan  food debris left in fridge Call center type of contact
455008755950715819,Honestly  this place was pretty awful  First  we arrived to check in and could not get in  The entire screen on the pad to type everything in was froze  We called our  host  which is a call center for the entire Zencity  not a specific person  that had no idea who I was or anything about my airbnb stay  He literally was zero help and the only reason we got in    minutes later was because we caught the door when someone came out  Next  to be brief   the bed in this airbnb is old and worn  We didn t even feel comfortable getting in it because it looked so dingy  The bedroom also reeked of cat urine  We ended up buying an air mattress unfortunately  Pretty much the trip was an overall disaster  Kitchen and bathroom was pretty clean and up to date  Bedroom is awful  Checking in was TERRIBLE  Communication was TERRIBLE 
480453089297115351,Great location  but not very clean

478314910960882800,The key drop box wasn t working so I had to wait an over hour just to check in then once I got to the room the tv did not work  other than that it s a nice place  
453591491114609896,HORRIBLE   PRICE WAS DECENT   NO TRASH BAGS  BED WAS UNCOMFORTABLE     GAVE US THE WRONG DOOR CODE  AND A BAD SMELL TO BOOT   PAY A LITTLE MORE AND FIND A BETTER PLACE     
541375283953661277,Unfortunately this was not the experience that we were hoping for  I waited TWO HOURS after check in time waiting for a key to get into the air bnb  I was never able to get a key  and to top it off the building was being evacuated after the fire alarms were activated  We had to rearrange our plans for the night due to the inconvenience of not being able to get into the air bnb  After waiting so long and STILL no promise of even getting a key for the night I cancelled our reservation  I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to staying in this air bnb  Even though customer service was not able to help  I will say they responded in a timely manner  If you decide to stay here  I would be cautious and have them verify a key is there and available before you check in 
500691383711592969,Overall stay would have been phenomenal if we had hot water for longer than just the first day there  I reached out multiple times  even contacting Airbnb support  getting to the point where I just had to call the office of the complex so someone could finally resolve the problem   Also in regards to the toilet leaking into the below apt the following morning of our arrival  the plumber walked in unannounced  hours later    stated he  didn t know the place had guests    Location was the main good thing considering the elevators reeked of marijuana as well  Overall stay would have been phenomenal if we had hot water for longer than just the first day  I reached out multiple times  even contacting Airbnb support  to where I just had to call the office of the complex so someone could finally resolve the problem   Also in regards to the toilet leaking  the plumber walked in unannounced  hours later  while everyone was still in bed   stated he  didn t know the place had guests  
499317250545252240,The room was clean   The location was great   The cost was affordable   The check in process was a complete and utter disaster   For the first room       I had  the apartment building key card was not available   This made it impossible to get to my room   I was told that at     pm that the housing     team would contact me to get me the card   They didnt contact me by      pm   Turns out they leave for the day at  pm    After   phone calls and   hours of wasted time late at night  I finally got checked in   I basically had to beg to get transferred to another room  evidently their support staff couldnt come up with that solution on their own     The check in process was completely unacceptable  it is the last thing you want to deal with after a late dinner  Be sure you have the key card for check in   For the first room       I had  it was not there   This makes it impossible to get to my room   I was told that at     pm that the housing     team would contact me   They didnt by      pm   Turns out they leave for the day at  pm    The check in process wasted   hours of my time late at night and was completely unacceptable   I basically had to beg to get transferred to another room 
495646468480600577,DO NOT STAY HERE   From the photos this place looks like a steal  but once you arrive you will soon realize how poorly maintained the place is     My wife and I arrived around      and were immediately hit with smells of weed and cigarettes in the hallway   Not pleasant  but we can t expect management to be able to control the neighbors   Once we walked into the apartment we were wishing for the hallway smell as the entire apartment had a stench of rotting garbage   It felt like some didn t take the trash out for months  and showed of right before we arrived to remove it   As we walked around the place we noticed unclean floors and countertops  area rugs that should be trashed  and to top it off sheets that smelled like the previous guests   As we were debating on whether or not to stay or find a hotel  we noticed human nails in rugs next to the bed as well as pieces of glass near the coach    Clearly this was not the place for us to stay the night  and we left for a nearby hotel   I brought this up to the management group and their response was  ohh well   and  we will refund the clean fee    It was so dirty that we couldn t stay there a refund of the clean fee was an insult   I highly recommend that you keep scrolling to the next option 
465290503584795811,Our experience was not good  We had an issue upon check in with a smoke detector beeping  We were unable to reach the detector and deferred to Zencity for a resolution  We were advised the following day that they couldn t have someone available on the weekend to help  We spent the entire first night trying to sleep through a beeping every    seconds  We were advised through Airbnb to cancel as we went to get a hotel room for the  nd night  The issue still isn t      resolved and the communication has been terrible on Airbnb and Zencity  This trip has verified we are done with Airbnb and will book through hotels moving forward  Our experience was not good  We had an issue upon check in with a smoke detector beeping  We were unable to reach the detector and deferred to Zencity for a resolution  We were advised the following day that they couldn t have someone available on the weekend to help  We spent the entire first night trying to sleep through a beeping every    seconds  We were advised through Airbnb to cancel as we went to get a hotel room for the  nd night  The issue still isn t      resolved and the communication has been terrible on Airbnb and Zencity  This trip has verified we are done with Airbnb and will book through hotels moving forward 
465230494908816165,First this place is not safe  there was an incident that made us feel extremely uncomfortable and vulnerable  the police were contacted twice and never responded  I messaged the host and they didn t get back to me until the next day and all they had to say was that they d notify their team so they could  keep an eye out   Upon arrival the home was dirty  I sent multiple pictures to the host and got no response  The amenities were very minuscule  no trash bags  a coffee pot and only two plates  It s extremely loud due to the location  traffic  and the neighborhood  The night of the incident we stayed in the car until early morning  I do not refine d this place  for lock of safety  cleanliness and lack of concern from the host 
465216896642263648,This air bnb was awful    The instructions to enter the building did not work  We did not even get a key fob to access the building once we got to the room  Zencity was impossible to contact and when they answered they could not even offer any help  I would not stay here  The instructions to enter the building did not work  We ran into another couple trying to check in to their air BnB who had similar issues not being able to access their room  A resident of the complex was kind enough to let us in  but once we got into our room we were promised a fob that gets us inside the building and up the elevator  After not being able to locate the fob  it was nearly impossible to contact Zencity for help  Once they finally answered they had no way of helping us with our problems so we were scared we would have to sleep in our car if we did not catch a resident entering the building when we were coming back  They did not help us all weekend or offer any sort of refund for the lack of communication and not being able to access our room ourselves 
465135616008079051,The irony of calling their company  ZenCity  is not lost on me  We were not only highly annoyed but we were also then late for our engagement  also needing to find a new place to stay for both nights where we could guarantee re entry into the building  and also on the phone with ZenCity staff who by no fault of their own  are in no way helpful  Just entering the building is the most stressful thing  I generally enjoy Airbnb experiences  but I have now learned my lesson to only do Airbnb from actual individual owners and not these ill named corporations who run Airbnb properties  What an embrasement for Airbnb   First of all  do not book this  But if you do  do not follow any instructions they send you about getting into the place  Even if you call them and ask them to clarify because you read the reviews about it being hard to get in  it wont matter  They will say its easy to get in  They will say instructions are forthcoming  And you believe them because  what self respecting company gets multiple reviews saying theyve made it difficult to get into the building without remedying the situation  But Im not entirely convinced that anyone at ZenCity visits this apartment to know how to actually enter the building  On the keypad  you need to dial your apartment number in the directory  not the other number they give you  From there  the code they send you MAY work  IF you get in that way  they then recommend you walk around a desk and through a mailroom to find a key fob at a kiosk that does not exist  Meanwhile  the elevator to get you upstairs only stays unlocked for you for about two minutes  So while youre looking for the unicorn key kiosk  you get blocked from getting up the elevator  Fortunately  if you get there before the leasing office closes  the kind worker  who is embarrassed to have ZenCity in their building  offers to let you up the elevator to the apartment but is  of course  unable to provide access to the apartment  So you will stand there with all of your things while you wait for  Zen City to answer the phone and feign shock that you cannot get into their place  saying   We at ZenCity are not known for this   all while providing no real solutions  When they finally found a code to get us in the room  we asked how we would get back into the building  and they suggested we wait outside for someone from the  front desk  to let us in  This is NOT true  The desk  like the kiosk  is fake news  And how is that a solution for trying to re enter a building at midnight in downtown KC anyway  Why would they find this an acceptable solution regardless  Were supposed to just HOPE someone arrives and lets us into the building  No  Fortunately  we found a place to stay  The actual apartment is small with water dripping from the toilet  Its otherwise modest but cute I guess  and absolutely NOT WORTH IT  I dont know who you are reading this much of my review  but I do know that you  lovely human  deserve much much better  I suggest you send someone to the building to actually create instructions on how to get into the building and rooms  NOTHING about your instructions to enter the building are correct 
460138667349307754,You get what you pay for here and the prior reviews regarding the check in and the call box are correct  I had to tailgate in the building as the call box does not work as given by the instructions  The area is nearby mostly hotels in the area and office building but a shot walk away from the touristy spots 
460807462801271095,Apartment itself was nice and clean  the communication was good in the beginning  We got responses back within an hour or so  However that changed Once we got to the property  Getting in the building was very difficult and someone who lives there actually let us in the building  We had talked to the security in the building for help  He told us that the intercoms do not work and that we ll need a key fob to get in and out of the building as well as the elevator  The security was able to let us up the elevator  When we got to the unit  the key fob was no where to be found  We immediately contacted zencity and they told me that someone will deliver the key fob ASAP  We waited around for   hours for the key until we absolutely had to leave for our dinner reservation  Again  when we got back  we had to explain the whole situation to the security again so he can let us up the elevator  That night  we received a message saying that the property manager did not have an extra key fob so they will not be able to provide one for our entire stay  On Sunday  we got back to the property and asked the security to let us up the elevator  The security told us that they can not do that anymore because of the protocol  We were scared that we will not even be able to get our stuff from the unit much less staying another night  We ended up having to sneak in with someone to get to the unit  We packed up our stuff and got a hotel room for the rest of the night because it was too stressful and scary that we do not know if we will be able to get back in the unit after leaving  So this might be something you might want to consider before renting through them  They also took     hours to respond back to my request or questions after the check in 
509459470718267224,The front door entry pad was malfunctioning and broke   We had to be let in by others in the building   Later the door  was propped open   I had to enter the code to retrieve the key three times before it unlocked   There was no extra blankets in the room   There was so much hair in the bath tub drain you couldn t close the drain   The smoke detector looked to be held together by duct tape   The whole fifth floor stank terribly   It was like dead fish   The only relief was to get in the room close the door and spray the room with freshener   The room temperature was set at    and was not able to be changed without a code   That code was never given to us  The front door entry pad was malfunctioning and broke   We had to be let in by others in the building   Later the door  was propped open   I had to enter the code to retrieve the key three times before it unlocked   There was no extra blankets in the room   There was so much hair in the bath tub drain you couldn t close the drain   The smoke detector looked to be held together by duct tape   The whole fifth floor stank terribly   It was like dead fish   The only relief was to get in the room close the door and spray the room with freshener 
743701866,Full information on how to get in the building Would I be able to get my money back really disappointing that wasn t able to check in had to leave the same night because of money wise was short and didn t have any money left or didn t get my money back to find a place to stay  Waited for a response didn t get nothing it s really upsetting Wasn t able to go in Wasn t able to check in front desk didn t let us in at all saying we wasn t suppose to be there Didn t stay the night and wasn t able to get my money did cancel and everything I m really disappointed wasted my money and didn t have a place to stay the night so left home that same night
743614893,The property is beautiful  HOWEVER  the looks are deceiving  Everything is either cheap or not worth the amount of money you pay  For starters  the description states they ll provide toilet paper and I wrote them once we ran out  I looked because I m thinking it was more in stock  no response until LATER the next day questioning me but never sending someone up  SO I WENT TO BUY SOME  The bed is hard and uncomfortable  The couch had a weird smell  In my younger days of college I would not make a review but I paid      to stay and I m not a happy camper  I m a physical therapist and just wanted to relax and get away from Chicago and even though it was beautiful  it wasn t worth the money  The residence weren t friendly  I know  they don t have to be BUT DANG  a wave rather than looking because they don t know who you are   I had many problems throughout my stay and the response time said   hour and I wouldn t get a response until the next day     hours   The property is beautiful  HOWEVER  the looks are deceiving  Everything is either cheap or not worth the amount of money you pay  For starters  the description states they ll provide toilet paper and I wrote them once we ran out  I looked because I m thinking it was more in stock  no response until LATER the next day questioning me but never sending someone up  SO I WENT TO BUY SOME  The bed is hard and uncomfortable  The couch had a weird smell  In my younger days of college I would not make a review but I paid      to stay and I m not a happy camper  I m a physical therapist and just wanted to relax and get away from Chicago and even though it was beautiful  it wasn t worth the money 
493477500949152498,Those staff who had contact with me through the chat and phone call were nice and had good communications   But the door stuff at the Parc Frontenac Apartments had so bad communication issue   She just kept ignoring me  and I was not able to get in my room  That was the worst customer service ever I had experienced  After I called the call service  I could have a room at different apartment after about an hour from I got there  Never book with them 
743109061,Although the location was great  finding off street parking was a pain  We could not access the floor unless we had a key fob which was difficult and we wouldn t have been able to access it via elevator if someone else hadn t helped us  The bathroom and towels were not clean  hair on floor  toilet  and towels   On top of all this  the smoke alarm began beeping Friday night in the middle of the night due to low batteries  Out of frustration  I messaged the company and never heard back from them  Overall  we would not recommend this place to others 
742739512,The apartment was clean and well located  but none of the doors locked and the outer doors were propped open when we came in  The host failed to respond to these concerns  The apartment was also incredibly loud  the neighbors were playing music until   am and we did not sleep at all I do not recommend  It is not acceptable to stop responding when a guest tells you they feel unsafe because none of the locks work no locks  unsafe stopped responding when i reported a concern
742673015,As a third party vendor with so many reviews  I would have thought the experience would be a lot smoother  Not having a key fob was extremely inconsiderate and made entering and exiting the building very difficult especially elevators  At first  I acknowledged maybe it was a small mistake and someone will surely drop one off the following morning  yet that never happened  I shouldn t need to remind you of that  Then  I met another couple complaining of the same exact situation with their stay  That someone would  try  to deliver their key fob and never did  The most uncomfortable is the fact that the entire apartment smelled like cigarette smoke  First exposure was strong  and we figured it would go away  For   whole days each time we entered and exited the smell never went away and was consistently strong  That makes no sense for an apartment that says  no smoking allowed   If we are being charged a clean fee  things like that should be triple checked to ensure guests are comfortable in their stay specially since there s no ventilation  All my belongings still smell like smoke and that s gross  Also  many of the light switches did not work  At first I didn t care until I compared the listing photos with the unit we got and realized it was different  hence why the natural lighting wasn t strong  So the combination of the important light switches not working made the apartment very dark and gloomy for no reason  Poor lighting  Horrific smoke smell No key fob Very very poor lighting  only     light switches worked out of the many available  The place smelled like smoke the entire time  and inaccurate descriptions in terms of utilizing a key fob  NO KEY FOB       I messaged them immediately to which they kept asking for photos as if I d lie about that  In the end  they stated someone will try to drop it off tomorrow and they never did  Even saw another tenant in the elevator complaining about the same issue of not having a key fob  This made going in and out of the building such a hassle and wasted lots of time  After inquiring about not having a key fob  they stated someone will drop it off the next day to which no one ever did throughout our whole stay  Never mentioned it even after check out  I had to bring it up at check out since they instead reminded me about the      fee if the key fob was not left in correct place  when we never even got one  which shows they never even kept record of it  For the amount paid  relative to other airbnbs that I had the option to rent out  it didn t seem fair  The inaccurate description in terms of the exact room  wasn t same as photos   very poor lighting  and it being a  no smoking  room but smelled like COMPLETE smoke  Every time we entered the place  the stench would hit you immediately and never went away despite trying to air it out  Now that I m back home  my entire luggage and belongings smell like cigarettes which is ironic as one of the key rules is to not smoke ever  This really really bothered me  There was no ventilation in the bathroom either so the smell would linger constantly 
741980986,No salt and pepper or oil  Clean place  host never responded to our messages 
741923953,Do not spend your money here  Very unclean and disappointing 
741791448,They need to update their pictures  most people would not stay here if the pictures were updated  Missing pieces to the sliding front door  looks like they tried to patch some holes and it looks terrible  For towels there was a dish hand towel  it was just weird  Sheets balled up in the bedroom closet  they didn t even attempt to make it presentable    I m giving   stars because it was a semi convenient location  The building itself is awful  my boyfriend and I couldn t sleep AT ALL  The walls are like paper and the surrounding neighbors are loud  they re doing construction work next door  so I would advise you stay somewhere else or a hotel  They need to update their pictures  most people would not stay there if the pictures were updated  Missing pieces to the sliding front door  looks like they tried to patch some holes and it looks terrible  For towels there was a dish hand towel  it was just weird  Sheets balled up in the bedroom closet  they didn t even attempt to make it presentable  Okay  so I m giving   stars because it was a semi convenient location  The building itself is awful  my boyfriend and I couldn t sleep AT ALL  The walls are like paper and the surrounding neighbors are loud  they re doing construction work next door  so I would advise you stay somewhere else or a hotel 
468206299067421828,Buyer beware   They couldnt get me into the actual apartment via the intercom  which required me going to the apartment building leasing office upon arrival   Once I gained access to the apartment  there was no key fob to give me the opportunity to come and go   So I was literally stuck in the apartment   Zencity was not very responsive to myself or Airbnb in terms of resolving this  so at   PM I was forced to cancel and go a hotel in another part of town   Never again with anything Zencity 
740533048,Did not receive full refund  Did not get to stay here  Could not get into building  Bad experience  Did not receive full refund  Did not get to stay here  Could not get into building  Bad experience 
500023650970845177,You don t have any privacy there isn t any curtains in the house downstairs so everybody going up and down the streets can see right in and the furniture is so outdated The furniture is very outdated and then you need to put some type of blinds or curtains up so people can see inside their isn t any privacy  There wasn t even a blind or curtain in the bathroom on the third floor why can t people have privacy if your so worried about people having a gathering where you have it open for people to watch maybe you need to take it off of Airbnb don t nobody want everybody looking at them what if someone wants to walk around naked then tell your cll lol eating service yo clean right the floor was sticky by the kitchen nook area I was just disappointed with not having any privacy
491318129599295382,I would not stay here alone  Homeless were sleeping on the main floor  lobby area   Entire building smelt of weed  Back door to building not secure  If you have issues checking in  host does not respond  I was having issues with the code to get in  no one responded at all  Very unsafe place  homeless sleeping in the lobby  back door always unlocked  Entire building smelt of weed 
453624977586905850,Make sure to have a good  CLEAR line of communication  Need better communication  I wasnt able to even make it into the building or talk to someone who couldve helped 
515969189491651541,Ok place the parking pass was missing the first day so struggled with wondering if I would get towed from parking in lot   They told me it was fine but still a nerve wrecking experience as I kept doing downstairs checking to make sure I was ok to park there   It was also cold in the home and the heat would not go past      needed a code for the thermostat to get any warmer   I also requested for late check out   hours early  They did not respond until    checkout saying they could not honor late checkout because other guest requested early check in   But what about your current guest that asked   hours ago   Poor communication and a big inconvenience as my flight was delayed  
439143992392770583,Great location  but the bed is uncomfortable  The gasket on the freezer needs to be replaced  The table in the kitchen needs to be a little smaller so   people can sit comfortably  The chair by the bed is broken and needs to be fixed or replaced  The bed was very uncomfortable  but I am not sure if it was a mattress or bed frame issue  Window blinds would be nice on the window near the bed  However  we did appreciate how quickly you all responded to all my messages  We were just disappointed that the room was not up to the standard that you all expected it to be at 
452117307942695422,This property should not be an option for anyone  The central air doesnt work and they expect that a portable air conditioner will cool the entire apartment unit  On top of that the smell of cigarette smoke is over powering  The finishing touches to this ordeal are the sub par maintenance and lack of cleanliness throughout  Please see past messages between myself and Zencity 
455733831262448844,This unit is extremely well located   close to lots of restaurants and bars  in walking distance to many things  Unfortunately  the key fob did not work for us so we were unable to come and go as we pleased as we could not get back into the building unless an actual tenant happened to come out and let us in  It made for a stressful trip and felt unsafe  Also unfortunately  the unit was not very clean     Other than the location  the two best parts were the rooftop hangout space  theres a hammock  grills  seating areas and a TV as well as hot tubs  So bring your suits   and the bed  This is probably the most comfortable bed and pillows Ive ever experienced at an AirBnb  Unfortunately  we did not enjoy our stay with Zencity  Here are a few reasons why   First major reason  The key fob we were given to enter the building DID NOT WORK  We could not get access INTO the building and had to rely on waiting for other people to come and go and hope they would let us in  I contacted this listing   times during our stay to see if someone could fix this emergency issue and I did not get a response  It impacted our ability to enjoy our trip and come and go as we pleased needed  It felt unsafe to not be able to access the premises when we needed to and I did not like having to rely on strangers to let me in   The unit was not very clean  No one marked the  Cleaned By  sign to indicate that it was clean before we arrived  There was toothpaste running down the front of the bathroom vanity and pooled on the floor  The living room rug and bedroom carpet were not vacuumed  The walls are HORRIBLY dinged up  scratched  and they look blotchy and filthy throughout the entire unit  It did not make us feel comfortable  clean  or like we were getting the value for what we paid  Also  the bathroom faucet barely hangs over the sink so water pools all over the counter  The faucet is lined with mold and mildew from the constant mess  And the apartment smelled bad   The light fixtures in the bedroom dont work  One was broken and the other one didnt even have a lightbulb in it   Someone elses clothes were still in the dryer   We could not adjust the temperature   There was no mention of the rooftop hot tub on the listing so we didnt bring our bathing suits  Such a disappointment 
451408141860641682,DO NOT STAY HERE     Impossible to get into the building and I was approached inside the entryway by a street person and had to decide whether I was gonna have to fight with my bags on me  The entry instructions DO NOT WORK  It was  am and after    minutes a security guard let me in and said he has to let ABB people in all of the time  When I got up to the apartment  it smelled horrible  I had no choice but to stay after the fight to get in  I had   nights booked but left the next morning  I doubt I will get a refund  Read the other reviews  I tried to be proactive after reading how it was impossible to get into the building  Only got canned answers with no way to contact Zencity except for the app  which they responded to hours and hours later only to ask   Do you still have a problem   This is not a safe place and whatever you do DO NOT STAY HERE  You need to not be on Air B B as your instructions and customer service are the worst 
515923092981038719,The place was real cute and good location but it wasn t clean at all  Pet hair was on the bed sheets  cobwebs in several corners and the floors were sticky  Within    minutes of being there one night I was told that I had the tv on too loud  Mind you it was  pm on a Saturday when quiet time began at   pm  Another weird interaction was that the host knocked on the door  waking us up  prior to our checkout time asking if we were leaving on time  I don t understand why that couldn t be a text or email  Beds had dog cat hair on the sheets  cobwebs in several corners  floors were sticky
450657092141655905,The host posted the wrong address on the website  I messaged them when we took off and they replied two hours after we arrived  I called customer service to tell them we were lost because of the wrong address and she hung up on me  What was suppose to the a    min drive turned into over an hour and cost      on Lyft  The microwave in the apartment was broken and the bathrooms were filthy  I messaged them and no one came out to fix it  Customer service is unacceptable  I will not be booking with them again  The only great thing was the location of the apartment and the views  Power and light district is pretty cool  Everything is in walking distance  The host posted the wrong address on the website  I messaged them when we took off and they replied two hours after we arrived  I called customer service to tell them we were lost because of the wrong address and she hung up on me  What was suppose to the a    min drive turned into over an hour and cost      on Lyft  The microwave in the apartment was broken and the bathrooms were filthy  I messaged them and no one came out to fix it  Customer service is unacceptable  I will not be booking with them again  The only great thing was the location of the apartment and the views  Power and light district is pretty cool  Everything is in walking distance 
544173182154468326,This place looks nice on paper but beware that I caught a huge rat on the premises  I also saw a second rat on the last night and heard the scratching in the walls throughout our stay  If you think that I m lying  I have pictures and videos to prove my case  Check in was delayed by a hour and I had to start online teaching in my car   Lastly  I was informed this less than an hour prior to checking in and it was a huge inconvenience  The place looks nice but a rat infestation  is more than enough to turn a nice place into a complete dump  I would hope that Zencity has eradicated these issues by now but I cannot recommend anyone staying here until they are fixed  Also  please process my full and complete refund  RATS RATS  Rats  I hope that you have called an exterminator because catching one but seeing   rats is too much for any guest  I don t want to mention the hearing rats scrape inside of the walls of this place  I would like a full refund for my trip due to this inconvenience    Sincerely   Christopher Davis
447048533184113433,Zencity lacked communication and sense of urgency when we arrived and couldn t get into our airbnb because the lock box wasn t working  A neighbor in passing had said that the girl the day before was having the same problem and couldn t get in which means that this had already been a problem that wasn t fixed before we got there  Waited outside for an hour messaging and calling and not getting replies  If it wasn t for a neighbor who lived in the building  we would have been outside for a lot longer  Once we got in  we couldn t leave because we didn t know if we could get back in which isn t cool  Had to wait another hour before they finally got someone out to the fix the problem  The place itself was okay  in a decent area with lots of stores and restaurants around  First time using Airbnb and I was disappointed by the customer service skills  There was lack of communication on Zencity s end  No one had reached out to me on how to check in until I messaged and waited a good    minutes before someone got back to me  The lock code was not working and a neighbor passing through had said he saw another girl that was struggling with the same problem the day before which means that Zencity was probably aware that this was a problem and didn t do anything about it before we had arrived  We waited outside for over an hour  We had just gotten off an   hour bus ride and really wanted to get to our Airbnb and relax and sitting outside added a lot of unnecessary stress  All while this was happening   I wasn t getting much in response to the messages between myself and zencity so I had to call several times with no success on getting in  The man that I spoke to every time was nice but also lacked communication  Said he would be in contact with us through zen city messages and I had to message him at least   times before I heard anything back  Didn t seem like anyone knew what was going on and I didn t feel like my boyfriend and I were being treated as a priority  If it wasn t for a neighbor who lived in the building  we would have been outside for a lot longer  Once we got in  we couldn t leave because we weren t sure if we could get back inside again and that was very inconvenient for us  We were upset that we were stuck and didn t feel like anyone wanted to help us  At one point  we had asked if could just get a different airbnb because we were so sick of waiting around and getting no answers  My boyfriend considered calling the people who owned the building to come and fix the problem since Zencity wasn t doing anything  Waited a total of       hours before they finally sent someone out to fix the lock box  The place itself was okay  under the bed that we slept in was super dirty and dusty and I found that out after I dropped one of my shirts down there and pulled it back out  Covered in dust bunnies and dirt  This was my first airbnb experience and it was not a great one  I think a partial refund is fair giving the circumstances we dealt with upon our arrival  It was really inconvenient and unprofessional to have us waiting outside and no one seeming to have any urgency 
443666030235721227,NIGHTMARE  This was an entirely fraudulent airbnb  Showed up at    PM with instructions to look for a lockbox with key in it  There was no such lock box  Got Zencity on the phone  talked to someone at length who could not reach anyone in charge  said they were all  remote    and we got  disconnected   Called back and was told there was no way to get me into that place but they were looking for someplace else  Periodically they said they didnt have anything until the next evening  but sometimes they said maybe they could find a place with only one bed for the night  But an hour went by  and there was no solution  I got a hold of the property manager for the actual building  and was told that the lease on the unit I was supposed to be in had ended more than a month earlier  and no one had a right to rent it on airbnb  Had to take a     uber to a hotel  Zencity then asked me to cancel the reservation and take the dispute for refund up with airbnb  I did not do that  instead I contacted Airbnb  Airbnb  to their credit  took care of it  cancelled the reservation  refunded me  gave me a discount for my next rental  and offered me a little gift  Zencity is not to be trusted unless you want to risk arriving in a strange city  in the dark  and having no place to stay 
455810760560710953,Im just going to be straight forward and address pros and cons   the pros are that the neighborhood was homely and nice  the apartment is rather spacious    the cons are the smell  the drain in the bathroom  the loud ac that doesnt work in the bedroom  and the spotty internet and TV   overall  not a great time  but it wasnt the worst address the smell problem  its genuinely disgusting  and theyre probably wouldnt be gnats if it didnt smell so bad everywhere 
443415816470873604,The lock pad wasn t set properly so we couldn t get into the apartment when we arrived  had to call and wait outside with our bags for some time to be able to even enter the unit  We were notified by management on day   of a  noise complaint  after a night of the two of us watching the   pm news on the couch  Meanwhile  we could hear every footstep upstairs  and every time the neighbors leave through the shared front door it sounded like someone was coming into our unit  which we did not complain about because we understand that this is city living   The dishwasher door spring was broken so it crashed to the floor when opening  which rolled the shelves open  and ended up in broking glasses   The worst part of the entire stay was when they sent someone to fix the dishwasher  He showed up the next day  walking right into our apartment while we were there  without knocking  through the complex door and through our front door literally into our living room while we were standing there in shock  Next  when attempting to use the oven  it immediately made the smoke alarm go off because the oven was so dirty greasy  They sent someone to clean it  and it was still dirty enough to set the smoke alarm off during preheating which made the oven unusable  and during a   week stay  this was a problem   At one point the outdoor side gate was open when I came home at night and was unable to be closed locked  The Wi Fi was slow most days and was completely out on others  They finally had to provide a hotspot so I could work from home  Most cabinet drawers were broken  The couch is stained and the springs feel like they are about to come through the top of the cushion  The unit was not clean properly   there was hair and debris all over the living room rug and spiders in the corners  Many of the messages I sent about these issues were not responded to  Overall I m shocked that Zencity is allowed to manage Airbnb s  and I could never in good conscience recommend this place for anyone to stay for a significant amount of time

481179784441823796,The main reason I decided to book this place is because I was told there would be garage parking on Pine St  The key fob for the garage did not open the gate and I was forced to park on the street  I was on a cross country trip with valuables in my car and did not feel comfortable leaving my car outside of the parking garage  As I approached my car the next morning I saw I was given a     parking ticket as well  I am extremely unhappy with everything that has transpired  Who ever runs this spot needs to check in and make sure the key fob actually works because it did not for me  The main reason I decided to book this place is because I was told there would be garage parking on Pine St  The key fob for the garage did not open the gate and I was forced to park on the street  I am on a cross country trip with many valuables in my car and did not feel comfortable leaving my car outside of the parking garage  As I approached my car this morning I saw I was given a     parking ticket as well  I am extremely unhappy with everything that has transpired and am requesting a refund  Who ever runs this spot needs to check in and make sure the key fob actually works because it did not for me  I am lucky no one decided to break into my car as I have been told not to park on the street at night in this area 
481163132444792456,No heat made the stay VERY uncomfortable  The heat was not turned until we were leaving  The thermostat was locked and could not be adjusted by us  Either give the tenant control or respond to their requests  I called every day and I received promises with no results  This is totally unacceptable  We had to wear our winter coats inside the unit   There were a couple of other items   The toilet seat was very loose  I hand tightened it but someone needs a screwdriver and a wrench   Coffee pods and a Keurig would be a nice touch   A set of measuring coups would be helpful   The lack of heat made the stay VERY unpleasant  
481119350844157433,Very horrible experience at this place I don t recommend this place for anyone There were some many things wrong I don t know were to start the door to enter the apartment building was broke was out there for   mins before a resident walked up and was like it s broken it s a trick to getting  Then once we were about enter the Elevator she informed me that dog had urinated into the elevator which no one clean up  Which almost vomited the smell was so Disgusting  Then the style of the apartment was almost like loft style in which I was assuming I was getting two Separate bedrooms  Then the  st bedroom had a dirty used diaper in the closet and the laundry room had an used tampons in there  The whole experience there was just disgusting and had me sick to my stomach
480001887874228616,Let me start off by saying I NEVER write long reviews  However  if I could give this property zero stars  I would  I had high hopes  even though this property had no reviews  because I ve booked with Zencity before  But NEVER AGAIN  The photos listed are of a totally different property  I have proof   The place was FILTHY  There was urine in the toilet  dirt and grime in the shower  and the sofa had stains on it  Not to mention there was a crackhead on the steps in the lobby  The host s communication is terrible  It took hours for them to respond  They only offered to send a housekeeper the next day and did not even acknowledge the fact that the photos on the listing did not match the property in person  I ve never had a problem with AirBnB until now  Even they were hesitant to refund my money  My trip to STL was RUINED because of Zencity and AirBnB  Do yourself a favor and don t book  I am extremely disappointed with my St  Louis stay  The property was inaccurate and not clean  Do better 
479221355011536269,Unit was not clean  Found cockroaches  Left and rebooked elsewhere  Will not book with this company again  I did not think they handled the situation appropriately

526805539790559911,A disappointing experience for a vibrant city    Lack of Building Access   After following the instruction on the directory  I was not presented with a prompt for building access  I repeatedly made a request to ZenCity to provide a key card as an alternative to dialling a keypad and voice activated responses  I was only able to access the building via building tenants allowing me to tailgate   Loud Air Conditioning  that is intermittent in air and temperature  If you are interested in sleep  I would say you might find you are challenged but the auditory abuse of this appliance    The following were additional items of question             Exposed Duvet without a duvet cover as bedding             Thin walls  can hear the footsteps of neighbours and conversation in the next door and above 
495669923213027413,Spacious  sparsely decorated apartment in a Good location   Be prepared to live out of your suitcase as there are no clothes dressers to place your garments during your stay   Hopefully Zencity will have replaced the missing blinds in the bedroom so you will have a modicum of privacy   With  luck  the furnace will be working your entire stay  it only operated for the last day of our four day rental   We froze and complained for three days and Zencity did nothing   Oh  and keep your fingers crossed that the sinks in the bathroom drains   We didn t have use of one bathroom for three days because our repeated  respectful requests to have it repaired  and to get the heat turned on  were ignored   I ve heard that Zen is a path towards happiness  but the road Zencity will put you on is a rocky  unpleasant path to frustration  Furnace did not work  sink did not drain and it took you three days to fix those significant problems   You never did repair the missing blinds in the bedroom   Your failure to act showed disdain for your customers

442718038979971606,DONT GO TO THIS PLACE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT  The most stupidest place I ve ever been to please go somewhere else even a motel would be a easier stay  Got to the freaking place the code on the lock box didn t work called and the lady was like are you sure you re at the right place yes I was at the right damn place  Are you sure you re at the right lock box there s only one lock box  Are you sure it s number    Yes  She gave us like     codes to try none of them worked  Was asked this for a damn hour  Ended up telling us to walk a couple blocks to the other Airbnb that they also have at like midnight  Would of drove but I already payed for my parking  Ended up there code didn t work for the entrance to the apt  Someone finally let us in get to our room the code for the door doesn t work  Had to call for the  RD TIME  Had to wait for another    mins finally got the right code  The place was on the  th floor not the   st like the place I wanted  The place was awful compared to what I wanted to stay at  Honestly want a reimbursement  But Foreal don t go       Sorry if I don t make since still so pissed on what happen Worst stay I ve ever had  Had better at     motels  Honestly want a reimbursement  I got to the right place couldn t get in because the codes weren t working for the box  I kept being asked the same freaking question when I told the person on the phone what was happening  You sure it s number    Yes told her it was    times was on that phone forever  Ended up having to go to a another Airbnb that you guys had that was not even as nice as the one I payed for  Code didn t work for the door had to call again for the  rd time  Finally got around   am than got woken up at    am could of let us stay longer since you guys messed it all up on your end 
490547294045883612,Disappointed in our stay  Unit is a great location  clean  and had towels  dishes    Those are literally the only good things about the trip  Where do I begin  Upon check in  it was    degrees  We attempted to adjust the thermostat  It was only blowing cold air  We notified the host immediately and did not receive a timely response  When they did respond  their advice was to use the extra blanket  which was a sheet   I was freezing so we left to meet up with friends thinking surely the host would be over soon to take a look  Nope   Upon our return  the temperature was    degrees  I called the host  He said he would call back in   minutes  At   AM I received a response  We had an absolutely awful night  No one ever came to look at the place  We found a service slip that said the thermostat was  broken and unable to cycle dated a few months ago  The unit needs repaired    We did not have time to find another place to stay so we made it work  Upon checkout  the clean people came before we had even vacated  Not impressed and we will never use Zencity again    The complete lack of communication and lack of basic temperature control was completely unacceptable  Terrible communication  We needed assistance for a comfortable stay and got literally no help 
456695657214884495,I was really looking forward to staying here for a few days  Check in was at    they didn t send check in instructions until    pm  To which i found out address on the listing was wrong  I could not get in the building because the code box was broken  they had no alternative except have someone let you in  Their keyfob did not work either  I was left on hold for over    mins and then the rep hung up  Defeated i decided to stay at a hotel instead  They never called or messaged me back  If you re able avoid this company at all cost  This isn t my first mishap with Zencity Terrible communication 
465046244966541372,I was excited to stay at this unit for my trip to see a Bears game   I had a later flight  so was glad they had self check in   I assumed because this was a company as the host and not just an individual person  they would have someone on call      for any questions    I arrived at the unit and used the instructions to check in that were given to me earlier in the day   I didn t have an issue getting into the building  but when I tried to enter the code into the smart lock on the unit door it did not work    We tried several times then received an obnoxious alarm from the lock  likely meaning too many attempts   I messaged the host and called them   times   Only to sit on hold with elevator music once for   minutes   When the host responded via message about    minutes later they gave me a new code to try on the lock that I tried twice and it also did not work     I ended up leaving and going to search for a hotel to stay instead    I did contact Airbnb and I did end up getting a full refund

536997305275825932,My group and I chose this AirBnB for the location and value  and while it is in a nice part of town  we could not have been more disappointed with the apartment and our experience with ZenCity   On the day that we arrived  we found folded towels with lipsticks stains  a folded comforter with a stain  and dirt between the sheets and comforter on one bed  Between that and the dirt visible on the rug  it was clear that this location was not clean hardly at all before our arrival  We ended up having to do laundry for all of the beds before we felt truly comfortable sleeping in them  There were also a couple of cracked glasses and countless scratches on the walls  but there was nothing we could do about that   The biggest issue we had was how dang COLD the apartment was  The window in the front window didnt seal properly  and so it was     degrees colder than the rest of the unit  The Nest Thermostat could be adjusted in a reasonable range  but after only about an hour or two  the heat would turn off  I assume to save money   This was at all times  not just at night  and so when we woke up or came back from a day of sightseeing  wed find a    degree apartment  I have pictures   with    hours until it reached our selected    degrees  This meant that our space was never comfortable enough to enjoy in the morning and evenings when we would WANT to use it   All of these issues went partially or fully unresolved  as ZenCity was absolutely impossible to reach out to  Every time a message came in or out  it was sent received by a new person after some time at ZenCity  which dragged   message conversations into hours long communications that would still leave the issue unresolved  It took   days for them to answer a question regarding where to dispose of garbage bags  and that was only after bringing up an additional issue on the  th  Regarding the temperature  they said that they adjusted settings on their end  only for the apartment to get slightly colder while we were asleep away   This stay and experience was honestly the only thing keeping us from having the perfect Chicago vacation  I would recommend staying as far away as possible from any unit managed by ZenCity

434782617314006258,Beware   this company is extremely difficult to work with    I came here to stay the weekend with a friend of mine  We wanted two separate sleeping spaces  this listing says it sleeps   people  Sounds great  When the trip got closer  I looked through the pictures and saw there s a double bed and a small couch  I messaged the AirBnB owners to make sure the couch is a pull out  confirming we ll have enough space    They said NO  this isn t a pull out  The couch looks like a loveseat  so I ask them if it s a big enough couch for an adult to sleep on  They refuse to answer my question and instead ask why I need to know if only   people are staying  Valid question  I respond that we aren t planning to share the bed  that s why we chose a place that fits   people  so we can spread out    I ask how they accommodate   people  They refuse to answer  I remind them that this is false advertising  and ask them to explain how they accommodate   people again  Eventually  they ignore me because I m asking for a refund    Is that allowed  To just ignore your client   Here s where it gets weirder when we show up  the couch IS a couch bed  This whole thing could ve been alleviated  It was so strange    The place is fine  the company is super difficult and does not treat its customers with respect  I d stay elsewhere to avoid a scam  I asked repeatedly how you could claim   people slept here  You ignored all my questions  Extremely inappropriate behavior for a business  That s a very valid question 
434712312815766952,WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN   When I arrived to the building I looked at the entrance directions that were sent by Zencity  They appeared to be very clear and I assumed I would have no problem   I WAS WRONG  First off you have enter THREE codes to get to your room  First  to get to the lobby you have to  enter the unit number on the intercom   sure no problem  First I enter      THE UNIT NUMBER   the buttons stick and enter           Great  after a few tries i get it enter     properly  Then the speaker box rings where then im supposed to say another passcode into the speaker box  The speaker rings once then I get an error message  unable to complete call    So after    minutes of trying to figure out what is happening someone happened to be leaving the lobby and asked  Air BNB  This happened to me too  Someone let me and activated the elevator for me  They told me it happened to them too  But its fine when you get up there youll have a key waiting and you can use it to get in from now on  Okay so annoying but no big deal  He lets me up  I get upstairs and enter my room with a THIRD CODE  I get in the room and there is no key  NO KEY  So now I cant leave the building without having repeat this entire process  I send a message to Zencity   no answer  I call the phone number and get a hold of someone named Asheen  Hes the lone guy managing the phones for the all the Zencity Airbnbs  He tells me it can take       hours to get me a key      Im here for    hours how is this going work when I have to leave for business  Then he says he has a new code for me to try so I go back downstairs and try it  it doesnt work    So now im STUCK in the lobby with no ability to get upstairs  Asheen tried a few more codes and even he couldnt decipher what the instructions meant  So then he got off the phone to try to get a hold of someone else in the company  I sat in the lobby for    minutes to an hour with NO IDEA when id get back upstairs  And even if I did i still wouldnt be able to leave to conduct the business I traveled to do  I eventually get a call back with a code to a lockbox that has an extra keycard   If not for Asheen continually calling to other Zencity employees I would have been stuck there for who knows how long  I then requested a call back from management about the issue which I NEVER GOT   If I was an older person or a foreign traveler it would have been so much harder to figure this out and could have been much worse   What kind of person thinks THREE DIFFERENT security codes is a good plan to enter a building  elevator and room is a good idea  If your phone dies or you lose it your screwed  if you dont write the code down on paper and lose it your screwed  if you arrive and you dont have  key card and you cant get a hold of someone youre screwed   I was the third person this happened to THAT DAY   Just stay somewhere else that has a normal entrance process instead of something thats more of a pain that entering the Pentagon  Have someone who can actually explain something properly rewrite the  how to get into the building  section  Also no one wants to enter   different codes to get into a building  Its obnoxious
545611601510146450,Great safe on site   The front desk staff is amazing    The location can t be beat   I had a horrible sewage stench in my unit   It was unlivable   Maintenance agreed  but zencity did nothing about it and management would not return my repeated calls and emails  I do not recommend   While it is a great value and location  zencity is I responsible and unreliable should something go wrong with one of their units  I wanted to love this place   It would have been a great value while I stayed in St  Louis to be with my hospitalized mother   However  the unit smell horribly   I begged to be moved and while everyone acknowledged the smell of sewage that permeated throughout the unit and even agreed that no one else could stay until the problem was fixed  no one helped me   My repeated requests were ignored 
455789212744246107,This place is the worst Airbnb I ve ever experienced  The place is very super dirty  We walked barefoot in the room and our feet were dark  Dust is everywhere in the room especially on the carpet in the living room  My one year old niece sat there and she got rashes all over her legs  We also found glasses and foods on the floor too   I smelled like someone head on the pillow in my bedroom which was very disgusting  I knew right away they didnt change the bed sheet for us   When I first used the microwave  I found a piece of chicken left in there   I told the host what we faced  and the cleaner came to clean again after   days The communication was very bad because you would get reply in a few days or never  The ONLY good thing about this place is location    Place looks exactly like in the photos  If the host care more about cleanliness  this place would be great

528327150442913549,The Good  Clean  convenient location  quiet  decent price for what you get  bedrooms spacious and comfortable  The Bad  Hokey gaps in the LVP flooring and bad drywall repairs  could use more towels and washcloths considering we got   towels and   washcloths for a   person   day stay  the pictures make the living room look big but in reality the furniture is very small and uncomfortable to sit in  Is like the whole area was designed for someone who is      The post says no parking  but we were given parking by the building and then had it taken away the last day  Theres a parking garage about a block away for     a night  but street parking is very limited    Note  If these things dont matter to you and youre just looking for somewhere to crash while you explore St  Louis  then its not too bad considering the price and location     mins from downtown   We really didnt mind  but I figure people should know the reality of what they are paying for

546333153971527101,Unit        the place it s self is fine    However   it is a two bedroom that has only one key for the apartment and only one key fob to enter the apartment complex   The unit is on the   th floor that requires key fob the enter building and key fob to access the elevator    Entry to the unit requires another key   We had two business travelers and Zencity  refused to help us secure another key and fob for our four day stay   We had to hide a key in the hallway  on an emergency exit sign so we both had access to the unit    Anytime one left or one of us went to bed we had to hide the key on the exit sign  Luckily building security was kind to us and let us in the building when needed and got us on elevator that you needed key fob for   There was no where to hide the  Fob so one of us always had to have it  This was business travel and my coworker and I were on different schedules   Total inconvenience   After a long day of travel and checkin issues  followed by calls to Zencity customer service about the key issue  decided to take a shower the first night   There was zero hot water in the unit   Called Zencity again their response was there is low water pressure in the building run the water for a longer period of time    Ran all faucets for    minutes no hot water   Zencity informed after a    hour travel day they may be able to have someone come look the next day   Eventually located the hot water heater on my own   Was in a trap door in kitchen area about   feet above ground   Also located fuse box  on my own and ended up fixing the issue on my own   Had to trip the breaker for hot water heater   times during stay   On check out day we were    minutes late when clean services miraculously showed up on time    miraculous  because we had zero customer service for our issues the entire stay but the turnover service was ready to roll   Check out was at       a m  By        a m   we were out the door and I began receiving phone calls threatening late check out fees    We were late because we had no hot water the morning of check out and had to restart again   By this time  I had lost patience with Zencity and was not too calm with those calling me about late check out   When I arrived home   hours later I had an email from Zencity stating there was a stolen item and they wanted       The device  supposedly stolen is call a Minut device   that apparently reads the decibel level in the unit to ensure there are no parties   I Was sent a picture of the device that we never touched  still intact    However  I think someone must have stolen their coffee maker at one point because there was not on in the unit   First time I ve ever had an Airbnb with no coffee maker   Despite those issues the unit itself was fine   Needs some paint   However   the management group Zencity  is more like ZENSH  TY   Will never stay in a unit managed by them     Building security tho A    those guys saved us  
458630309493751596,Nice location  pretty clean  had a few things broken unable to use and poor communication on host end  I was very dissatisfied with my stay  Mostly because of the poor communication  Thing were broken and and I felt as if you all didn t care enough to communicate with me about concerns   I am still waiting on response from you all 
518069187015067317,The apartment wasnt clean properly  The floors were dusty and there were roaches  There were roaches even in the dishwasher  I dealt with the roach issue since I didnt have time to pack my stuff and move to a new location since I was there for work  I also had already paid for a months stay and they were not giving me a refund  When I addressed the issue the company offered a  courtesy tidy up  mid month  I emphasized that clean the apartment wasnt going to solve the issue and that they needed pest control  I requested to be moved to another building but they could not accommodate me  On my last day at the apartment  someone tried to break in  The only reason they could not enter is that I had an anti burglary lock on the door  After the attempted break into the apartment  I decided to leave  I wasnt issued a refund not even for the remaining weeks I already paid for  This was my first experience using an airb b and it was a terrible experience 
451466196885365584,I got locked out and had a door code that worked earlier  I had to sit in the hall for and hour with my work equipment because check in was delayed  The instructions were  the most vague information I have ever read 
518168969844162315,Solid location  It s about      minute walk from blue line metro station and a bus that can take you to Gold Coast  Decently safe area  the specific street the apartment is on felt safe   The apartment was clean but had a weird smell in it  Not bad just an old kind of smell  There were air fresheners but they were empty    I extended my stay an extra day and was locked out of the apartment the night before the last day  which was very frustrating  It took me    minutes to get ahold of someone to provide a working code  After I checked out  I received a claim that I broke one of the ceiling fans and should pay      This unit didn t have a fan and the screenshots were definitely not from this place   Overall decent stay and the price was very reasonable but working with the host company was not great 
462273609039134980,I was in my apartment and someone who doesn t even stay there walked into my place  It was scary  The host wouldn t even respond  I got it recorded also  It was very weird Hey I been trying to reach out to you all for the longest  I have a recorded conversation on the phone with you all while someone walked into my location that wasn t staying there  They already had the key pad entrance  I was scared of my life especially with everything going on in this city  The girl didn t even belong in the building
507105934490869512,This property is not as expected   Though they advertise exceptional clean there was still hair in the shower drain   There were holes in the walls where the blinds had been pulled out of the wall  There were tiles missing off the bathroom walls  The worst part is the room is right next to the elevator  an elevator that  squeaks    So every time the right elevator goes up or down  day or night  you hear it   The room is so hot you have to turn on the room unit which goes on and off constantly and is in the living space so you will need to constantly adjust the TV volume  the air unit also has a terrible oder for the first day   I contacted Them within the first   hours of checking in with concerns   they did offer many other options in the near area  Now they want me to pay      fee for a missing key fob  that opened the main door and elevators  
480453736984813328,I m sure they re fine   but they need to be more understanding of things that are out of someone s control like having to check out early  I checked out a day early due to a family emergency and was able to recoup    of that due to their lack of understanding 
480413420847547131,DO NOT STAY WITH ZENCITY   We were never able to actually access the apartment  the key was missing   After we messaged them about the problem  Zencity apparently knew that it had been missing since October  th and didnt do anything about it   They didnt have anywhere for us to stay so we ended up sleeping in our car   Thanks for nothing  assholes
461602142539336460,It s dirty and stinky not worth even a dolor I was going to stay here when I got to the place first had problems just to be able to get in then once in the building the smell was horrible and then got to the apt it was so dirty I decided to cancel and they didn t refund my money because of they re canceling policy but if I m sopposed to get a clean apt and get the opposite I should have gotten my money back oh and the place looks nothing like the pictures It s dirty and stinky not worth even a dolor I was going to stay here when I got to the place first had problems just to be able to get in then once in the building the smell was horrible and then got to the apt it was so dirty I decided to cancel and they didn t refund my money because of they re canceling policy but if I m sopposed to get a clean apt and get the opposite I should have gotten my money back oh and the place looks nothing like the pictures
463033185283992907,Truth be told this is ALL location location location  Other then that not much more to say about the apartment  we could not get an early check in due to the apartment being clean and so we were expecting just that     far from it  unfortunate because with just basic and care and basic items the unit could be a true GEM    NO COFFEE maker  we were in town mostly for work and do rely on basic necessities and a coffee maker is one of them   no blender like I said if it wasnt for the location and rooftop not much more to say about the unit or the customer service Truth be told this is ALL location location location  Other then that not much more to say about the apartment  we could not get an early check in due to the apartment being clean and so we were expecting just that     far from it  The floors were far from being clean there were fingerprints on the stove and microwave the fridge was not clean at all there were crumbs everywhere  the bathroom tub had hair in the tub and on the wall   the tub did not drain and when brought to someones attention not much concern was given  NO COFFEE maker  we were in town mostly for work and do rely on basic necessities and a coffee maker is one of them   no blender like I said if it wasnt for the location and rooftop not much more to say about the unit or the customer service
505081726428628943,This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with Airbnb  Just Checking in is was horrible because I received a different room then what I paid for  Once I got to the new room  there were a few instructions someone forgot to mention in the email  and I was unable to get to the key fob that would give me access to the building door  Once I finally received the key fob  there was issue with the door code for the room and it took over  hrs to get into the room  The room only had one sink  located in the kitchen ONLY  and it suffered water damage in the bathroom  Finally a day before my checkout  I had no access to my room because the door code no longer worked  and it took over  hrs before Zencity decided to give me a new room for the night  This was an inconvenience for me because all of my belongings were in my room and once I got to the new for the night  there was no available WiFi and I couldn t charge my phone  Zencity was able to get me into the room early the next morning but due to the time it took I lost some wages for the day  as I was working remotely  I asked them about compensation for the trip and they still are giving me the run around  The only thing that ran smoothly   was the checkout process  That was the only good thing about this disaster of a Airbnb booking  I would not recommend Zencity to anyone  You re not missing out on anything here  there are hundreds of Airbnb I m sure are much better  and at this price point  This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with Airbnb  Just Checking in is was horrible because I received a different room then what I paid for  Once I got to the new room  there were a few instructions someone forgot to mention in the email  and I was unable to get to the key fob that would give me access to the building door  Once I finally received the key fob  there was issue with the door code for the room and it took over  hrs to get into the room  The room only had one sink  located in the kitchen ONLY  and it suffered water damage in the bathroom  Finally a day before my checkout  I had no access to my room because the door code no longer worked  and it took over  hrs before Zencity decided to give me a new room for the night  This was an inconvenience for me because all of my belongings were in my room and once I got to the new for the night  there was no available WiFi and I couldn t charge my phone  Zencity was able to get me into the room early the next morning but due to the time it took I lost some wages for the day  as I was working remotely  I asked them about compensation for the trip and they still are giving me the run around  The only thing that ran smoothly   was the checkout process  That was the only good thing about this disaster of a Airbnb booking  I would not recommend Zencity to anyone  You re not missing out on anything here  there are hundreds of Airbnb I m sure are much better  and at this price point 
542068078082406212,I wouldn t come back here  My experience was bad  But you could try your luck  You need to work on your units  How could I pay all that money just to not have a wifi for my whole trip and don t have control of my own unit temperature 
539848184352805552,I highly recommend NOT staying here  The owners are corporate  the walls are thin as paper thin and efficient  communication is challenging to say the least  ZERO stars  Look up the definition of empathy 
542094722739784568,Avoid at all costs   The company is shady as hell and looking to milk you for every dime  Beyond that  the unit has no end of problems  I signed for an extended   month stay and regretted every second of it     Leaky upstairs neighbor pipe caused damage to the ceiling that now constantly drops powdered drywall an the counters   A heating system that you cant controle  Runs full blast while its in the   s  but turns off for days when its    outside   Barely stocked kitchen makes cooking nearly impossible   No parking at all  Youll have to try your luck with street parking   Internet down roughly half the time    Wall a c units that can barely keep you cool when its in the high   s  and cant outpace the radiator that is always running   If you need somewhere to stay then do yourself a favor  Sleep outside  Itll be nicer 
460117308213120441,I d probably avoid booking here    We were really excited for this place  But sadly reality didn t match the pictures    Cons  When we arrived we realized we had not received the check in information that we were told  I will be in contact closer to your arrive for a smooth check in   The check in was anything but smooth  We were unable to enter the building using the provided code and had to call for a second time within    minutes of arriving to be let in  The first phone call was to receive the check in information and codes and the second call was when the codes failed to work  Then the door to the unit had issues opening for the first time  we had to use tricks such as pulling the door so that the lock would properly work  We were told we would be able to use a key fob found within the unit to enter the building on our own  The fob did not work and this was where communication started to decline  The first three calls were resolved quickly  however  the fourth phone call did not result in the same  This communication took from   pm  Thursday night      pm  Friday afternoon  to hear any sort of update  despite asking for an update  we were trying to determine if we were able to leave and come back on our own or if we had to call every time we wanted back in the building  Thankfully other residents in the building understood how horrible the Airbnb is with their guests and were nice enough to let us in  The residents  three different residents mind you  also noted that other Airbnb guests were having similar issues and that this is an incredibly annoying issue to continue to have    The unit itself isn t bad  I m just a bit confused about what our clean fees covered  There were visible dirt burn marks on the carpet  dust on surfaces  and what looked to be pieces of food left in the sink  which may have been due to the kitchen sink draining terribly slow or the food disposal being broken   The floors also looked as if drinks had been spilled and not clean because it was still sticky and black  The ice tray in the freezer looks like it has melted and refrozen as a large block that was unusable  There were dents and scratches throughout the entire apartment that were not shown in the pictures prior to booking    The air conditioning was awful and did not work  Luckily we had beautiful weather so it wasn t unbearable but it would never adjust below     The air filter was also a disgusting brown color   Pros  It was a decent part of town that wasn t far from anything we wanted to do  The bed was comfortable  it does squeak some  but not too bad  The gated parking lot is also a great feature    Overall the unit has a lot of potential to be an incredible stay  but sadly the technical issues of allowing us to freely enter drastically dampened our impression of the host and their ability to meet explicit expectations laid out in the booking summary we used to make our decision to stay here  I would not stay here again 
519629430482373855,Not so Zen w  Zencity  I stayed here one     night  maybe      hours  Upon arrival the hallway on the way to the unit was very smoky  no problem no complaint  I enter the unit and while doing my usual walkthrough I notice the clean job is not so clean  again no problem no complaint  I search Airbnb to see if maybe I could find another place but nothing was available with such short notice  I run to the store and buy clean supplies etc then return to scrub down the kitchen  bathroom and whatever those stains were on the couch  Again no problem no complaint  I put a sheet over the couch so I could watch some tv and order dinner  After all that I was finally able to relax and go to sleep  I never once messaged or called the host and I certainly had no intention of doing a negative review  I woke up  wiped the bathroom back down after showering and placed all of my towels in the hamper they provided  After check out I then receive a request for      from Zencity saying I busted a hole in the closet door  With   picture showing a hole in the interior of a closet  I decline the charge because I did not nor have I ever caused any damage to any Airbnb  and I ve stayed in plenty   Furthermore  I didn t even use it at all being that my visit was so short  I have never had a host try to blame or charge me for any damages  Especially after I clean etc just to be able to stay the night there  This host has presented themselves as very dishonest in practice and is trying to pull one over on me 
519613259964058632,Terrible check in process Terrible check in process
459367597725299060,The original confirmation code did not work and had to call for a new one  The room was subpar clean and most importantly  did not include a fob key  This is a major issue because you need the fob key to access the elevator  After addressing the information and asking for a full refund  Zencity has yet to respond to me    Would NOT recommend 
495714905389925398,Let s start off with THE PICTURES ARE NOT THE APARTMENT YOU STAY IN  The place wasn t dirty but the walls were dirty  It does not have a fire place  it smelt like kitty litter but that could be do to the water damage in the kitchen  the water in the shower was Luke warm  you have to pay to park on the block Mon   Saturday between  am    pm after that it s free  The building is out dated  The windows are drafty so we had to cut the heat up to    while sitting in the living room   THE PICTURES ARE NOT ACCURATE  Let s start off with THE PICTURES ARE NOT THE APARTMENT YOU STAY IN  The place wasn t dirty but the walls were dirty  It does not have a fire place  it smelt like kitty litter but that could be do to the water damage in the kitchen  the water in the shower was Luke warm  you have to pay to park on the block Mon   Saturday between  am    pm after that it s free  The building is out dated  The windows are drafty so we had to cut the heat up to    while sitting in the living room   THE PICTURES ARE NOT ACCURATE 
513834683561658827,I left my hat at the location which I understand is totally my fault  I reached out in hopes they would be able to return it to me and provide me with a way to retrieve it  It was a very expensive hat  They told me they would send me a shipping label when they find it  They ignored all messages after that and I never got a shipping label  You all are terrible at responding to messages 
510896136481122923,There were so many issues with this unit and building   To start we got to the building to retrieve the key   fob  The code didn t work to get the key   After calling they had to see if there was any other way to get a key  Finally got one out    We got to the unit  it was clean  The bed only had a sheet on it  KC in December you need a comforter    After going to dinner and coming back  the fob didn t grant access to the building  I called the host  Their solutions were calling other units in the building to let in  that didn t work so we were told they many need to put us up in another place  Finally after an hour we got in  Again cold outside December KC    The next day  went to lunch and came back  Again the fob didn t work  I called again and they reached to maintenance   I was told I would get a call back  After   hours of no call back  I called them back so we could leave the building  Their solutions   they would be able to get a replacement fob the next day  they day I check out  Then to get in find someone s else entering the building and sneak in behind them    I told them that I have medication I need access to  All I got was sorry that s the only solution we can offer    Finally I asked if there was any spare fobs at all that I could have access to after an hour on the phone  They had to call maintenance again  Finally worked  I ve still not received a call back on the poor experience  Not having access to the unit I rented is such a big disappointment  It s something you pay for  On top of it  they told me the comforter was missing when it was never there    I expected much better from ZenCity  I really need a call back from someone  This has been the worst experience I ve had  I didn t have access to the unit multiple times in the cold  The solution you gave was for me to sneak in when someone else buzzes in  Then you were going to give me a new fob the day we checked out  Someone needs to contact me
498606907356366461,This place was not clean at all upon arrival  I wouldnt suggest staying here  There were at least   flies in the room and outside the bathroom there was a splatter on the wall with hair stuck to it  The carpets were clearly not even vacuumed and there were pieces of trash still left around  Great location but not very happy about our stay here  This place wasnt clean at all     
546349262488271362,Zen needs to have a better logistic when it comes to paying attention to clients  I waited   hour and    minutes unable to access the building  Tried contacting the host several times and the only response that I got   several hour later  was to remember my check out  disregarding my inconvenience 
500765823175764405,Sent a private message to this owner about our experience  After   days  They finally reached out with a saved message sent to all their disappointed customers   Thanks but no thanks    Move on to the next    when searching Already sent and it took you   days to respond
520875919630513180,Still waiting for refund  Zencity  the host company  provided several options for check in time when I made my reservation  I chose  am  The night before my reservation  Zencity wrote to me with the check in instructions and told me I could not check in until  pm  When I explained that my reservation was for a  am check in  they just said  Airbnb made an error  and would not let me check in 
507287104230923961,Ok  here we go  first  the cost was supposed to be       yet I was charged        And second your heating cooling system is crazy  According to maintenance floors     are controlled by the single apartment on the floor whole wants it warmest when the heat is running or coldest when the air conditioning is running  There were six night when I had to stay with a friend  Finally I had to purchase a       BTU inside A C unit because the heat was set at    degrees  According to the Mayo Clinic the most healthy temperature to sleep at in between    and     I am demanding a credit of       over charge            days unable to sleep there          Price of A C  Totaling          Ok  here we go  first  the cost was supposed to be       yet I was charged        And second your heating cooling system is crazy   According to maintenance floors     are controlled by the single apartment on the floor whole wants it warmest when the heat is running or coldest when the air conditioning is running   There were six night when I had to stay with a friend   Finally I had to purchase a       BTU inside A C unit because the heat was set at    degrees   According to the Mayo Clinic the most healthy temperature to sleep at in between    and      I am demanding a credit of       over charge            days unable to sleep there          Price of A C   Totaling           Should this Demand not be met  I as an attorney will not only file for damages   I will simultaneously send out Press Releases  For Immediate Release 
460693093614231101,This is ran by a company  not an individual  They could provide a working key fob for me to get into the apartment  After speaking with a rep on the phone  and being locked out of the apartment  they couldn t call me back to let me know about a replacement key fob  They still tried to charge me to stay in this apartment after they couldn t provide a working key fob  and after they couldn t return a phone call to let me know whether or not they had a replacement fob  I would not recommend renting from them  Not trust worthy 
526722183716743234,I booked this place and requested a early check in on the form in two locations  I explained I was a  rd shift worker and travelled four hours straight from work  I needed to check in early to sleep  They accepted my reservation request and never gave me check in instructions   They also never informed me until I arrived that my request wasn t approved  Had they told me  I would have gone somewhere else that could accommodate me  They refused to refund all my money  They ad also says free parking but if you look harder within the ad  it also says no parking on site  This place is also in a very dangerous park of down and looks nothing like the pictures  There is no one on site to help you  I booked this place and requested a early check in on the form in two locations  I explained I was a  rd shift worker and travelled four hours straight from work  I needed to check in early to sleep  They accepted my reservation request and never gave me check in instructions   They also never informed me until I arrived that my request wasn t approved  Had they told me  I would have gone somewhere else that could accommodate me  They refused to refund all my money  The ad also says free parking but if you look harder within the ad  it also says no parking on site  This place is also in a very dangerous park of down and looks nothing like the pictures  There is no one on site to help you 
473887879528816877,Awesome clean location just not good communication as am still awaiting replies for things left behind  Left my camera there have contacted the host and no reply as of yet  Have filed police report and will be reviewing footage  Please contact             Jordan  Thank you
515925111268273555,There were stains on the carpet and none of the remotes worked  The first thing we weren t able to get in for almost an hour  The key fob didn t work  and I had to get a code    Second  the tv remote barely worked  I couldn t turn on the tv with it or change the volume   Third  the fan light remote didn t work at all    Fourth  there were stains on the Carpet   Fifth  the window was left open  and the clock had the wrong time   Sixth  there were stains in front of the window by the bathroom   Lastly  there was food or something on the picture frame that talked about the place   I have pictures videos of most of these  I usually love Airbnb and have stayed in a Zencity before  This definitely was my worse experience  I complained to Airbnb  but they told me to first talk to you 
505097591620204319,The only good part about this property was it s location  There was no parking except paid parking on the street  Apartment had roaches in the kitchen  only   blinds worked properly  so place was dark  only one of three light bulbs in bathroom worked  shower and tubs paint was peeling badly  apartment was cold and drafty especially at the window AC units radiators wake you up every morning  about   am sounding like someone hammering the pipes in your room  Management sounds like they re calling you from China with an oatmeal box and a string  This place was AWFUL 
461578127434512063,DO NOT STAY HERE    They were supposed to leave me a fob keycard to be able to get in and out of the building  in and out of the parking and to be able to use the elevator and stairwell  I rented this Airbnb as I was driving    hours for a concert  I ended up missing the concert because it took   hours to sign in due to having to have the front desk escort me around the building that way I could get into the apartment  When I called the phone number I was rudely hung up by a customer service agent of this company  It s not a apartment owner renting out there property it s a business that has multiple units and after speaking with the front desk all the other people who rented there units also had the same issue  So I ended up wasting      plus    hours and   days due to me not being able to leave the apartment  I called numerous times but they would not respond to me and when they would answer the phone I would have to explain my whole issue again for them to say we will call you back shortly and them never calling me back  Worst Airbnb experience ever  I will never be staying with you again this was a horrible experience  I still can t believe the fact that I lost my concert that I drove    hours to go just because your company forgot to leave me the keycards for the building  elevator  stairwell and parking 
516655596932253043,Although the apartment was huge and very clean  we had some major issues  Principally  when we arrived to check into our apartment  we were alerted that someone else was staying in our apartment  Although the concierge was very nice and helpful  it was a bit alarming that Zencity didn t know at first who could be staying in our apartment  We ended up finding another Airbnb in the same building  but it definitely added an element of spookiness and discomfort to our stay  Secondly  the wifi was pretty terrible  We resorted to waving around our laptops in the air in order to catch a connection  If these issues were resolved  I would happily stay here  but alas as is  I would be hesitant to book again 
547127311655412837,After our   week stay  I would recommend that you please do NOT stay here or in any Zen City owned property  Especially if considering this unit for a long term stay  I preface this by saying I travel year round for work and rent often from AirBnb  I have never left a poor review before this    During our   week stay  we encountered issues that have been mentioned in previous reviews  which shows they have never been successfully resolved  as well as new issues not mentioned in previous reviews    When we arrived  the unit smelled very strongly of sewage and or a dead animal  We notified the hosts  who sent maintenance out  Maintenance was only ever able to give trouble shooting ideas  none of which resolved the issue  and then the hosts never had maintenance come assess or try to resolve the issue again    There is also a clear issue with water in this apartment  The water would only run hot sometimes  and when it did  it only lasted between      minutes total per day depending on the day  The hosts sent someone out to address the issue  and when that repair did not resolve the issue  they never sent maintenance back to address it and it went unresolved    The city maintenance also had to shut down the water for an hour  which caused one of the toilets to stop working  We had an unusable  broken  clogged toilet for an entire week before it was fixed  as maintenance had to order and wait for a part to arrive  and we were paying for a two bed two bath the entire time  Thankfully  AirBnb support was able to process a     refund of affected nights    On top of all these individual issues  communication with Zen City the entire time was extremely vague and lacking  When I mentioned issues  I was often told they were passing it along to the corresponding team  and rarely or never received information with solid details on when or even if maintenance was going to show up  When I would check back in  not having heard anything  I was often speaking with someone entirely different than before and had to re explain issues as if they were brand new  I even communicated that no one was to knock or enter the apartment before   am  and that boundary was either not communicated from Zen City to corresponding teams or completely disregarded    as maintenance showed up at     am  We spent our entire stay waiting for issues to be addressed or resolved  and it was clear by the end of our stay Zen City was not addressing issues  but it felt they were rather waiting for us to leave  After the initial troubleshooting attempts for both the terrible sewage smell and hot water issues  no one ever came to address the issues before we left    I will never stay with Zen City again  and strongly advise anyone considering staying here not to  It s unfortunate  because the unit is gorgeous from its appearance  but entirely unlivable due to unresolved issues and horrendous communication and customer service  Our stay here was an absolute nightmare  Ive never left a poor review before this  and it makes me sad this was the case  as    solely from appearances    this unit if beautiful  However with the extreme inconvenience caused from unresolved maintenance issues including the horrid sewage smell  the hot water issues  and the broken toilet which wasnt fixed for a week  as well as with the clear gaps in communication  I am left with no choice  I highly recommend establishing better communication between your Zen City staff and your maintenance teams 
465286178909503039,I d like to preface this review by saying that I never actually write reviews  Only in cases where the experience is very good or very bad do I think it s worth the effort  My wife and I have stayed at a number of Airbnb s  and  our experiences have generally been great  Our stay with Zencity was anything but   We were staying for a week in Chicago for my work  with my wife planning to work full time from the Airbnb for the week  My wife is also pregnant  By the second day of our stay with Zencity  the unit began to reek of cigarette smoke  and was at its worst during the day for the hours that my wife was working from the unit  Secondhand smoke is a terrible risk to a developing fetus  The next morning I reached out to the host to resolve the issue  We requested either to be moved to a comparable unit or be refunded the remainder of our stay  It took multiple messages for them to respond  and even once we were in the middle of the conversation  the average response time to a message took hours  The resolution that they offered was either to move us halfway across the city to a much cheaper unit or to request that my wife find somewhere else to work for a day while they used an ozone unit to temporarily reduce the smell  even getting to this point in the conversation took over    hours   Not wanting to endanger my wife our baby  we moved to a hotel and alerted the host so that we could be refunded the remainder of our stay  The host claimed to be considering the refund repeatedly over multiple days  but on the last night of our stay  requested that we cancel the reservation  After cancelling  they alerted us that they were denying our refund request because they couldn t confirm that we weren t in the unit because we hadn t hit the  cancel  button in the Airbnb app despite informing them that we had vacated partway through the stay  Taken together  it seems as though they were just delaying responding so that they wouldn t even have to offer the     refund in their cancellation policy  Also  the TV does not work and unsurprisingly  Zencity never responded to our message at the beginning of the week asking them to fix it   This experience was all around terrible  We will never be staying with Zencity again and we recommend that you do not either 
465217841322327777,The unit is exactly as shown  The unit was NOT clean properly  Slimy sticky residue in the bottom of shower tub  The carpets were very dirty and looked as if they hadn t been vacuumed in QUITE sometime  While packing to leave  my fianc  and I seen black mold that was on the wall surrounding the window and inside the window seal near the ceiling  that was attempted to be covered by tape and paint  There is an awful smell of trash mildew that permeates throughout the unit  source unknown   Be sure to bring your own toiletries and amenities if staying longer than one night  Only two towels  two hand clothes  and two wash clothes provided for a   day   night stay for two individuals  As well as one roll of toilet paper and one roll of paper towels  There is no public parking on the premises  but several parking meters down the block and     parking garages within     blocks of the unit  The unit does have a great location and is conveniently located near Barnes Jewish hospital  Whole Foods  several restaurants bars  and shops  Unfortunately  the apartment was not clean  There is black mold growing in the windows seals  Which was covered by tape and painted so that it wouldn t be noticed  Maybe look into a different  more thorough  clean service  and have a routine check done of the apartment unit from a representative of Zencity 
572451857330439521,Terrible
495610523866159095,Good location  Apartment was ok  Unfortunately the wifi did not work which caused me a lot of troubles as I was traveling from Europe  As you know  I was very disappointed by my stay since the wifi did not work

547071512009528082,Filthy disgusting place wasn t clean at all   I found dirty used underwear on the bed   The place was cold it had air coming through the windows  When I say everything in the place was dirty down to bathroom to walls everything about the place was horrible The place was filthy disgusting it s was not clean at all   I found used underwear  When I say nothing was clean in the unit Down to covers on the bed
486940955971834301,I do not recommend  the place smelled rotten flesh and they gave me the runaround about getting it taken care of  when a guest tells you the place smells really badly you should definitely get it taken care of 
483363627233999800,Seems hit or miss on cleanliness  my stay was definitely not clean   clumps of hair on the bathroom floor  old sandwich in the fridge  and no soap in the bathroom soap dispenser  Ive reported this in several different ways but no one has responded to my request to refund my clean fee   The unit is very nice  however  and the front desk staff was very kind  Please refund my clean fee   I paid more than the price to stay in clean but there was hair on the bathroom floor  an old sandwich in the fridge  and no soap in the bathroom soap dispenser 
465124225853245363,I originally booked a room                 in The Netherlands      Main Street Kansas City Mo       through ZenCity  I was forced to check out early on            Upon check in ZenCity failed to send my access code to the key retrieval box so they had to open the box remotely  Once receiving my key and attempting several times to enter my room I discovered the key did not work  I contacted ZenCity again and they assigned me       When I enter the room the room had not been clean since the last guests stay  I contacted ZenCity again and was relocated to       The room did not have the amenities promised  The washer and dryer was not hooked up and operational as well as the refrigerator and the wifi was non existent  After waiting for the key and each room assignment I was forced to wait   hours in between call backs  I did not enter the  rd room until     pm on my check in date due to ZenCity s lapse  I woke up the next morning           with a call from ZenCity stating that I had to leave the unit and they would find me another  I was forced to cut my trip short and cancel due to the unit and area that ZenCity chose to relocate me to  It was not in the area that I had time to research and read reviews about and I was a woman traveling alone   My staycation was a nightmare 
460149608672120421,Rented one location   Got there  keypad didnt work and no property manager on site to let us in   Moved us to a  comparable  location across town   Gave us the wrong keycode to get in   Finally was able to access location which in no way  shape  or form was comparable to what we booked originally and included a backed up tub   Communication was very slow   took    hours for them to address the tub issue by text   In fairness  they were kind enough to return the difference in price between the two facilities  but I will not use this company again  When you cant get your customer in the place they booked  it would be nice if you  put them in a comparable location   Additionally  it may be wise to have a property manager in the city you are booking rooms in 
568811427041154957,The condo needs a lot of repairs and clean  The pictures seem to have a filter  everything is much older and not as nice The condo needs a lot of repairs and clean The entrance was so dirty with dirty cloths and old plastic bottles on the stairs  The windows needs to be sealed   really cold wind coming through  The bath as tapes on the tiles and the ceiling needs repair The living room window is ripped  One of rooms has a terrible mattress on an assemble bed  The furnace noise is too too loud  The pictures seem to have a filter over  Everything is much older and not as nice  I can send you the pictures if you like

568184390046866442,I would not recommend this place  The place was in disrepair and dirty  Maintenance was required so the shower would work  They stopped by while I was out of the unit  the host did not communicate well and proceeded to injure themselves while doing the repair  They tracked their blood all over unit including on the towels  They gave me the false impression that they would award my requested refund amount  equivalent to      and instead then changed the offer to a paltry amount equivalent to a night s clean fee    Do yourself a favor  stay somewhere else  If I could award zero stars I would   I arrived to a dirty  run down apartment with broken cabinets  dirty counters  and dirty towels  However I wanted to give the host the benefit of the doubt  so I told them they didn t need to come clean  just be aware   Then I noticed the shower wouldn t drain  I communicated to them that this had to be addressed ASAP  They told me that as it was the weekend  it would take two days to repair the shower  I replied that this was unacceptable and that they would need to resolve the issue that day  They then stopped replying to me    I left the unit for several hours  When I returned I noticed they had fixed the shower and injured themselves in the process  I knew because their blood was tracked all over the floor and the towels set out for my use    I then contacted the host again and demanded a discount based on my experience  They gave me the false impression that the refund amount I requested  approx      had been approved  For this reason I did not bother to follow up w AirBnB   Once I returned home from the trip I followed up with the host to inquire when my refund would be awarded  Only then was I told the host was considering IF my experience warranted a refund  Angry  I contacted AirBnB to be told because I had not contacted them sooner  it was outside their control  Even though I refrained from contacting AirBnB as the host had lied to me  implying initially the refund would be issued   The host now claims I am due a paltry refund of less than one night s clean fee  I highly doubt I will ever see even that pitiful sum  When I called AirBnB today  an agent informed me that someone else will have to call me back regarding processing the refund 
531924022203362227,Cleanliness of the room itself was okay  Ran into issues with zencity not communicating and beating around the bush when I told them the room was missing blinds making it hard to sleep  Kept saying theyd bring it to the attention of their team and schedule a time to come out  Never did  and only on the last night did they say it wasnt gonna happen  leaky shower head shot water on electronics the first night  Towels they layed out for us were also damp and smelled old  good thing they had spares  Decent parking around holidays  decent location  Gun shots from the neighbors  as expected   its St  louis  security was nice  but disappointing still Cleanliness of the room itself was okay  Ran into issues with zencity not communicating and beating around the bush when I told them the room was missing blinds making it hard to sleep  Kept saying theyd bring it to the attention of their team and schedule a time to come out  Never did  and only on the last night did they say it wasnt gonna happen  leaky shower head shot water on electronics the first night  Towels they layed out for us were also damp and smelled old  good thing they had spares

470255006035883197,FIRST OFF  UNIT IS REALLY NICE    Pros  Beautiful Views  Great Building  and Amenities    Cons  Lack of communication from ZenCity  money was stolen from unit  company accused me of smoking in unit and trying charge a      fee    We enjoyed the stay overall for our honeymoon  but with the poor communication it makes me rate this airbnb lower  After a week  still no communication from Zencity about the smoking charge and stolen money  Someone access the unit and stated they were maintenance and money was stolen  Just ruined the amazing experience  Thank you  I am still frustrated about the lack of communication regarding the unit being accessed with out any communication  and money stolen  Lack of communication and timely response to my concerns and a trump up allegations regarding smoking in the unit  Really unprofessional at the end of the day  Over all great unit and building 
465873118853613150,This was the worst experience I have ever had while traveling  The Zencity canceled my reservation right at check in time   They did not have the curtesy to call me and let me know the reservation was canceled  They did it via that app  When I call the owner  I was give no other option   I will never stay at a Zencity apartment and I would be very worried if you select them the next time you travel 
748533852,This host is a total scam  After paying for the room  no check in information was given and we were unable to access the property  After our flight landed at      pm we had to take another Uber from the property and pay for a hotel 
746866114,Fair   Had trouble getting in It was difficult to first get into the building the code provided didn t work  I had to stay on heard forever and get code that did work  Then got in the elevator it still wouldn t take us to our floor so we had to walk two flights of stairs  Get up to the room and discover the ppl before us lost the key for the doors and elevator so each time we had to take the stairs and wait for others to let us in  Then on top of tht the kitchen lights didn t work   Some one was supposed to come look at it but never did  And the desk on the side of the bed had a cigarette burn on it  Then the second day the toilet stopped flushing

746395741,The place was dirty and reeked like cigarettes  It s carpeted and it was as if someone had been smoking in there for years  I complained to zen city and they told me to crack a window and spray febreze  I don t think I ve ever written a bad review in my life  
748940121,Room wasn t ready   hours after check in  Constant smell of cigarette smoke  No key set  very difficult checking in

748889803,Neighbors were not quiet and could not sleep  There was feces in the hallway  There was no TV remote  I was briefly locked out one night when my code stopped working  Perfect location however  Neighbors were not quiet and could not sleep  There was feces in the hallway  There was no TV remote 
748119216,I m five months pregnant and this place was advertised as smoke free  Definitely not true and the entire complex filled with smoke  People down the hall were smoking weed as well  My husband and my eyes were bloodshot and we had to leave not even twenty minutes after we checked in  DO NOT stay here if you prefer a smoke free environment  ALSO they have cameras IN the apartment  Make sure you read the fine print  You know what happened
748672171,The place itself was nice  a great value    But  some issues   I couldn t get my keys from their box  so check in took about    minutes longer than it should have  late night after a long day of travel     I couldn t control the mode on the thermostat  Mode is controlled by the building  and for some reason it was set to cool throughout my trip  even though the outside temperature was in the    s   There was almost no silverware  and dishes were a little dirty   Nice restaurant in the building advertised in the listing was closed throughout my visit   Host was responsive   courteous enough  but ultimately not that empathetic to or effective at solving my issues 
516640817798806646,  Check in was terrible everything else was good
747364406,The shower was broken and they never came to fix it  I had to make a hotel reservation to shower and getting in touch with the host was difficult  The shower was never fixed and I still had to book a hotel to take a shower 
748678984,You can expect many delays with their customer service and the intercom system not working  If you dont want a headache I would chose a different building of theirs  I am sharing with you the message I sent to AIRBNB  I tried to resolve with you the issues that i expierenced during my stay on multiple conversations with your customer service and I am incredibly disappointed in your response  We have stayed with you many times and I would of hoped that you would do more to keep our business  But since you did not I had no choice but to reach out to AIRBNB and  the message I sent is below                                                                     I am contacting you about the above stay with Zencity from April  th to the   th  When I arrived they said there would be a fob to easily gain access into the building  There was no said fob and i had to use the code provided to enter the building every single time  using an intercom system  On saturday  one day after our stay  i messaged zencity twice about the fob and did not recieve a response  There were zero issues with the intercom system so i just went about my stay  On Monday the   th I tried to gain access into the building around      pm that night and I could not  I immediatly called Zencity and was on hold for a total of    minutes between two phone calls  All while im waiting in the foyer of this apartment building because i had to have a fob or key to even get into the lobby  For the next     HOURS i was stuck in the foyer speaking with zencity     mins into being in the foyer a woman came that was also staying with zencity and she was stuck with me  at the end of     HOURS there was a total of   of us that were staying with zencity that could not gain access into the apartments that they rented  While i was on the phone with the woman from customer service we tried everything  different codes  she tried calling management and they would not come  they said that they do not have a master fob in one of the lock boxes of this foyer bc they were getting new ones  I had no water  food  and no charger  my phone ended up on     so the customer service lady took down Kats  one of the other people stuck in the foyer with me  phone number so that she could call us back and she never called us back  At this time two more people joined us and they called zencity and basically the only solution was to BEG a resident to let us in and use there fob in the elevator  When i got back in my room zencity said that they could not fix the problem until at least   am in the morning     i got into my room a few minutes after   pm      so they said i had two choices        I could not leave the apartment until   am bc i would have zero access into the apartment due to the intercom system or    I could go get a hotel or a different AIRBNB  The guy on the phone said he could give me a refund of          and i basically told him that wasnt good enough because it was not going to make me whole  I had to take a     uber to my hotel that cost      for the remaining two nights of my stay  When we tried to get the refund the next morning through the message they sent it said it was expired and i could not collect  I called zencity and basically they pulled back the refund and she said that her manager would call me the following day  We are now at Thursday and no call from the manager and no partial refund  I called them again on friday and nothing  This morning i called them and he said he had to get managers approval but would be sending a refund today  We recieved a refund of      this afternoon  It wasnt even the      they first sent us   We paid zencity      for the stay and only recieved       I asked today to speak with a supervisor  i have never spoke with one as of yet even though the supervisor was suppose to call me the other day   I understand that things happen but i expected them to make us whole since it was their issue that the intercom system didnt work and it was the apartment buildings issue  I am also highly disappointed in their customer service  I would like you to please review our stay and let me know if there is anything you can do with zencity to get a more comparable refund  They did not provide us with a fob as stated and we could not get into the building for half of our stay and had to relocate and had to relocate to a hotel Customer service did not find a solution to there problem about their system not working with the intercom system  Also I was told a supervisore would call me back and never did and I was told a specific amount of a refund and i only got the partial amount that they said they would give 
748748757,Ended up canceling my stay the day of after the trouble I had and after seeing the room  Check in information was late  Bed had stains on the comforter and some blinds were broken  We also were told last minute the parking pass and parking fob were missing  thus we couldn t park there for the first night  This was a huge issue because we were from out of town and we didn t know any overnight parking areas  I understand things happen but we chose this Airbnb for its parking  We were supposed to be able to check in at  pm  I had to reach out and contact multiple people to at least get in by  pm There was a stain on the comforter right in the middle of the bed  The furniture was also a little beat up  Some breakage in the blinds Slow to respond  I had to call the help line a few times for immediate help 
750431271,Our stay in this apt was a nightmare  Stay away from ZenCity they are very clause to what can be easily defined a fraud  The apt is far away from what they advertise and even if they are promoting the Anti covid clean policy they have no idea on what is  clean   If you intend to go there this is what you should know      an house which is at the limits of safety  Screw and spikes all around which are putting at the risk the kid s safety    dirtiness allover the house and furniture fully dirty and stinky  food left inside the fridge and hairs allover   We had to clean up everything and sanitise all the furniture  Far away from the COVID policy    no blinders or curtains which are making the sleeping very difficult  I have requested several time no answers    linen and towels full dirty and full of dust  We had to go to laundry to get them clean  Most of them were used and not washed      services advertised  such as laundry machine  which are not present in the house but in a dirty and stinky basement    windows fully dirty and with sliding guides full  of dirtiness in such a way to prevent any closing creating a serious safety issue  I had to repair by myself  I have contacted ZENCITY several time to solve the issues and they haven t done a single step to resolve the issues  We were there just because close to the hospital and need to stay there but i strongly recommend all the people who want to stay in CWE to stay far from ZenCity host  also other families we met had the same problema in other apartments  Look at my pics to see the reality on how this people are managing their properties 
750976397,None I already told them everything   But the main issues were noisy all night   No towels for a four night stay and again no contact via phone   We left one day early  No phone contact in St  Louis   Only messaging notes No phone contact whatsoever   You left a note and waited 
748732878,Not a good host at all  to be completely honest  The suite  location  and pricing was all pretty decent  but we had so many difficulties with getting into our building and communicating with the host  We were given a code to get into the buildings entrance and into the elevator  but that code stopped working on the second day of our trip  The key fob they said would be in the suite was absent  We messaged and called several times about the issue  but it was always  well get back to you  or no reply at all  That  or they continously questioned our ability to reach the elevator in under    seconds even though we did it on the phone with them  We never heard back or received the key fob  and we barely could leave our suite the entire visit because we had no way to get back in unless maintenance happened to be there  Absolute mess of a trip and we will not be staying with this host again 
750351756,Where do I begin   I guess by saying PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE  SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE    Ive never has a worser experience with a stay in my life  In a nutshell     There were NO lightbulbs in the bedside lamps so I had to use the closet light for lighting in the living room  They told me they would send maintenance the next day  so I stayed in my room the entire next day waiting and they never came    The microwave AND stove BOTH DID NOT WORK  so I was unable to cook    There was LOUD construction pretty much all day   am  pm   except on Saturday and Sunday  The noise was head pounding and woke me up everyday  I was also unable to use the room as a quiet place to study     WORST COMMUNICATION EVER  If you want them to answer the phone be prepared to wait  and also pray that they actually answer and not just hang up on you after a while  The messaging was a bit faster  but they did a good job of not responding to what I was asking of them  Some instances they would completely not respond at all  or say they would get back to me and I would never hear from them again  It was very aggravating working with them    I complained about all these things and do you know what all they actually resolved  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  They couldnt even compensate me for the things that didnt work  On the  rd day I actually reached out and said I would like to cancel to receive the     refund for the days that I stayed and they didnt even get back to me  so I felt like I had to stay so it wasnt just a gigantic waste of money   I still cannot believe this place would allow themselves to provide this poor of a service to guests smh  Please do not stay here  you will regret it  Will never be booking with you all again  You all should take a great deal of more pride in the business that youre offering to people  I was overcharged for what I went through and no one helped  Ive also told people to never book here and will continue to do so  Non working amenities  no light bulbs in the displayed bedside lamps  and the  view  was just a window with another building completely in front of it  They did not send my instructions prior to check in  This made moving in a long  drawn out  and a hassle  WORST COMMUNICATION EVER  If you want them to answer the phone be prepared to wait  and also pray that they actually answer and not just hang up on you after a while  The messaging was a bit faster  but they did a good job of not responding to what I was asking of them  Some instances they would completely not respond at all  or say they would get back to me and I would never hear from them again Other than the fake view  I liked the location overall Construction in the neighboring units all day everyday  the view was not quite the  view  and very important things in the room were not working nor were they fixed 
750973765,This was my worst Airbnb experience to date and Im furious with this company    Im in St Louis visiting family but was looking for an airbnb for two nights because I had a major presentation for work and wifi was spotty where I was staying  So I reached out to Zencity before booking to ensure that wifi could reliably support zoom calls  I was assured the average wifi speed at the unit was    MPBS  So I went ahead and booked  As soon as I checked in  I tested the wifi  which hovered between   MBPs and   MBPS  never even reaching above  MBPs  I immediately reached out to Zencicty via Airbnb  told them the situation  and underscored how I needed this fixed urgently  When they hadnt responded in several hours  I found the Zencity website and found a contact email  I sent that address an email and it immediately bounced back    the email address was no longer valid  They were not contcatable    I ended up leaving the unit and taking my dispute to Airbnb  Believe it or not  in the dispute with Airbnb  Zencity has refused to give me any of my money back  I still have not heard back from my original message  which included screenshots of the abysmal wifi speed     The rates are low for a reason  avoid this scammy company  Get your act together   this is no way to run a company I specifically asked about wifi before booking  I was booking this spot because I  NEEDED wifi for a very important meeting  and where I was staying didnt have wifi  I was told wifi would be   MPs  In reality it hovered between     MBPs  I tested the wifi right when I checked in  reached out to ask for help and never heard back   I also reachedd out via the contact email address on Zencitys website  The email address was defunct and my email bounced back  Then  in disputes with Airbnb  Zencity declined to give us any kind of refund  Long story short  this company is a fraud with no care for customer service  Hair on rug I  never  heard from Zencity after reporting the wifi issues  I also reached out via their contact email address on their website  The address was defunct and the email bounced back  I ultimately had to turn to Airbnb 
751291393,great people you guys usually do a good job I dont knowcwhat happened the last   spots no coffee couldnt even change the heater it was cold and no response which was surprising cause Ive stayed with them
751629051,When I arrived at the location I followed the building entry instructions  to the letter literally speaking the codes out loud as told to do in the booking details  However  the doors would not unlock  Much to my surprise  there was another couple who had booked a Zencity listing on Airbnb who also could not get in    We had to wait in the entry until a tenant let us in the building as they exited  Now  even though we were now in the foyer of the building  we could not use the elevator as the access code at the door activated the sensor allowing us to go to our floor  but since the access code at the door didnt work  we could not get the elevators to function without a key fob  We had been told that the key fob was waiting for us upstairs so this would not be an issue moving forward  We tried calling Zencity from the phone number listed but couldnt get through  After    minutes of waiting  still unable to reach them a family arrived and graciously allowed us to ride up in the elevator to our floor  At that point another couple joined us who also was struggling with Zencity their code for the door did not work either   When we all got off at the same floor  we went to our rooms  only to discover that the key fobs were not in any of our apartments  I was finally able to reach them on the phone  but was told that the fobs had been lost previously and there was no way for us to get a new one  When I explained that that made it nearly impossible for us to enter or get upstairs due to our access codes not working  the woman on the phone insisted that the codes did in fact work  I kept her on the phone  went back downstairs  and with her still listening to me out loud tried all three codes  Not a single code for any of the rooms rented worked  I once again found myself locked out of the building unable to use the elevator  I had to wait for someone else to let me in and take me upstairs  Promptly at      p m  California time  where theyre located  the woman hung up on me despite the fact that we were still having a conversation  When I tried to call back at      PST  the phone rang and rang and rang  I attempted calling five times  They never picked up   At that point no one had responded to my pleas for support over the Airbnb messaging platform  Given that I was in town for work  and would be leaving the building frequently  the inability to safely access and use any of the entries made it such that it was impossible for me to stay  Before the woman unceremoniously hung up on me  I had requested to speak to management to get my money back because I would be checking out she informed me that was not possible    I had to go through Airbnb  who were incredibly helpful and handled the situation beautifully  in order to cancel the room and get my money back    By the time I had booked a new place and checked in  Zencity finally responded to my messages on the Airbnb platform  Reiterating they could not refund me and that they had called for maintenance to see if they could let me in the building  Their service is the worst I have ever experienced booking through Airbnb   I wish I could say I was exaggerating  but it is simply a terrible company to deal with  they say misery loves company  but there was nothing gratifying about knowing that four other individuals were dealing with the same issues  We all spoke with one another and confirmed that none of us were able to get help from them  and none of us received working access codes or fobs    If you are considering booking at this building  do not and I mean do not choose a Zencity listing  The building itself was lovely and all its tenants exceedingly helpful  but Zencity made it impossible to safely stay at the location 
462251541890733542,The location is amazing and the apartment was very clean   I would not recommend if you plan on making use of the kitchen as it was extremely limited with what is available  it shows that this was never a lived in apartment and is strictly for rentals   Communication was also an issue for us  we felt that the communication issue in having to reach out to obtain check in instructions despite being told we would be sent them  coupled with the lack of notice about maintenance on the building shutting off the water   was a real detriment to our stay     We also feel that there is a lack of basic necessities in the apartment in regards to the kitchen   i e  no pot holders   no salt or pepper shakers
752466443,Weird smell no parking This place had a weird smell and holes in some walls  Needed to be clean bad     
752278410,Pictures do not match  the place  Was very unclean and we ended up canceling our reservation  The whole apartment was dirty  Dig said it hadn t been clean since      and it showed  Yellow stains in towels and sheets  Holes and markings on walls throughout Bathroom fixtures and flooring were dirty  Window shades in the first bedroom were broken  and a chair had a white stain on it  Overall we did not feel comfortable  I have many pictures I can share upon request  Pictures from the listing did not match what the actual apartment looked like  Parking was very confusing Dirty throughout the apartment  Holes and marking all over walls  Yellow marks on towels and bed sheets  Spider webs in corners  Card in apartment said it hadn t been clean since       two whole months  Dirty floors especially in bathroom  Shower walls and shower has were filthy  I took pictures so they ar available upon request  Late responses
751229697,We stayed   nights  We were told there would be a key fob once we got initial entry  Well there wasnt a fob and there was no access to laundry facility or anything else  Very disappointed  Wont use again  stuck outside for over    minutes Being stuck at front entrance multiple times with it being between    to over    minutes was very irritating  no access to laundry facilities also frustrating  Dont feel you advertise correctly with washer dryer mentioned in headline but there isnt   in apartment   with no key fob I didnt have access to other floors  So what was supposed to be a relaxing little weekend get away turned out to be   frustration after another  Very disappointed  
751946101,Arrive early enough that theres someone to help when you cant get in because of a bad code for the door or keyholder  Prepare to brush your teeth in the kitchen sink  Please check your own codes to make sure they work  Check in was the worst experience Ive ever had  And there is NO sink in the bathroom  Had to use kitchen sink and they did put a mirror over it but just not usable  I had to call twice as neither the door code would work  someone from the building saw me struggling with it and let me in when I explained  then the key code would not release the door to get the key  I did call host again and got a really nice lady who worked with me to get the key to get in  it was cold and rainy and was standing outside in it trying to resolve the issue  no sink in the bathroom 
753332546,hidden camera s in bathroom
751499635,We were trapped in our room  The key wasn t there to get into the building and the intercom to get into the building was broken  They gave us a refund but we were trapped in the room all evening and night  The only way to get into the building and elevator was to ask a resident of the apartment building to let us in  There was no one near enough to bring us a key  This place is a corporation and didn t have any way to accommodate us  The workers we talked to on the phone were nice but took    minutes to answer every time and couldn t help us 
563836979108308594,Wasn t pleased with the stay   I was Looking for a place with free parking   a kitchen in a good location  Although it had all three   when we first arrived the person said he was new   didn know what to do when it came to the zencity apartments  His manager was in a meeting   he was waiting on her to call back  Then they couldn t find the key  Finally found the key   Got in the apartment   it was just not what i expected   There was stains on the counters   handles on the cabinets  Also smeared glass   microwave  The inside of the of the sink drain was yellow   Like bad rusted   Immediately I sent The owner pictures because we was writing each other back   forth because of the issue with the key   suddenly he stop writing me   I had To go out   get clean supplies   other stuff to make myself a little comfortable  The owner responded   hours later   The place wasn t that much so i guess You get what you pay for   Wouldn t stay again As i told You before the house wasn t clean   For it to be Covid going on you would think the place would be clean   sanitized 
752428271,We Were unable to enter property via intercom  there was no access fob in location  While likely just taken by last guest unintentionally  there was no communication or resolution  We had another stranger let us in the building hours later to collect our bags and ended up paying for a hotel  Cute place though  When we had to be let in and searched the entire place for the fob it started as funny and expected  With    hours and no resolution ever offered I had to get a hotel just so we could have someplace to stay we didn t need to rely on a stranger letting us in the building  Unable to use intercom to access  no fob for access in room after another person let me in  It took    hours for them to respond and I ended up paying for a hotel
754357083,Location and size is great but be prepared for a dirty apartment  Even after cleaners came back  it was still filthy  Hair and dirt all over the floor  a small blood stain on a comforter  sinks and tubs that don t drain and have gross stuff backing up  and gross stained couch and chairs  The kitchen is equipped with dishes but not any salt and pepper  oil  hotpads  or any other cooking basics  I was pretty disappointed in my stay  Very dirty apartment even after it was  clean  
752871979,Read the reviews   Spend the extra few dollars and stay somewhere else   The apartment was cute and the location was super convenient  but thats the only good thing about this place   Despite the not so great reviews  I gave this place the benefit of the doubt thinking it wouldnt be that bad   It completely reeked of stale weed  cigarette smoke to the point that it was unbearable and nauseating  I kept the window open the whole time to try and air it out some  but it didnt help much  I used the washer and dryer to try and rid my clothes of the smell before leaving  and even they somehow smelled like it too  I thought it was ironic that they had a  No Smoking  sign inside of the place   Also  the neighbors were having a rap sesh at      am one morning  and the other morning a woman was screaming  hitting  and kicking the walls outside of another apartment at      for at least    minutes   One of the extra blankets they offered also had a giant yellow stain on it  Gross   If you dont mind the smell and noisy neighbors though  go for it as it is in a great location  Thanks for the stay  May I suggest doing something about the stale cigarette  weed smoke   I know its most likely coming from the neighbors  but it was unbearable and nauseating  Maybe add a disclaimer or offer a more reasonable price  I almost cancelled my stay there because of it  but didnt want to only end up getting a quarter of what I paid back  and instead opened the window and slept on the couch just to have fresh air  Also  one of the blankets had a big yellow stain on it  Gross  Even the washer and dryer that I used to wash my clothes to try and rid them of the smell reeked of it too 
754169586,Not really nice  Condo was not locked when we arrived  Closet door hanging  Hallway smelled of smoke  No bath soap  Old furnishings  Old coffee grinds in coffeemaker  Nothing to make it stand out as a place you want to be  Doorlock confusing  Condo wide open when we arrived 
755561807,The unit was not clean  The fridge had dried up juice at the bottom and sticky drippings on the floor  The ventilation system did not work also the ceiling had mold from what looked to be water damage  The bedroom door had a whole in it the bed was full of hair and the bedroom closet had dried gum in the wedges  The bathtub had not been clean it had dried up soap residue and hair all over it    guess the clean fee is money well spent  Not to mention this was a totally different unit than advertised in the photos when I booked  This stay was totally unacceptable  I sent in photos  messaged in dozens of times and was only offered for someone to come tidy up and on top of that I was still charged full price  This was a totally different unit from what I requested and booked and when I reached out to the host  I was told that it was when the whole decor  furniture and floorplan layout was different from the pictures  Upon arrival the stove had  crumbs on it  the fridge had red dried juice in the door shelves and at the bottom  their were also sticky drippings on the floor  The ceiling had mold from what looked to be water damage  There was a hole in the bedroom door  The bed was full of hair  as well as the bath tub and floor  The tub also had dried up soap residue  The bedroom closet door had dried gum in the wedges  Which makes me question why your company is charging a clean fee   The host replied but was not much help  The dirty unit and the host being unwilling to assist  also the A c unit didnt work
754139446,There was a mixup and they double booked us with another group and we did not have anywhere to stay for one night  However  they did give us a refund for that night and made steps to ensure something similar wont happen again
755580215,We weren t able to get in the place wasn t as clean as expected and while they were responsive on some issues they could use some adjustment on how you get in and get out Do you know the glitch which is two things number one place was not very clean it smelled funny seconds him we couldn t get in and out and that system you have for the door code does not work you need to come up with a different method for letting people in because that one that doesn t work
758109772,Could have been better overall
572524541322086239,nope I have pictures of clusters of pubic hair in the hallway and in the elevator waiting area on the  th floor  The night before I left  there were shards of glass on the elevator left by the clean crew  You need to watch the clean crew  because those people are making   person do the majorityof the work while the restof those lazy fucks sit against the wall relaxing  Saw it twice   and yes  they were all black  I was in the same situation    years ago   Youre saving money on clean  but in the end its going to cost you  Eat shit all the way until your noy is Turdville  not leaving a bad review   but you need to have a rover to check the situation in your common areas 
759277765,Worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had to the point where I more than likely won t be using this service ever again   I reached out to both Airbnb and the host directly about extremely loud construction noises that were impacting my ability to work remotely   despite me putting in my initial request that that was the purpose for my trip  I wasn t even able to get on conference calls because I couldn t hear  The construction was daily from  am to  pm and ran all week  I wish I could upload videos to share   With that said  I reached out in a timely manner and just stopped hearing from the host altogether and have been bounced around through several  help  assistants from Airbnb  The host tried to offer     of the nightly rate back which after Airbnb s astronomical fees  was less than      for a weeklong stay that was unworkable for my sole purpose of being there    Terrible  terrible service  If you re planning to book with Zencity  don t waste your time or your money  Their lack of communication impeded me from options to relocate and actually be productive during my work week   From the fees to the customer service issues to hosts buying up properties and jacking up prices  Airbnb is starting to become what it allegedly wanted to change about the hotel industry and you hate to see it    I m only giving two stars because the apartment was cute and the bed was comfortable 
758558310,The Airbnb was filthy  The host had good customer service 
767289813,This property did not live up to our expectations  The lights did not work in the kitchen  TV only got limited stations  washer machine did not work and we were missing a towel and had to go purchase one   Even the carpet in the hallway was disgusting dirty  The whole experience was not good  Excellent location but that was it  This property has not met our expectations and lacked attention  Lights in kitchen did not work  were missing a towel and had to go buy one because after calling and seeking help yet no towel showed up and yes we have permission to enter the unit 
768339233,The pictures are of the unit  The unit has a very strong urine smell  The toilet is not safely secured to the wall or the floor so it rocks  The room was NOT clean  The location was great 
758114611,Horrible communication and response time if you have any issues  The check in process is horrible I couldn t get in through the intercom box and had to wait for security to let me in and door to the apartment code didn t work that you all sent me 
757080580,I stay in a lot of Airbnbs for work and travel and this was one if the worst  The carpet in one of the bedrooms was dirty and when we arrived the window was open  letting in the cold and rain  The latches on the window did not lock  and when I tried to report it  I was given no help  The place was minimal to the point of soullessness  Dont stay here  just get a hotel  Its not worth it for the price   I will never stay here again  It was a horrible place with dirty carpet and a broken and open window  The place had no amenities and was completely soulless  The carpets were dirty and the window was open   broken
756823494,Decent Whoever is clean isnt taking the time to thoroughly go through and actually clean and wipe everything down  The floors were disgusting Floors looked like they hadn t even been swept  it was picked up and organized but not clean
424461460627734699,This was my worst stay with Air BNB  The host was very responsive at the beginning when booking  I asked to stay later than the original   am check in  They mistakenly charged me for a whole other night instead of the     for staying late  They then took over    hours to respond when trying to get it refunded  Upon arrival check in was super simple and the place is keyed entry which is nice  When I got to my room at first things looked fine but a closer look proved otherwise  The sheets on the bed still smelled like someone s cologne  Definitely had not been washed or changed  The floor wasn t vacuumed  crumbs everywhere The windows had cobwebs  and the curtains were filthy  I couldn t stay  I booked the next flight home and was refunded  No way I could stay in there  Please actually get this room clean  The surface clean is not enough  Sheets should be changed after every guest visit  The should probably be a mattress cover as well  Curtains are dirty  Shades are dusty  Surfaces in the kitchen are not clean  This is such a safety hazard  Especially with COVID 
423099369875169945,SO GROSS  This apartment had toe nail clippings all over the living room floor  black hair balls all over the bedroom and bathroom  dusty  nasty    The shower doesn t drain  YUCK   Also  it s directly on the Blue Line Train line SO LOUD right outside the living and bedroom window  Over     trains pass by everyday  Keeps you up at night  Finally  it s    stairs up to the apartment  on  th floor  no elevator    ZENCITY is not local and was completely unresponsive  We begged them to move us from the moment we arrived to the  toe nail stairs palace   Sent    photos of the GROSS APARTMENT  After   days of asking to move  they gave us     refund for the unclean apartment  Wait what  We had to get Airbnb involved and after   nights in this NASTY PLACE  they reluctantly moved us to a new apartment  BEWARE   ZENCITY did call us   times on the  th day at the apartment because the owner realtor wanted to come in during our stay  THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON THEY URGENTLY CALLED US  Not one time did they call to discuss the DISGUSTING floors  Not one time did they call to explain why their description states  single level home  no stairs   Every message from ZENCITY was from a different person  so you basically start the whole discussion over and over again    If your dream is to vacation above a Taco Bell in Wicker Park  then this is your spot Please make sure that apartment description is HONEST do not describe as  single level home  in amenities  there are    stairs  and make sure future guests know that the apartment is directly on the blue line train tracks  It s SO LOUD  And this apartment needs a DEEP CLEAN  The toe nail clippings and hair balls were SO GROSS  It needs a serious dusting and make sure that earrings and personal items from previous guests are removed  DISGUSTING
767290469,DO NOT BOOK HERE They failed to provide me with extra towels after multiple requests not to mention I was forced to stay here without any air conditioning in the heat  There was no one who came out and checked this issue nor tried to compensate me in any way  This stay was horrible and I was doing anything not to have to be stuck melting in this apartment  It was not thouroughly clean everywhere but enough for me to be able to still stay  The windows are broken  shower curtains inside out  and mix matched curtains just to name a few  The Zencity staff offered nothing but excuses during the whole stay  Good luck if you do decide to stay here  I am very i pleased after my stay of having to sleep in uncomfortable temperatures with no help or compensation  I will not be returning and I still deserve some of my money back for the lack of performance of air throughout the facility and my sweat and tears 
757095203,They conveniently leave out that there is no parking  Whether you park on the street or in the garage you are paying at the least     a day or more  So beware before you book this place  Also the walls are paper thin  You can here the elevator and anyone who Is in the hallway or by the door  I kept thinking someone was coming in the door all night  The tub was clogged with hair that i had to remove with a fork because the water wouldnt drain  Imagine taking a shower in a tub full of water  THE WORST  And the host was unresponsive  She offered late check out in the check out details and when I asked could she accommodate late check out she stated she couldnt because the housekeeper was scheduled to come at    of which the housekeeper was late cause no one came while I was in the lobby  The location is cool if you trying to shop but if not  find another place with better parking options  Most of the shops had long Lines outside due to Covid restrictions anyway  Overall  the only good thing about good place was the view 
759134101,   There is NO cable    There is NO sofa bed   its a   loveseat    There is NO shower  The faucet for shower bath doesnt work so dont plan on bathing    Check your dishes before use   many were unclean and grimy    Theres no kettle for boiling water for tea or coffee so forget that    The plus side is the location but its on the ground floor on a busy traffic corner so the noise level is quite high  Parking is a bear so you have to find a spot and watch the parking limitation signs  I would like a discount refund applied to my credit card  There is no sofa bed to sleep on   its a   loveseat and Im      Theres no cable  The shower bath faucet doesnt work so I was not able to bathe   stupid  Theres no cable  There was no kettle to boil water for making coffee  And the bath mat had to large wads of long black thick hair  gross   You charged me         which is way over priced for a place with no shower or sofa bed as we had planned  I expect a credit refund for one night            And you should not be in the Airbnb business as youre not a homeowner with the care factor that should go into the facility and the service  No one available to respond to no shower bath usage and no sofa bed to sleep on   This is not a host but a corporate outfit that does not know how to provide proper service for Airbnb  There was no sofa bed to sleep on so I had to share the bed with my traveling companion  the shower bath did not work so you couldnt get any water to run through the faucet  There were long black hairs in the bath mat  gross  and the cup glasses I went to use in the kitchen were dirty and grimy   had to rewash them all  No way to make coffee  no kettle  but they have a press but no kettle to boil the water  Carpets are dirty into the bathroom  Oh and theres no cable tv as stated  Only a very bad connection of a few local channels 
760428141,Nope  don t   Apartment would be fine with a good clean  maintenance  decent furniture  but Zencity s lack of organization and communication is incredibly frustrating   No parking access  so I had to pay to park   Bad experience and was extremely frustrating  Seriously poor communications  response to issues  cleanliness  poorly maintained property that wasn t the same as listing   Garage access never worked  so I paid to get after attempting to resolve every day  Maintenance man walked in while I was buck naked and after I had said to wait until after I was gone   You guys need to get it together or get out of the  rental business 
769913389,This place was not at all like described in the listing  Noisy neighborhood  uncomfortable bed and couch  no street parking ANYWHERE and unresponsive host  The description of amenities was inaccurate and the host did not respond to any of my questions about them   she simply sent me copy and paste messages about check in  parking and check out  On top of that  the entire apartment looks out toward the community dumpsters   not exactly a  home away from home  situation  I love AirBnb but was sorely disappointed by this place 
420921739439209097,Horrible host  I requested an early check in  which had to be approved by the host before I was charged   They immediately accepted my booking but DID NOT provide early checkin  I m VERY disappointed with this travel experience    The space on the other hand  was in a great location and we were very happy with the actual place  Terrible check in  Requested a partial refund and you ignored it  You should be ashamed of accepting my early checkin request and not accommodating it  Tells me you are money grabbing

768370280,Awful stay  The intercom to enter the building doesn t work and we had to bang on the door until some workers let us in  The main light in the apartment doesn t work  The water in the tub doesn t drain  The pool is closed and they falsely still claim there is a pool available on the listing  Communication was bad  Do not recommend The intercom to enter the building doesn t work and we had to bang on the door until some workers let us in  The main light in the apartment doesn t work  The water in the tub doesn t drain  The pool is closed and you falsely still claim there is a pool available on the listing  Awful stay 
464304449988083937,You couldn t pay me enough money to stay in this place again besides the key fobs not working  there is no on street parking like advertise there s construction going on  The closest place to park is a block away  The host was rude when I was upset and could not get my key fob to work and she hung up on me  I would say definitely that the apartment was very nice but the mechanics meaning the key fob in the rudeness of the host I would caution anyone from staying here
766265472,The pictures looked extremely beautiful which is what attracted us to the place to begin with  The location seemed ok  but the building over all was nice with the convenience of the restaurant  gym  and rooftop patio all in one  My complaints came when you enter the apartment and there was a smell almost like take out curry  which made me nauseous every single day   the dishes were still dirty  like they had never been washed  and to the point that we were forced to eat out every night  even the cutting board still had food left on it  There were missing light bulbs  shower curtain was broken  the chairs were broken  my   year old actually had fallen backwards in the chair and nearly busted her head  the couch was ripped  don t expect to sit on it without laying another blanket down because you will itch  If you re looking for cable or to watch the news  forget about thst  They only had Netflix  internet went in and out so much that the tv was constantly on buffer  After we left  they actually tried to accuse us of smoking in the unit and not clean up after ourselves even tho we paid the clean fee  So if you are planning to stay  make sure you take pics of the place the first day  And the last  And keep it in better condition than they left it for you or else they will try to get you on for an extra         moral of the story  dont stay here 
761558630,Worst AirBnb I ve stayed at yet  It was very dirty  very loud  the toilets were hardly operable  and zenacity did not respond until it was time to check out  Never again 
760754198,I can not say enough about the location and view   Amazing   But it was not a comfortable stay as the beds were just terrible  One of the beds was actually very badly tilted so I slept at a slope   Then the mattress was so poor that it only added more to the slope   Sleeping inverted is not comfortable   The lighting in the bedrooms were also very dark so it made anything a struggle   I would not stay here again  The beds and lighting in the bedrooms really need work

765104349,Overall  this is a functional place to stay if youre not fussy about cleanliness  Its far from luxurious  but has a pretty good view from the living room   The host is prompt and clear with communication  The check in and check out was slick and easy All amenities were provided as listed and functioned  The location is ideal and this ideal location is where most of the value lies in this accommodation  The photos of the interior make the apartment look nicer than reality  however  if youre in town to get out and about the city  then this may be a good fit  Hi   Thank you for the accommodations  I appreciated the clear communication  quick response to my parking question  and ease of check in and check out  The location and view was nice   I ranked on the lower end for aspects of the stay that were about the overall state of the apartment  The floors are sticky  there was a very strong odor of smoke and other foul smells  there were hairs found in multiple areas including bedding  couch  and bathroom  a vase of old dead flowers on the couch  dirty windows and walls  Cigarette burns in the furniture and rug  and there were  minimal  fruit flies and water bugs upon arrival  There were stains throughout  lamp shade  comforter  rugs  etc  and bathroom fixtures are heavily rusted  The photos conceal the true state  Therefore  I was disappointed   especially considering the price of this accommodation  Other good aspect  however  TV worked  lights worked  toilet worked  low pressure flush and seeps at base   kitchen functional  AC worked  hairdryer worked  hot running water  and felt safe  Note   Neighbor s  were heard ragefully screaming both in their unit s  and in the hallway  on   occasions  but it never lasted more than    minutes   Best wishes  Melanie Moralez
405891644285470630,This was our worst Airbnb experience we have ever had  Upon arrival to the apartment  it was apparent that this had not been clean whatsoever  beyond setting some clean towels out on the bed  There was mold in the toilet bowl and shower  Every surface was hairy  dusty  and or dirty   There was dirty linen in the closet  Although we appreciated that the host immediately responded to us with an offer to  retouch these spots   we had to demand that it happen immediately  not the next morning  Unfortunately  even after that was done  it was still unacceptable and disgusting  It was not in line with what the pictures in the listing or description depicted at all  This consumed an entire day of our trip   involving extensive communication with the host and ultimately Airbnb   and we ended up relocating to a hotel for the remainder of our stay in Lincoln Park 
489104248064977990,Not clean  Host was nonresponsive about many issues  including lack of water  heat and laundry 
769100837,Getting into the building was difficult due to the inaccurate codes we were given and the TV was left on by whomever was there last  which made it concerning that we were entering an already occupied apartment   Never saw the inside  we cancelled our stay  since I was traveling with small children and felt uncomfortable  Staff has been fairly communicative and helpful with a refund  Though it has been    business days and I still have yet to receive the full portion that  Also  it was inconvenient if you re traveling with a lot of luggage  there s several stairs you need to walk up in order to get to the entrance of the building  I was appreciative of the attentiveness of the staff once we had decided we weren t staying there related to the difficulties we had getting into the building due to the inaccurate codes and concerns that we were entering an already occupied apartment  since we heard voices on the other side of the door  I was also appreciative of the assurances of the full refund  However  it has now been more than    business days since I was guaranteed this from Zencity and I still have yet to receive it   I have only received         when I was told I would be getting back         total  I would really appreciate some follow up related to this issue  Thank you 
769344598,Wouldn t stay in this unit until issues are addressed  Air did not work good   Not very clean  Air did not work good  Stayed    to     I let y all know and noting done about it  Seemed hotter at night when trying to sleep but couldnt  sleep well because too hot  Bed didn t get fixed in a timely matter in one of the rooms  Also I had to fix the shower head myself  Unit wasn t very clean either  I should be given money back for all the inconvenience had to go through  If you look in emails I mentioned these issues  I wouldn t stay again and wouldn t recommend anyone to stay in this unit until issues are fixed  I was very disappointed  Specially when we are in the area working already hot from a days work and come home to a warm apartment   
450672496221041807,The unit was not clean upon arrival  Dust was everywhere  along with a few dead bugs  AC was blasting at an uncomfortably low temperature  I asked if we could have the code to turn it up but customer service did not answer  We all woke up feeling like we had a slight cold because of the AC dust  The blinds were broken  Random marks on the a lot of the walls  The coffee table top was broken  Overall  the space look better in the photos than it does in person  I would look for another location in Wicker Park because it is a great area to stay in

540586570868448669,The apartment has everything you need  Zencity  did something out of the ordinary and agreed to help pack up the rest of my stuff to FedEx back to me since I left early with some of my belongings there  However  I am really disappointed that I did not receive some really valuable items sent back to me  I was very clear with all the items I had left in the apartment and I received everything else  but two things    it s again disappointing that they did not follow through on what was agreed upon  I am still grateful that I got most of my stuff back though  The apartment is really nice  FYI  it s on a busy street during the daytime  but you don t hear any noise in the apartment  I had some items not delivered back to me such as my Red Light box as well as some brand new makeup I bought at Sephora  I am really disappointed that I did not receive all my belongings back to me  It s interesting that I received all my other items except for those two expensive things 
542091736187266337,Our first disappointment with a vacation rental  I really hope you address the safety issues with the electrical and gas in this unit  We tried several times to reach out  leaving a phone number  before receiving a    minute window to respond with no verbal acknowledgement of our concerns 
762593212,I can t say that I was at all impressed with this stay for a handful of reasons   The location is undesirable  the area feeling unsafe and sketchy and smelling bad  The neighbors are extremely loud  dogs barking  people yelling and stomping in the halls  loitering outside  we literally saw a man and woman aggressively shoving each other and verbally fighting in the street outside of the building our first night  This was at all hours of the day and night   The apartment itself was not that clean or well kept  it was dingy  there were blinds broken  bed was uncomfortable  space was small  wires from the WiFi router were messy covering the floor next to the right side of the bed where I slept to a point where I couldn t step there without stepping on wires  The only great thing about that apartment was coming into the air conditioning that worked very well after a hot day out   On top of all of that the parking situation is a nightmare  No clear instructions and super hard to find  had to figure it out ourselves and when we reached out to Zencity for help the response was not timely  You re given one spot far away in a parking garage with a parking pass  but the pass that was given to us had the incorrect number on it  so when we went to park someone else was in the spot we were supposed to be in  When finally gotten back to I was told to just park in another place that the former pass supposedly covered with a different number  but the whole time I was afraid of being towed  I told them of that fear and got no response back until my check out time when they asked me to leave a good review and didn t even address my last message   All that being said  the few things that were decent were  close driving distance to everything  when I did get a response they were kind  my car didn t end up getting towed  and nothing bad happened to me   It served its purpose  but honestly this would not be a stay for me again  Not my first  second  or even third choice 
763057038,I was unable to access the unit because the key code that was given to me didn t work the keypad was missing numbers   symbols so I couldn t gain access   The front deskman was very rude and invasive and even followed me up to the unit and quizzed me for several minutes  treating me as if i didnt belong   I will give Zen City this  they did answer me promptly after I had to call the number though   i was not giving a resolution and was left without accommodations for the night   I was told I get a call back within    minutes after waiting an hour after speaking I was told I d get a call back within    minutes after waiting an hour after speaking to someone from the hosts office and I didn t hear back anything until     the next morning   mind you I was depending on that stay for my accommodations so I guess they didn t care whether I had a place to stay or not since I didn t hear from them throughout the night  I m not sure who dropped the ball when the ball was dropped or how the ball was dropped but it was dropped so someone needs to contact me ASAP to get this rectified or do I need to call Airbnb directly I don t know please advise
543466511256363162,DO NOT STAY HERE  The unit was DISGUSTING upon my arrival  It was so GROSS  The city sidewalk is probably cleaner or an alley  I didnt even stay there  I had to stay at a friends house during my entire trip all while trying to conduct business meetings  via zoom  Im currently working with my bank and LAWYER to get my money back for services not rendered  Zen you have the pictures Ive sent regarding the matter    I  also have video evidence of the unit that backs up my claim  Do yourself a favor and do the right thing  REFUND my money  You need to make sure your clean staff is clean the unit after every guest  Shame on you for charging a clean fee when no clean is done  This is why I didnt stay at your bnb  It was disgusting  With covid cases on the rise  you should be on top of keeping things in and around the bnb sanitary  Instead of letting germs and filth fester

387172622741459593,This booking was a terrible experience but I ll try to be as objective as possible  The pros are that the location is perfect  The place was quiet and mostly clean except that the clean person missed some hair in the tub and a dirty wash cloth that fell from the shower curtain when I closed it    When we arrived the intercom system would not allow us access to the building  A resident finally came by and let us in  A fob was supposed to be provided to allow access to and from the building but there was no fob  Similar issues have been reported by other guests that were staying when we were  My first customer service response was a text message that told me to read the check in instructions  Then  someone called me and condescendingly just read the check in instructions to me  Several hours later someone responded that there was an extra fob In a lock box in the foyer  The lock box was empty  I was stuck there the first night because I wouldn t have been able to come and go    I had to leave the next day and left another message reminding them I didn t have access to the building  When I returned I had to wait several hours outside until another building resident was kind enough to let me in  When I finally got in the place looked like it had been completely torn apart  All the linens and towels were gone  the bed frame was apart  the head board was off the wall the mattress was standing up against the wall  I called zen city about this and they assured me no one had been inside the apartment  After sending pics  I was informed that someone came to spray pesticides for some unknown reason   I had to fight them to get a refund at all and it left having to book something twice the price    I contacted air bnb and they said they couldn t help because it was more than    hours since the check in time  I m extremely disappointed with zen city and air bnb    I ve learned my lesson about booking spaces with out of state management companies  They just aren t equipped to deal with problems that pop up    If you have any trouble checking in immediately ask for a refund or contact air bnb don t give them the opportunity to waste your time and pass that    hour clock

763810327,Would only reccomend if you know that this place has the bare minimums but is in a KEY location  Apartment was so dirty  We had issues with the air conditioner which was never fixed  If the apartment was not in a KEY location  I would rate it even worse  All it needs is a deep clean  Communication was sometimes incredible and other times awful  I disliked that I had to speak to a different person each time  
763469307,The location is very nice  The apartment was NO ZEN   the smoke detector battery beeped EVERY NIGHT for  weeks  Finally the battery died  The company stopped answering my emails and calls  and said  don t worry we have our top team working on in    It wasn t complex   I needed a    foot ladder to change the battery   The manager for the building wouldn t answer my requests and airB B actually sent me texts telling me to stop making noise   This was a work assignment at a hospital   I was forced to move the mattress to the floor in the living room   only feet away from the bedroom  but with the kitchen exhaust fan I slept some   The shower has ZERO water pressure  seriously around   inches and warm but not hot   The Only plus was the neighborhood   I give both Zencity and AirB B a big fat F  my simple request was never met   I spent close to          and got a      refund  SHAME on you AirB B  for allowing this company to rip off a nurse at a hospital  Shame on you Zencity for your lies and complete ineptitude     So heads up if you have a problem with your space from the many places this company owns   you will not be helped by them or AirB B   Your response to my Valid and HUGE request was pitiful and completely unnecessary  The simple request to stop a smoke detector from beeping  but I had to wait until the battery actually died in two weeks    I was forced to move the mattress to the floor in the living room    and all you did was give me      off  I should have received   weeks free  The water pressure in the shower was ZERO   I decided your actual offices must be in China or somewhere  as your email responses were grammar wise inaccurate  I give your company a complete F  a FAIL for response and sincerity

386189057133434982,I was unable to access the apartment so contacted Zencity from the lockbox area   They had a back up key but chose that moment to ask if the apartment had been clean   the person on the phone admitted that they KNEW the clean team had been unable to clean   They did not call to inform me that I would be walking into a place with dirty bed   bath lines  trash in the trash cans and dirty dishes   They suggested I clean and change the dirty bed linens with spares in the apartment   I was told the place would be clean by       the next morning  I booked a hotel for the night   Next day  again  not clean with no answer as to when it would be clean   Then they had the audacity to argue about a full refund as I had to book a hotel due to their inefficiency  Once I notified and spoke with Airbnb  I was refunded but only after   days and countless emails   Zencity should have contacted me beforehand as they knew the place was dirty     all in all the worst experience with a host  If you know you will not have a clean apartment unit  call the customer in advance   You knew the clean staff was unable to service the apartment   Secondly  if you have a service failure  which you did  for two days in your inability to clean the unit  dont make your  very upset customer have to spend time asking for a refund   I only received a positive result after contacting Airbnb to tell them about the abysmal service    Such a poor experience with Zencity   Never again 
386139556333021646,Place looks like photos but not clean  Bring clean supplies  Place also had an odor that would not go away after I clean  Place needs to be clean properly before allowing someone to stay there  There is an odor  Carpet and flooring where not clean  Counter tops  and appliances not clean  No supplies were available and I feel I was charged to much  There was not a day I wanted to stay just to relax as this was a trip for me to relax  I only slept because  was uncomfortable  Bed should be higher  Everything is so small and close to the floor  I recommend having toilet paper and paper towels for guest to use as part of their stay  That was a lot of money to hand over for a place that was not comfortable

404360243598489499,Horrible walked in and had water damage on the wall next to fridge  Found a dirty towel behind the bathroom door someone dirt old sock behind the curtains Hello    Also when I entered I saw mold on the wall witch is do to water damage where the paint was coming off the wall  Witch maintenance saw  Also found a dirt towel on the floor behind the door a sock under the curtains in the bedroom you could also tell the blanket was not washed because we found strands of hair in the bed  then the toilet backed up  So the stains on the towels just wash with bleach and soap and it comes right out maybe a lil bit of baking soda  Gets  the stains right out  So for you to complain about towels being stained is ridiculous and you need to do some maintenance to your apartment before renting 
764935512,As much as I try to write positive reviews  I am unable to do so for this listing  Although this is a great location and the building overall is nice  there were three major negative factors   The whole apartment smelled of cigarettes  I recognize this is mostly out of control of the host since it is due to bad behavior of a previous visitor  but this ruined our stay   The check in process did not work  Thankfully another Airbnb guest in the building recognized our situation having gone through it a few days before  if they weren t there  I m not sure we would have been able to get into the apartment  There was no washer   dryer in the unit despite that being in the listing  There is a hook up for one in the massive walk in closet but none was present
522486170101007437,I am very disappointed that the Zencity management does NOT maintain their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   Its deceptive selling  and its personally disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my second encounter with a Zencity apartment and you continue to disappoint your guests   The lack of proactive communication and response is aggravating and is a major business downside    As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together   I am very disappointed that the Zencity management does NOT maintain their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   Its deceptive selling  and its personally disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my second encounter with a Zencity apartment and you continue to disappoint your guests   The lack of proactive communication and response is aggravating and is a major business downside    As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together  
401417146375677198,Great location  However only one bedroom has AC which makes it a bit uncomfortable on summer nights  The AC in the living room is also underpowered   Need to make sure that basics like shampoo and soap are available in the apartment  Also the statement about AC is not fully accurate  One of the bedrooms does not have AC  It is a bit of a misrepresentation  The main door knob is difficult to use 
400010400197507865,Had a terrible experience after my friends and I could not enter the property since the door was jammed  I tried calling the host s immediate assistance helpline several times but got no response  After several hours and waiting outside the bnb at   am in the night  I received a call back for the assistance I requested  A maintenance person needed to be sent out to check the door lock  Since it was already really late in the night and we had plans for the following day  we were forced to take a hotel room for  x the price it would normally cost  The next day I had to follow up with the host again to find out if the door had been fixed and they seemed clueless about my issue  We were finally able to get in the next day and complete the rest of our reservation  I am still working on getting my refund for the money I paid for the hotel rooms and uber   Location      Good neighborhood  clean spaces  Property       Shower curtains have black mold Bathroom door does not have a lock
403628693083576361,Zen city is the worst  Don recommend them  Filthy apartments and horrible customer service Apartments are super dirty  I stay with you guys allot and your clean ladies which are employed by you do a half fast job that is not worth what you charge for clean fees  Also there is no pool please don t mislead people
765987816,We had a miserable check in process because the so called  welcome kit  had apparently been misplaced   Zincity did not have a substitute  kit  available nor did they send an agent with a second kit   They just kept telling us that the  kit  was at the front desk  but never offered any real help   Fortunately  the  kit    the card key to exterior doors   a remote to operate the garage gate   was finally found by the doorman   But Zincity should have been responsible   actively helped us   The apartment lacked in many key ways   In the living room  there was only a small sofa with dirty pillows on it   a single pole lamp in the corner for lighting   No comfortable sitting chair   The living room rug was stained   The kitchen  also dimly lit  lacked so much as a  tea towel  potholder or even a salt shaker   the ice trays had been filled   The beds were comfortable but likely were doubles  not queens as advertised   While the apartment was spacious  it was very sterile  not a welcoming place to stay  esp  in comparison to the many other Airbnbs weve stayed in over the years    Hopefully  Zincity will respond to cure these defects in its service and property  Check in was the worst process weve encountered in all our years of using Airbnb   The  welcome kit  wasnt at the front desk as it was supposed to be    Multiple emails that I sent to Zincity met with the same response  the  welcome kit  was left at the front desk   But it plainly was missing   the responsibility for this failure   for correcting it was on Zincity   Instead  calls by me to Zencity  Customer Service  were unanswered by a human    I did receive one phone call from a Santa Barbara  CA exchange but there was nothing from an identified  Zincity office or agent     There was no offer by a Zincity agent rep to come with a second  kit     The  welcome kit  was no more than a card key   remote for access to the building   garage   There should have been a contingency plan   like a spare  welcome kit  when the first  kit  is missing or a Zincity agent should have brought us a second   We   the paying guests   should not have lost   an hour of very stressful time until the  welcome kit  was finally found      Then  the apartment was incredibly sterile   ill equipped    The living room did not have any lights except for a single pole lamp in a corner  and the only seating was a small sofa with two gross  dirty pillows on it   The living room rug was stained and dirty      The dim overhead lighting in the kitchen didn t adequately light that area   There were no tea towels  potholders  not even a salt shaker   Only ice cube trays in the freezer  which were filled   I had to rearrange lightbulbs to better light some areas   There was only one spare lightbulb   three burned out ones   I moved a pole lamp from a bedroom to the living room for more light   Shelves in the the entry hall lacked any books or other decoration   the walls throughout were nearly blank   There were no instructions on trash disposal  check out procedures or even how to gain entry to the garage from the building at the  th floor  the doorman showed this to me   My husband   I make frequent trips to St  Louis   The apartment is spacious   well located for proximity to our sons house   entrances to from I     but well not stay in Zincity properties given our check in experience   the poor service   maintenance of the property itself 
388325368110358058,Honest review here  The place was dirty  It has a weird smell  Found bugs in the bathroom  Carpets were very dirty  Good location but I must say the smell was a big turn off  It felt really dirty just to be there  Decided to leave after an hour of check in and did not go back at all  Hopefully hosts see this  Honest review here  The place was dirty  It has a weird smell  Found bugs in the bathroom  Carpets were very dirty  Good location but I must say the smell was a big turn off  It felt really dirty just to be there  Decided to leave after an hour of check in and did not go back at all  Hopefully hosts see this 
767395883,Bottom line  if I had to pay the same amount to stay at this Airbnb  or another one run by Zencity  I wouldve just stayed at a hotel instead   The price was pretty close to some decent hotels downtown  but I wanted to check out Pilsen  so we went with this place   the pictures looked nice   The root cause of our issues was that the property is run by a conglomerate  who probably isnt local  and probably doesnt care if they get a few bad reviews   The good  location didnt seem unsafe to me  it was in good proximity to restaurants  we only parked   times but we were able to find street spaces within    ft and the unit was reasonably sized   As one reviewer mentioned  the AC unit is somewhat loud but it worked well and it was around    degrees outside all weekend   The bad in order     Bugs   there were tons of gnats or gnat like bugs all over the unit  but particularly in the bathrooms   What was weird was that the number varied throughout the stay   Sometimes it was unbearable  one person wanted to shower in the downstairs bathroom but was too grossed out and ended up showering upstairs    Sometimes it was just an annoyance   Either way  gross     Check in   we followed the check in instructions  but the key in the lock box did not work on any of the doors to get into the building   Messaging was useless  the first guy said hed look into it but never got back to me   Messaged again    minutes later and got a new person and had to explain the whole situation again   Meanwhile  we tried calling and when you follow the appropriate prompts for check in issues  the call just dropped   times   Finally  on the  th attempt  our call went through but was put on hold for    minutes   Once we got somebody on the phone  we were able to run through the other lock boxes to get another building key  which worked   Luckily there was another available key  otherwise Im not sure how long it would have taken us to get into the unit in the    degree weather with all of our luggage     Cleanliness  while it appeared that they followed the Airbnb  enhanced clean  steps  it seemed like they half clean everything else   The floors were dirty  the bathrooms were just ok and the bedrooms were just ok   Certainly nowhere close to spotless  which is the experience I normally have with well run Airbnbs      Wine glasses  there were   of them and   of them were cracked   I wouldve been fine with plastic ones  but not cracked glass ones     Dogs  there was quite a bit of barking from the neighbors dogs   Im a dog person so it didnt bother me that much  but it was frequent enough that I noticed     TV  didnt really use it at all but I couldnt figure out how to control the fire stick with the remote provided   No other TV options available unless you had your own device to connect to a HDMI cable 
765975972,Perfect location and a decent space with very friendly staff at the reception desk  Great view  However  the room smelled like cigarette smoke and made the stay pretty unpleasant  I hope they can figure it out and get rid of it before the next person stays 
764310429,If you book this  make sure you read plenty of the reviews  and ask questions about the entry problems beforehand  First negative experience I have had with an airbnb and it was miserable  The key code that we were provided to get into the building did not work and my wife and I were stranded outside in the middle of the night trying to get a hold of someone from ZenCity with no success  When we finally got an answer from Zencity  the person we talked to was unable to help us  After   hours of trying   we finally ended up booking a hotel room which was overpriced and scarce due to the holiday weekend  The next day we were finally able to reach someone with zencity support who told us that we would be buzzed in when we arrived back to the building   When we arrived back at the building we called zencity to have a manager buzz us in  but they couldnt get ahold of the manager  After a bit a passing resident finally let us in  The unit was a good place to stay once we were finally in  and the location was very nice  but this was a terrible first night experience for us  We are already unhappy that the person we spoke with said we would not be reimbursed for the full expense of the emergency   am hotel option we had to go with  but we were told that at least some of what we paid would be coming back to us for the check in instructions stranding us and this still has not happened  We know this is not our error on the building entry  as there are tons of reviews having the same problem  Please do something to try and make this right  We have made airbnb aware of our issues as well and are waiting to hear back from support 
766328704,I cancelled my reservation after finding a broken door lock and being forced to wait in a parking garage for an hour after being given a fake parking pass for an occupied parking spot  Also neighbors outside this place fighting on the street did not make it feel safe 
386983789975678706,wifi did not work and they lied about all the amenities  She said they were open and when we got there it was all under construction 
766316192,The blinds in the apt were blinds were opaque blinds meant for living rooms or to accompany another blind that would actually block out sun  As the windows were huge it meant at night all the lights from city shone in and at crack of dawn sun came in  I did not sleep the time I stayed to the point I left early  Still trying to chase a refund  You didn t fix the blinds which made apt unlivable
417292930329437009,I haven t had a bad experience with Airbnb s except for this time  My husband and I booked a room with Zencity  at  am they messaged me the day we were supposed to arrive and they asked if we could change reservations to a different room in the building  We agreed because it was the same price and looked comparable in pictures  After arriving we were able to get keys but it was for the original room we booked  We were confused but went along with it and messaged them on the Airbnb app to see what to do  Not wanting to hold our bags in the lobby we just decided to go up to the room we had keys for  An hour went by and they messaged us saying you re booked for the other room  I hope that answers your questions    Needless to say it didn t lol  So we tried calling the number attached to the reservation confirmation and could only reach an automated phone line  They called us after an hour of trying to reach them and said you need to move to the other room  and we can try and help you figure out how to get the keys to the other room  This was such a hassle  We had plans and reservations so we didn t have time to troubleshoot their mistakes  After trying to reason with them on the phone  we finally just asked for a refund and said we wanted to leave because the room wasn t very clean  the street ally parking was so sketchy  the building itself smelled horrible of body odor and smoke    they refused to refund us because that would take  manager approval  and refused to get the manager    they finally just texted me after another hour went by and said just stay in the room we were in    needless to say  we will not be coming back or recommending this company Airbnb location to anyone in the future 
767335770,I would not recommend renting from Zincity at all  We stayed at a zincity owned Airbnb in St  Louis   The apartment was much larger than the photos led us to be and it s in a great spot in the city  Security there is also amazing so we were very excited   We noticed the AC wasn t working at all so it was very hot in the room  We contacted zincity through the Airbnb chat section  They spent the first day trying to get me to check the thermostat  like I didn t know how to work one   Long story short we stayed there for   nights and it was hot the entire time  They never fixed the AC  They would try to get me to fix it but I told them I m not a AC repair guy  They suggested I just open the windows  which are   stories up and did not have protective screens  I told them that was too dangerous with my young kids    They never offered to relocate us  even though I asked numerous times   they did bring up portable ACs but they worked like box fans  so they wouldn t cool any rooms down at all   they only offered us our clean fee back for compensation  and they promised a supervisor would contact us a few days ago and he never did  I explained to zincity that I was a disabled combat veteran with a wife and four kids and being in this heat would make my disabilities worsen and my kids and wife uncomfortable but zincity still didn t resolve the issue at all   I will not be renting from them ever again  I understand stuff happens  such as an AC breaking  but not resolving a problem and taking care of your customers should always be number one and we weren t number one that week  We stayed here   nights and we noticed the AC wasn t working  It was very hot in the room  I am a disabled combat veteran and if I get to hit them I can get very sick  I also have four children and a wife who were with me  who were also very uncomfortable   I notified y all of this that night and it was never fixed  It would take hours to hear back from y all on chat and at first it was just y all trying to make sure I had the air on properly  No attempts to move us or offer us a refund occurred and I didn t have the money to just leave and get a new place  so we had to stay in a hot apartment for   days  making the evenings of our vacation miserable   Finally I was told portable AC units would be brought up but what we eventually got did absolutely nothing to cool the rooms   Y all told me a supervisor would contact me a few days ago and no one did  I asked numerous times to be relocated and was either ignored or was told ok y all would and no one got back with me   Y all gave me the     clean fee back but that in no way compensates us for   days of misery in the rooms   I asked for half my money back to compensate us and no one has got back with us   On top of all that y all also had left books inside the room  probably for decoration  and one of em was filled with male and female pornographic imagery  I have no Idea why this would be left in an apartment that rents to families  My kids could have looked through it I d I didn t happen to first    This was an absolute awful way we were treated and we are still waiting to hear back from y all to see if your going to make it right

390505771951241898,the TV didnt work there  it keep saying network  disconnected  there were still broken glass in the door of the second bed room  there was so much build up around the tub Some of the electricity outlet didnt work The tub was stopped up to where we couldnt take a shower  we have to use the sink  the bed was comfortable  everything else was false advertisement  I appreciate it for you letting me and my family stay there but everything that was said about the place was completely wrong  the TV didnt work there  it keep saying network  disconnected  there were still broken glass in the door of the second bed room that my son got cut on and hes four  there was so much dirt and grim in the corners of the washroom  and around the tub  Some of the electricity outlet didnt work The tub was stopped up to where we couldnt take a shower  we have to use the sink  The only thing that was nice was the fact that it had a nice kitchen and the bed was comfortable everything else that you said was completely wrong  false advertisement 
386961280106804867,When we arrived  the front of the building was condemned and we has to use the back door  no problem  except the elevator was broken and we has to go up four flights of stairs to get to the room and back  However all of that wasnt even a dealbreaker if the room had been clean properly  We had even found hard used towels hanging over the shower curtain when we arrived  Mention the front being condemned and four flights of stairs with no elevator  also we had found the apartment semi dirty and found used dirty towels from previous renters still hanging over the shower curtain 
764443187,I wouldn t stay here again  There were a lot of problems   host s instructions for building entry were wrong  dishes were broken  no cooking utensils  inaccurate listing of kitchen appliances  thermostat broke halfway through  and host entered twice without advanced warning  The host is a company  not a person  so I was unable to get any help with these issues  Whenever I reached out  I kept getting corporate responses   thank you for your patience   The place was fine  but the host Zencity was terrible  I d book somewhere else 
766329233,Pro s  close to downtown if you have a car  House looks more or less like pics  Private space in both floors   Cons  ac too loud  tv didn t work because the control had no battery  not enough basic stuff like coffee  not much light coming from the windows  bath hanger fell after one day  there where small flying bugs and two spiders in the lower floor  neighborhood is kind of sketchy at night  not the best place to walk alone   The apartment had wifi but it never worked  That was one of the worst things  My computer would connect to the line but no Internet whatsoever  Parking on the street is hard  we use an app  parking hero    and that work    Zencity Is a big company  so a new person answered me every time I needed to solve a problem  I had better experiences with Rbnbs managed by owner 
389837159041545639,Location is amazing  located in middle of downtown    Check in was easy  simple   There were many amenities in the Airbnb but no iron which I was disappointed in   The worst part of my stay is that the power was not working in half of the room during the second day  Which included the air conditioner  I spent the entire night and morning sweating profusely as it s summertime now    When I reached out  I was asked to go find breaker box in the basement  This may seem reasonable  accept the fact that this is an apartment building with    floors and it was      pm  So this was unacceptable  Fix whatever issue causes the air conditioner to stop working  It s summer and this makes for a very unpleasant stay 
391952251893043771,I ended up staying at a hotel  The entire building reeked of cigarette smoke  The unit has central air and a portable A C  but the bedroom was still absurdly hot  The hosts would not refund me for my stay  despite the fact that I didnt stay there  dirty any linens  etc 
470958735264124122,Location of the apartment is great and close to the hospital and the vibrant place of central end west  The check in was a bit turbulent because the main door of the building was stuck and didn t open with code  i had neighbor living in same apartment to help open the back door  The apartment is spacious with good living room and big TV with Netflix and Hulu access  It is overall clean but it seems it was clean days and may be weeks before my arrival considering there was some cockroaches in the bathroom 
571512367033458897,BOOK WITH CAUTION   I never write reviews but this time I had to  I ve used Airbnb for many years and this has to be the worse experience ever    We arrived at  pm to the building   Check in time   The doorman for the building was helpful but they do not work for Zencity  Other tenants live there  not Airbnb related units   Anyways  we arrive and we go up to the unit  This unit only opens with a digital keycode  There is no physical key  We spent     hours on call with customer support at Zencity trying to get in  All the codes they gave us did not work  We tried over     times probably  The building doorman  not associated with Zencity  offered to help but they also could not get in  Zencity customer support was so unhelpful and they were acting with no urgency  They kept asking us if we were entering the code right  it s not rocket science to enter a code   They never sent an actual person to help physically  Never  No one    After this  it s been   week and they still have not refunded me  I keep messaging them but they regurgitate the same message    we are waiting for manager approval    Huh   Why would this require   week   There s clear evidence between messages and phone calls that we were never able to get in     In short  terrible experience  Horrible customer support  I would never want to book with Zencity again  You ve been warned  Please focus on making sure the customer is first 
496650623550623781,I was never able to check into the unit  The call box number to use to gain entry was not working it seems based on other online reviews of Zen City  that this is a common issue with their short term rentals    They are pretty good in communicating their pre check in instructions  but post check in they are very spotty with communication and don t seem to be able to resolve anything  they only message to ask if anyone was able to help  isn t the person I m messaging supposed to  know this    Furthermore  when you try to contact them by phone it goes straight to voicemail with a voicemail box that is full    Not sure how often this happens  but I know I m not the only one  Your instructions for entry do not work  because the call box number     Zen City  does not work and just returns a busy signal  This was an ongoing issue  Also  your pre check in communication and instructions is great  but your ability to resolve and communicate after the check in time is very spotty 
389060554952174489,Horrible customer service  I run my own air bnb and would never treat my guests the way Zencity treated me  Zero help  no one lives in the city that works for this property management company so I was left to sit in the hallway till I left to go rented a hotel for the weekend  ZERO STARS Horrible customer service  I run my own air bnb and never would treat my guests the way you treated me  Zero help  I couldn t gain access into the the apartment and you  left me to sit there in the hallway  ZERO STARS
767232532,Location was great  apartment is ok but basic and we had   days without air conditioning  Also the front door automatic lock stopped working which we had to fix ourselves and there was a smell in the unit when we checked in  Communication from the owners acknowledging and resolving the owners was poor  I think I ve said enough but here goes again  the smell when we checked in  the lack of air conditioning for   days  the lock stopped working in the front door  poor communication and zero effort to help offset the issues we faced 
567674227363724397,Access codes did not work and ended up canceling while trying to get inside the building around Midnight on the day of my stay  Codes didnt work and I had to cancel 
451414078125021740,The ac never worked they never came out to fix it or clean up the room it was a horrible experience When we got there bed was not made up clothes in washer it needed a full detail just sad the way they treat you after you spend your money
430400539293146560,Im a frequent Airbnb traveler and this time booked the place for two weeks for my business trip  I found the Zancity apartment not suitable for my needs  there is no working table and a comfy chair  in the picture you can see a tiny table and a plastic chair   so I mostly worked standing placing my laptop on the microwave in the kitchen  There is a lack of drawers or other surfaces especially in the bedroom and bathrooms and I kept my stuff in the suitcase  The handers were missing so Zenticy stuff brought us some  We also got only one key even though we were two people with different schedules and were told that there is only one  Last but not least the apartment wasnt clean as we used according to the Airbnb standards   having some dust  stains  and peeling all around  Zencity sent a clean person but the place requires deep clean of the kitchen and maintenance in the bathrooms  I wont recommend this place as its also not so cheap  Please clean the apartment for the next guests  especially the kitchen and bathrooms   We highly recommend adding a working station   a table and comfy chairs for   people  Everyone works remotely today  Also adding some drawers would be great  I would go to Goodwill and buy some pictures and items to make the place cozy and reduce the feeling of a ghost apartment 
421661979857123673,This unit is NOT market ready  It needs a major deep clean  the unit was filthy when I arrived  The blind doesnt work and the outdoor furniture is in terr vel condition  Customer service from Zenicity terrible  renter beware  Your clean standards are below grade  Terrible maintenance of the unit  it was filthy 
389859598207304983,The lock to the room was broken when I tried to check in  and the door was wide open when I first got there  It was unsafe for me to stay so I wasted      on this Air BnB and had to get a hotel room downtown so I could have a place to stay where I wouldn t have to worry about someone breaking in 
547122672758233004,By far the worst Airbnb experience we ve had  all because of management  There were a plethora of shortcomings with the apartment during our   week stay  but the worst was when our thermostat stopped working and the heat turned off when it was    degrees outside  After multiple attempts to work with Zencity to rectify the situation  days of them lying and telling me that maintenance was  on their way    someone finally came on day    only after I contacted Airbnb directly  We literally had to turn on the oven to heat the unit in the middle of winter  I travel for work and use Airbnb monthly  and have never been so frustrated than I was staying here  Do yourself a favor and keep scrolling 
400014721441469744,There isn t any parking near at all place was dirty pricing is good tho Please Add Option For Paid Parking
435476420588526967,Do not book with Zencity  They took my reservation and never sent me check in details  I waited around for   hours only to have to contact Airbnb for a refund  This occurred while sitting outside of the property 
384060853145448148,Really liked the location but we had difficulties at check in  Due to travel schedules  I arrived to the airbnb late where I discovered the lockbox containing the key was empty  I attempted to get ahold of someone and had to wait    minutes for someone to pick up the phone  on hold as its an office handling the property and not a person   At that point  the instructions to get into the building were not super helpful  the wifi information was incorrect and the place was not particularly clean  The bed sheets and towels were but the floor was not  There was also a lot of damage to the doors  walls and carpet  I liked the location but check in was difficult because of the issues with the key box  it took a while to get ahold of someone to help so I was stucking standing on the street at night with all my stuff in a neighborhood I didnt know  the information provided was all incorrect  including wifi and password  plus there was a lot of damage in the apartment and it was not very clean

390570685068544943,You get what you pay for  There are SO many reasons this place is significantly cheaper than places around St  Louis  The floor was so sticky it was hard to walk in the room and it reeked   When we got there  there was no fob for access to the building  and no one answering the calls for the access code  We never received a replacement fob which impacted our access into the building as well as the parking garage  This meant we had to pay for parking every    hours in a public lot  The floor was so sticky it was hard to walk in the room  We never received a fob which impacted our access into the building as well as the parking garage  This meant we had to pay for parking every    hours in a public lot 
383305118435319135,We had a bad experience  We stayed there for more than   months  The kitchen doesnt have an oven tray  pyrex or anything to be able to use it  after they said they dont provide it we had to buy one   The oven was dirty  but they clean it the day after we told them  They also dont have tea spoons or anything to be comfortable cooking eating there  When we arrived the bed slat was broken in many places  the living room lamp and one of the bathroom lamps were not working  These thing were resolved     days after we told them  They dont have cable tv and the firestick stopped working correctly  had to reset it many times every night  We asked for a replacement and after   weeks of waiting  and complaining  they told me to buy it and that I was going to be reimbursed  They never did  and they are not replying my messages regarding this  Honestly  in my opinion  the only good thing about this apt is that it is nice  true to the pics   If you are planning on staying for a few couple of days and dont want to cook there  it might be ok  But dont expect to feel homey  Also  keep in mind that it doesnt has a dinner table  just a coffee table  as you can see in the pics   From all the airbnb apt houses that Ive stayed in the US  by far this was the worst  I believe you could have make us feel great with really little effort money  The things we were asking for are simple easy things  something to be able to cook in the oven  tea spoons  solve the firestick issue    after   weeks of waiting for a new firestick I was told I could buy one and you were going to reimburst the money  I feel scamed    not only you havent done it  but also you dont reply to my messages regarding this issue  I believe after paying over       we deserved not to have to buy our own firestick and oven tray  I feel disappointed  I have stayed in many airbnb apts houses in US and this one was the worst experience  In the rest of the places  you felt more at home  they even had coffe tea sugar olive oil conditioner and shampoo  big bottle not the tiny ones   I dont think you care  so I am not sure why am I wasting the time to write these    
386192505966786962,The check in process was awful  there was no intercom for us to enter the building like the check in instructions described  We had to wait for someone who lived there to let us in  Furthermore  they did not leave us a key for us to get in and out of the building and did not provide one until a day later so we could not leave the building  Also  was later contacted by the host that there was evidence of BEDBUGS in the couch so we needed to leave immediately  We tried many times to contact the host for these problems but would always be on hold  given an inconclusive answer  and no help  In the end we had to hound down a security guard to help us 
409320720869328166,We were very disappointed with the level of cleanliness in the apartment  Everything felt very dirty and the shower was clogged so it was overflowing every time we tried to shower  The shower curtain was also dark brown on the bottom and should be replaced  The apartment also smelled like vomit and cigarettes  All the sheets in the beds had stains on them  including blood  and didn t smell clean  The carpet and couches were extremely dirty  It was also very uncomfortable to work remotely because the dining table chairs did not fit the table properly  We were also very uncomfortable that there was an automated noise complaint message that we received in the middle of the night  even though we were sleeping  The lack of noise insulation made it very difficult to sleep through the night since this apartment is on a busy street and right next to an emergency room  Also  the lights were severely flickering every time we turned them on and made us concerned for the safety of the place because of how many old buildings in this neighborhood don t have updated electricity  There was also no shampoo left for us and a very limited supply of dishes silverware which would have been nice considering how much we paid for the place  The bed in the front room also has a broken frame  Overall  for the amount that we paid for the place  this did not meet a basic level of expectation  We were very disappointed with the level of cleanliness in the apartment  Everything felt very dirty and the shower was clogged so it was overflowing every time we tried to shower  The shower curtain was also dark brown on the bottom and should be replaced  The apartment also smelled like vomit and cigarettes  All the sheets in the beds had stains on them  including blood  and didn t smell clean  The carpet and couches were extremely dirty  It was also very uncomfortable to work remotely because the dining table chairs did not fit the table properly  We were also very uncomfortable that there was an automated noise complaint message that we received in the middle of the night  even though we were sleeping  Also  the lights were severely flickering every time we turned them on and made us concerned for the safety of the place because of how many old buildings in this neighborhood don t have updated electricity  There was also no shampoo left for us and a very limited supply of dishes silverware which would have been nice considering how much we paid for the place  The bed in the front room also has a broken frame  Overall  for the amount that we paid for the place  this did not meet a basic level of expectation 
420343931689659561,Great location  and once we saw the place it would have been perfect  However they didn t send check in Information  once they finally did send Information it was wrong  Once we finally got ahold of them after   hours of going back and forth they still were not able to give us keys to access the building fully the way we needed to  We ended up cancelling after       hours of back and forth and had to last minute book a hotel instead  which wasn t the easiest to find for the same price  They were easy to work either after to get a full refund which we greatly appreciated but definitely not something I will deal with again nor will I ever book with Zencity  I have always loved Airbnb and this was my first terrible experience  but it definitely makes me hesitant about ever booking one in the future  Hopefully this place can figure it out because it really was a great location and would have been perfect for my family  but after reading reviews seems like there is something always wrong  Wish I Would have read Into that more 
381788702820404737,The smoke smell was unbearable  so we left early  As mentioned in a previous review  messages from Zencity were automated and did not acknowledge our complaints  The previous problems around check in and wifi code have not been addressed  so you will need to read the previous review to know how to open the door and connect to wifi  Additionally  the A C unit could not keep up  so the apartment never got under    degrees while we were there  I received no acknowledgement about the smoke smell being unbearable  You should not be renting this place on Airbnb until you remediate it 
768416350,Great location  relatively clean  would prefer floors then carpet  It s very hot no air conditioner  I had a lot of trouble to gain access to the apartment  I don t recommend for summer  The check in experience was horrible  I was tempted to cancel  I had so much trouble obtaining the key  The host seems to be a corporation which does not provide the best experience because they are not even aware of the condition of the apartment   The apartment was not comfortable no Air conditioner and Chicago is now in the      hot temperatures 
389050643003015978,Location is awesome but unit just doesn t measure up to pics or my standards  I should have went with hotel instead this time around  Hi  I did send pics of the mold in shower tub caulking  The unit overall did not look clean and did not have fresh smell at all I had to had fresh smell myself  The A C does not cool entire unit and with TV only being in living room space it was simply uncomfortable staying here  The remote stopped working on day two  Yes  the replacement was offered  I would clean routines  A C performance  adding TV in bedroom  The price was not worth the stay  Thanks 
569636472581587551,Customer service is the worst  Once I pay an extra night they did not generate a new code for me  so once I went to eat  they kicked me out from the Aparment and then I had to be outside for   hours while it was snowing waiting for a new access code   There is not a phone number and if you chat they take   hour to answer back  It is not a good idea to stay here  Customer service is the worst  Once I pay an extra night they did not generate a new code for me  so once I went to eat  they kicked me out from the Aparment and then I had to be outside for   hours while it was snowing waiting for a new access code 
763055295,It was over all an okay place to stay  First   days the air was not working took them two days to get back in contact with me  The bathroom shower curtain was dirty like it haven t been clean  There was so much stuff from previous stay that was in the couch 
465969887169699503,To start off with the pros the location is close to lakeshore restaurants and stores  Getting in the rental was easy             The cons we finally made it through the two front doors and once we got to the Airbnb the room was completely dirty  Bed wasn t made garbage in the kitchen  tub had a bunch of dirty towels sitting in it  Ants were on the floor and I had to sweep to keep them away and it is a basement studio  Called zen and they said someone would come and clean the room and for us to come back in an hour after we had to wait until  pm and our flight got in at   am and was told no early check in and to have to wait another hour was a complete inconvenience on top of the room being dirty  Other than the location I would not recommend staying here  you would be better off paying for a hotel room  You told me I would be given a refund of   night and a clean fee and I haven t received neither yet  I called and messaged you and there was no answer  I just called and the phone just keep ringing  I will be taking this further if a refund is not given back as we discussed 
762560665,This property was filthy  Stains on the couch and bedding  dirt grime on all of the walls as well as in the tub shower  dirty appliances  debris on the floors  etc  I left immediately  booked a hotel  and am making other arrangements for my stay in Chicago  I travel for work  staying in Airbnbs for    months out of the year and will never book with zencity again  as they clearly do not manage or maintain their properties well 
451408866695550470,THE GOOD  BAD AND UGLY GOOD   AC  washer and dryer worked well   Unit was well supplied with paper products   Customer service rep  Andrea and maintenance man  Jeremiah were very good in responding to problems  See below  BAD   Property was very dirty  kitchen floor and AC vent were black with dirt   smudges on the walls  drapes were falling off the wall and blind were missing slats and draw strings resulting lack of privacy and security issues  repair took two weeks   Sections of flooring in the hallway were missing which could cause a stumble and fall  UGLY   We had a    day pre paid lease and were illegally locked of our unit for more than    hours   We had to go to a hotel without fresh clothing  sundries and medications  After returning to the apartment we could not leave the unit because the access key pad had be improperly installed and would not lock    Another call to have something fixed 
759673144,Do not stay here  This apartment was filthy   Bathroom was not clean  Soiled tissues make up wipes in the toilet  empty travel size soaps in the showers  hair all over the floors  grime build up along sink faucet  Dried up contacts and hair found on the bedroom floor  Ashes on terrace floor  Only   outdoor chairs were clean enough to use  Tons of grime on the refrigerator water dispenser  Oil stains on the stovetop  I notified Zencity about this when we first arrived and requested someone to clean immediately  They wouldnt send anyone until our last day  Sunday  when we were checking out Monday    I requested a refund for at least the clean fee and never received a response  Worst Airbnb experience Ive had by far    dont stay here  This apartment was filthy  I sent a message on may   th about compensation and you never responded   completely unprofessional  I would never recommend Zencity as a host 
393447232232011267,I would not stay here again   Lots of clean needs to be done to pass any hygiene standards      The code we were given to get in was the wrong one  the building was extremely hot  the place was filthy per our previous conversations and pics sent   The automation of info wasnt as appreciated as a personal fast communication we received from other AirBnB hosts 
539112855103479472,NOT a Zen experience  ZenCity does not comply with the Chicago Heat Ordinance which require landlords to keep daytime temps a minimum of    degrees  As a result when I arrived the pipes were frozen   it was in the single digits during my trip  No water in the apartment until the middle of the next day   And I was unable to stay warm in the apartment  I was denied my request to control the temperature  they control the Nest thermostat  And my requests to speak with a manager went unfulfilled   I do not recommend staying here  Need to align your policies with the City of Chicago Heating Ordinance  Your lack of compliance with the law made my trip miserable 
563734922431799404,Host was not honest about the Airbnb  They knew the building would not have power during my stay before I booked the room and did not share that  When the power went out and I tried to contact them they were extremely slow response and were not honest about the problem  Refusing any refund but offered     off my next stay with them when I made it clear I will not be using there company ever again  Host was not honest about the Airbnb  They knew the building would not have power during my stay before I booked the room and did not share that  When the power went out and I tried to contact them they were extremely slow response and were not honest about the problem  Refusing any refund but offered     off my next stay with them when I made it clear I will not be using there company ever again 
426769567428030176,    Thanks for the stay but you were sending me so many text that was false because the time you texted I was never there and I did not have a baby with me
446388955424994568,Overall the apartment was decent and its in a pretty nice spot  I travelled from Indiana and had asked several times about how the parking worked and never really got a clear answer but was offered a  pm early check in which I accepted  I asked all of my questions between  a  p and all of the responses came overnight so I essentially got the response the next day  not a big deal until I had problems getting into the apartment    First off  the parking garage isnt available until you check in so you have to park on the street temporarily  check in  then move your car into the garage  The front desk staff was less than helpful and literally handed me the keycard and said  Im sure you can figure it out   not really Zencitys fault but they could provide more info in their check in instructions   From there I figured out that the ONE assigned parking spot is on the  th level which connects to the  th floor of the apartment building  The one keycard is needed to access almost everything   including garage entrance and exit  building entrance  elevator buttons  except floor    and so on  Not a huge deal but the one card created a few logistics issues  Check out is also a bit of a hassle because you are asked to leave the keycard in the room  but you need it to get out of the garage   so you have to get your car out of the garage before you go back upstairs to leave the keycard   Check in was a bit of a nightmare  as I mentioned earlier Zencity offered early  pm early check in which I accepted  I was able to get the keycard  park  and get up to the apartment  with a ton of my mothers luggage I might add  only to find that the   digit code I was given to unlock the electronic deadbolt didnt work  I reached out to Zencity for help but didnt get a response  We decided to put all of our luggage back in the car and continue on with our day  Later when we came back  well after the normal  p check in  the code magically worked   The posting says the apartment hosts    and with an air mattress this could easily be    I had indicated there would be   in my group yet there where only   towels  There was also only one dish towel in the kitchen  There were no hot pads or oven mitts for the oven  and there was only one cooking sheet  There was no standard coffee pot  just a french press  again  not a huge deal for me but it may be for someone   The  smart  thermostat constantly changed to some setting other than what it was set at  There was mold in one of the showers  the fridge is scratched and dented  one of the tables is damaged  the wall mounted toilet paper and towel holders where all falling off  the trash can was broke  the doors squeak and one of the chairs is so bent it doesnt sit level  For those that care  the apartment building has a rule stating only two persons per apartment in the pool   This may seem like a lot of complaining but I spent the most Ive ever spent on this particular Airbnb and I feel like there were a lot of little issues that all added up  Its obvious no one lives here permanently and so many of the little things have gone unnoticed  Need to improve communication  All responses to my requests happened overnight  When I had an issue checking in no one responded  Also provide more info about parking   you have to park on the street for a bit before getting the pass to the garage  Parking spot     is on the  th level which connects to the  th floor of the apartment building  If you offer someone early check in the keycode needs to work at that time 
531182884843389393,We picked this unit thinking it would be nice and in a nice area  the area was not bad  However  the unit it s self was run down  You could tell they tried to give  luxury  upgrades to the unit  We arrived on       the unit was not clean pass first glance looking  In fact the last time the unit had been clean was       and the property manager forgot to wipe it fully off the wifi board when he did the walk through  The sad part is he knew the unit wasn t clean and tried to comment that he was checking behind the cleaners  Not only was the unit not clean there was bugs flying around in the bathroom and on the ceiling in the bathroom  the walls in the unit are thin so the neighbors walking and continuously barking dog are heard all night long  Literally the dog was barking from the time we arrived till the time we left  The windows also need to be resealed as they let in quite the dead as one on us now has a cold  We would turn the heat on and the rest of the unit would be warm but the bedroom freezing  To top that off on our second day we came back to the unit only to be staring at an eviction notice from the building owner stating they were evicting zencity and all occupants in the zencity unit from the building  This was the Worst Airbnb experience the host was not communicative at all and we were very uncomfortable leaving our things there upon receiving the eviction notice  We dealt with an eviction notice and an unclean unit  The floors were gross  there were bugs flying around in and on the ceiling of the shower and the window seals let in a bunch of cold air making one of us get a cold  The walls are super thin in the unit and we constantly heard noice from those above us  The neighbors dog barks a majority of the day 
755859619,Beware  This listing is located directly over a very loud bar that is open until at least   a m  While I very much appreciated ZenCitys efforts to find an alternative place to stay for my second night  the description of this unit gave no indication at all that the apartment is located above a VERY loud bar that was open until   a m  when it then turned rowdy customers out on the street to continue the loud partying until   a m  The floors were vibrating because the music was so loud  This resulted in me getting about   hours of sleep before a very important  day long business meeting  It was a nightmare  In addition  there was no hair dryer after I doubled checked the listing before packing my bag for the trip  Finally  the entrance to the building was blocked by HUGE boxes left on the staircase  I literally had to wedge myself and my suitcase through the door and climb over the boxes to get to upstairs to the apartment  Very dangerous and completely ridiculous  While I very much appreciate your staffs efforts to find an alternative place to stay for my second night  the description of this unit gave no indication at all that the apartment is located above a very loud bar that was open until   a m  when it then turned rowdy customers out on the street to continue the loud partying until   a m  The floors were vibrating because the music was so loud  This resulted in me getting about   hours of sleep before a very important  day long business meeting  It was a nightmare  In addition  there was no hair dryer after I doubled checked the listing before packing my bag for the trip  Finally  the entrance to the building was blocked by HUGE boxes left on the staircase  I literally had to wedge myself and my suitcase through the door and climb over the boxes to get to upstairs to the apartment  Very dangerous and completely ridiculous 
754800731,We were disappointed that the apartment was not as clean as we had expected  The front bedroom bed sheets had not been changed  There was no top sheet  creases that looked like someone had just slept on them and there was hair on the pillow case  I was going to put fresh sheets on the bed  but the ones I found in the little freestanding bedroom cabinet were in a ball on the shelf and also had hair on them  The bathroom door was filthy  and there was toothpaste on the wall   The entry to the building was filthy as well  I wouldnt rent this airbnb again  They dont post photos of the tiny bathroom  most likely because they couldnt get a decent angle for the camera lense due to the size  It wasnt as clean as I would have liked  not terrible  but definitely not as clean as a bathroom should be  The grout is filthy  the door had splash marks of some kind down it  there was toothpaste on the wall  and the paint around mirror that acts as a door of the  medicine cabinet   where the extra shampoo is kept  is completely worn off where you open it  It wouldnt take much to touch up the paint every once in awhile to make it more presentable  Its obvious the owners have no pride in the place  It was easy to get the key out of the lock box that is attached to the door of the building  That being said  the tiny entry to the building was not only filthy  it was full of old mailers and boxes  Its actually a hazard  If I could post the pictures of the tiny entry and the narrow  dirty staircase that runs at an angle  I would  The bedroom that looks over Belmont was not clean before we arrived  There was no top sheet and there was hair in the bed and on one of the pillow cases  There were creases on the fitted sheet which looked like a sheet after someone has slept on them   I looked under the fitted sheet at the mattress pad and it had disgusting stains  I found extra sheets in the little freestanding closet  but they were dirty as well  It truly was disgusting  Needless to say we didnt use that bed  When I complained to Zencity regarding the dirty sheets and mouse poop in the kitchen cabinet  they kindly offered a  touch up   However  I truly didnt want one of their cleaners back in the unit when we were not there  and since we were not going to use the dirty bedroom  or any of the kitchen amenities  we decided it best to turn down their offer of sending someone in to clean   They did offer a refund of our clean fee  which we accepted   That was very generous of them  Location is good  and street parking was easy and plentiful  but noisy at night due to it being directly on Belmont 
754720654,Worst experience traveling ever with Zencity   Never going to use Air BnB again   st time last time  Never will I use Air BnB again  Chicago is a dump 
411535612816934968,horrible  dont do it  horrible customer service
411504373879130889,ok place
390483435013961892,Check in directions were not accurate   Place was dirty and worn   Smelled terrible in the entry way  Bed linens has stains on them  microwave was dirty and the floor was dirty  Couch is cheap and uncomfortable  No pillow protectors  so gross  My son didn t stay with us for it was gross and we left unsafe    Overall  the listing description and pictures do not reflect what you really get   Don t believe the listing  I contacted the company and they do not care about making us feel better about our experience    Hostile neighbors left us feeling unsafe    THIS PLACE IS A BIG NO  I have shared our experience and you don t care
394195264447111102,Don t get me wrong  this apartment is nicely remodeled  the location is perfect  the building is secured with gated parking and smart locks on every door  However  we contacted Zencity within    minutes of arriving at our reservation to inform them that the smart lock on the door was broken and wouldn t allow for the door to lock  We were consistently told that the maintenance team was coming  however the maintenance team never arrived  We checked in with them every few hours and we did hear back from them each time   However  we never got a response on how we could fix this ourselves or an ETA of the maintenance team  We even asked to be moved to a different rental or reimbursed in order to find a different rental property on our own  We were left there and received no assistance  It was incredibly frustrating that this company would leave young women alone in a city without the ability to lock their door  It put us on edge  and their lack of caring or urgency was not appreciated  As well  this unit was definitely not clean  There was an obviously used wash rag in the bathroom on the counter  previous renters trash found on the couch  and old food  rice  all over the floor next to the bed  Don t get me wrong  this apartment is nicely remodeled  the location is perfect  the building is secured with gated parking and smart locks on every door  However  we contacted Zencity within    minutes of arriving at our reservation to inform you that the smart lock on the door was broken and wouldn t allow for the door to lock  We were told that your maintenance team was coming  however the maintenance team never arrived  We checked in with you every few hours and never got a response on a fix or an ETA of the maintenance team  We even asked to be moved to a different rental or reimbursed in order to find a different rental property on our own  We received no assistance  It was incredibly frustrating that your company would leave young women alone in a city without the ability to lock their door  It put us on edge  and your lack of caring or urgency was not appreciated  As well  this unit was definitely not clean  There was an obviously used wash rag in the bathroom on the counter  previous renters trash found on the couch  and old dried food  rice  all over the floor next to the bed 
752801382,This is above a bar and VERY loud   Do NOT book this place unless you are cool with no sleep till well after  am   The host never responded and only gave me back    bucks when I canceled my reservation after the first sleepless night  I had booked for   nights    It was awful   And  there was a nasty hair folded into my towel   AWFUL experience   It is above the bar and very loud I had a huge hair in my bath towel Host never responded when I complained about the noise It is above a Bar It was above a bar and I had paid for   days and only got    bucks back after cancelling when I had no sleep the first night
391309981900164694,Make sure key work before
391955223855147231,No parking was a bummer   bed frame was broken to the point where half of the bed is completely unusable  Otherwise cool  Bed frame was broken and honestly a danger to your guests  Check in took    minutes as I had to troubleshoot the key box malfunction with customer service  No parking in the middle of a busy city was a pretty big bummer 
749232037,the property was not clean at all  Zencity offered me an immediate refund  Outside of being disappointed with the room  and having to find a new place same day  I received good service from Zencity  Absolutely filthy  Didn t match the pictures online at all  The art on the wall in the main online picture isn t even there in real life  I don t understand how that was clean  and how someone is expected to comfortably stay there  Should drop the price to     bucks a night 
412226036693028039,Just be prepared to haul your luggage a long distance  possibly up   flights of stairs  The elevators to the garage  the garage your advised to park in  were broken and had been for months according to staff  The roof top that is advertised is for  residents  only not Airbnb guests  All in all this was a disappointment  Not recommended for older individuals or anyone with knee issues 
424735266569927297,Though the location of this unit is perfect and had potential to be a wonderful stay the unit was not clean and we needed to move to a hotel   Immediately upon entering the unit  we were hit by a strong cigarette smell  After walking around in     degree weather waiting for check  in we needed to shower  One of us hopped in the shower and we soon found out they there were no towels in the unit  Not even a hand towel  The  shower was filthy and was covered in the last guest s purple shampoo  The purple shampoo was in the tub and the shower curtain  The shower curtain was covered in mold and extremely dirty   We needed to dry our selves off with back up sheets which were in a closet that unfortunately also had stains    Gross   In between the sink vanity and the cabinet there is black mold which is a health hazard   The bedsheets had hair on them and appeared as though they had not been washed  The carpet was covered in crumbs  and the floors were covered with dust and debris in some sections    The couch pillows were stained   The kicker is that there was a  last clean  sticker by the wifi code  The date on it was over   weeks before our stay   Though the bed was made and the trash had been taken out it was very clear that the unit had not been thoroughly clean in between guests  Which is shocking as it is listed as  enhanced clean    We immediately tried to get in touch with the host and they did not get back to us for hours  until air bnb cancelled our booking   and processed a refund   When that happened  they immediately contacted us   What was extremely frustrating was that all of the other comparable units in the area had been booked and we were unable to relocate with another unit in the central west end with a kitchen or access to a washer dryer  We wound up getting the very last room at a hotel in the area  Needless to say  we reshowered    On a positive note  the doorman was fantastic  Our plane landed at    and they watched our bags for us until check in  The building staff were extremely lovely as well    Air Bnb also support was easy to work with and made it clear from the beginning that we were protected in this situation   I would avoid booking with this company 
452849703405296795,The A C wasn t working for the first day and a half of our stay  and it was extremely hard to get a response from the hosts without going through Airbnb first  The hosts had the maintenance people come on the second day with no warning  and we had to cancel plans we had because the maintenance people were given no instruction on how to get back into the unit without us there  The key FOB given to us did not work to access the unit  even though it was supposed to as specified in the check in instructions  On our last night of our stay  we were locked out of the building because the keypad screen was frozen and the key FOB couldn t grant us access into the building  I could not get ahold of the hosts until I finally reached out to Airbnb support  The hosts did nothing to help  They just kept asking for photo and video proof that we could not get into the building  We waited outside for   hours just to get back into the unit  The only reason we even got back in was because of a resident walking her dog  This will be the last time I book an Airbnb from this company 
431819302523250702,Just didn t meet my standards  Property is old and the clean crew sucks  I got to one unit it was dirty  Communication suck and once I got in touch with somebody I was told I couldn t get a refund so they moved to another unit in a different building cleaner but old and the shower curtain was nasty dirty
745593501,I wish they would have spent more time setting up this place before making it available on Airbnb  TV wasnt set up  No lightbulbs in lamps  Price tags on decorative items  Also  we were only given two towels for the two of us for the entire weekend  No washcloths  No hand towels  I also had to ask multiple times for check in information  They finally sent it an hour after the scheduled check in 
438333860454118131,BEWARE  READ AND BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS      I have rented many Airbnb s  This is by far the worst experience I have had  I wished I believed the negative reviews and steered clear   to note for everyone  the host ZenCity is a large property management company that specializes in marketing and AirBnB and drives their costs down by offering terrible management services   here are the Key issues I ran into  They are all common themes amongst reviews     the digital locks malfunction OFTEN  we were locked out of the property for an entire evening  We called the host  a call center in the Philippines is who answers  and we were on the phone with them for   hours  in the rain  with my   and    year old daughters  to argue with them about the problem and they never sent anyone to help us  We gave up and got a hotel for the night   We made videos and provided to the host on how their new wifi   digital only locks were not accepting input     service is terrible  if you have an emergency  liked a family of   with young kids being locked out for the entire night due to a wifi lock not working   there is no actual owner   people available  ZenCity  the host  is a large property manager and you only talk to call center representatives in the Philippines   When we eventually had to get a hotel for the night  the host even argued   declined to reimburse us for the hotel  Luckily Airbnb is handling this for us      the property is filthy  Crumbs on counter tops  sticky floors and hand railings  hair on rugs  stains on towels etc  even trash left on the rooftop patio    the property is run down  The clothes dryer doesn t work  the toilets run  the outdoor furniture is moldy  literally     the property stinks  like cigarette smoke and dust   All in all  it is house is a run down dump with worn out trendy furniture that is run by a large company who don t really care about the property  their service  or you   It s better suited as a party house for a beer pong match and not a place any family  especially with younger children should consider   And to the host  shame on you  Your business model puts the end consumer dead last  We were locked out ALL NIGHT because of malfunctioning digital locks and you had no contingency plan for emergencies  What if one of my children had medication  What if we had an infant and needed formula  diapers etc   It disgusts me how little you think about the peoples lives who rent your homes  This is a terrible business model offering fully outsourced services with no real ownership  and one of the reasons AirBnb has a bad name amongst homeowners  You should be thrown off this platform  As discussed  the property was very dirty  the clothes dryer did not work  and the lock malfunctioned and there was no physical key available   you were unable to have anyone help us while locked out
394927800831001657,We spent an hour trying to enter the apartment because the lock was broken  so we just sat outside on hold with all of our luggage after traveling in July  then when we finally got inside  they hasn t clean from the last guests
745552250,if it wasnt for how dirty the place was    it was a close location to university chicago medical center and walking distance to the lake    to bad the place was filthy bed was full of hair  fridge was gross  definitely not covid    clean
745466347,Nice places but very poor communication  They have no thermostat so hopefully they get this worked out  I would love a return phone call  And some customer service to deal with these issues   I ve been trying to reach someone about my stay for   days  Supposedly booked two studios bc they didn t have anything to sleep two people   Even was told they couldn t offer one w a couch  One place ended up being a full apartment w couch and bedroom and could have slept    Also had no thermostat in hmeither room and the place was insanely hot over a warm Chicago weekend  Also no lights in master bedroom  Key pad code did not work  Got a return call hours later w a new code Absolutely impossible to reach  Miscommunication about the rooms  Very unhappy  Still have yet to get a return phone call  I paid for two rooms when I didn t need to  Was told both were studios and one was a full apartment that could have accommodated   people
745074287,The condo was grossly misrepresented  The condo was not professionally clean  carpet was not vacuumed and kitchen floors were not mopped   stove and vent for the stove was dorty  dead bugs on the floor  bug trap with a lot of dead bugs inside of it  horrible smell of smoke and other orders  extra pillow had blood stains  stains on comforter  urine stains on the bed skirt that looked like a small animal urinated on it  and more  I have pics and video to prove  The claims show up much better in the video  The location was great but the place was too nasty to stay  It was my first airbnb stay and it was horrible  Left and stayed at a Marriott hotel instead  The location was grossly misrepresented  I have video evidence to prove and I want to share with you  Could you please provide an email so I can do so 
445586200193083109,Bad experience  The reviews are      accurate  the walls in this unit are made of paper  You can hear water flushing and feet stomping like they are inches away from you  The entire unit was so poorly constructed we thought the door was going to come off during our stay  Absolutely not worth the price we paid for it  Would not recommend  I am blown away by what we paid for this unit  Over      a night for this unit was outrageous  You need to have someone check out the door frame on the entrance  because it is about to come off the hinges  Will not be recommending this unit or your company to anyone 
744371708,I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone  The fob wasnt given to me  I was given the wrong access code to enter the building  I had to stand outside for a while to wait for someone to enter  exit the building so I can get in  I couldnt use the gym because I didnt have the fob   The shower was disgusting  The water wasnt going down the drain and it kept getting higher and higher  I contacted the host and they wanted maintenance to come fix it but I didnt sign up for This  The sheets were dirty with black hair on them     My hair isnt black        stars  Still waiting for my refund I would like a refund The photos are a little different I didnt get the key  I was locked outside and had to wait for someone to enter exit the building for me to enter  The bed was dirty with black hair on the sheets  The water in the shower wouldnt go down 
744328105,We were headed to Chicago to visit colleges with my daughter  The location was perfect  The place looked too good to be true   and it was  The bathroom shower was clogged so we stood in dirty shower water  I notified them right away and there was no response until late the next day  We went out and bought Liquid Plumber and prayed it would work  It sort of did  but still wasnt draining properly  There was a yippy dog that barked most of the daytime that we were there  Luckily  it stopped at night  Then while we were trying to sleep  water pipes were ticking all night long followed by swooshes of water  We were supposed to be there for   nights  but couldnt stand it  The lack of sleep was getting to us all  We ended up leaving a day early and spending the night at a hotel  Unfortunately  this place only had   review when we booked  so I trusted that itd be a great place  Do yourself a favor and book somewhere else    Unless you plan on getting wasted and passing out at this place so you dont mind any of the noises  On the upside  the appliances and kitchen were nice and clean  and the place had a cute deck out back to hang out  The location is awesome  but parking was hard  We ended up doing SpotHero which worked out better  If you stay in this area or downtown  dont bring a car  The public transportation is awesome  You can take the L almost anywhere  still waiting for reimbursement for inconvenience and the liquid plumber we bought  Really disappointed in the delay and lack of response from your company  overall  the place was clean  but the bathroom shower was not  It was clogged and left us standing in a pool of dirty water when we showered  I emailed and called about the clogged shower and there was no response until the next day  It was so gross that we had to go out and buy Liquid Plumber and pray that it worked  The clogged shower  a barking dog all day  creaking floors from the person above us  and loud pipe noises all night long  Wasnt worth it  We even left a day early because we couldnt take it 
392713923370032756,The property was in a great central location  however the parking was horrible  Checking in was a nightmare  I had to reach out to receive check in information as it was not provide it before hand  Then after    hours on the road get to the property and the code does not work  After calling customer service I was on hold for    minutes just to be told they would call me back in    After    minutes I called them back just to be told to download an app to enter the property  The app did not work as the last person was still connected to it and no way to disconnect them  So for another    to    minutes we were given code after code to try entry none of which worked  The final code which was    digits long finally worked  Once inside all of the blinds were broken and the shower did not work properly  I had to call customer service several times during my stay  the only rep that tried to resolve any issues was Mariano  I hope I spelled that right  This property is listed as an apartment but it really feels like a college dorm  I would not recommend if you are looking for an apartment 
435469625434765239,Ok  so I am going to start with the biggest issue  On the day I was leaving  I found a dead bed bug in my clothes that I picked up off the floor  I immediately messaged Zencity to tell them about this and to ask if they had previously had a bed bug issue or what the deal was  I messaged them on      and it is now     and they still have not replied  This is terrible customer service  Please READ ALL THE REVIEWS  I wish I did  If you read them all  the complaints that people have are valid and      true      Communication is non existent  They send you form messages and there is not a human to check the inbox apparently      The place is dirty  Both beds had hair in them  And it reeks of cigarette smoke  All my clothes and luggage smelled like it after returning home it was that bad     The photos online are either photoshopped or very old  The walls are filthy and covered in patches and different colored paint  It looks really run down for the price you are paying      The stairwell is super dirty and sketchy  Multiple steps creek and sound like they may fall in at any minute      The neighborhood is the only nice thing about this place  HOWEVER  please note that it is not convenient to get downtown and to the major tourist destinations  Maybe it was pre Covid when an Uber Lyft didnt cost     each way  but now it is not  Like I just said  Ubers Lyfts were very expensive to get downtown and the subway is a    minute walk  Plus  once you get to the subway many popular places require you to transfer trains and then walk about    minutes after you get off the train  So in short  it took us       minutes to get anywhere which used up a lot of time and was also just really frustrating      Oh and this one didnt really matter  but it is principle  They sent a message saying to  enjoy the snacks they provided us  but there were no snacks lol     So again  read all the reviews  the things people are saying that are negative are true  I would not stay here and would not rent from Zencity  Those that had a positive experience must have very low standards  I messaged you about finding a bed bug over a week ago and you still havent answered  Luckily  as of right now it seems like it was just a dead one and there wasnt any live ones that left any eggs   but it is still really bad business that you never answered me  I gave ample time for a reply before resorting to leaving you a bad review  I would never stay at one of your places again 
744107375,Beautiful views and GREAT location  near John Hancock and Water Tower    However  cleanliness is an issue  An easy resolution to this would have been responding to me after you knew no one came to clean as you said they would   The apartment was beautiful and we would have loved to book it again  but obviously we will not return to this property  The view was amazing and so was the location   My daughter and I were able to walk pretty much anywhere we wanted to go as the apartment is about three blocks from the John Hancock Building  The sheets on the sofa bed were stained in multiple places and there was a used pillow on the floor under the sofa   I sent multiple messages regarding this and the rug in the living room needing to be vacuumed   Zencity replied saying they would send someone out that day   IF someone showed up   the sheets were not changed and the rug was not vacuumed   That evening when I emailed back I received no response   I emailed two more times and still received no response  Communication was great until I put in a second request to have the apartment clean properly   After that  I received no additional responses   It is really disappointing because the view and location would have brought us back repeatedly 
392214637291954530,The unit was absolutely filthy  When we checked in there was hair in the shower  a filthy stove  shockingly dirty glasses  dish ware and cutlery  dusty vents  and a pungent smell of cat litter  There is also a neighbor who smokes on the deck and you can smell the cigarette smoke in the kitchen  The entrance foyer is filthy as well    We reported the issues to Zencity but they were not very helpful in resolving these issues  When we decided to cancel the reservation and request a refund  Zencity was not helpful at all and we have taken the matter up with Airbnb    Avoid this place and the management company    Do not book with Zencity  They will take your money and not refund you  The unit was absolutely filthy  The stove had grease marks  the was hair in the shower and on the sink  the neighbors smoke and the smell infiltrates into the unit  the carpets were stained  the walls were stained  the building entrance was filthy  I wouldnt recommend the unit or Zencity to any one 
434750213198412092,So I really thought this was going to be a great stay  and if Zencity has responded to me I think it would have been  Starting with check in  they should tell you to park out front with your hazards on while you get the key and ask for a cart to load your things  I never figured out how to use the parking pass  so every time I went in the garage I used the call button and told them I didn t understand  and the garage let me out  Check out is also confusing  so I would again park out front with your hazards    Next  the smell  I failed to read other reviews and only looked at the star rating when I booked  but this place smells like rotten egg  I m not sure if it s a gas leak or just smells like that  but looking at other reviews  it s a persistent problem  That alone really didn t bother me  after a few minutes you get used to it  and the place is so nice  It looks super clean  has a cute view  nice people in the halls  and the location is just amazing    But  then I went to bed  And as soon as I laid down  it smelled like pee  So of course I finally message Zencity  They said they would send some one in to check if I allowed  I agreed if they let me know when because I have my dog with me  and they didn t reply for over    hours  I told them that was ridiculous  so they never responded and never came to look at it  I stayed here for   nights in a pee bed and never heard back from them OR AIRBNB    If they had come and made things right I really wouldn t care or be writing this review  because mistakes happen  But the lack of care on there part and on Airbnb s blows my mind  So yeah  I would highly advise not staying with Zencity  It s confusing  gross  and they won t respond to your problems 
410154686534955315,This host is VERY unprofessional    This place was very dirty  no clean service what so ever  I sent in pictures  spoke with   different people  they emailed and said they started a refund but ever contacted me or Airbnb  it has been weeks   I have yet to receive a refund  I called Airbnb and they told me that this host didn t even create a case to be refund  I have NEVER left a review on anything before that s how horrible my experience has been  Cleaning service horrible
413004242274297283,I will say before getting into things that the apartment itself was not bad  It had decent space  a nice kitchen area  and a good sized closet  The neighborhood as well is a decent area all things considered  Thats basically where the positives stop  Getting into the apartment was frustrating and stressful  I received an email with basic instructions on how to get into the building  but took me several minutes to even find the apartment as the instructions on how to get there are clear as mud  Once I get there  there is an electronic keypad to get into the apartment  The code I was sent didnt work  I had to call up support who gave me a code to let me once  and then emailed me a code to use going forward  Once in I grab the FOB and placard to park in the lot  keep in mind you have to park on the street during this time  which you arent supposed to do   I get into the parking lot  and notice there are numbers on the spaces in the lot  and a number on the placard  but not a matching space number to the placard number  I call up support again  who after going back and forth told me that all they could do was suggest I call the parking lot attendant  there isnt one and it was nearly midnight   Eventually I just parked in a spot and walked around looking at other peoples placards to verify whether there was assigned parking or not  Once I parked I got back to get into the room  new code doesnt work  Call up again to get a new code  and the rep just gives me another new code  Next day  same issue  Im told eventually I need to download an app  which I really didnt want to do  but was basically told it would be the only way to ensure Id be able to consistently get access to the apartment  As far as the apartment itself  it was far from perfect  You can tell that the apartment has seen better days  There are several spots where the wall has been damaged and paint worn off  Multiple towels have stains in them  and when the AC kicks on you can smell cigarette smoke  Overall I dont think Ill ever get an airbnb from this company again  I will say before getting into things that the apartment itself was not bad  It had decent space  a nice kitchen area  and a good sized closet  The neighborhood as well is a decent area all things considered  Thats basically where the positives stop  Getting into the apartment was frustrating and stressful  I received an email with basic instructions on how to get into the building  but took me several minutes to even find the apartment as the instructions on how to get there are clear as mud  Once I get there  there is an electronic keypad to get into the apartment  The code I was sent didnt work  I had to call up support who gave me a code to let me once  and then emailed me a code to use going forward  Once in I grab the FOB and placard to park in the lot  keep in mind you have to park on the street during this time  which you arent supposed to do   I get into the parking lot  and notice there are numbers on the spaces in the lot  and a number on the placard  but not a matching space number to the placard number  I call up support again  who after going back and forth told me that all they could do was suggest I call the parking lot attendant  there isnt one and it was nearly midnight   Eventually I just parked in a spot and walked around looking at other peoples placards to verify whether there was assigned parking or not  Once I parked I got back to get into the room  new code doesnt work  Call up again to get a new code  and the rep just gives me another new code  Next day  same issue  Im told eventually I need to download an app  which I really didnt want to do  but was basically told it would be the only way to ensure Id be able to consistently get access to the apartment  As far as the apartment itself  it was far from perfect  You can tell that the apartment has seen better days  There are several spots where the wall has been damaged and paint worn off  Multiple towels have stains in them  and when the AC kicks on you can smell cigarette smoke  Overall I dont think Ill ever get an airbnb from this company again 
394934424250866490,I would not recommend renting this property  It was not clean  The tub and sink in the bathroom were slow draining   There was no coffee pot and very sparse kitchen utensils  It was a very nice large space but very poorly maintained  There was a large living room and dining room but no dining room furniture  Our check in process was very disconcerting  There was no key in the primary box and no key in the back up box  The key finally found was in the clean service box  This whole process took     hours  The check in process was very difficult  You have that info in your records  The unit was not clean  The bathroom sink and tub were slow draining  There was no coffee pot in the kitchen and there were very sparse other kitchen utensils  no hot pads and more  The dining room had a very small cafe table and   very small chairs  There was no dining room furniture  The most worrisome thing however was the condition of the door lock  It was a dead bolt but the space the dead bolt went into was larger than the bolt  The bolt did lock deeper into the door but the door was very loose and we believe it could have been kicked in easily 
741312577,This place was filthy   Whoever clean it prior to our arrive did an awful job  Had to demand a refund from Airbnb  because the owners stopped answering my calls after I requested a refund  which lead to several other issues   There is only one tv in the entire apartment  The bedrooms were small and crammed   Parking was horrible   Not the best location  Dogs were barking non stop 
397045690415138179,The only real issue here is the lack of free parking but if youre willing to pay a few bucks a day or not needing to park most of the day  its a decent walkable area to be in  Unit itself was fine as a place to sleep  Better off just getting a hotel probably The lack of free parking should have been highlighted more up front in my opinion and the front door code for the building didnt always work   The space was fine generally  Mostly just issues with parking and getting in a few times along with a  broken dryer
394937427473892736,Me and   other guests just completed our stay here and felt very mixed in our review    Pros  The location is awesome and the apartment complex is quite secure  If you don t have a key fob you can t access anything within the complex  We felt safe within the apartment  It also had a parking spot which was very helpful  It was within walking distance of the power and light district as well as many cafes and restaurants  The beds were quite comfy    Cons  Unfortunately we had a lot of issues with Zen city  We quickly realized they are a large company that are in it for the money and not to help guests  When we arrived the access code for the key didn t work  After calling they were able to quickly help us get a spare  Once we were inside we found that there were only   towels for   guests for   nights  This was obviously an issue  I reached out asking if they d bring towels and while they responded quickly and assured us they would be bringing towels ASAP and it was a priority we never got towels despite asking and hearing the same response each day  This was very upsetting as we felt they were just dragging us along when we would have been understanding if they had just said they were unable to provide more towels  We had guests using hand towels and paper towels to dry off and zen city never made an attempt to help fix this  We felt that the service  the apartment  and the cleanliness were not worth the high price that we paid to stay here  It did not seem very clean  the bedding had stains on it  there were dust bunnies everywhere  and the apartment was not very homey and incredibly empty except bare basics  We tried to be very understanding guests  When we arrived the code we received to access our key didn t work  it said there was no key with that code  Upon calling we were able to get the spare key  no big deal  However  when we entered the unit we only had   towels for   guests for   nights  I contacted zen city Friday at   to ask for more towels and we were told they would be delivered to us ASAP  However  they were not  I contacted again on Saturday and on Sunday and each time we were told that the towels would be delivered to us ASAP and it would be a priority and it was not  We had to use hand towels and paper towels to dry off because only two guests had towels  It would have been one thing if we were just told that you could not provide more towels but you kept jerking us around saying you were bringing towels  It became very very frustrating especially for the ridiculous price that we were paying for the unit  The unit also did not appear as though it had been vacuumed and appeared as thought it was minimally clean  The bedding also had stains on it  Overall we are very displeased with the service of Zencity  While communication was quick  it was all empty words and nothing was ever done or completed 
396338559509505990,Not accommodating I know you are a big company and it would have been really appreciated had you helped us out with our incident and at least considered a partial refund 
410005905448481302,Arrived and the unit had not been clean after previous guests  It threw a massive wrench in our vacation plans as they would not respond for hours  We had to get a last minute hotel  cancel our reservation and seek a refund through Airbnb because they just left me hanging for over five hours saying they were  looking into it     Im sure the experience would have been smooth if the place was clean  And it probably is     of the time  But in a pinch  they are not on site and their support communication was absolutely horrible 
425264745742039598,Worse air bnb ever  Location was horrible  customer service was even worse  Could not talk to anyone for a while  room and gate key fob was lost  Will never come back again    Worse customer service ever  
468767106532339202,I had few issue during my stay  The internet was not working  This was my second time staying at Zencity  The first time it was pleasant experience but this time I was not happy  The place has bad smell and the place look older and smaller that the pictures  Also the internet was not working and I wasntable to work 
439760282626857397,The apartment fit the description  location was great  decorated very nicely  Check in was all digital  However  it was incredibly dirty with sticky floors  hair  and generally dirty shower  We did not feel comfortable using the shower at all  Generally I am not picky about such cleanliness  but this was excusable  We could not get in contact with Zencity during our time  The apartment was incredibly dirty  There was calcium build up and hair in the shower and sticky floors  It was disgusting  We could not get in contact with you the entire time 
411519019287523803,This apartment condo is in a good location  However  they need to have a better relationship with the front desk  No one was there for check in for at least    minutes when me and   other couples arrived  We were eventually let up by a random tenant that asked if we wanted to use her key fob to go upstairs  The instructions are slightly incorrect on how to get into the room as well  While there for my short stay I saw one roach and one waterbug in the space  They need to do a pest control check in before new persons occupy the space in the future   Overall nice space  but need to update procedural check in standards and cleanliness checks  Please review cleanliness standards in the apartment for pest control reasons 
485526235041436828,This was my first AirBNB experience  I was really unsatisfied with the service  The code they gave me to get in the building did not work  The second one did  That issue was solved fairly quickly  The second day the sink in the kitchen backed up from the drain  I didnt even use the sink  Nasty water was spilling all over the floor  I called them and maintenance came the next day but did nothing to fix it while I was staying there  He said he did not have the correct tools and they would be sending someone else  I never saw them  The last night of my stay the keypad on my door to the room stopped working  This was the real mess of this trip  First  I had to walk to a convenience store to buy a  V battery to try and get it to work in case the batteries were low  This was after midnight  so it was tough to find one open  My phone was running low because I had no access to my charger in the room  The guy on the phone had me download an app to try and work the keypad over Blue Tooth  This did not work either   He told me to go down to the front desk and ask for a key  but there is no front desk  After an hour and a half of trying to get in  I asked it there was anyone he could call that had a key to the second door in the unit that just had a key lock  I guess there wasnt because no one ever came  He said he would try and contact someone but never did  Four hours later he called to see if I had gotten in  I felt like he just left me with no room  bathroom  or my belongings  I would not stay at another ZenCity location  Here are a few suggestions  On check in  make sure you send the correct Front Door code  This one did not take too long to fix  so that was good  Two  make sure maintenance is kept up on in the apartment  The kitchen sink backed up through the drain twice while I was there  Maintenance came but did nothing about it during my stay  Nasty water was pouring all over the floor with no way to stop it  Maybe if you provided an emergency maintenance number or something  Third  make sure the door key pad works to the room  I saw a couple of reviews that said they had an issue and the person I called for my issue also mentioned that it had happened  If it is already a known issue  why hasnt this been fixed  I got back from a concert and the door would not open  The person I called did try to help me at first  We tried downloading an app for Blutooth access and I had to walk a mile to a store to buy a battery to try to make the pad work  Both did not work  The person I called eventually stopped taking my calls for hours and left me waiting in the lobby without my things  a room to stay in  or a bathroom  He was supposed to be trying to contact someone who could come with a key but he did not  My phone was running out of battery because my charger was in the apartment  If that had happed  I dont know what I would have done   I was eventually able to get the door open after physically moving the pad on the door   Four hours later he called me back and asked if I had gotten in  I said I finally did but no one ever came to help  I had to be at the train station early to come back home and if I had waited on him I would not have made it  I did not get to use my last night in the room because of this mess 
413719495617975526,The apartment was fine  although our experience was less than satisfactory due to misinformation in the Airbnb description of the property and a complete lack of communication from the Host  First  we specifically booked this unit because it was listed as having a washer and dryer so we could clean some clothes in the middle of a long trip  It did not have a washer and dryer  and our communications asking the host about this during our stay were completely ignored  I made multiple attempts to communicate with the host  starting immediately after we arrived for our two night stay  and other than a non substantive  we re looking into it  I heard nothing  Second  the unit was listed as being three blocks from public transit  It was much further than that  and it was a hike and took nearly an hour to get to the Loop on transit  If you want a decent unit close to the University of Chicago and don t need anything from the host  this is a fine unit  But the listing was inaccurate on several points that were critical to our experience 
394881744221459174,Check in was listed for  am  When I arrived at      am was told I couldnt check in until  pm  Wasted my day waiting around in a thunderstorm  Customer support was useless didnt have the ability to check me in or fix any problems its all automated  Others had the same issue  Stay somewhere else avoid Zencity properties  booking was listed for  am check in I showed up at      am was told couldnt check in until  pm  Waited   hours when Zencity called me back said I could check in it didnt work they finally canceled the reservation after I wasted my day hanging out in a thunderstorm  I will never use a Zencity property again  Their support staff is useless  They didnt have the ability or knowledge to fix the problem 
394900868829102414,The building is only secure in the front  any joe could walk in the back door without a fob  The entire building smelled of dog urine  Dog urine found in elevator and in hallways  The apartment was clean but that was the only thing that was clean  Parking was too far away and not convenient for a family with lots of luggage  The trashcan in the parking garage on the first floor hadn t  been emptied in probably a month  Wasn t       sure there wasn t a body in it because it about made us vomit when we got out of the car and that was on the third floor  One of the bedrooms had a busted window and they put  tape and a plastic bag to cover the hole  Well it rained  so we couldn t sleep in the room because it was hot and humid  The tv sound was awful had to turn it up loud to hear which wasn t all bad because it drowned out the dogs barking in the hallway  I have never been happier to leave my vacation and would have if there would have been other vacancies in town  Zen city and Airbnb should take this place off there bookings list  I will never use them again  Changed my dates and zen city said it was fine and Airbnb dropped the ball  Then we had to stay an hour away from the city because everything was booked up  I did get a refund but thats besides the point 
423904127806481655,Disappointing  To start with  their  parking options  are expensive  Finding the key was like something out of an Indiana Jones movie  Once we finally figured out how to even get in  the apartment is lack luster  The bedrooms have no TV  the living room has a small TV  WiFi is spotty  the shower faucet in the small room was nearly falling out of the wall  the light switch in that same small room was cracked  the chair in the living room had a broken leg    To finish off my stay  the host accused myself and my guest  both    year old sober men  off  peeing the bed  and claimed after our stay a  noise sensor  was missing  It was like they put lipstick on a pig  Do not recommend 
412224857651781824,Buyer beware   My airbnb had no hotwater and I had no response from ZenCity  There was never any hot water and no response from ZenCity on the issue 
453533336551619299,Dirty shower and bathroom  Temperamental door lock and wrong main door code  Charged me twice so I suggest you check your bank statement  Got locked out in the rain when code didnt work  The shower was scary dirty  And got locked out of room  tricky lock  Only good thing was the person on the phone who tried to fix things 
440600198977244229,This is my first and only bad review I ve written on Airbnb   The AC did not work  which on its own isn t the end of the world  What happened next though is unacceptable   I called on night   and was told someone would be out the next morning  They also said they would call me with updates  Neither happened   Called on night    exact same conversation on the phone  They said they would call me back with updates and that someone would be out that afternoon  No call  and no one came   Same thing the third night     I m pretty sure every person I spoke to was informed not to call me back since it was   different people and they all seemed sincere  so very likely the owner manager told them to leave me hanging for whatever reason   It was pushing    degrees outside and I was sweating the entire stay    A part of traveling is feel safe and secure and I don t think these owners take their tenants security seriously  If you say you are going to call someone back  then call them back   You ignored me on   occasions
414507479429724354,Close to the lake 
395429878561905968,They double booked and never notified about it  I couldn t get inside the apt bucause somebody else was in there already They double booked the apartment and i had to find out while trying to open the door while the other renters were in the property
440589354111739794,Would not recommend
398489002619774140,Not what I expected Dryer broken  Among other things
396372999836896478,Great location  and check in was very easy but we had some issues during our stay  The clean job wasnt the best  The appliances  microwave   dishwasher  did not work for over half of our month long stay  The team at Zencity is quick to respond but they say theyll get back to you and then often dont ever follow up until you reach out again    The space is cute but should note that its a little smaller than it looks in pictures   the couch   tv are so low to the ground so the room looks bigger 
415142287600623543,Same as last time   robo company that only gives robot responses  You did nothing to help my experience
521792201182108758,Could not get into the building the whole stay  Had to have tenants let us in every time we went out  which made leaving a chore  Tenants stated that this issue was known and nothing is ever done to remedy the problem  Upon arriving to check in  was also unable to get the key out of the key box  Had to call and have somone open it remotely  Pictures online are deceiving  What looks like a upscale loft is actually an subpar apartment  Hardly any furniture  and what was available was very uncomfortable  suggested parking options were deplorable  Somone backed into my brand new vehicle  Parked in an alternative lot with no issues afterwards  Silver lining was a decent location  and a clean decently stocked apartment  Could not get into the building the whole stay  Had to have tenants let us in every time we went out  which made leaving a chore  Tenants stated that this issue was known and nothing is ever done to remedy the problem  Upon arriving to check in  was also unable to get the key out of the key box  Had to call and have somone open it remotely  Pictures online are deceiving  What looks like a upscale loft is actually an subpar apartment  Hardly any furniture  and what was available was very uncomfortable  suggested parking options were deplorable  Somone backed into my brand new vehicle  Parked in an alternative lot with no issues afterwards  Silver lining was a decent location  and a clean decently stocked apartment 
394130249825770565,If your looking for cleanliness DON T stay here  While staying at this location we had issues with the wireless lock and needless to say the whole time we stayed Friday   Sunday we couldn t lock the door which caused a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety    When we contacted Zencity regarding the issue they could of cared less and never sent out a maintenance team to get the problem fixed  I spent   hours of my vacation dealing with this issue along with the cleanliness of the place  Missed out on a group tour because of it as well    In my opinion not worth the stress or headache  Pictures don t represent the property in its current state  Make sure all your equipment is working properly  Locks  washer and dryer if advertised are useable  Have a maintenance team on call in case any issues come up  Very disappointed that we could t lock our door during our stay and no one came to fix it
441273632819315003,Inaccurate listing  Unclean shower  No pool  No parking  No front staff   All floors had the trash overflowing  Apartment looked nothing like the pictures  Construction was going on in the neighboring apartments and it felt as off they were hammering for    hours of the day  I ve stayed in about    Airbnb s in my life  friends or mine  and this was by far the worst I have had  No thank you
409389942983916254,Pros  Perfect location  easy check in  square footage  and bed quality    Cons  lack of amenities that were supposed to be included like a hair dryer or coffee maker  as well as a general lack of amenities   e g   only two forks and very few kitchen items   The noise monitor in the living room tracks your sound level and makes it virtually impossible to use the space at all   While talking in normal voices with the TV on in the background we received multiple calls messages  all before the stated   quiet time  began at    PM  saying we needed to quiet down  It felt like we were unable to use the space we paid for for anything other than sleep  so we ended up having to spend more time out of the rental than we would have liked to   Overall  an okay experience  Would be a great option if you re only looking to sleep in the rental and not use it s kitchen or living spaces  Pros  Perfect location  easy check in  square footage  bed quality   Cons  lack of amenities that were supposed to be included  e g   hair dryer  coffee maker  causing us unforeseen expenses  and the noise monitor being in the living room makes it virtually impossible to use the space at all   While talking in normal voices with the TV on in the background we received multiple calls messages  all before the stated   quiet time  began at    PM  saying we needed to quiet down  It felt like we were unable to use the space we paid for for anything other than sleep  so we ended up having to spend more time out of the rental than we would have liked to 
399214111520463670,i will never stay with Zencity again 
414417996713726753,Overall i would not recommend   the place was not sufficiently clean  internet and television were not working  trip hazzards leading into the kitchen  drywall falling apart    However the location was great with some good restaurants in walking distance  Salt and smoke was the highlight of our stay We appreciated your hospitality     However  the television would not work  leading into the kitchen is a MAJOR trip Hazzard the place was not sufficiently clean pubic hairs in the shower  and a mound of dust on the vent right at front door   we absolutely loved the location  Salt and smoke was a   star    But overall from the drywall being cracked and falling apart to the floors being uneven and seperating and the trip hazzards  Unfortunately we would not stay again and would respectfully not recommend it to other travelers  With it being      for two nights we at least expected a clean environment and the internet to work so we could enjoy movies once we were done exploring the city 
392753545543977280,Cockroaches  filthy stained couch  wobbly furniture  shower in first floor leaks  gnats insects were present daily in the basement bathroom  code was changed twice by Zencity without notice to me and I got locked out twice   One of the two washing machines was  not operational and both dryers were out of order during my one week stay   I reported everything to Zencity and they offered me a partial refund of the clean fee for all my troubles  I paid over        for one week    Ridiculous and worst experience Ive ever had with an AirBNB rental   In the grand scheme of things  the fact that there is no coffeemaker is not a huge deal  but pointing it out in case  any of you consider that an important part of a rental   It was more of an annoyance that there wasnt a coffee maker given all my family and I dealt with  but some people are serious about their coffee so throwing this in for good measure   Other than the location of this rental  this was really the worst apartment rental ever  and I never give bad reviews  I just dont return to products or services that Ive not been happy with but this one seriously needed to be reported   Please review the many messages I sent during my stay regarding all the issues I reported   getting locked out because the code was changed more than once without telling me  cockroaches in the apartment that I reported and no one sent to address until the day before my departure  broken  wobbly  filthy furniture  etc   Its all in my messages and in the refund request I submitted along with a detailed explanation of what I reported during my stay 
434791285825146910,The condo is very well laid out and bright  Furnishings are very nice  Bed is comfortable  Location is downtown and close to great restaurants  One grocery store downtown a few blocks away  Parkade is across the street  Gym is very good  Pool area very nice   We had several issues though     Poor communication with management  Messages sent were answered much later or not at all  If there was a crisis we would have been left in the dark      One fob provided  Needed for elevator and room of course  Very hard to plan around one fob and   people  I asked for another and they replied much later that it s not possible      Fob for parkade was fine  But a strip with barcode is provided to enter and exit parkade  Instructions only say to use at entrance and exit  Could NOT find scanner  Asked management via message  Was told to use at entrance or exit   Had to ask another vehicle leaving parkade  You in fact have to hold barcode up onto windshield  Scanner is on ceiling by exit  Impossible to see or know without being told      Bed was sloppily made  Toilet was not clean  No cleaner or brush to clean it  Floors dirty  Walls had several foot prints  hand prints  Paintings missing on walls  Lamp not working      No coffee maker or kettle in a beautiful kitchen  Asked about this and was told to feel free to use anything else in kitchen  Coffee maker would be a great plus  A toaster would be great too      Limited towels  Only one in kitchen      Huge walk in closet    hangers      Dryer sensor is not working  Dryer kept turning off and on  Condo is a great space  Here are the issues     poor communication  and delayed replies     fob with scanner was not explained as seen in text to you  Have you actually gone into parkade to see how it operates  We had to ask another vehicle for assistance  It is NOT clear      cleanliness  bed was not made well  Floors and toilet were dirty  No toilet brush or cleaner to keep it clean  Walls were covered with hand prints  Foot prints as well  Paintings or pictures missing on walls  Lamp not working      kitchen is advertised but not equipped with a kettle or coffee maker  This would have been great to have  Toaster would also be great  Why offer a kitchen      carpet was not clean or vacuumed enough      not enough kitchen cloths or towels to dry dishes      one fob for a couple   We had to plan our departures and arrivals around   fob  Not convenient at all      no hangers in closet      something wrong with dryer  possibly the sensor 
464963391778048606,I could not gain door buzzer access to the apartment building to even check in to my Airbnb this company rented out  They then told me They refunded my money  But it s currently being investigated by the Airbnb resolution center as a scam  I have course have yet to see my       I have yet to get the refund for the room that I could not gain access to  The resolution center with Airbnb is currently investigating it as a scam 
423203679214939295,it was okay for a last minute stay  the blinds are broken in the living room  the window sill in the hall needs some work  the bathroom door doesnt shut right  the front door didnt lock right  their towels looked dirty glad I brought my own  and the oven looked as if it hadnt been clean in months
428909576474329750,There as no hot water in the shower and they did not send anyone to check until mid afternoon the day before I checked out  There was someone else s hair smeared on the side of the shower  I had to call them to get the door passwords because they didn t email me anything in a conformation  Literally a borderline scam  Don t go here
426616785531471045,Im not sure if this was just an anomaly  but my reservation was delayed an hour for clean  so I dragged my bag to a museum to kill time  When I returned  the intercom system did not work as detailed by Zen  I could not get into the building without looking like a suspicious person  and I certainly could not leave after that because I would have to rely on strangers going in and out  So I talked to Zen on the phone and the guy was very helpful  but there was only so much he could do  apparently  So I dragged my bag to a local restaurant and waited another   hours while a repair crew was supposed to remedy the problem  Nothing was changed when I returned  so I asked for a full refund and canceled the trip  Before canceling  I was supposed to have contacted AirBnB directly  which I honestly thought I had  So when I got home  I did receive a refund from Zen  but not from AirBnB  So another hour on the phone was spent with a different helpful person  but you could sense they didnt want to give me anything for all of my trouble  After persisting  I did get a full refund and a small credit toward another AirBnB in the future  Im not sure my time was worth all of this trouble  I appreciated the support I received on the phone  but ultimately I had to cancel the trip because it was far too long to wait to even get in to the building  which never happened 
436934744418829221,This trip was uncomfortable and the accomodations were disappointing  The unit looked nice but still had cheap leaning furniture  The air unit needs to be fixed it blows hot air and the wifi barely works  I didnt appreciate the way the company handled the communication with us either  I would suggest renting another property  its not worth the hassle  It takes almost an hour to connect to the host  Maybe the worst rental Ive stayed at and Ive been all over with Airbnb This trip was uncomfortable and the accomodations were disappointing  The air unit needs to be fixed and the wifi barely works  I didnt appreciate the way your company handled the communication
439760199387659154,I was very disappointed  A couple days before checking in I had contacted the host for any possibility of checking in earlier  check in is at  pm   they didn t get back to me  So the day of check in we ended up arriving       assuming everything would be ready for us to check in  Unfortunately that wasn t the case  the receptionist informed us that she didn t have the key to the apartment  since they were still clean it inside  We received the key       mins later  Once we went inside the airbnb we expected it to be clean However   we took a look inside   it was very dusty   shower did not look clean  I would recommend if cleanliness is not top priority but location is  Also communication with the host sucks 
454389446662874766,I would not stay with zen city if given another choice  As other reviewers noted  it s impossible to get into the building without asking for help from a resident  When we finally made it to the unit  there was no fob  We cancelled the stay at that point since we couldn t leave and reenter the building or unit easily  The check In system makes it impossible to have a relaxing stay 
396389720826695251,Unless they fix what they are saying  Don t trust this company  Place was dirty  no pillow cases  just not a place or company I would use again      Coming from someone who was born in       raised in Hyde Park  Father a huge professor head of the foreign language department at U High laboratory schools  I have the email from zen city showing I was to leave the keys on the table  Since there were only Two tables in the entire  what use to be a one bedroom turned two  Normal logic would say put keys on coffee table  Which was what we did  Until that is resolved  I will not give a good  or bad review 
400659522955631200,Shower drain did not work as well as toilet flushing  Brought it up with the owner and they ignored me  Also window AC couldn t keep up with the heat
423157471331079154,The unit is nice and the area is decent  some nice restaurants within walking distance    Please do not rent this unit  Our unit had   bath towel per bathroom  no shampoo soap and a dirty rag hanging in the shower     Zencity is an awful  awful management company  I requested early check in for noon  it was accepted  I got to the unit at        There was no fob in the lockbox  instructions followed perfectly  I called Zencity and messaged on the app and sent an email to their email address on their website  I spoke with a woman and she said she d call me back in five minutes  I waited   hr and    minutes and called back  A man answered  He told me he was also going to call me back in   to    minutes  Nothing  I waited until      as maybe they forgot about the early check in  Still no fob  I tried calling  and Zencity blocked my number from getting through    I used my brothers phone and got through and eventually after   hours of waiting  someone helped me    Everything negative about the unit posted in the reviews is true  The kitchen dining table chairs are not safe  they collapse if you lean back too far  The couch is ripped    These are all easily fixable things but Zencity is horrendous and doesnt care

400669361732048761,N A I m writing to you regarding our recent visit to your property at     W Belmont on          Although the room was clean and as expected upon arrival  we were very quickly disappointed and upset for the remainder of our stay  We ran into a huge issue when we realized that the AC was broken  No matter what approach we took to turn it on  it remained completely shut off  This made our nights virtually unbearable  It was in the   s in Chicago and we had to try and sleep in an     degree room throughout the evening  Opening windows only made the problem worse as it didn t cool anything down and the train noises woke us up just as we were able to fall asleep    I reached out to your company to come and check out the AC unit on     in preparation for our second night  I received a response asking if someone was allowed to come in and take a look  I responded that we d be out of the room for most of the day and we re expecting someone to come take a look while we were out  However  after returning home we realized no one had been in the room and it was just as we left it  AC unit still broken   We were most upset that we were told someone would come fix the issue and no one did    This situation is unacceptable and we are planning to write about our experiences in an online review  We would consider not posting anything if you can give us some sort of refund for our stay  It s not fair for us to pay      for a room where we were only able to sleep   hours each night at the properties expense    I look forward to hearing back 
423945244996413243,Not the best check in procedure and they were not able to find a solution  It took them over   hrs to try and get us in  We were never able to check in because the keys were not in the location we were told  It took them over   hrs to figure out a solution and by then we had already made arrangements to stay elsewhere 
412495207845666813,Fuck this place they will still your money  They will purposely leave you in pending status for review  the minute you book another airbnb   pay for it  they will ignore your withdraw or cancellation request for booking   charge your account then send you checkin instructions   the address to the property  Key word the host here will do this directly after you cancel withdraw your booking request also   I believe airbnb helps them because there waz no withdrawal option for this host but I was able to withdraw with no problem with another host who took to long to respond    leaving me with no other option but the cancellation request   I sent a message because I thought it was odd that the withdraw request was not available   note this was all done before any acceptance  address of property   check  in information  They still took my money told me I dont get a dime back  so I paid      for two airbnb   only stayed in one of them for two days  I could have stayed home   paid my mortgage for that amount  my husband   I just had left his step dads funeral   we were sad   flustered   decided to get a airbnb for a couple of nights because we didnt want to bring that energy home to our kids  this host will fuck you with no vaselune   airbnb will help them In order to leave a review I had to enter atleast   star bur this airbnb did not deserve that  I never stayed at this property didnt go nowhere near it  They left me in pending approval status   waited until I booked   paid for another airbnb   withdrew   canceled my request to book with them to accept me   send me checkin instructions and stole my money out of my account  Airbnb helped them steal the money   the said a host has    hrs to respond to a request   thats fine but if a customer cancels or withdraws before a location or checkin instructions is provided   airbnb   the host knows that another airbnb has accepted   you are using their airbnb instead  A FULL REFUND IS A NO BRAINER   So fuck this host   airbnb the fraudulently scheme to still potential customers money   they refuse to give it back  I know I am not the only person this has happened to I can see a class action suit coming for Airbnb in the near future   I promise to be the first in line
426790844217863241,The checkin instructions are not valid for this unit   Ava sent me a message with the instructions  but things fail on the first instruction   I immediately messaged Ava Zencity  and never got a reply   After about an hour  a clean lady in the building took mercy on me and walked me up to the unit to try the  rd instruction   That worked   Once I had the key  I could come and go as desired   The unit itself is very boutique ish   In most cases  it was very clean sterile   However  there was some kind of padding or tissue that was very wet on the nightstand   It also looks like someone kicked in the bottom of the bedroom door     Ultimately  I would stay here again if the entry instructions were updated and accurate  The checkin instructions are not valid for this unit   I messaged Ava yesterday when I tried to get in   She still hasnt replied   It took me almost an hour to get past the front door  and that was just because a clean lady decided to help me   None of the tenants were willing to assist   That hour was critical  causing me NOT to be able to attend the Negro League Museum before it closed at     The cleanliness comment   There is some kind of wet pad or tissue or something on the night stand  and there was a little bit of other clutter that looked like it had been left aside   The card key is on a lanyard  but has tore away from the lanyard and is a lost card waiting to happen   Lastly  it appears that somebody kicked in the bottom of the bedroom door 
395645893702887245,No room number posted outside of door  hard to find room  Also  the code to get in the building didn t work  Security guard had to let me in  Code to get into building didn t work  Called and messaged about issue with no communication  Security guard had to let me in  Also  room didn t have room number listed outside of door so it was hard to find 
400731467030343198,DON T DO IT  We booked an apartment with Zencity for our    year anniversary  When we checked in  there was no fob left in the unit which allows access to the building enables the elevator  After messaging through the app  calling and waiting on hold and messaging calling through Instagram  We finally got someone to answer and we re told they would call us back  Got no call back when we were supposed to and we re forced to get a hotel room for the first night  We were told the second day at around noon that a fob was left at the front desk but when we asked the front desk  no one had been given anything  After that Zencity refused to communicate with us despite multiple phone calls and messages  The apartment was what we expected but if your trip is important  don t book with Zencity  I can t believe after leaving us without a place to stay the first night that you would continue to ignore communication attempts until after the trip was over  Terrible customer service and really surprised that you conduct business this way 
446961481308115528,This apartment needed a lot of repair  I d call it a fixer upper   It was very disappointing and we did not stay  not even one night   The cleanliness of this apt was very bad  Grime on doors and shelving  hair along the hall floor and baseboards  crumbs and dirt on the kitchen floor  fingerprints and smudges on the mirrored side table and glass coffee table  The large rug looked worn and stained and the venting in the bedroom was thick with dust  lint and sticky grime   No pride in this apartment   The walls showed wear and tear  ceiling was damaged  had stress cracks and the paint was sloppy  thick  gunky  caked on and chipped in places   Ceiling  light over table had three of  five working bulbs  Entrance way and another light fixture also had missing or non working bulbs  Electric light switch in hall did not completely covered the hole housing the electrical wiring   a gap between plaster and hole   The inside front door knob and lock also was ill fitted  and did not make one feel secure  In addition  there were three different doors gate to enter the apt  This was very cumbersome and would require two hands  The directions to entry gate did not include the first code at all   The instructions also directed guest to walk  up  the steps which was on east side of building  when they should have said walk  down  the steps   the west side of the building    The balcony looked appealing but the doors to access were so heavy making it difficult to open  Also there was a bad smell ruminating from below the pool looked to be the color green   algae   I sent many pictures to the the host in hopes of receiving a total refund  To this date I have only received about a third of it   My husband would have preferred to sleep in our car rather than to stay at this Airbnb  We checked into a holiday inn and the next day found another Airbnb  Very disappointing  Unable to stay at this Airbnb   The apt needed a lot of attention  Cleanliness was very poor  grime  hair along floor and baseboards  crumbs on kitchen floor  stains on surfaces  dust  noticeable finger marks and prints on side and coffee table  soiled carpet  venting in bedroom  thick with dust  lint  sticky grime   This apt needed a lot of repair  No pride in this apt  Walls were damaged  ceiling had stress cracks  paint was gunky and sloppy   many places were marred and chipped   Ceiling lights had missing bulbs or light bulbs were burned out    Three codes for three different doors gate required to get into this apt  Very cumbersome  Host had to troubleshoot problems over the phone to guide us into entry  Instructions to access apt were not accurate  no code for gate  directions to first gate were incorrect   The balcony looked appealing but the patio door was heavy and difficult to push open  There was a bad smell from the pool directly under the balcony and the pool looked to be green  maybe algae   I sent many pictures to the host in hopes to obtain a total refund   We simply could not stay at this Airbnb  My husband and would have preferred to have slept in our car  instead  we found a hotel room and then another Airbnb  This place needs a lot of attention and repair 
423188199130559957,The place was very nice   clean  Beds were comfortable  But the customer service part was horrible  We got locked out multiple times  had to wait outside for over   hours to wait for someone to bring up a keypad to back into the building  Other then that everything was great  Please work on communication with customers  we waited for   plus hours  to hear something back from Someone  Also we were locked out of our Airbnb multiple times   had to set outside with our children   had to wait over an hour for someone to drop off a key pad to get in the building 
401459322736006025,This was by far the worst experience I have ever had when trying to book a property  I have actually booked with Zencity several times and have had great experiences  There properties are normally in great areas  clean  well designed  and the staff is normally nice  professional  and responsive  But this time was nothing like that  I can t say much about the property itself except that the parking situation is horrible  I can t speak about the unit because I never saw it  I booked the property the same morning as check in  I requested an early check in  This request was ignored  Around   o clock when I still had not heard anything about my booking  I called them  I spoke with Andrea  she should honestly find a different profession because hospitality is not her thing  she advised that my booking was just then being reviewed and approved my stay  I received a confirmation email  my card was charged  Upon reviewing the confrontation email I found that there was not any check in instructions  I called back and spoke with Andrea again and she advised that check in instructions are computer generated and that I would have to just wait until that happened  Mind you it is after   o clock  When I expressed my displeasure with having to wait and not being provided a proper time expectation  she told me that the delay was my fault for waiting so late to book  as tho the booking I made that morning never happened  not one time during my interaction with her did I get an apology for anything  I then wait an hr in     degree weather with no response or check in instructions  I then call back and I m advised that the property has been double booked and there were no other properties available for me  I then tell Andra that this posses a huge problem for me because I used my last bit of available money to book this property and did not have the means to book another property while waiting on a refund from them  She offers no solution other than assuring that I will get a full refund  At this point communication between her and I completely breaks down  Which is then followed up with a note from her expressing how upset she was by my word choice and tone during our last conversation  Again  no empathy  apology  or real solution to my problem  I get a lecture  Fortunately  I was able to speak with Airbnb and they provided excellent service  I was issued a coupon to cover that nights stay at a different property  So around   that evening I was able to check in  relax  and forget about the anything but Zen experience  Andrea needs better training  She lacks empathy and comes across as robotic

427454081251080479,I will never book w  Zencity again after this TERRIBLE experience  FIRST OFF  was given wrong check in instructions so I was not able to gain access to the building  Called customer support which then they told me to ask someone nearby to let us in   already looking sketch  The man who let us in was a  maintenance man  with no badge or uniform  This same  maintenance man  was ironically going to OUR room   His purpose was unclear b c we were told the room would be accessible after   and this was after       He said it was  just to checkout the room  and his English was hard to understand   Meanwhile he was speaking Spanish on the phone with someone else the entire time  We approached the room to find that it was NOT Securely locked and cracked open      We knocked  I closed it and then put in our code to make sure this was our right room     It was and when we entered  IT WAS NOT EVEN THE ROOM PICTURED  the soap was knocked over on the island  sunglasses on the table  NO KEY FOB for building and garage access  The  maintenance man  just did a lap  flushed the toilet    and asked us if we were good with it all while still speaking Spanish and what seemed to be reporting to someone on the phone  I was not okay with what was going on and my girlfriend and I were pretty sketched out at the whole situation  We went back to the lobby   played phone message tag with a Zencity rep for about    min and they had no explanation for really anything  The concierge at the front office of the apartment was not surprised that we were having such trouble w  Zencity   their building  After being told that they had no other rooms available  AKA the room we originally booked  and after I figured out the room lock malfunction that was causing the door to not completely lock unless held tightly while lock was automatically locking  I felt safe enough to stay here but later regretted this choice after discovering how dirty the place actually was   Hair   debris all over the carpet and dirty surfaces   BUT WAIT THERE S MORE   Next day they also tried to charge me     for a WASHCLOTH that WE left behind because it had makeup stains on it       this whole company is a joke and everyone who had anything to do with our room should be fired 
452367761874978508,I wish I could leave   stars  You can t get into the building without someone walking out  The place wasn t clean when I got there and it honestly looked like someone else was staying there  Dirty tampons in the trash can  beds very recently slept in  wet dirty towels on the floor  there was even a knife out on the counter  The host didn t keep in touch with me and was very unhelpful with my problems  Do not book here   If I could leave   stars I would  Instructions to get into the building weren t accurate  The place was a mess and disgusting  And the communication with the host was terrible  Thanks for making it a terrible experience
414488845096480414,A true disappointment     First off  the building staff were absolutely wonderful  The ladies at the front desk were so kind and delightful  truly wonderful people  I do not believe they are associated with Zencity   I really dont like writing bad reviews  Ive had Airbnbs in several countries  as well as having stayed in Chicago a handful of times  and Ive never had a bad experience enough to warrant a negative review  That being said     Check in was not smooth at all  We were told a  PM check in  and by      the place was still unavailable due to being clean  The place is tiny so I cant imagine it took that long to do     The apartment was missing toiletries and basic kitchen items  where was the salt or pepper    No body wash or shampoo outside of liquid hand soap  Yes  we should have packed our own  that one is on me  BUT still kind of took us by surprise    We found a porn DVD between the couch cushions  Im not a prude by any means  but come on guys    if this place was  being clean  for an hour and a half  Id imagine the couch should have at least been looked at   The  what I assume used to be  white rugs in the living and bed room were stained  as were the decorative pillows on the sofa  The shower had hair on the walls before we got in  It just did not feel clean at all  especially considering the high clean fee Im paying     Parking was a nightmare during the weekend  but once you found a spot it wasnt too bad of a walk  Expect to pay      day if you stay at the lot to the south east  and know you wont be able to take the car out from   PM  AM   At the end of the day  this apartment had all the charm of a lousy hotel room  but without the amenities like getting more than   towels  access to toiletries  or coffee  and costing much more  Just did not feel cozy or particularly well looked after   The view was nice  Check in was a mess  the upholstery around the apartment was filthy and in need of urgent clean or replacing  and we were caught off guard by the lack of basic kitchen ingredients or toiletries  It was a real disappointment 
415845679485628490,I am really disappointed with my experience at this place  From a quick glance  everything seems updated and modern in the building and unit but when looking closer this place is definitely having some serious issues  I have listed some of my concerns below      The overwhelming smell of sewage was present in our unit as well as in other parts of the building  It seemed to be coming from either the bathroom or laundry room or even both  There is something seriously wrong with it  We tried closing two of the doors to the laundry unit and it didnt help  This was definitely the worst part of our stay      The communication regarding the sewage issue wasnt the best  We wrote in to notify them of this and they offered to have the clean crew come again but it wasnt an issue of clean but of the piping and drains in the unit  They didnt accept any responsibility for this and said it was the building maintenances responsibility  However  if you are renting out a unit I believe its YOUR responsibility to ensure that the standards are acceptable   We stayed there from Friday to Tuesday and the awful smell never went away      The keypad on the door to the suite was a little difficult  The code was pretty long and even when entering the code correctly and pressing the lock icon sometimes the door wouldnt open    From a positive perspective  I really liked the location of the building its only a few minutes away from some great restaurants such as Vin de Set and Little Fox  The key fob made it really convenient to access the parking lot and entry into the building  The unit had some stylish touches and was updated 
452815089270963123,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE   NO AIR CONDITION    Unfortunately  I would have rated this apt   stars  but I had no AC from day one   the apt stayed at     I called and messaged Zencity for all   days  but nothing was ever done  They would always tell me they would message or call me back with info about someone coming to fix the air  but never did  Beautiful home and amazing location   but very risky to stay here with how their customer service is  Beautiful home  but with no AC   poor communication on how to get the AC fixed was very frustrating  I worked most of the days  but coming home to sleep in a hot apt was horrible  I called multiple times and left multiple messages from day one but never got a response  I hope I can be refunded something for this experience
402856855819493922,I ve never given a bad review for an Airbnb as I ve always had great experiences   until this one   I rented this place only because it was the closest one that I could find to where I needed to be for my dates  When I arrived  the lockbox didn t have a key for the unit I was staying in and the  back up  lockbox was completely empty   I messaged the host but didn t get an immediate response   After finding a phone number  I was told to go ahead and use another key   Once inside  and starting to unpack  it became obvious the place wasn t too clean   The floors hadn t been vacuumed and the carpet in both bedrooms was badly stained   The worst part was the pre programmed Nest thermostat   It was     in the unit when I arrived   I turned it down to     hoping to get a good night s sleep   It took until   am before the unit finally cooled down enough to quit running  but as the temperature quickly began to rise again  it soon became apparent that Zencity had programmed it to shut off once the initial temp was met   To override the programming  you need to have a   digit pin number which Zencity wouldn t give me    They assured me they could re program it remotely to max out at       When I arrived back to the unit later that night  same story   back up in the high    s   The next morning  I decided to cut my losses  pack up and stay elsewhere   I messaged Zencity about the uncleanliness early on  and no one responded at all   Finding a parking was nearly impossible each night   I will credit Zencity with having comfortable beds and the linens were clean   The wifi and TV seemed to work fine  but I didn t stay long enough to use either much 
486936551918363385,I was truthfully disappointed by my stay here  I had a feeling this might happen given the mixed reviews  I stayed for a little over a month at this apartment  Starting with the positives  the location is pretty good  Youre at the edge of Hyde Park  but close to a bus stop  Youre also walking distance from food options and Trader Joes  and the lakefront  Theres a doorman       The apartment was larger than I expected with two large bathrooms  I only used the shower in the bedroom and it worked fine   Building is relatively quiet and lots of natural light too  Bed is decently comfortable  Unfortunately the apartment was not clean upon my arrival hair was still in the shower  hair was found in sheets  I had to pay to wash the sheets again   dishes had stains  etc  Apartment needs major maintenance  its unacceptable to have tenants stay in an apartment where the walls and the ceiling have cracks  This needs to be fixed  Additionally  the pots and pans were entirely scratched up  There were also no simple cooking necessities such as olive oil or S P  so I bought some and left it there for future tenants  Lastly  there was NO WiFi for my entire stay  I reached out to Zencity numerous times regarding this issue from the first day I arrived  A representative did get back to me each time  but nothing was actually followed through  For example  the first representative asked ME to reach out to the network company for a technician to come fix the issue  I did and no one followed through  I reached out to Zencity a few more times  I cant tell you how many times I was asked to turn the WiFi off and on again LOL  One time they asked for a friend stay at the apt while I was at work until a tech could come by  and no one showed up all day  I followed up with Zencity only for someone to tell me no one ended up coming  obviously   Nevertheless  the WiFi was never resolved  For the price I paid  which was a lot   this was unacceptable  I hope all of these are fixed for the next guests  Really disappointed by this stay  The apartment was not clean upon my arrival hair was still in the shower  hair was found in sheets  I had to pay to clean the sheets again   couch had crumbs  coffee table had stains  dishes had stains  I rewashed all the dishes I used   etc  Apartment needs major maintenance  Its unacceptable to have tenants stay in an apartment where the walls are cracking in the ceiling and the sides  this needs to be fixed  Additionally  there needs to be more utensils  the pots and pans were entirely scratched up  this is carcinogenic  Last but not least there was no WiFi for the entire month I was present  Each time I reached out to fix this issue  sometimes attempted to talk to me and act like they were going to resolve the issue only for another representative to message me about something else and the topic to change  Nevertheless  this was never resolved  I am planning to let Airbnb know about my experience here  It wasnt terrible  but its not acceptable for the price I paid 
402155113644125072,Good location but terrible communication
445601114864919653,first and last time I will ever stay at any Air BnB  To be   we couldnt even have dinner and have a conversation in our unit with out getting a noise complaint   mind you  we didnt even have the T V on nor the Radio     cant have guest come up to the unit   What kind of rules is that  what are we kids 
441271798531504837,Do not recommend this company for anyone  The customer service is absolutely AWFUL  We were locked out of our Airbnb for two days without given any alternate to access the building  When trying to reach out to the host  it took several phone calls which led to being told I would get a call back which never happened  When requested a refund  I was ignored  No surprise since I was also ignored while I was locked out of the Airbnb building during a thunderstorm  Terrible customer service  Terrible communication with guests  Terrible all around and will never use as a host again 
530457002209117018,Heads up for those looking for a long term stay  Do not rent from Zencity  More suited for short term stays  This is my honest review    Cons    The building is very old and was not clean very well  The hallways constantly smell like sewage  and the walls are thin  so you can everyone around you     The washer and dryer listed is actually in the basement  and is for all residents in the building   They do not have reserved parking for Airbnb guests here  It s     night for      month for the closest garage       minutes walk  and street parking is rarely available    Their is no central heating and cooling  just a window unit that doesn t have heating capabilities   The host did not provide a space heater  so it got very cold in the apartment     The microwave did not work and they never sent anyone to fix it    Communication was poor  and they would always say  we ll send someone to fix it    There are two very yappy dogs next door  which I know they can t do anything about    The gym was also under construction  They recommended another building that was a   minute walk    Pros    The location is about a       minute walk to Barnes    The view from the apartment was great   The guys at the front desk were awesome    I was supposed to stay for   months  but left after    days due to my experience 
400003030097578667,TV instruction Air conditioning and heating instructions No coffee maker just a French press Few things we disliked    It was clean but the smell of pine sol was very strong  The area rug and sofas were very dirty  old stain  the upstairs coffee table was broken and very dangerous  Really bad  A garbage bag was at the back door which was very unpleasant   In  the main  bathroom  the towel bracket was loose   The bathroom downstairs has a leak I m not sure from the shower or the roof  Also a description on how to turn the TV on would be nice and there was no knife  even for butter  My intention is not to be negative but you need to fix these things  
505797739159547762,Do not recommend booking with Zencity    if you need anything from them  they will not help you  We    couples  booked this place for a Friendsgiving trip  We arrived in the evening  and the next morning  I immediately notified Zencity of an issue in the kitchen  clogged insinkerator and rotting fish smell from the sink  presumably from a previous guest that cooked fish and tried to put it down the insinkerator   Zencity said they would send out a technician to fix the issue  but never did  They then  escalated  the issue  but again there was no resolution  Nevermind the fact that they never fixed the issue in the first place which negatively affected our stay  now that weve checked out they try to charge us for  unexpected clean  in the kitchen    A  How is it  unexpected  given that I alerted you immediately  we corresponded about it B  How is it our fault that your team failed to come and fix the issue promptly  when I clearly stated in my messages  have all the screenshots to prove it  that  you should send someone out ASAP to avoid further damage   I am beyond angry and frustrated  I have been a stellar airbnb guest throughout my   years of joining Airbnb  go read the    positive reviews that other hosts have left about my stay   and have never had trouble with hosts  Zencity  I am sorely disappointed by our stay  The morning after our check in  I immediately notified you of an issue in the kitchen  clogged insinkerator and rotting fish smell from the sink  presumably from a previous guest that cooked fish and tried to put it down the insinkerator   You said you would send out a technician to fix the issue  but never did  You then  escalated  the issue  but again there was no resolution  Nevermind the fact that you never fixed the issue in the first place which negatively affected our stay  now that weve checked out you try you try to charge us for  unexpected clean  in the kitchen    I am beyond angry and frustrated 
430339516025826032,This was far and away the worst experience I have ever had with an AirBNB  Zencity provided us with an incorrect code to get into the building  We proceeded to have to stand in the rain for    minutes while they got us another code  Once that was resolved  we went to the room to find that there was no fob for us to access the amenities in the building including the pool and parking garage  We called to ask that we get one so we could access these things and we were told it would be delivered to the front desk in the morning  They proceeded to not have one delivered and subsequently told us they would not be able to provide one  We were staying for four days and that is unacceptable  We filed a complaint and they did not respond within the    hour window  They had every opportunity to make it right and they told us they would not even make the effort to deliver on the things promised in the listing  We will not be staying with them again  You should resolve the issue with the fob  We should not have to stay for   days with no access to the amenities in the building  You also need to review your email being sent to ensure it is correct  We stood out front in the rain for    minutes because the entry code for the building we received was incorrect 
486157634827850347,The worst Airbnb experience I have ever had from start the finish  DO NOT BOOK WITH ZENACITY  We had issues with every part of the check in process which caused us to miss reservations and added stress to the entire trip  When we arrived  the voice box wasn t working but luckily a postal worker was able to let us into the building  We didn t have the key fob to get into the elevator  and zenacity wasn t responding to help so we were able to find a random person to let us up to our floor  THEN the key pad into our unit wasn t working  which took zenacity over an hour to figure out until we could finally get in  Our problems were supposed to end here  as there was supposed to be a key fob in our unit which would allow us to get back into the building  but low and behold no key fob  I contacted zenacity several times throughout the weekend but we were never provided with a key fob so we had to rely on other people coming and going to get us into the building and up to our floor  Following the stay  we had reached out to zenacity to give a chance for them to rightfully compensate for the entire experience  but they have stopped responding altogether now that they have our money  I will never book with zenacity again and you shouldn t either 
425382164553096093,  flights of stairs to get to the rental  It s very small  You hear sirens all night to where it s hard to sleep  Not the best area to stay in 
424546214837995692,The location was great upon arrival first impressions of the apartment was great until night fall there was no air of course I communicated this to the host and they reassured me they would set the air to cool off the unit  Well day two still no air also we noticed the washer and dryer set washing working only because there was a smell in the kitchen and that came from water sitting in the washer for a while which caused it to stink and I communicated this with the host as well and they sent a bogus nose complaint automated email which did make sense because at the time they sent it everyone was trying to sleep so the whole stay just became a headache the air didn t work at all not did the washer and dryer and we got no help with any of our issues so I don t not recommend anyone booking this location communication is horrible  Well it s horrible when you have complaints  Communication is key I was being communicated with up until I had issues
404259227689354248,Horrible experience  After driving a whole   hours  we arrived and our entrance code didn t work  We messaged and after a whole   hours we ended up having to get a hotel room  When we messaged this company for a refund they didn t even bother to reply  DO NOT BOOK HERE  We arrived and our entrance code did not work  We drove over   hours and we didn t receive a response till a whole   hours after we messaged y all  We were tired and had already had to get a hotel for us to rest  Horrible experience experience and we requested a refund and no response was made 
455806907067233772,This experience was the worst   From accessing the building  Instructions are not clear and confusing   I was let in by guest s    Having    seconds to make it to the elevator  because you don t have the fob yet in room     To arriving to your room only to finding out that your suite doesn t have a fob key   Because of all of this  I was left in a building where fob keys are used to operate the elevator and even the stairwell if you needed to move from floor to floor    I called and called all three days to not only receive little to no help but I was offered     off my stay  UNACCEPTABLE     Day    Friday    I arrived late in the evening and didn t make a call to Zencity  The next day  I did   Day     Saturday    I made   calls to Zencity about this issue  I was told the same thing over and over  They ll call management to get this resolved  When I had to leave the building  I could take the elevator to the  rd floor but couldn t come back up to my suite  Which  was on the  th floor  I had to either ask strangers to let me in  Or  ask the security that was his post to help me  I eventually had to cancel all my plans  I called additional   more times from the lack of call backs to only receive a message saying  we re moving you to the third floor  However  without a key fob  that was impossible  No staff  no random people were moving around the building in the late evening  I was then told to stay where I was   th floor  until staff arrived in the morning    Day    Sunday    I called multiple times  The issue was still not resolved  I could not move up and down the building with the fob key   Check out day  Monday    I was told there s no staff over the weekend so there was nothing they could do about it  My issue was basically brushed off by everyone the entire weekend stating the same thing   I ll call upper management to get this resolved   At the time I was ready to depart  I went to their  staff office  to find out that because this company is based out of California they had to call in and report issues  There was nothing I could request on site  They would have to approve it  At this point  I ve talked to   reps on this day and I would think they should ve placed a call immediately   The ONLY reason why I had so much communication with them is because I KEPT CALLING    The company AirBnb stated that after I was having issues  I should ve called them directly for a refund  I never seen this posted anyway  Supposedly  guests that experiences issues only have    hours to report directly with them  Or  you stuck only requesting a refund with the host    Out of       they decided to refund me     from an issue that caused me anxiety  lack of movement  no accessible to my suite  and prepaid cancellations of plans    Do not book this lockbox    With having no staff to assist guest that arrives to a room with no fob key is a NIGHTMARE    The worst experience ever 
442679497700604115,This was a terrible experience  honestly  My friends and I had to stand outside and wait for someone else to walk out so that we were able to get in  There was no key fob in the apartment  the woman said we wouldn t need one  We went out to a club  came back and were stranded outside for   hours because we DID in fact need a fob  The intercom was broken  They had to place us in another home for the night  forcing us to leave our belongings in the other apartment for the night  Aside from that  the man I spoke to on the phone BLOCKED MY NUMBER and I had to call from another phone  I ll be requesting for a full partial refund  However  the places were beautiful and clean  Just very unprofessional       
415921011973905353,BEWARE  Our check in instructions for the lockbox were inaccurate and we were unable to get in  I sent multiple messages with no response  When we called  we were given a completely different set of instructions to open a lockbox that was supposed to have several key fobs I side  The lockbox was completely empty  When we called a second time  the person we spoke to didnt know how to help us and promised another person would call us right back  We never heard back and had to find and pay for a hotel at       pm 
433268745238270645,Good things   Location  kitchen  This place was not well clean   I didnt see toenails like Ava but certainly plenty of hair  dust   Im honestly not sure if the cow rug was every clean   The shower is abysmal   It has no more pressure than someone gently spitting water at you and it doesnt drain all that well     Although this place is listed as a single level home you should know that it takes   flights to get up there and in classic Chicago fashion they would likely be considered out of date with building code these days   Once you get up there it is great to be above the street but it is no quieter at the top than at the bottom   I lived in Chicago for years and got used to the train  but if someone decides to be loud on the street in the middle of the night you will hear every last thing   The biggest complaint   Got a message from Zencity that we the property manager owner was going to be coming our last day for a tour   I responded and said that was not okay to have anyone in the place while we stayed   Im not hyper crazy about Covid but also not a fan of having someone s  I dont know in the only place I call  home    Got no response so messaged again and got told it was mandatory and they were coming   Contacted Air BnB and they agreed that was not okay   Got a call from zencity and I told them explicitly no to anyone in the place   They repeatedly asked if i would not give permission and said i did not give it   only at the   th hour  about    min before the  visit   did they call me to tell me that they postponed it     I would not stay here again   I would easily choose any of the other locations in the area over this one
419564019111147944,Weekend stay  Somewhat close to powerlight district  However  a long     blocks  The apartment was just like the photos  Pretty basic  We were worried about the check in process and key fob issues based on other reviews  However  once we got in the building and got the key card fob  in the room  all was well  You need that key card to not only get in the building but use the elevator up or down  So checking out and leaving the key card in the apartment was tricky  Value vs amenities was off  Pool hot tub closed  Entertainment  pool table  area in the photos  CLOSED  Many live there with barking dogs    I felt the place was a bit overpriced based on what we observed  EDIT  WE WERE JUST CHARGED      for dirty rags and marks on pillow cases due to womens make up    UNBELIEVABLE    DO NOT STAY HERE    REPEAT   DO NOT STAY HERE  Although there is little you can do about this but the barking dogs in the apartments are far from pleasant for a stay  We were also not aware that the pool and hot tub area were closed  That was a bummer as well   We thought the value of amenities vs cost associated was a bit off  Way too much to pay for a tiny efficiency with barking dogs and no parking with no hot tub  pool and living area was also closed  Should be disclosed   ARE YOU KIDDING ME    I WAS JUST CHARGED      for dirty rags and pillow cases   WHAT A JOKE    Its makeup  Wash the damn things before charging a guest this ridiculous amount        SO INCONSIDERATE    NEVER AGAIN   Review will be changed to reflect 
444184441599275558,This is a horrible place to stay  The place smelled like smoke it had cigarette burns on the carpet  the paint was chipping in the window panes   The elevators and hallways were dirty and smelled like pee   It s not a loft it s a community apartment living  This is a horrible place to stay  The place smelled like smoke it had cigarette burns on the carpet  the paint was chipping in the window panes   The elevators and hallways were dirty and smelled like pee   It s not a loft it s a community apartment living 
424646315950082642,There were no keys to get in as described by the host  We were allowed into the building by a neighbor and the apartment door was unlocked  That is when we found out about the scam and called the police  The host did not respond to any of our messages the day of the arrival  We got scammed  The place was unfurnished  The furniture you see is virtual  We had to find another place to stay and completed a police report  Watch out for scams 
447777504763908159,Sorry  but we cannot recommend this place  As another guest noted  we too were bothered by the constant smell of marijuana in the building  The entryway lobby was filthy  and not totally secure  as anyone could enter the lobby and elevator from the adjacent restaurant  The apartment was dingy and in need of a deep clean and an overall paint job  A large broken window was shockingly  repaired  by simply attaching plexiglass over it  the drapes were falling down  paintings and hardware were missing or missing parts  The kitchen equipment provided was comically cheap and sparse  Altogether  not a welcoming nor comfortable place to retreat to at the end of the day  A great idea  But sorry  this did not at all match what we expected from the listing  what view    nor rise to our expectations of cleanliness or care about the accommodation  To be fair  were not sure what you can do about neighbors use of marijuana  but the odor was pervasive and constant and unpleasant  especially in a non smoking building  And we of course realize that you cant do anything about the streets around the loft being more vibrant   Covid did shut a lot of small shops and restaurants  we clearly see    But we found the apartment to be      Dingy   It really needs a deep clean and a paint job  rugs were dirty and plainly not vacuumed on arrival  the oven was dirty  the hallway is dark  the street entry and lobby are unkempt and filthy  empty flower pots are also really sad    We could not tell that there was any special  covid  clean      In poor repair   The broken window shockingly  fixed  by attaching plexiglass over it  drapes falling down  missing hardware  bath lights out  painting missing from the wall  kitchen sink and toilet missing small but noticeable parts      Cheaply appointed   Silverware comically small and cheap  teakettle   a french press does not equal  coffee maker   a cutting board would have been nice  all the floor lamps were wobbly 
413753408860162276,A C was out entire stay   Was able to leave last day and get a partial refund   However location is great   recommend having a filling insured vehicle for the area though  
399952451731489102,WE DONT RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY  We had several issues with the apartment      The apartment is not kept well  It was dirty mainly in  the kitchen area and the rugs    The racks in the oven can t be pulled out which almost caused a fire in the apartment      The garbage disposal did not work   and the phone number they provided to use during our stay never responded      The kitchen does not have enough utensils and kitchen rags  The pots are old and dirty  the silverware was dirty  They do not provide you with soap in the showers there is only hand soap in the sinks and one of the dispensers did not work   The garbage can was dirty abs broken  The bathroom s trash cans did not have bags to help with hygiene      The  areas in the deck are for private use only and not open for airbandb customers as advertised   We were told to leave the area by upset  residents     A few outlets did not work    The overall feel is of an unkept apartment   it was not a pleasant stay   WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APARTMENT We had several issues with the apartment      It was not clean  mainly the kitchen area and the rugs    The racks in the oven can t be pulled out which caused the gravy of my meat to spill catching the oven in flames    a very dangerous experience      The garbage disposal did not work   we called the number you gave us several times only once someone answered who said somebody from management will call is back but this never happened  We spent the weekend with the sink full of dirty water    One kitchen rag is not enough    You should be embarrassed to have those old pots and pans in a rental apartment    The silverware was dirty      The description of the apartment said that the roof top was available yo is but when we used it a resident came upstairs and said that the area was theirs and was private and we could not use it  You misinformed us     There was no soap to shower 
428193659753155920,Don t reserve an early check in  they will accept it to have your business and once you arrive they will give you the run around until   pm  the normal check in  The place is nice but that s the end of my compliments  The place smelled like smoke after I had to wait   hours into my reservation to even get in  They never gave me a parking pass yet they charged me afterwards for the missing parking pass even though I told them there was none when I showed up  I literally had to write a note and leave it on my dashboard to stop my car from being towed  This is a company not a person and if anything is incorrect don t worry about them fixing it because they respond once or twice per day  and if you call they will get off the phone and say they will call you back and frankly it s       that they call back  Worst   day stay I ve had anywhere in saint louis 
416802803247894691,Host doesn t respond when there are issues   the patio is not usable Since you had to refund me because host didn t respond to Air not working   patio can t be use with garbage   lawn not kept up  Directions to get in were not easy to follow
420207831767978996,I ll start with the good and say that this is indeed an overall nice apartment in a beautiful little neighborhood   However  I m pretty disappointed in how the place is equipped  The internet did not function whatsoever after day    I spoke with another tenant of the building and she said her internet was down and the landlord did not respond    The kitchen had   sets of silverware  no cutting board  no kitchen shears etc  The coffee table was broken and you could barely set anything on it  There were no curtains on any of the windows  only blinds which made it difficult to sleep past daybreak  Overall it was the most Ive ever spent on an airbnb and they lacked basic necessities 
402092297703172241,Overall we had an okay stay in our unit but it is not a place we will book again  I don t recommend because of the lack of simple things  things that were expected but not provided  In the pictures it shows the roof top but the four sections of the roof with seating was for other apartments  They did not correspond to this unit  There were many problems  The sheets did not fit the bed so they constantly slid off to reveal a plastic over the mattress through the night  The bed sheets and pillow cases and comforter were not clean  They smelled musty  We had to wash them ourselves  no laundry soap included and no toiletries  Dish soap was placed in the shower as shampoo   The disposal in the kitchen was broken  they came to fix that but did not fix the other issues   The kitchen trash was broken  the stove was very dirty  floors were dirty with particles and hair  They messaged saying we needed to turn down the noise because there was a complaint but there was no loud noises from us because my baby was sleeping in the room with the door open during that time  There was also no good check out instructions so we didn t know where to place our trash  Some suggestions  Sheets that fit the beds  include toiletries and not dish soap in the shower  add trash bags to bathrooms  include directions for check out and where to throw out the trash  clean linens  kitchen  and floors better  All were dirty in all rooms 
404346929424552810,Couch is disgusting
489866381103582691,unclean bed sheets  thin pillows  low quality mattress  promised three times to send cleaners fix problems and nothing  dirty stove  no trims in kitchen or bath  basic unit that feels like a mattress on the floor of an abandoned unit  you all are a scam 
443457097762548255,Very creepy building  Pretty sure it s haunted  And I didn t even think I believed in that kind of stuff 
424627139802255385,When we arrived at the Airbnb for our   night stay the check in was a nightmare  The code to get in using the front intercom system didnt work  We stood out there for a while trying to get in until someone let us into the building  Luckily the apartment code worked and we were able to get into the apartment  The apartment was very basic  and it was average for cleanliness  After looking around at the Airbnb  we looked for the building FOB that was supposed to be in the apartment  but it was also missing  After talking to the customer service reps we found out that we wouldnt get the FOB till the next day at an unknown time  So while I stayed inside the building my partner was on the phone with the CSR to try to reset the front intercom system code so we could go out to do things with family  But the reset didnt work  So we had to cancel our evening and morning plans and had to make adjustments to the rest of the next day to make sure we would be able to get back before the office closed to pick up the FOB from them   Then when I reached out to the host to get a partial refund for travel issues that made me have to cancel my important family plans  they never responded back  I will never book with this company again  I had high expectations for this company because they had several properties and they were a business  But my experience and response from hosts that directly rent out their property have been far better than this one  Please make sure the front door to this building is accessible by the guests or put in the info that they need to arrive before the office closes so they can get in  Also  the apartment door auto lock is very finicky  getting it fixed so guests dont accidentally walk away before it locks would be a good idea too 
444201988306916251,The area did not feel safe  and the apartment smelled like weed  I was unable to stay  Unfortunately I was unable to stay here due to the smell of weed and having a history of lung issues  The place really needed vacuumed  the window was open   broken  and I was stopped by two people in the dark just trying to get into the building  I ended up having to pay for a hotel for my stay and am hoping this money will be refunded to me  Thank you 
414486240550508289,RUN   Not only is this listing not COVID clean  it s not even a half step above  enter at your own risk   There were hair clippings in the toilet  yep  those hairs   some sort of dried crust on the kitchen countertop  a dirty towel on the bathroom floor  HAIRS AND STAINS on the bedsheets  used tissue in the bathroom trashcan  and a filthy area rug in the living room  After hustling for a different rental  I left the same night as I checked in  I immediately communicated with Zencity   They offered a  touch up clean  and     off future stays  Bless their hearts   I ve been an Airbnb guest since       staying in a variety of rental types   extra bedrooms  basement  apartments   guest houses with multiple private bedrooms but shared bathrooms  This is the first time I ve straight up vacated and requested a refund   I also sought support from Airbnb but they ve got zero cares   If it were possible  I d post photos in my review because there are plenty and they are gross   At this point   I m out       and for real  Airbnb has provided nothing but ghosting   Maybe they own Zencity  Zencity has made it clear that accountability and veracity are at the bottom of their priority list   The  review  that some unknown respondent stated my refund request was currently under has lasted much longer than the promised  we will update you as soon as possible   That was sent to me on July      If someone that hasn t communicated with me is reading this and would like photos  I m happy to send them   Refund my fee  I did not stay in the apt 
400776904164588975,This is my first and last attempt with an air BNB  I had to waste nearly four hours of my time and skip out on plans due to the fact I was trapped in the building  No intercoms systems worked and a tenant was nice enough to get us in and to the room where a key fob was supposed to be  When we arrived there was no key fob and when I called the for the second time about issues getting in and not having a key fob I was argued with u til I provided a picture showing no fob  Without having the fob I couldnt leave the building because I wouldnt be able to get back in  I was told I would relieve a call back and instead waited an hour and had to call back myself  I restated the issues as we had no key fob and was told that someone would be working on it again  After another hour of wasting my time I have asked for a full refund 
405697887201500486,  Not clean Couldn t get in room code did note work   Dirty towels Dirty bathroom  Dirty bed
420925985155845235,Ummm    Let me start with the positives   The location is great  the morning sunrise view is beautiful  finding food  as long as you arent  looking for late night bites  is not hard  there is a gym in the building and when I need help with the internet acting wonky the host was responsive  Now for the BS  the couch NEEDS TO GO  Not only is it worn out  it is uncomfortable to sit on  The microwave  was dirty and so was the refrigerator  The air conditioner barely cools the apartment  so beware  Due to the fact that the kitchen was filthy upon arrival  Im  almost certain the rest of the apartment received a half way tidy up  although the description of the unit stated that the apartment gets an enhanced and thorough clean  Especially because its COVID pandemic time  you would think they actually clean the place thoroughly  The are no basic commodities like  soap  shampoo  lotion  band aids  body wash  an iron  a mop  a broom  clean supplies  extra toilet paper  extra paper towels  pots   pans and sponges  When I complained about the uncleanness I  was NOT met with an apology  nor a returned portion of what I paid to stay there  As a matter of fact  I didnt get a response at all about my concerns  I am still trying to figure out where do I complain to further escalate the matter because  this was a huge issue  Especially because when I asked if I can check in about an hour or   earlier to decorate the apartment for my mate because the trip was a special trip  I was told I couldnt  because the clean service had to clean the apartment as another guest was checking out earlier that day  Also  the ceiling  in the bathroom and bedroom  a badly cracked and the plaster and paint are hanging  Im probably missing other details but this pretty much covers how unsatisfactory this unit is  Zencity is not where you will find your zen  as areas of zen are usually clean  This is apartment isnt  as welcoming  as the description details  Might I suggest actually  having a clean  service clean the apartment before renting it out to guests  Also  youight want to get a new couch that couch has ran its course There was no pool and if we had access to one itt wasnt  in the building  we checked  Also  when your guest is inquiring  about the cleanliness of property  it would be much obliged if the host actually responded instead of ignoring the inquiry altogether  Lastly  there is absolutely no good reason why any unit should be rented unclean to any patron 
566016870485731805,The only decent thing about this place was that it was warm  had a decent location and had a roof over it  The check in process was HORRIBLE  arrived at night to find several lock boxes to try because they gave us the wrong code in the instructions  luckily in one of their pictures the correct code was there  The instructions that were sent suggested that there should be more than two keys  so while looking for the second key  the first one was tried on the door which it DID NOT OPEN after trying several times our fingers became frozen and we sat back in the car to regain warmth  After trying to call message the host and support until almost  am to which no response was given  I re read the reviews to see another stayer left a helpful tip  the door sticks and to jiggle the door knob while trying to get in  Luckily this worked  I messaged the host letting them know we got in  The host messaged back later the next day nonchalantly saying they re glad we got in  Not offering to do anything for the inconvenience   Then after getting inside and being beyond exhausted seeing that there was dirt all over the shower  walls and ceiling  As well as floor boards coming up and stains on the floor we felt beyond cheated and wanted to leave right away  Support began messaging me on behalf of zencity to which I thought it was zencity so when I reported everything to them they said they couldn t do anything because I didn t report it to zencity on the first day  KEEP YOUR MONEY AND STAY ELSEWHERE    Your place needs updated  needs to be clean thoroughly and needs better check in instructions 
401439174436207317,This seems to be a hit or miss as far as whether you are going to get a clean place to stay I have read several reviews that were positive and several that were negative  I enjoyed the location however the floors were sticky  and the shower had mildew all around the bottom  The building smelled of weed every time you walked in  The apartment had sticky floors  the shower had mildew all over it 
445630373350599797,This place was grossly misrepresented in the photos and description  When we arrived the place looked like it was barely  if at all  clean  The surfaces were dusty and dirty  the couch cushions and pillows were stained  the blankets smelled terrible and musty  and the kitchen counter and floor had multiple fragments of broken glass   not something you expect to deal with when you re spending over      night  We spent the morning of our first full day clean and throwing things in the wash to feel comfortable in what was supposed to be our home for the weekend   thank god there was a laundry setup in the unit     On our second night my partner and I went out to celebrate our anniversary and returned to our hallway floor covered in water and disgusting brown water leaking from the ceiling  right outside of our bathroom  We alerted the host immediately and were told by one of the Zencity reps to take whatever extra towels and sheets we had and place them underneath the leak to absorb the water until it could be fixed  We spent the rest of that night livid because we kept hearing a steady drip of the water from the ceiling and had to pass this mess and have water drip on our heads each time we wanted to use the bathroom    By morning the leaking had stopped thankfully  but our experience was already ruined  I of course requested a refund from Zencity and was told they could only refund the clean fees and     for the ceiling leak  which felt like a major downplay of the issues and a lack of taking responsibility for the state of their unit    I would absolutely NOT RECOMMEND this Airbnb rental based on my personal experience and will avoid the Zencity company at all costs    The only positive to this unit was the location  which was walking distance to food  shopping and public transportation and felt safe at night  Otherwise I would suggest looking elsewhere  The Airbnb unit was grossly misrepresented and quality control was lacking  Management took little responsibility for the fact that the unit was filthy  had broken items  couch cushions  toilet seat  kitchen drawers  broken glass and dish   and sprung a leak halfway through our stay 
457155926758331953,The unit was DISGUSTING and Very Dirty  Not at all like pictured  Very disappointed
421039024998180281,This was my first experience with airbnb and Zencity specifically  Zencity offered great communication prior to the trip  However  when I arrived with my young daughter we were unable to get into the building with the code  After a few attempts  an individual from the building came out to let us in and told me to just push the door hard because the door was broken  I should have left after this incident  but I decided to give it a shot  We traveled up the elevator  that looked like it hadn t been vacuumed in months and smelled like weed  and got to the apartment  Once we got inside  the wear and tear of the apartment was evident  The only lock on the door was not secured and left me feeling unsafe  I called Zencity to cancel the reservation and ended up booking a hotel for our stay  This apartment may be great for singles looking to enjoy St  Louis or a quick getaway  but it did not provide me with the safety and security I needed to travel with my daughter  Please check the security of this location  The outside door to the building and the apartment lock are not secure  This needs to be addressed for security and safety purposes 
402148936204590236,Entry instructions did not work and assistance never came  Multiple noise complaints for normal TV volume  Great location  As I mentioned I could get into building for    minutes in the hot sun  Multiple sound compliant for TV volume  Unacceptable 
447051506806371227,Place was clean  Only suggestion to add is a coffee maker and to fix the dishwasher  it didnt seem to be secured so it would rock back and forth when open  I was nervous the bottom shelf was going to roll out and the dishes would break    Parking is on the other end of the block with assigned spots   Customer service was fine up until Sunday  which it quickly went downhill  I had extended my stay an extra   days a few days into my stay and because of that the code on my door changed between Sat Sun  I was emailed this Thursday but did not see it until Sunday when I was already locked out  more so  the code expired    hours after it was sent so I couldnt use it regardless  If you plan on extending your stay  make sure you keep an eye out for your new code and use it ASAP so it doesnt expire    I was not able to get into my unit for   hours on Sunday  I called  the number listed for Zencity       times without any answer and unable to leave a voice message  I also left multiple messages with my phone number to please call me ASAP for Zencity via the Airbnb messenger without response  I then reached out to Airbnb directly  who also tried to contact Zencity via phone  email  and messenger and then instructed me to stay at a hotel for the night  Zencity called around   PM  which at that time I was already in my hotel for the night  I was told they were incredibly busy all day and thats why I was  not contacted sooner  which I find difficult to believe that if they are that busy they dont ask for more help or have some sort of emergency line   Furthermore  the days following I asked to speak to a manger multiple times and have not received a phone call or message from them to discuss any type of reimbursement  Im here for work  so the inconveniences on Sunday morning were after having worked night shift  I felt very stranded without anyone to get help from and by the time they called Sunday evening  I had been up for more than    hours  Luckily  I did not have to work that night as well  Very disappointing customer service  would not recommend this place  Place was very clean  Only suggestion to add is a coffee maker and to fix the dishwasher  it didnt seem to be secured so it would rock back and forth when open  The bottom shelf might roll out and cause damage to dishes    Customer service was fine up until Sunday  which it quickly went downhill  I had extended my stay and because of that the code on my door changed between Sat Sun  I was emailed this Thursday but did not see it until Sunday when I was already locked out  moreso  the code expired    hours after it was sent so I couldnt use it regardless   I think if a door code is going to be changed  that should be something that is verified with the tenant to ensure they have access via phone call or ensuring that they respond back to the email   I was not able to get into my unit for   hours on Sunday  I called  the number listed for Zencity       times without any answer and unable to leave a message  I also left multiple messages for Zencity via the Airbnb messenger without response  I then reached out to Airbnb directly  who also tied to contact Zencity via phone  email  and messenger and then instructed me to stay at a hotel for the night  Zencity called around   PM  which at that time I was already in my hotel for the night  I was told they were incredibly busy all day and thats why I was  not contacted sooner  which I find difficult to believe that if they are that busy they dont ask for more help or have some sort of emergency line for those locked out of their unit   Furthermore  the days following I asked to speak to a manger multiple times and have not received a phone call or message from them to discuss any type of reimbursement 
401456948073724638,The place is nice   the area was great  but whoever does the clean doesn t properly keep the place up  There was hair in the shower  old urine stains that even I couldn t remove with clean product   The place didn t look properly swept or mopped   Also  upon checkin communication was horrible and the entry code didn t work  Zencity replied with another code that didn t work as well  Once I let them know the issue I never got a reply back until after I was already in the building  I waiting until someone finally walked out and then entered the building   Zencity did offer an extra hour before check out which was appreciated   but I didn t like standing outside with a little one and pregnant late at night  Communication and cleanliness needs to be better   The place needs to be deep clean    the rugs also need to be switched out  The place is nice  but not properly kept up  Whoever is doing the clean isn t doing a good job  Also  Communication should be better for your guest upon checkin  Thanks a lot 
416571804255379199,Please make sure the internet works after you check in The internet did not work which was a big deal breaker  I tried to email the company a few times and didnt get a reply it was very frustrating 
447106087974283936,DONT BOOK HERE  They made me feel totally unsafe by cha going the locks in the middle of my reservation and not communicating with me  I came back from the store to a new lock on the door and they never told me they were going to change it and all they offered was an apology  They literally changed the locks in the middle of my reservation  Totally unprofessional
426797369048113249,DO NOT BOOK  For starters  there were NO TOWELS in the entire unit  The closest thing was a single  un absorbent dish towel in the kitchen and a roll of paper towels  Naturally  I messaged Zencity  a company that  hosts  this listing and many others  about this problem  very matter of factly and simply requesting they provide towels  I received no response  The only other message I got after the initial check in was a stock message stating they hope I enjoyed my stay and to leave a positive review  Laughable    To name a few other problems the unit itself smelled bad when we walked in  I sensed mustiness cigarettes and my husband sensed the smell of a dead animal  Take your pick  The rug in the living area was filthy and had visible debris on it  The bathroom sink was chipped  the shower liner had a disgusting brown film  and there was what I can only imagine were dirty linens left in the bedroom hamper  There were half used individual sized bottles of shampoo and body wash left in the shower  It was appalling and by far the worst Airbnb experience we have ever had   Despite the good location by the park  the listing  and presumably any listing hosted by Zencity  is NOT WORTH IT  It is completely unacceptable that there were no towels in the apartment and I did not receive a response from anyone about my inquiry  I will be spreading the word that Zencity is unreliable and awful 
418158986427520885,Upon booking for the Airbnb we reached out to the host from Zencity And we asked was a unit available and was the issue with the door fixed per the reviews we were reading  They replied back yes everything should be good if we wanted to move forward and book  We booked and got ready to head to the space  Wednesday the   th the first night was great no issues no problems we were able to get into the apartment with no issues  Thursday the   th my brother was laying on the couch in the front and looked over to someone trying to get into the apartment  Luckily we have a chain on the door and the guy looked over and saw him on the couch and said he was sorry he didn t realize the unit was being rented out for the weekend  I told him we were only here till that Saturday  He said OK he introduced himself as a realtor and he was actually doing a apartment tour on that specific unit  He had people outside the door to show the unit and ask would it still be OK if he showed the unit  My brother then told him I was still sleeping so Right then wouldn t be the best time  He said thank you and he left  The Host Was notified and they tried to say it was not a realtor when in fact it definitely was  The next day we were greeted by the maintenance people early in the morning they were surprised when my brother opened the door and saw we were there  We informed them that we would be here until that Saturday  They said ok and went upstairs to a different unit  Not anytime was a  Leak  mentioned  A couple hours later another duo of maintenance guys came through and My brother answered the door again and they were shocked as well to see us there I take it the message wasn t passed along that we were there renting till that Saturday  So my brother explained the same thing to those maintenance guys they said cool and they went upstairs to another unit  During this time around when The first set of maintenance guys came through  the host sent an offer and asked if I would be willing to check out a day early and take     refund because there was a  leak  in the building  me and my brother respectfully declined and said we were comfortable in the space that we were in  At no time did the host say this is an urgent emergency and at no time did the maintenance crew that we saw and greeted at the door state that it was a leak in the unit  nor ask could they enter the unit to check and see if it was coming from The unit we were staying in  We replied to every message in a timely manner in which it was sent to us  Around   o clock the maintenance crew showed back up to the unit and when My brother opened up the door The one maintenance man said they were told we were leaving at three and in no way did we ever say that to anyone  The maintenance guy said no problem I m not going to harass you all when you all have proof that you all are allowed to be here  During the time we contacted Airbnb and they stated no one Has been in communication with them to cancel the Airbnb so do not worry about it  During that call I started to receive messages from the host with a bunch of slanderous lies and disrespect  The person messaging at the time  Gary  was extremely rude  disrespectful And sent very threatening via messages as well as phone calls  Gary attempted to lie and say we never opened the door for maintenance  he lied and said we were rude to maintenance and we were smoking weed in the unit  All of thee above were lies but Gary continued to spread the lies via Airbnb messenger  My brother went outside after Gary continued to lie and spoke to the maintenance and both men Kevin and Raul stated we were never rude or disrespectful to them and they didn t know where that lie came from  They also stated we definitely Opened the door for them and no weed was ever smelled  Gary proceeded to threaten us by calling the police from   PM to almost      PM in which we were not worried by any means because we did nothing wrong  Turns out there was never a leak in the building we spoke to other residents in passing  The host never canceled the Airbnb until almost   PM that day AFTER I already contacted Airbnb to have the reservation canceled myself  But they were lying While we were on the phone with Airbnb saying they spoke with them and had already canceled our reservation and we knew it was a lie  All of this could have been avoided if Gary had not lied and been disrespectful  We found out someone rented out the unit and they were not supposed to rent it out on airbnb  they were trying to get the unit make ready for actual residents to move in  So  instead of the host just saying that him being open and honest he tried to lie and then lied more and thought threatening us was going to make him get what he wanted  I do not recommend this unit or any unit this company puts up if this is how they run their business  On top of everything else Gary was standing outside the whole time texting and being disrespectful as if we didn t know who he was with bright red hair  Not once did he come in introduces self or even be brave enough to face us  he of course like most cowards hid behind texting 
409416831130855962,Wifi didn t work and loads of other things were inaccurate on listing  Agency that handles unit was unprofessional that when we needed help  Also big safety issue  front door to building did not lock half the time   Don t stay here   I have reported all issues in a formal complaint 
417341857847754239,I would probably stay here again  but    As the previous reviews stated check in was not smooth  Another resident allowed me entrance and to use the elevator  The door code did work   Parking was difficult and has to be paid for during the day M F  This is included in the listing  but the only open lot I found was   blocks away  Also  the pictures of the skyline were definitely not from this unit as all you can see are neighboring buildings  And I don t think they met the Airbnb standard of clean this visit perhaps an isolated incident   THE GOOD  the place is in good repair and the bed is comfortable  It s actually a cute little unit  The building is quiet during the day  I work nights so that s important to me   Once checked in entrance is easy peasy  just keep your door code handy  I didn t get to use the amenities during my stay  but they offer quite a few  There was hair in the shower and food on the potholder  Yuck   I paid for two extra days because I work nights and when I went to check in was unable to enter the building as your check in process is not functional  When I messaged about my issue the reply was not timely  which I needed it to be so that I could go to bed for work that night  and impersonal as your representative did not seem to understand that my check in date was actually the day before   This was rather upsetting 
449962262724379052,I arrived around     pm on Thursday only to find that the floors were still filthy  there were clumps of hair and dried blood in the shower and   of the pillow cases had a blood stain and dirt on them  I reached out immediately to Zencity and stated that since it was so late Id stay the night but wouldnt be spending the rest of the trip there and that they needed to refund my money  I used my shirt as a pillow case  I woke up to an an email stating that they were sorry for the inconvenience  I had to reach out numerous times to get a real response instead of a canned one  They still hadnt come uo with any kind of solution by  pm Friday  After    hours they still couldnt come up with a way to make things right  It became very frustrating because the only form of communication with them was email  My guest and i ended up having to clean out the disgusting shower just to be able to use it so we could continue our vacation   There were some emails back and forth and all they could tell me was that my refund request had been sent to manager  Tomorrow will be   week since i sent the inital email and i have yet to hear back from a manager or anyone from Zencity  I wont ever be staying with them again and i think Ill stick with hotels from now on  At least at a hotel there is someone on shift to communicate with  Provide a contact number and not just an email   Dont email canned responses 
569595726551460120,I would be worried to rent from them their impossible to deal with over the phone they are also very quick to assess fines for matters with her for an excess of any damage they also have piss poor security and allow people in your room that you don t want Allowed unwanted guests to answer the apartment and cause damage and then try pin me for those damages when I price them of the person and if they were not supposed to be on the premises   Company days is an unlawful merchandising business practices and is due for a good lawsuit
420993082504940697,Was notified a couple of hours before check in that my stay was canceled due to a lost key fob  When asked about my refund they said I had to cancel the reservation myself  So   Iwent to the cancellation page and clicked the tab for host needs to cancel   which a request is sent to the host   I noticed a day later that the request hadnt been taken care of so I messaged them and they said they never got a cancellation   I them what process I used and they said they couldnt cancel I had to    there was no option that wouldnt have taken all of mypayment so I told them I sent another request and they still refused   Air bnb had to be contacted to settle the matter unfortunately with this whole process wasting multiple hours of my time that I should have been operating my business   Shady Practices
419487659501712116,There were some discrepancies in listing and our stay  The apartment smelled like smoke even though it is listed as no smoking  There was no shampoo  conditioner  or body wash in apartment after listing states otherwise   Also some surfaces were sticky  and dirty rags stuffed into corners and furniture  Some other inconveniences were difficult parking  loud neighbors traffic construction  broken elevator  and very poor shower pressure  Check in out was easy and location was close to everything we liked to do  Thanks for letting us stay  there were a few discrepancies between listing and actual stay 
400008042427436241,The location is great and the owners are prompt in their communication  however  the rest of this listing was not as advertised  The owners are not accommodating to any minor check in requests and the furniture and fixtures are broken and dirty  The owners need to invest in this property significantly to bring it back to the standard of when these photos were taken  This listing was not as advertised  The furniture and fixtures are broken and dirty  For example  the bed in the back bedroom broke   times  just by sitting on the edge  The coffee table was old and wobbly  the couch was dirty  the bedframe in the back bedroom was stained  Every single light flickered to a point where the lights were unusable  I am extremely dissatisfied with this listing 
425283166743807479,Great location  Quiet neighbors   If adjust days from request  include Day and date  Fee is too high for amenities  Provide shampoo and conditioner at minimum  Customer service was slow to respond and not helpful  Adequate and good location  Great location  Quiet neighbors   If adjust days from request  include Day and date  Fee is too high for amenities  Provide shampoo and conditioner at minimum  Customer service was slow to respond and not helpful  Adequate and good location

409413247369622278,My girlfriend and I recently went on a trip to KC and decided to try an Air B B  This is something that her and I have done before and have always had positive experiences with  After looking at a few different places  we landed on this posting and decided to book it since it was close to some bars and not far from the venue  The pictures looked amazing of the place and even though there was a review of it smelling like cigarette smoke  we still decided to give it a shot  Let me just say  the pictures were taken at the right angle with the right lighting because it looks NOTHING that in person    As soon as you open the door to the building  you are blasted with a strong odor of cigarette smoke  Once in the apartment  the smell is not as strong  but almost everything is filthy  The floors are stained and look like haven t been clean  The couch is completely stained  and she would not sit on it  There is a very small hallway that leads to the bedroom and doors on both sides  However  both doors are off their hinges and just hanging there  There is also burn marks on the wall next to the stove  I wish I could say that this was the only thing wrong with this listing  but nothing compared to what we found    While looking throughout the apartment  she came across a used needle sitting on top of the trashcan in the bathroom  My girlfriend and I decided to leave the place immediately as we now felt unsafe there  but not before she also found a dead cockroach in the air vent  We ended up finding a nearby hotel and calling the people who run the listing  At first  they promised as a full refund over the phone and that the place was unacceptable  however  the next day they messaged us and asked if they could send a clean company over as recompense  We told them that after only spending about    minutes there and finding everything we did   that there was no way we would stay and had already booked a hotel  They then proceeded to tell us that since we denied the clean company  they would not be able to give us a refund  Thankfully Airbnb customer service was able to help us and we eventually got the refund   My best advice I could give you is to stay clear of this listing  Spend the extra cash on a hotel so you do not have to deal with what we did 
401403694185843052,Customer service with Zencity was terrible  The listing is the opposite of what the apartment actually is  This apartment is not equipped for long term stays  The kitchen was not a full kitchen  It had a limited amount of cutlery  barely any cooking pots  the dishwasher didnt work  and the bed was immensely uncomfortable   enough to give us back pain for the remainder of our stay  When we first walked in  it smelled like gas in the apartment  The HDMI cable didnt work and kept glitching and popping  When we tried to watch TV shows in the living room  we couldnt sit on the couch for any time because it was so uncomfortable and very disgusting   along with the carpets   Overall   the price does not make it worth the stay here  Hello   a couple of points that we think you can improve on   We felt like you werent very flexible or communicative with us  Initially when we wanted to cancel due to flight issues related to COVID  and there was no flexibility  Later on  we reached out about issues the lock code and never received a response  but luckily that issue was resolved quickly  Lastly  we reached out about forgetting something in the apartment  and we received no word back  even after we suggested going back and grabbing it ourselves   You had listed that it was a full kitchen  comfortable bed  equipped for long term stay  The kitchen was not a full kitchen  It had a limited amount of cutlery  barely any cooking pots  the dishwasher didnt work  and the bed was immensely uncomfortable   enough to give us back pain for the remainder of our stay  When we first walked in  it smelled like gas in the apartment which got us nervous the first few days  The HDMI cable didnt work and kept glitching and popping  When we tried to watch TV shows in the living room  we couldnt sit on the couch for any time because it was so uncomfortable and very disgusting   along with the carpets   We dont think that this airbnb was valued at the     K we paid  We will be reaching out for a refund of some sorts because of how deceptive the listing was 
450630025494810931,  Apartment is fine   Area feels unsafe at night   Not very smooth checkin process   Strong weed smell in building   Lift was filthy like a bathroom   Parking space was far from the building and kinda unsafe   host was responsive though
566654120870059214,It was okay just not really what you would expect to get out of a place to stay  It was not very clean when we got there and they messed up our check in so we had to wait an hour after we were supposed to be able to check in before we could even get in the room  Overall it wasn t the worst place I ve ever stayed but I wouldn t recommend it unless it s like your last option  It wasn t super clean  the bathroom and kitchen were pretty gross when we got there and the blinds are basically all broken 
404357670517825263,When we arrived at  pm  the temperature in the apartment was    degrees Fahrenheit  only   of the windows had screens  and Chicago in the summer has tons of flies   mosquitoes  so we couldnt do anything but turn on the AC and wait  at   pm  it was still     we eventually had to restart the furnace to kickstart it     An hour after we arrived  a maintenance person arrived to fix the dishwasher without warning   at  pm  FWIW  the dishwasher mostly did work for us as long as we ran it on normal  not express  but the lower rack was missing some wheels   The back yard shown in the photos as a nice place to hang out was filled with weeds and construction debris and completely impassable  The back stairs hadnt been swept in months or maybe years  there was serious grime on the side of the bathroom sink  cracks and peeling plaster in the walls and ceiling of the bathroom and living room  a tile in the bathroom was held in place with electrical tape  the floor was too dirty to walk barefoot  and when I lifted a couch cushion to retrieve a pen I had dropped  it was clear that it had been a looong time since that was vacuumed   And oh yeah   there was no back to the building  just tyvek paper waiting to have siding replaced   Sheets were thin   dingy polyester and pillows mattress were not even ikea quality   We tried multiple times to contact both Zencity and Airbnb support  The hosts were quick to reply before our stay  but rarely replied before     hours while we were there  even in the middle of the day    I have stayed in Airbnbs around the world and never had an experience like this  On the plus side  the location really is great   close to the      transit and restaurants  We tried several times to report issues during our stay and got only late responses and zero resolution  You need to do some serious work on this apartment before renting it 
427448282730772396,Poor communication  no central air conditioning and there are roaches  Great location near the water  Great restaurant nearby  Close to a lot of things  Overall won t be staying at this particular place again but loved the area  Very poor communication  not a great way to end the trip 
427452189132891098,My girlfriend and I arrived at the air bnb around   pm and saw a man carrying a weapon directly outside of the building  After he left we tried to get inside which was very confusing and took us roughly    minutes  We weren t aware that the parking was located off site and was a good      minute drive away from the apartment lined with bars and groups of men  We decided after driving to the parking garage that the safest decision for us  as two woman alone at night  would be to park in front of the building and move it in the morning because of the parking meters  When we got inside it wasn t messy but it wasn t clean  It smelled like weed  there were stains on the couch and bed bugs  We contacted the hostess immediately  who was very professional every time we communicated  and informed them that we would not be staying the two nights that we had previously reserved  They did an inspection on the room and claimed there were no bed bugs despite the bites we had both received  We made it clear that we had already booked a hotel and would not be returning  They refused to give us a refund but told us we were safe to stay there  Essentially we paid      to walk into a building where we felt incredibly unsafe the entire time  use the bathroom once and leave with bed bug bites 
446286455166828586,First and foremost  this place is not a luxury studio  You are paying for location only  Check in was super easy  the door staff helped and were super nice    It sucks to complain about something on public reviews  as i worked in the service industry for over a decade and know sometimes they are not true  However  I can t say anything positive about this place  and many issues were stated in previous visits by others  As was said in some other reviews  the place was dirty  The floors were gross  there was dirt hair dust everywhere  The bed frame was either loose or broken  so every move you made was super loud  There are two bedside lamps connected to one switch  and only one of them worked    Additionally  as said in some other reviews  the internet did not work  There was no WiFi connection available or searchable  and the tv also did not work  I tried to reset the router  and I changed the remote batteries but still did not work  After contacting the host about these issues on Friday  I got no response again and no one showed up to address them  With nothing to do while in the place  almost no service  could not use laptop too   I ended up not staying one night and left a night early  I finally got a response from the host about issues when I notified them I had left and checked out a day early  I offered to send videos of issues in addition to the pictures I sent the resolution center as well   This place is in a great location  you can walk just about everywhere downtown  but that s about all the good things I can say about it  For the price of Air BnB s now and the cost of       for a five day stay  it was one of the worst values I could think of  I have asked for a refund  but you definitely find better stays or equal value or with better hosts around the city  Stay away  there are better places and hotels in the area  This place isn t a luxury studio  It was dirty  the floors were disgusting  One of the two bedside lamps worked  the bed frame was either broken or loose as it was super loud  The internet and Tv remote didn t work  so I literally had nothing to do while in the air bnb  I couldn t use my laptop  and barely had phone service  I didn t stay one of my nights and left a night early  After contacting you about the issues with the place on Friday  no one answered until the day I left when I told you I was leaving  For the price of Air BnB s now           Really   and especially this one  this was an absurdly poor stay  I could have stayed at the hotel around the corner instead and had no issues  The location is great yes  but you cannot call this a luxury studio at all  I won t ever use Zen City again  and I asked for a partial refund through the resolution center  but am going to ask for a full one due to lack of communication from a host about issues and I didn t even stay the whole time  As I sent in a message before  I have videos of said issues too  couldn t upload them in the resolution center  
471708111414102288,I got there  they don t have on site parking which is stated  so parking was interesting  The guard wasn t very helpful on getting upstairs  It isn t clearly stated how to get upstairs  there s multiple elevators but only   for the lofts  which I only found out by a nice bystander  I get upstairs only to be greeted by feces in the toilet  and hair all over the apartment  In the sinks  the counters  on the floor s   and of course when I had to check the beds  it was there  I contacted  Zencity  and they responded quite quickly saying they d send a clean crew  So I left for dinner in hopes by the time I walked back it would be solved  However  this was not the case and when I attempted to contact them  they were not as responsive  No clean crew arrived so I was left to wash the sheets myself after driving     hours  Took me til     pm to finally sleep  They charge     for clean fee and when I asked for a refund they initially declined and then resulted in giving me     wish has not yet been given back    weeks later  Nice location but disgusting attempt to sell an apartment  Highly do not recommend  Maybe under new management  Zencity is terrible 
531221790034969989,Zencity   was the absolute worst experience ever  I have so many complaints where do I begin  My initial   p m  check in  didnt happen until after   p m  due to the fact that I never received instructions as they indicated after two attemptsof contacting  Zencity   they sent the information at      p m  I was charged almost       when found out later that the price was     per night  Guests arent allowed to control the heat  and that weekend iKC was inclement weather   so it was freezing   Excessive dog barking throughout the night  dog feces in the hallway all weekend   the elevator had trash in it  the downstairs foyer was filfthy with cigarette butts and leaves lying around   All which I have photos and shared with Zencity and AirBnB  The mist disturbing   was when we tried to lay down and found hairs in the bed  and decided to change linen  When changing the linen  we noticedmultiple stains on pillows andmattress cover   The mattress was in fact flipped upside down   to hide the portion that was the most soiled  I immediately contacted Zencity support   with my concern and he instructed me to send photos   I  sent photos of the pillows   mattress cover   hairs in the shower  the wall  damaged blinds and nose matter that was on the shower curtain   He offered to send someone up in the a m  to clean  but it was already after   a m  and we were beyond tired  Seeing my frustration   he offered to move us after a hour of going back and forth and also stayed how he would request a full refund  The unit he moved us too  was cleaner  but freezing as we can not control the heat  I have complained to Zencity and AirBnB   multiple times and sent over a dozen photos   multiple times  Even though I was subject to a dirty unit  I still clean and took photos   so they are dated and times stamped  so no one can ever say that I was a poor guest   I have requested a refund  in which the offer was     off next stay  I will never stay in Zencity properties again  So declining that offer they told me a     refundis all they can do for     dollars After all the BS we were subjected to  that was the ultimate disrespect   Zencity   was a horrible host  that only cares about their accounts and not the guests       I  suggest anything other than Zencity Out of all my years of traveling   this was by far the worst experience ever  My initial reservation was booked for another unit  but the dates conflicted  so I requested to cancel  Zencity   mentioned that I would be penalized     for a cancelation so I did request for another unit  that could accommodate those dates  The new unit was more expensive  yet smaller  but once again I would be charged a     cancelation fee  so I had no choice but to accept   The day of checkin was scheduled for          at   p m  in which upon check in  I would receive instructions   I didnt receive those instructions until almost   p m  and that was after two attempts of contacting Zencity staff   The late check in was the first issue  Secondly   after arriving back to the unit after our New Years Eve plans  we were prepared to lay down for the night  but when the sheets were turned down  we saw multiple hairs in the bed  Seeing that therewas spare linen in the closet   we attempted to change the sheets in which the pillows and mattress cover was heavily stained  In fact the top of the mattress was flipped upside down  because of how soiled the cover was  I instantly called Zencity support in which he asked to send photos  I not only sent photos of the soil mattress cover and pillows but the extremely long hairs in the shower  and on the wall  The most disturbing photo was the snot that someone blew on the shower curtain   I made my complaint and frustration known to the support and told him that this was totally unacceptable  He did mention that he received the photos and how apologetic that he was  He did mention that he could send a member to clean the unit in the morning   but it was already after   a m   and we wanted to turn in for the night  so he offered to switch us units  due to the fact that it was so late  I only accepted because I already had so much invested into this unit  and being New Years weekend hotels were almost obsolete   After changing units we didnt lay down until almost   a m  Third complaint came from me searching for the Zencity customer support   I noticed that the unit we were staying in  was advertised at     per night  when I was charged almost          for a weekend and was told that the unit was more expensive that the original      per night unit  I had booked  So that was a whole other issue  The list of complaints can go on and on  Guests arent allowed to adjust heat  and need a access code  to use  The entire building was filfhty  from trash in the elevator all weekend   dog feces in the hallway  excessive dog barking all times of day  the downstairs foyer was dirty  cigarette butts  lying and around   and the place was just nasty  I took photos of everything that I mentioned and sent to the support team  making complaints and asking for some compensation   for such a horrible stay  They had the nerve to offer me     discount on a future stay  I will never stay or recommend Zencity to anyone   by the way I stayed in the KC location on Main Street  I did request the help of AirBnB  and displayed all photos of everything mentioned   So I am still waiting on a resolution   Final response fro  Zencity was a offer for      which is around     of what I paid for the entire weekend        I had the worst experience through Zencity and I recommend everyone to consider all other possible options  before booking with Zencity  to avoid the disrespect that I received

550768658228486429,AVOID AT ALL COST    the place was filthy when we arrived  It was superficially clean but the whole flat needs a deep clean  The bathroom was dirty  the soap dispenser was not working  how expensive is a replacement     the blinds in rooms were covered in thick dust  the dishes  pots and cutlery were grimy  the dishwasher dirty  the vacuum cleaner clogged  the bedsheets had hairs on them and looked used   general TLC needed  the ceiling tiles were broken and looked like they were about to fall down  It s an old building and a flat and really needs some easy fixes     the central heating was loud and one bedroom and the living space did not get any heat  no extra heater available  awful in winter    there was ice in front of the main entrance  so it was a struggle each time to go in and out without falling and breaking your necks   the communication with Zencity was half decent  they replied when they wanted to  not when you needed them to communicate with you   frustrating checkout  in the end we were lied to  told there was another booking when there wasn t  and told no late checkout was available even though they offered it first in an email  Then basically kicked us out without any reason other than  instructions from higher levels  even though we repeatedly requested some assistance  Felt like this was vindication for complaining about the filth and coldness from the start of our stay    An absolute disgrace of a company to deal with  it s really not worth the hassle    I will give credit where the credit is due     the flat was pretty and nicely furnished if you don t consider the layer of muck on top of every surface and the general state of being worn out and things not working  eg the record player    great location for public transport to city centre and not far from the O Hare airport     great location for some local caf s  food places  even vegan food  and a Target I was happy enough after the apologies and a partial refund for giving us the flat in a filthy state and having it cold   Got really frustrated after being spoken to like a total idiot for asking for a late checkout  First you offered the option  Then denied it to us  Then lied for the reasons  Then said you didn t need a reason  just instructions from  higher levels   didn t help us out with storing our luggage for a couple of hours  then threatened me with a bad review and charging more money   An absolute disgrace of a company  you should not be in business for how you treat your paying customers 
567351637356888319,Not great  dirty and not well maintained  This rental was disappointing   It was soooo dirty  from dust so thick on top of headboard  chipped paint throughout the unit  no coffee maker  front door keypad loose  problems connecting with WiFi  someone parked in the parking space and key fob didn t work with entrance on Dolman   If you are paying someone to clean  they aren t doing it   It really could be a nice place but it needs much attention 
474602095889029913,The apartment was nice and well appointed  However  the host failed to provide us with a fob to enter the main building after hours  We requested one multiple times and he never provided one and in the end did not even respond to our requests  I would not recommend zencity to anyone  The first night we were able to get in the building only because one of the tenants let us in  We were very disappointed with tour lack of response  We communicated with you that the fob was missing and you never provided one  We also told you we couldn t get into the building without a fob after hours because the code you gave us didn t work and the main door was closed  You never responded or provided us with one  This is not how you treat a guest or get good reviews 
566675639220969776,This place was ok  This is my first meh review for an Airbnb place I have stayed at and I think the sole reason for this is that this is a company who manages this property and not a normal person like I ve experienced with so response time with any questions or concerns I had was almost non existent  For example I messaged them at   am and didn t get a response until  am the next day so my issue didn t get addressed or anything  My only other complaint is that yes this place was not clean at all like very obviously not clean or at least not well  I wish I had taken times to read the reviews on that one  Location is great it s near by to a lot of good food places and park  It is what you make of it  Having better response times when messaging through Airbnb app and making sure residence is clean  Two biggest complaints but otherwise fine 
499290295548671582,They should do a better job at communication  I wouldn t recommend this location to anyone  It s hard getting in contact with your host if you have any problems  They are very rude and when I did have a problem they did not provide me with the help I needed neither care about my time or accommodate me for my stay  The temperature would not change because they have a control system on it so the whole stay I froze  It was an unhappy experience and rude customer service  Customer service was horrible  Do better at communication when dealing with your paying customers  I wouldn t recommend this location to anyone 
565989256240370895,I didn t enjoy my stay  Had to cancel and go to a hotel nearby  Beds wasn t clean  No heat  No WiFi  Cold air was coming in by the AC unit because it wasn t properly sealed  Can have cleaner bed sheets  WiFi that works  Working heat  Sealed off area around the AC unit so cold air doesn t come in 
531138285564340357,So many things wrong with this place beginning with the host  Zencity consistently takes over    mins to answer phones and even longer to answer text  The entry code was wrong as I saw other ppl have stated but I assumed that they had cleared things up  Took an hour to check in  The place Itself is decent enough but several issues  The bathroom has no sink  The only sink in the unit is in the kitchen  The door to the bathroom is a sliding door that doesn t want to stay closed and even when closed leaves Little privacy as there are huge gaps on the sides  The ice maker in the fridge doesn t work  This unit does not have controllable ac or heat  I informed Zencity that it was hot and asked them how to turn the heat down they told me to open a window  Temperature outside was     degrees btw  The thermostat said that it was being controlled at a central location so apparently they don t allow guests the option of changing the temperature  Also parking is across the street which isn t a huge deal when it s warm outside I suppose but in   degree weather with snow on the ground it s a huge hassle  The front door locks automatically but it is fickle and sometimes you have to reopening it and hold it closed until it locks  The fridge is so close to the wall that it is really akward to open the door  Also didn t smell great when first walking issue All this aside it s a decent place if u catch it for cheap 
467361171223656880,Excellent location  No wifi entire stay  Kitchen amenities not what is listed  plan on supplementing if you use the kitchen at all and be prepared to do some clean first  Location excellent but that s a given   Email with checkin instructions came day after checkin  Had to pull up instructions online on website to know logistics  We had no wifi the entire stay  Reported it from very beginning service came next afternoon had to check unit next door was never seen again and connection never came  Kept checking  With added in fees for service expected things ready to use  Had to wash utensils in kitchen before use to get garbage off them  Amenities listed salt pepper and oil for cooking but not there  So had to add that to our to do list  Coffee press was broken  stem not attached to filter base of the press  Bottom drawer of refrigerator had crumbs from previous use as well as bar soap scum on the shower caddy even though only liquid soaps supplied  The sofa was horrible for back support especially if two people are sitting attempting to watch something  Removed the dust from the trim by bathroom radiator and kitchen back splash so I wouldn t have to look at it Overall a major disappointment at an excellent location
564533096663115201,The code were were given to access the unit was incorrect and we didn t hear back from Zencity when we reached out to resolve the issue  We had to cancel the reservation and find other accommodations at the last minute  The code we were given to access the unit was incorrect and we never heard back from Zencity  We had to cancel the reservation and find other accommodations at the last minute 
563118442473057390,Check and confirm all details first Overall  I will say this  We have stayed in MANY AirBnBs over the last     years  and this was  by far  our worst experience yet  The unit itself to look at was decent enough  but given the area  parking issues  and the multitude of issues  it was in no way enough to make our stay pleasant  I should have known better than to secure a place run by a conglomerate  Details are outlined below   I did mention my first impression wasnt awesome  and that was an understatement  First  the description of the place definitely says free street parking  At the very least  this is very misleading  At worst  a complete lie  Very little parking to be had at all  plus I spent almost as much parking as I did for the space  Second  the entire place smelled like smoke  Not as much in the unit  but the entire building  After we settled in  we kept finding things that were either subpar or completely unacceptable   Ill start at the beginning  As we came to find out later in the day  the front door security is rendered useless during the day  as anyone can enter the restaurant and gain access to the foyer through there  without the use of a code  Once you reach the unit  the  coat hooks  at the front door were both literally falling out of the wall  Pretty big oversight as a first impression  Bathroom was the first stop  as we had just gotten off the road  Toilet wont flush  Having some experience in these things  I was able to get the flush valve going  but had to mess with it every time we used the toilet  It needs to be replaced  The outlet by the bed only works when the light switch is flipped  Again  Im no stranger to this type of thing  so I figured it out  but most folks will just be frustrated  Needs to be put in the description or welcome blurb  Once we settled in for the evening the first night  we wanted to cuddle in front of the TV for a bit  The couch is HORRIBLE  Not comfortable in any way  unless you grab all of the pillows from the bed and drag them out to be strategically placed  Then we couldnt get the overhead lamp to shut off  as the footswitch is broken  Tried  and finally succeeded getting the curtains closed  but one side only went so far  Mainly because of the joint in the rod holding them up  but if the wands werent missing  this would have been easy to overcome  I know Im leaving a few things out here  but that should give you plenty to go on    Thanks  but no   John
489827352422920317,This is probably the worst stay I ve ever had with Airbnb Although the property was extremely nice Good luck having Managment or ANYONE from Zencity accommodate anything they promised      I got locked out of the apartment took   hours for someone to return my call and unlock my door      located right next to a busy street  you hear literally every car passing by to sirens and semis      wash and drier did not work   I was there on business for a   day trip  let Managment know the first day They weren t working   they told me they d have maintenance come at a certain time   they showed up   hours late missed work meetings and had zero clean clothes  Didn t address the situation from day    didn t even return my phone call Now   days after the trip still no phone call when I was assured by Andrea and Eric  Managment  they would look into the situation and get back to me    Being an Airbnb owner in several states I would be appalled if my management treated guests the way zencity treats theirs Highly do not encourage you to stay with this property This is probably the worst stay I ve ever had with Airbnb Although the property was extremely nice Good luck having Managment or ANYONE from Zencity accommodate anything they promised      I got locked out of the apartment took   hours for someone to return my call and unlock my door      located right next to a busy street  you hear literally every car passing by to sirens and semis      wash and drier did not work   I was there on business for a   day trip  let Managment know the first day They weren t working   they told me they d have maintenance come at a certain time   they showed up   hours late missed work meetings and had zero clean clothes  Didn t address the situation from day    didn t even return my phone call Now   days after the trip still no phone call when I was assured by Andrea and Eric  Managment  they would look into the situation and get back to me    Being an Airbnb owner in several states I would be appalled if my management treated guests the way zencity treats theirs Highly do not encourage you to stay with this property
561751477559912722,This was a nightmare  The access code did not work  and I didn t get a new one until an hour   half after checkin time  after I finally got in we noticed it was freezing and NONE of the radiators worked  It is the middle of winter and freezing outside  so I reached out about it and they informed me that Maintance would come in and fix it that day but then hours later after no show from maintenance  they said that they would drop off a space heater the following day  the Wi Fi router did not have a power cord so no Wi Fi or apps on the tv  THEN we notice someone trying to get into the room  it s   people and they say they booked the same place for the same dates we booked it was unacceptable so we left
405028033571141954,This property is not adequately represented in current posting   Shower  lighting  basic supplies  and back yard area    Check in process was    minutes  Positives are the workmanship of the home is magnificent  Communication and check in was not good   Representation of back yard and loft area was very misleading  Ice maker not working  Refrigerator freezing food  Front door lock  Only   towels provided   Upstairs shower was unsafe and misrepresented in pictures   Ceiling fan not operable in master  as well as lights  Laundry room had no soap   Old food and alcohol left in refrigerator   Ants in kitchen sink and cabinet 
562290945548863093,I initially booked another place before this one but while I was on the road there they switched up my reservation to a completely different place which is this one  The room was really nice but that was it  I couldn t find any parking  my first room couldn t open so I had to go to another room in which I couldn t stay the rest of my nights in because I had to move back  well Atleast I was suppose to but i never got a call back  Really didn t feel like it was planned well on they re part  No one really knew what was going on
561029385819850870,Terrible experience never even got into my unit to stay due to locks not working and keys missing  They told me to cancel my reservation and they would give me a full refund but I only got    dollars back out of     and I never got to stay  We had nowhere to stay and had to go back home  I had the worst experience  I never even got into the unit due to missing keys and a lock that would not unlock  I jumped through every hoop  sent video repeatedly as they suggest and still never got into the unit  I spent almost     dollars and they told me to just cancel my reservations and I only got    dollars back  I will definitely be calling everyone I can to tell them to do something about this 
560267820703626198,Complicated check in  no real time support  Communication terrible  couldn t even get in  instructions were not accurate

555029411408263289,DO NOT BOOK WITH ZENCITY IF YOU LIKE TO LIVE COMFORTABLY  If you re looking for something up to par  nice and clean then this is definitely not the place you want to book  Now if you are accustomed to project living or low income living then you ll feel right at home but other than that just don t do it  Trust me  They tried to charge me      for a key fab that was returned to the key cafe  The bedding was stained  Had the nerve to be white on top of that lol  The appliances don t work hence the microwave was broken the last time we were there but I didn t know it was the same exact unit because they relisted it as new so the reviews could go away I would ve never stayed twice  The review will not be positive  The reason you all took the listing off and relisted in the first place  You get what you pay for I guess  Cool for the price if you like to do things yourself like clean and buy things to wash dishes  The couch has more stains than a toddlers tshirt  The duvets are stained  There was nothing here to clean with  The vacuum doesn t work  Microwave doesn t work  Pots n pans have stuck on burnt food  ZENCITY is the slumlord of air bnb  Experience wasn t the best but again you get what you pay for right  This was trash  But you all knew that already  The cleaners spot clean  All around bad experience  Don t book  Save yourself the time and frustration and just some book with ZENCITY like EVER  The shower makes a horrible noise if you try to take a hot shower  The unit above it does the same thing my guy and I laughed every time we heard them shower because it was so loud like well at least it s not just us  You can t adjust the heat so you have to bring a space heater if the temp is low  THE SLUMLORDS OF AIR BNB  THAT NEVER FIX ANYTHING BUT ALWAYS WANT MONEY  Zencity is the slumlord of AirBnb  You need to hire cleaners who actually clean  You need to replace the furniture that is stained worse than a toddlers tshirt  The blinds are broken in every area of the apartment  The microwave doesn t work  The sheets duvets were previously stained n washed  The pots n pans have wore to the point the next step is disposal  I m upset my son booked the same stay next week which is horrible due to the experience and the only rep that is within your organization willing to help anyone is Clifford  Ava Jemima have done nothing to make the situation better  Do better as a whole this place is trash  I would have never booked it if I had known it was the same listing I stayed back in August and had the exact same experience  THE WORST  THANKS FOR NOTHING  And the place you didn t even want to sit on anything without first putting a sheet or something over it  Disgusting 
553617816658526423,The worst experience I ve had using Airbnb  Stayed in the unit for    plus days  it smelled very bad from sewer gas for the first   days without resolution  it s in a poor location  next to the trash room  poor communication from host  charged extra fee without explanation or resolution  STAY AWAY The unit smelled very bad for over a week without resolution  poor communication with very long response time  asked to speak to a manager I was told that would happen and it did not  a     charge was charged against my credit card without explanation  and I still don t know what the charge is for  This was the worst experience I have had with AirBnB 
551511047688228865,first the good  super clean  awesome location  right next to free trolly stop   view is beautiful   the bad  for four guests and two bedrooms only one key and fob  you need fob to get into building and use elevator  I asked host and they said extra fob only if we were staying    days  the second bedroom had window into the living room and the curtain only covered    percent of window  the water pressure in second bathroom was super low 
550060381437867597,I will never ever rent an Airbnb from this company again the check in process and the communication with Company is absolutely horrible and their customer service Isn t much better  I had to stay there because my house was being worked on the first time they gave me a late check out but then locked me out of the unit    minutes before and I couldn t get anything out for four hours unfortunately I had to stay another day so the next day they gave me a two hour late check out but the housekeeper was there at    o clock and I had to leave so they did absolutely nothing for all my hasslesCommunication between your housekeepers and yourself is key and don t lock people out of the unit just because it s after    o clock I couldn t even get to my phone to call anybody worst experience ever Check in is horrible the process takes forever  My suggestion would be also if you re gonna let somebody have a late check out to actually give it to them don t Lock them out before they even get a chance to get their stuff out
445647890647160678,  There was rats     I would like either half refunded back or full refund   I was difficult for us to sleep with them running around  
428281784073549266,Got locked out multiple of times because the only way to get in is a call telecom which unlocks the first two main doors to the building which didn t work many times during my stay I contacted the host and didn t get a response the entire stay or at all for that matter  it was a very upsetting experience I have stayed at multiple location by the host and has been a loyal customer this was a very bad experience never got an apology nor any acknowledgement about the situation
485536166956809915,Forgot very important and meaningful items and I m sure whoever clean the room after we left took my items didn t report they were lost and found and NOBODY bothered to help  This was a terrible experience I forgot very important and meaningful items here and  no one was answering or bothered to help  Very very poor service  
499241197840902303,I was locked out of the building one night for   hours until someone who live in the building let me in  The call box outside didn t work so I was locked out
521061893914366667,The access into the building was non existent  Other people let me into the building  The whole apartment was dirty  Stains on the furniture  Hair all over the bathroom  No garbage bags  No salt or pepper  The soap was just water   Someone walked up and down the hallway speaking loudly on their phone all day long  The people right above the apartment were fight so bad  I could hear cussing and sounded like someone being beat  SThe access into the building was non existent  Other people let me into the building  The whole apartment was dirty  Stains on the furniture  Hair all over the bathroom  No garbage bags  No salt or pepper  The soap was just water   Someone walked up and down the hallway speaking loudly on their phone all day long  The people right above the apartment were fight so bad  I could hear cussing and sounded like someone being beat 
492051826911315690,Ive stayed here previously and it was a pleasure  This time around not so much   During my stay  The heat didnt work while it was    degree weather   When I called for assistance  the assistant asked me the temperature inside the apartment and hung up on me   There were no replies to my heat related questions on the app during my stay   Outside of this experience  the airbnb sufficed  But this ruined a good stay  Ive stayed here previously and had a great stay  This stay was not the same  The heat didnt work while it was    degrees outside and the person meant to assist hung up on me   This was a terrible experience 
555821201434739689,I do not recommend this Airbnb  I wish I could  The Host is just simply bad  The location was decent  These are some of the issues we encountered during our stay  a shower that didn t give much more than a trickle  A smoke detector that beeped at night when lights were turned off  A dryer that did not dry its contents  And a strange electrical wiring arrangement that turns off all of lights  lamps  TV  speaker  and apparently the smoke detector too with the flip of a switch  So no mood lighting  When I reached out to the host the morning after our first night about the shower and noise  we got a response that they couldn t be fixed until the next day due to a snowstorm  I said this wouldn t work for us because these were not small issues we could work around  No response  After some back and forth with various people from Zencity  but mostly me being totally ignored every time I reached out for an update  over our   night stay NOTHING was fixed while we were there  A complete lack of care  I didn t feel like I got my moneys worth  that s for sure  To top all of it off  I reached out an asked for a later checkout and no one ever replied after multiple messages  I received an email the night prior asking if we wanted to extend checkout to  pm  Instead of replying  they sent their clean team they failed to communicate with  I did finally get a reply when they asked why were still in the unit  And they even went through the effort of trying to charge us     for late checkout with Airbnb  This is what they do instead of addressing their guest needs  Zencity needs a lot of help on what it takes to be a good host  Most definitely not a legitimate SuperHost  Communicate with guests and promptly fix issues without excuses  Your guests are what keep you in business and you need to do everything you can to ensure you resolve inquiries in a timely manner  You were overall not a good host  not because of the issues but because your lack of communication and compassion  If our issues continue to go unresolved we feel like we aren t important as guests 
487638247678394012,The unit was not clean  I arrived to trash on the floor in the bathroom  dirty walls  rugs not swept  The internet is google fibers free plan   Mbps down   Mbps up  very rough to use for basic work needs  Free parking was easy to find all times of day within a block of the entrance  Support takes multiple hours if not days to get back to you and they can t do much besides pass it along to their manager  The phone number provided for around the clock issues just tells you to try again  no one answered  Not worth the price  had a terrible experience  Have support that can actually help  Clean units before guests arrive  Internet that actually works not some terrible free tier service 
552173294336810447,Apartment is great for short term stays  Host responded to my questions promptly early on  There was just an issue with the heating system  It is window unit in the living room that never reaches the bedroom so when nights get cold make sure you bring extra blankets and maybe a space heater  Since it is an old building there is a chance that the pipes will freeze so you might not get to take a shower  The host did respond to attempt to fix the issue sending a maintenance man but he said there was nothing he could do  When I did arrive a lamp was missing and there was already damage done to the apartment so it wasnt properly being maintained  It is good for a short term stay     days definitely not long term 
549337804225588041,No free washer and dryer and make certain you got the right door code The no free washer and dryer the sliding door open the cigarette butts and contact wrappers all were not ok and the inability to check in cause wrong door code everything else was great
526807488094425215,This is a  functional  place to stay  Your expectations need to be measured  It is not a luxury building or sophisticated apartment  it s a place to get a decent night s sleep  I was unimpressed with the way the apartment was presented  visible dust  dirt  hair  The paint job is very patchy and makes the room feel more neglected than it is  It s quiet  especially considering it s proximity to the train  Heating works perfectly  It s a solid   star place to stay  I wouldn t stay here again  Hi   So  I don t like leaving negative reviews  but this property is pretty lackluster  It was incredibly dirty  hair in the bed  stains on the towels  visible dust and dirt on the floor  I wouldn t accept this room if it was presented to me in a hotel  but I know Airbnb would a different  I think the bad paint job and sparse furniture didn t help the feeling that this was a neglected apartment  The pillows are very poor quality  almost unusable  The location is great  I was upset that the check in process wasn t smooth  but you did call me with     an hr to help me out   It s definitely a   star experience  I ve stayed in better places for less  but the holiday season is always more expensive  The WiFi is great  The heating works well  There was no laundry detergent 
532655337805887211,Harassed us about every little thing   kept telling us to keep noise down despite there being   of us   no TV no music  Unit   D has the most amazing miserable neighbor who bangs on your wall and leaves nasty notes under ur door   I have screen shots I kid u not  we actually had to pay for   places to stay bc it became so much of a headache Harassed us w texts about noise when there was   of us no music no tv  and we were kept up by noise not making it  We actually had to pay for   places to stay bc we were so uncomfortable
529738055211789647,The internet was very intermittent and slow and only worked in one room and the host did not respond to messages about it   Otherwise  fine place and great location
