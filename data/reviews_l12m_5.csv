746402703,Convenient location with Divvy bikes right across the street and Blue Line close by  The room got really warm hot and I wasnt sure how to adjust the heating no coffee maker
745631404,The place was great and in a good location near a bunch of bars and restaurants  Great for a weekend in the city
745608687,I expected this visit to be very pleasant and I was in no way let down  Our stay was secure and comfortable as well as very stylish  Every aspect of this trip was very well thought out and they quickly responded to any questions I had  I highly recommend staying with Zencity  Thank you for the quick responses and incredible hospitality  We will look into using Zencity properties again in the future for visits    
745505877,Great bang for buck  bring some ear plugs though  thin walls  Thanks for letting us stay  Lock box code was incorrect
745432779,Has great views of the South Side and Lake Michigan  Pretty sparsely furnished  in a decent part of town 
745062771,Wonderful place and exactly as described  Fantastic location  clean  and amazing view  Everyone in the building was incredibly friendly   I will absolutely recommend this place to others 
744647490,Great place and very convenient for the areas I needed to find  Very neat and clean   Really love the place   Would love to book again 
743252266,Great space and location  Be aware train is outside the window so if you are a light sleeper it could be problematic  Solid place and easy to check in  The train noise is very loud and should be noted  Train noise is loud and should be noted  Dust bunnies the bathroom
743294378,Excellent location and beautiful historic building  but the unit was not clean to level expected of a typical motel  let alone COVID    clean expectations  Also  repairs needed were never addressed  wall mounted bedside table had been dislodged  and tilted downward  so items slid off  You couldnt put a glass of water on it   The management company is not particularly responsive  They reply quickly  but dont actually address the issue   just ask for more info  I sent photos  on their request  and after many days still did not receive a response addressing the clean concerns  Pretty accurate  but not in good repair  E g  wall mounted bedside table had been pulled out of the wall   was hanging at tilt  needs repair  Kitchen with minimal supplies  e g  a french press coffee maker only  which is fine  but the hot water kettle provided had no cord  so not usable  Needed to boil water in a small pot  Floors not clean  hairs in the bathroom  handles on drawers   cabinets with crumbs and stains had clearly not been wiped down  carpet with stains including gum  drawer in bath unclean The unit is managed by a company  A different person responded each time  Responses only addressed on of multiple points raised in my message  and essentially kicked it down the road  requiring multiple correspondences and ultimately not addressing the concerns raised  Good price  but frustrating to pay a clean fee for an apt  that was not clean to basic motel standards  let alone COVID    standards 
456435321594440025,Was a really cool place the only downside was it smelled like weed and when we went to the intercom it wouldnt work so we had to wait for someone to open the door for us other than that the place was nice Was a really cool place the only downside was it smelled like weed and when we went to the intercom it wouldnt work so we had to wait for someone to open the door for us other than that the place was nice
450017413476823414,Stayed here for a comedy show  I think it was a little overpriced  but I think this thought was fueled by seeing a different rate a few weeks later  It was about half of the price that I had booked it for    Apart from that  it was a cool place to show up and sleep  Parking is about a block away  and for the most part  was exactly as described  If you are going to a show at Stifel Theater  it s across the street  The host provides good instructions on how to get into the building  The door to the apartment doesn t lock properly  but a smart lock was added to help with this issue    Overall  it was a good experience 
450008809072597903,The stay was overall great  I loved this apartment and how close it was to stores and restaurants  The only complaint I have is the comforter did smell like bed head  like it might not have been washed from the last guests  I did  bring laundry soap and re wash everything as well as re wipe down the bathroom  Laundry does cost  the garage near the apartment was so so so well priced  Overall it was a good weekend 
744144888,This apartment was adequate  a  you get what you pay for  experience  It was a low budget option within   minute walking distance to the blue line  I felt safe in the neighborhood and the apartment  The apartment was old  chipping paint corroded fixtures on tub  but overall seemed clean  The bathtub is advertised but there was no stopper for the drain  so no ability to take a bath  when I reported this no effort was made to rectify   Therefore taking a shower was awkward in the cramped space of the high walled bathtub  The wifi network info was incorrect so I was without access to secured wifi for one day of my stay  delayed response from host company  Again  not major issues but not   star service  Please see messages I sent during stay for improvements  thanks  Wifi login details were not accurate Slow to respond regarding wifi login
453554269058855194,Couldnt get into the building for up to     minutes because they didnt think to send me it ahead of time and their costumer service didnt seem to know the code either  This was after a long drive pushing  am and a struggle to get a later check out with this company which ended with us purchasing an extra day  The purchase was fine  money talks  but you would think a business that seemingly had a tight schedule would be in order  Well just getting into the building was the beginning of my woes  Come to my room and open the door    its a mess  Dirty and lived in is the vibe this air bnb must live by as a company motto  Mind you  our check in is scheduled to be no earlier than around   ish the previous day  So they didnt even try to clean it with the extra   hrs we were driving to St Louis they had  The most they could offer me was to sleep in the filth and theyll have it clean the following day  They showed their benevolence by granting us an extra hour to stay in their bnb before leaving  At this point Im fuming and ask for a refund  didnt even stay  we just went to a best Western two towns over  Refund hasnt been pushed yet and its been   days since exposed to this joke  management must feed off the bad reviews Im sure youre aware of the quality I was exposed to  Including how long its taking you to issue a refund and its just an overall bitter experience 
449995501773233746,When we arrived to check in the door was propped open and the lock for the door has been installed backwards  with the keypad on the inside and deadbolt on the outside   I immediately contacted Zencity and they said they would escalate to their manager and report back  They did not report back and I had to call back to check on someone coming to fix it  They said no one could come that day  Our options were to relocate to another Airbnb for one night and then move back after the lock was fixed  It was not possible for us to move and then move back based on the plans we had made for our visit so we had to prop a table against the door that night since there was no lock   Zencity did not come correct the lock until the next day at  pm after I had to follow up with a call and messages  After that we had two service men visit to remove air conditioning units without warning or our permission   The health and safety concerns and lack of responsiveness from Zencity was unacceptable    The Airbnb was only partially clean  The only positive note I can share is on the location  The location was great   walkable to the arch and Cardinals game   We will never stay at an Airbnb hosted by Zencity again 
449991420753239796,Overall a very nice place  The neighborhood was the biggest bonus for us  We ate at   restaurants in the area and visited park Ave coffee both mornings  The beds were clean and comfortable  The view out of the windows was beautiful  there s a community garden directly across the street  Thanks for a nice stay Hello  Thank you for a nice stay  Just a few small things  we attempted to use the small vacuum to clean up some cereal  it didn t really work which made us wonder how well the place gets vacuumed  I wiped the remainder of the cereal off the kitchen floor with a wet paper towel and it was very dirty  It looked like the floors hadn t been mopped in a while  We noticed the air filters on the hvac unit needed to be changed pretty bad and noticed it was fairly dusty in the apartment in general  Which was telling of the filters  We have bad allergies so we notice things like this  Overall we would stay again  We absolutely loved Lafayette area  We walked to park Ave coffee both mornings  ate at squires and the brewery 
744043563,As advertised  Historic building with attendant pros and cons  Beautiful location  Needs a new sink faucet badly  Paint peeling in the tube Second guest was not added to the buildings list  I had to connect zencity directly for them to gain access
743865547,I stayed in Zencity s apartment with my husband and two teenage kids  It was great for everyone to have their own space and common rooms to hang out together  We appreciated the comfortable beds and full  stocked kitchen  The location was perfect  close to the train and lots of places to walk to  We used spot hero for parking and found a place nearby to keep our car  Would absolutely stay there again 
449926145068168929,Great location and house is amazing  Thanks so much for having me in your home  Only bad thing  the hair dryer didn t work  Other than that  everything was amazing 
449293641601574565,The communication with ZenCity staff was terrible  The unit I rented in St  Louis at The Bordeaux had a malfunctioning central air unit  This is a top floor unit with no shade  the temperature was in the upper   s on the first day    two windows could not be left open because their screens were missing    From the moment I checked in  the thermostat read    degress  when I turned it down to    degress  it said it would take    hours to achieve that temperature  After waiting    hours with no change to the temperature  I started looking for the HVAC unit   found it in a closet  The fan was blowing air in the apartment  but it was not cooling the air  I noticed that the unit had no filter   then I noticed that the filter was sitting on the floor  between the unit   the wall of the closet   it was completely packed full of dirt  Id estimate that it had not been changed in more than a year  so the maintenance of the building may have been weak for quite a while   There were plastic wrappers   spare parts sitting on top of the water heater that appeared to have been used to repair the HVAC system    it appeared that someone may have abandoned a repair job mid way through the process   then the unit was rented before the repair was finished    In my case  it was late August  extremely hot in St  Louis   although I did sleep in the unit for one night  with no a c  with the windows open   sweated all night on the sheets  I was not willing to do it two nights in a row  I was left so frustrated by the complete lack of assistance  I didnt even want to be there   Three ZenCity staff responded  late  to my texts or calls  all asking about the nature of the problem  None ever followed up to ask me what I wanted done about it  or to tell me what was happening  One employee suggested that he could control the temperature remotely  asked me what temperature I would like it set at   then never followed up  The temperature never changed   neither did the thermostat  There was no obvious indication anywhere that the thermostat could be managed remotely  If so  that feature also did not work    The ZenCity staff communicated through text   email  outside of AirBnBs messaging app  despite AirBnBs guidance to only use the messaging app  so they would have a trail of evidence to troubleshoot any bad experiences  I sent multiple messages through the app  as well as directly to ZenCity employees  who ultimately never did anything to help me  After the fact  they never followed up to apologize   After receiving no assistance the following morning  I checked out early  with temperatures forecast in the mid   s  AirBnB quickly issued a refund for the second day   a partial refund for the first     Although ZenCitys reviews on the AirBnB site were ok  their reviews for the same property on other websites were generally worse  This was probably the worst vacation experience Ive had anywhere in the last    years   The paint in the unit was badly chipped   scraped by furniture  inconsistent with the photos  The check in process is complicated  The nature of the lock system is such that you could easily be locked out of the unit    reliant on ZenCity to help you regain access to your things   The HVAC was obviously not operational  The worst thing  though  was the customer service   lack of responsiveness when I had a serious problem  which made it impossible to stay   finish my trip  Ive never left a negative review before  but this was truly a  very bad experience  As I repeatedly said in my messages to ZenCity representatives  the temperature in this apartment was miserably hot     degrees     the a c unit was not working   had obviously not been maintained  But the problem was  after    hours  no one had sent maintenance staff to check out the problem  offered to accommodate us elsewhere  or anything else  I was repeatedly asked what was wrong   then I never received responses about what would be done   nothing ever changed 
449289591247927685,This is a beautiful apartment   Location is great and can easily walk to all things great to do in St  Louis  Truly enjoyed our stay  Such a beautiful apartment   Everything was cozy  clean  and as described 
743798198,This place is nice and simple  Not too much  not too little  In a nice location  get parking early  and if your vegetarian  vegan they have great options around them  you should order your Uber eats before  pm   All in all a decent spot  Thank you for allowing us to stay in your unit  The toilet kept running and has dried drip stains when we came in
743796170,I would definitely book with zencity in the future  Besides a few clean issues  the experience was nice  you are right in heart of the city  Besides the few cleanliness mishaps  the place was nice  Although there was a sign with an updated time stamp for the date the place had been clean  there were a few rooms not thoroughly clean  The kitchen stove appeared as if someone had just finished cooking  I wiped a nice amount grease off of the stove  The table in the living area was stained with cup marks  I wiped it down and my napkin was dirty as well  These few things prompted me to re clean all the areas knew I would be touching  Just a suggestion the hanging soap rack on the shower head in the bathroom is rusted and should be replaced 
449261699875922819,I loved staying in this apartment  Clean  easy access to Forest Park  restaurants  and music venues in Central West End  Service was excellent  and I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a cute  cozy home in the middle of the city  I loved staying at this apartment in Central West End  Easy access to hospital  Forest Park and many of the restaurants in the area  Thank you for being so accommodating during my stay   I will definitely keep this location in mind if I come back to St  Louis in the future   Thank you for everything 
449200908082774156,Very disappointed in my stay with zen city  I ve stayed with zen city before   I also used to live in the building so I was anticipating a similar experience  However that was not the case at the start of our stay  You d think that using digital locks is a good idea  when it works  But when it doesn t work  it can be a catastrophe  The reliance on technology without a clear contingency is not a smart way of doing business    It was   am and we had arrived at the apartment only to find that the digital lock had malfunctioned  inhibiting us from using the code to enter  We called customer service and they attempted to help us get in using new codes and digital codes but to no avail  I appreciate all the help Oshane provided however this was unacceptable  We were informed that there was no other way into the apartment and that there were no keys to enter the apartment  We were told that we had to travel to a different building  Mind you it was   am  As we were leaving  we were stopped by the front desk who ultimately found a way for us to enter    The next morning we were unable to leave our apartment without a way to re enter due to the broken digital lock  The locks were eventually fixed hours later    The apartment was ok  There was construction every morning and from time to time the bathroom sink would gargle and backup with old water  smelled unpleasant   A few stains on the couch  Furthermore the internet that services the apartment was not equipped to handle working from home     I requested compensation from management but my calls have done unheard  This is most frustrating as our experience getting their affected our trip thereafter and we ve been ignored by management  I demand compensation  Very disappointed in my stay with zen city  I ve stayed with zen city before   I also used to live in the building so I was anticipating a similar experience  However that was not the case at the start of our stay  You d think that using digital locks is a good idea  when it works  But when it doesn t work  it can be a catastrophe  The reliance on technology without a clear contingency is not a smart way of doing business    It was   am and we had arrived at the apartment only to find that the digital lock had malfunctioned  inhibiting us from using the code to enter  We called customer service and they attempted to help us get in using new codes and digital codes but to no avail  I appreciate all the help Oshane provided however this was unacceptable  We were informed that there was no other way into the apartment and that there were no keys to enter the apartment  We were told that we had to travel to a different building  Mind you it was   am  As we were leaving  we were stopped by the front desk who ultimately found a way for us to enter    The next morning we were unable to leave our apartment without a way to re enter due to the broken digital lock  The locks were eventually fixed hours later    The apartment was ok  There was construction every morning and from time to time the bathroom sink would gargle and backup with old water  smelled unpleasant   A few stains on the couch  Furthermore the internet that services the apartment was not equipped to handle working from home     I requested compensation from management but my calls have done unheard  This is most frustrating as our experience getting their affected our trip thereafter and we ve been ignored by management  I demand compensation 
447739794365071489,Great location and the building staff members were super helpful 
445641560513643608,Great location  decently clean  although some repairs were needed to the bathroom tiles  A member of my group left a suit in the closet and they have not been very communicative as we ve tried to locate it  The tiles in one of the bathroom floors needs to be fixed  Main door to the apartment is very difficult to open
743295564,This unit checked off all the right boxes when booking  Laundry  Two bedrooms  Newly remodeled  Great location  Sparkling clean  Only one review    I do utilize reviews and knew I was taking my chances   After checking in realized we only had one bldg key amongst the three of us  Asked for extra but couldn t accommodate  Made it work  Beds were hands down the most uncomfortable any of us had ever tried sleeping on  Unit was sparkling clean but shower didn t drain  Be sure and note that coffee maker is a French press  We brought a small Mr Coffee along  Love the area  A few small tweaks and toppers for the mattresses and this place could be     Hello Enjoyed our stay but feel a few tweaks could make it an even better space   The shower does not drain well  This is something anyone who is clean would note right away    The bed was the most uncomfortable mattress   I know that can be subjective but my    year old son who accompanied us this trip said he didn t sleep well either due to mattress  I believe this was my   th airbnb stay and numerous VRBO hotels over the years  Don t skimp on the mattress bc if your guests don t get a good nights sleep they won t be back  An easy fix would be a feather topper   Huge difference between an agency managing properties vs homeowners  Coffee is provided     of the time along with a coffee maker and filters  I know a French press was provided but maybe consider some ground coffee  Also providing a pitcher that filters water would be a nice touch   A couple of chairs for the back door deck would be a nice addition with a small table when the weather gets nicer   Unit was sparkling clean  The shower drain needs to be addressed sooner rather than later  Thank you for hosting

441993811701557684,Not responsive  passcode was not sent until I stand by the door and make a phone call and test code and change the code and test it again  It was    outside  I have to wait for them set the passcode instead of they set it up before I arrive   In the morning I make up my mind and prepared to go to school for my first class in new semester  the door of the building is broken  and it is broken for a long while  which they did not mention at all  My Uber cancelled my trip to school and charged me    dollars for waiting  The only way out seems to be the path through the dumpster and yes  it is    outside  I did not go to my first class due to it  Assuredly I asked help from host  not body replied to me  I have to walk all the way through that dumpster and detour to the door of the building and enter the passcode and the people inside of the building can get out   Nobody will help you when you were in trouble there  And room is old I can accept that as the price is relatively low  For cleanliness  you can tell the hair of others in the towel  etc  And people lives in upstairs is quite active   Location is ok  but I would recommend some else to live if you need food and water 
440508872326042585,Beautiful space  Hi the apartment was even better than expected  I unwittingly spent much more for the apartment than I had planned  but Clane was fantastic and talked to me about my concerns

742176815,great overall stay 
741754053,Beautiful place and great location  As others have mentioned  though  there was an issue with things being not properly clean  Hopefully ZenCity will pay more attention to this in the future  Wrong door code It was clear that some areas had not been wiped down   swept thoroughly
438423169762077719,This Airbnb was located in a very safe neighborhood  Parking was a bit difficult and do keep in mind that there are     flights of stairs you must go up to the apartment  no elevator   The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable  It is in an old apartment building like most of them in the area  Upon arrival the air was    degrees in the apartment  The first night was miserable but by our second night stay it had finally cooled down to    degrees  It never did reach the    degrees that we sat the thermostat at  There was a strong marijuana scent in the evenings coming from other apartments throughout the building  The smell was a bit overpowering and unpleasant  keep in mind also 
431808837862449605,Very unprofessional and in person know when the situation arises and they think by switching you to another room that they rectify the issue but they don t and their system is very automated so you only get to talk to him and if you press the right selections when you call the host number  Stay with a private house do not use in city they are running more like a business than a personable ran Airbnb The fact that I was not reached prior to me arriving to the unit even though you say you tried she still mean something in regards to me being compensated for the inconvenience and poor communication by the same city staff the reps on the phone we re very nice but it seems like they were not given the correct information to even let me check in timely and the new unit that they try to move me to and I asked for compensation by a partial refund and didn t get it the second unit that they move me to was a smoking unit so it smelled like smoke and it was much smaller the bathroom was very small and didn t have much room for me to move around and I m definitely not pleased I will not be using Sin City again unless they resolve this issue they try to say that they would not give me a refund and I do not think that is fair because I waited almost an hour before I could get in the new new room The fact that I was not reached prior to me arriving to the unit even though you say you tried she still mean something in regards to me being compensated for the inconvenience and poor communication by the same city staff the reps on the phone we re very nice but it seems like they were not given the correct information to even let me check in timely and the new unit that they try to move me to and I asked for compensation by a partial refund and didn t get it the second unit that they move me to was a smoking unit so it smelled like smoke and it was much smaller the bathroom was very small and didn t have much room for me to move around and I m definitely not pleased I will not be using Zen City again unless they resolve this issue they try to say that they would not give me a refund and I do not think that is fair because I waited almost an hour before I could get in the new new room Due to the rep not knowing the access codes and giving me the wrong access code which lock the door
428898289187826998,Great place in a great location for a very reasonable price Loved the place  only thing is one of the bathroom sinks has a pretty bad clog 
428183047398700410,Cool place to stay 
741763278,Great place to stay  Once I found free parking on the side street 
741754066,Cute place  Great area to stay 
428012576581351723,It was a nice living experience  Very convenient check in system and very clean environment 
741735008,Nice and cozey just wished bathtub was different   Felt very small   Other than that place was great 
427448767978231621,Everything was nice   Just like the pictures    The only negative things we found was the apartment smelled like smoke     really the whole building did   We found ashes on top of the fridge   Lastly  there was a book on the table in the living room and it had nude pictures in it   which I felt was disgusting if someone was staying there with children   Overall it was a decent place to stay   Beds were amazing and it was great pricing for the stay  Everything was real nice   The only negative that I found was that the building smelled like smoke especially inside the apartment that we had  We actually found ashes on top of the fridge   lastly  there was a book on the table in the living room that had nude pictures in it that I found inappropriate if children had been staying there   Other than that  everything els was nice  
426823419084115350,Very stylish apartment in a great location  In general  the place was very clean  but there was mold in the shower and quite a bit of long hairs in the bathroom   It would be nice to have a small amount of coffee and tea in the apartment
426804191089098093,Great   extremely stylish
741552182,The apartment was nice and clean  Bedding was very comfortable  Great location  But the stove and dryer did not work  I told them and nothing was done about it 
426729133547234862,Great location in the historic district   Modern apt  with plenty of space   We found some great restaurants around the area   We left our car in the parking lot and walked to Union Station and the Gateway Arch   It was a good hike  but easy walking and allowed us to see more of the city  We were surprised not find any cooking supplies at all   Typically  there is salt  pepper  sugar  olive oil  etc   Most times there is also tea and coffee   The living room carpet should be thoroughly clean or replaced   It didnt appear to be vacuumed  but it may be the carpet or vacuum cleaner   Not your issue  but unfortunately when we left  someones dog had pooped on the first floor just out of the elevator and all the way out the door to the parking lot   Just thought you should know  in case you want to mention it to the property management company 
426082917545708712,I was disappointed with my stay here  The unit had a bad smell as soon as we checked in and I immediately alerted the host  however while their communication was good  it was not followed up by action  They offered ozone treatment etc  but did not actually do it even after I told them to go ahead to schedule it  All the window AC s were terribly dirty and had the red light on requiring clean  Walking on the floor bare feet left you with black soles  All this also I told the host but nothing was done about it  Cleanliness is a big thing with me and this unit failed completely in meeting my standards  The sofa was dirty with stains on it   and the whole place looked tired and shabby  This unit is not worth the price we paid 
426039602752521685,We were very dissatisfied with our unit  We had to call to get a code for the outer door  The apartment was unlocked  The trash cans had not been emptied  A water bottle and trash was on a windowsill  The trash cans had not been emptied  Dirty towels were left in the laundry hamper  There were no hand towels and wash clothes or towels for the kitchen  There was no coffee or filters  I called the hostess and she seemed rather uncaring  She offered a one bedroom unit for the three of us  That obviously would not work  She wanted pictures so I sent them  We clean the washer which smelled horrible because it stays closed all the time   The lint filter in the dryer was stuffed  We stayed up till midnight washing linens so we could sleep  The sheets on one bed were on sideways  The next day someone changed all the sheets and left clean linens for the bath and kitchen  They emptied the trash but did not sweep  Hair is in every corner  It was advertised as three bedroom and two baths  The shower in one bath did not work   I cannot believe this unit can be charged for  I will never rent from Zencity again  
425343148621646469,Close to downtown   Nice modern space  Felt safe  lots of security features 
425314409536471104,Great place
425313774617378698,The place was really nice  in a good locality and close to lot of fun places   The apartment was really clean and as described  Had some trouble figuring out how to check in and with parking but figured it out after a while  Enjoyed staying here  The check in instructions are not clear enough  I saw one more person having a hard time finding the place and getting in and I helped them out   Reaching Zencity on the phone was hard and waited on the call for    minutes and ended it  Even on the app they took a long time to respond 
424625023593528914,Unit was amazing  had everything you would need  Bed was super comfortable    stars   Everything was amazing 
424615296438403045,Great place to stay  great location and easy check in  But when we got there we noticed there was no parking pass and we mentioned that but they still tried charging  Double check everything is in your room  Also the carpet in the room didn t seemed to be vacuumed so we had to do it ourselves  Also the bed sheets seem dirty and we changed those as well  Other than that it was a beautifully updated nice place to stay close to downtown  There wasn t a parking pass in our room and we mentioned that but you still tried charging  Remember to double check if it s in the room
424605519514294405,Great location  Spacious rooms and comfy beds  Washer and dryer was helpful as well  Parking isn t the best but it ended up working out fine   we always ended up finding a street spot even on the weekend  Definitely get a smell of weed in certain parts of the condo at certain times of day  Communication is not the greatest but check in instructions were clear  Overall really enjoyed our stay  Hello  Very much enjoyed the stay  Great space and location  The bed was comfy and clean linens  We loved the large bedrooms and the washer and dryer  However  we never got a response from host on our question  the living room and kitchen smelled like weed at times and rugs and carpet were a little dirty  But other than that great place to stay 
423915250859521080,Make sure you reach out to the host for your door code to get into the unit  as it wasnt communicated clearly before we arrived   Furthermore  the on site parking was amazing  but as of our visit we had to pay the normal parking rate and reach out for reimbursement   The host company had great customer service  and the unit itself was outstanding   Outside of my minor inconveniences listed above  this place and this host are easily   Star material  I recommend providing the passcode for the door before the visit begins   Also  we did have to be reimbursed for parking  as our fob did not let us out of the garage   We left all of the used dishes in dishwasher  clean  of course  and every used towel in the hamper  in the master bedroom   Hopefully that makes clean a touch easier for you all   Thank you for letting us stay in such a nice home 
423871698542835293,This was a great location and easy access to downtown STL  Company provided great communication on accessing the apartment and directions  Thanks for letting us stay with you  This was our first time staying in St  Louis and we felt very safe with how private this location was with the gated fence and entry    Cons  one of the bar stools was broken when we got there and the towels were dirty and had pubic hairs on them 
423856167599305182,Everything was neat and clean and whole apartment looked amazing  Zencity was a perfect host  Zencity was a perfect host 
423163801687640926,Great location  clean  great price   However  the day before check in I asked if I could get in       min before the  pm check in time to set up for a work call and only got a  well check on it  response    The fob I got did not work when I got back late at night  luckily a resident was coming in and let me in or I would have been out of luck  Communication was ok  and I got a fob after mine quit working  but I never got an answer after the receptionist told me the fob wasnt working well for anyone 
423134700978528812,Accommodation clean  comfortable  well equipped  and in a nice location in STL   I wasnt happy with the customer service from Zencity  The accommodation was clean and comfortable and VERY well equipped   My ONLY reason for marking my evaluation as low as I did was that I was disappointed in the service   I was in STL on business and was unable to access Wifi in my apartment   Zencity corresponded by email about this  but the issue was never resolved  NOR was there an offer to provide assistance in person   I never did find the router to which they referred   In exchange for this inconvenience  I requested   night reimbursement when I checked out a day early  this was just   night out of total   night stay    This request was denied citing  contract agreement    That is poor customer service in my opinion   I wont stay at another B B operated by Zencity 
423101884162981364,I feel like the space has a lot of potential but missed the mark  I also feel that     for a clean fee should mean that the place was spotless and well cared for but that wasn t the case  crumbs on the stove  dusty and the toilet wasn t clean  We were on the   th floor and would have had a great view but the blinds were broken so we couldn t open them to see out  Combined with the cold shower in the morning  we were fairly disappointed  I feel like the space has a lot of potential but missed the mark  I also feel that     for a clean fee should mean that the place was spotless and well cared for but that wasn t the case  crumbs on the stove  dusty and the toilet wasn t clean  We were on the   th floor and would have had a great view but the blinds were broken so we couldn t open them to see out  Combined with the cold shower  we were fairly disappointed 
423088068788305173,Nice enough place  but it is not what it looks like online  The building has a strong smell of marijuana and walls are really thin so that you hear neighbors a lot  Didn t feel very clean to me  Location is about all this place has going for it  Wouldn t stay here again 
740055074,Outstandingly clean   in a great location to walk to any of the touristy locations  Would visit and stay here again  Thank you for an incredibly easy   memorable stay 
421730432257979730,This place was not kept up and kind of dirty  The pictures made it look much better than it actually was  There were things hanging off screws in the walls  dirt coming out of the bathroom vent  a red and brown stained tub and shower curtain  black marks all over the walls  the place just didnt feel kept up  It definitely seems like a place that a corporation owns and no individual actually sees it  Some more upkeep of the property would be beneficial  It just didnt feel like it was in good shape    and it felt very dirty 
421726917463944738,Nice homey atmosphere  Enjoyed my stay here  I felt very at home  Safe and beautiful apartment  Nice restaurants behind it on Euclid  Parked in garage a half block away 
421679503161063100,Cozy and quaint place to stay in the city  Great hosts who are amazing with communicating needs and wants or to lend a hand at any time  Highly recommended  Thank you guys so much for everything 
421651617280156134,Thank you for hosting my family 
420290815475679297,Very good place  close to the Gateway Arch  Quiet all the time
420236756641365947,Can t beat the location   Food options and Forest Park options with a couple blocks  The building is a little dated and bathrooms could use some work  But all in all a pleasant stay 
561620432361583534,Amazing place  Would recommend to anyone   Amazing property  Everything about th  stay was fantastic  Wish there was a quicker way to unlock the door but that s just me being picky  Great job 
561597701418888689,Everything we needed was already provide right there for us  We didn t have to worry about anything and the whole process was so easy  It was so neat and clean very quiet for the location and finding parking was very nice and easy  Not to far from everywhere we needed to be
560858347549764328,The apartment is accurate to it s description the check in process was nice and smooth I recommend The stay was really nice and smooth thank you 
560926697474081462,Good location  clean  pictures matched what we saw and the communication was always prompt  Would stay here again  Thank you for letting us stay here  Overall it was a pleasant stay  It was a bit confusing trying to find the room initially  but we managed and we had no issues the rest of the stay 
419508958412733068,The building has significant challenges including urine and feces in the lobby  elevator and hallways   This happened each day we were there   The lobby was clean but the elevator and the area outside the elevator on floor    were never clean  they would just partially dry then new urine feces would be present the next day   Main entrance security door not functional   Little or no security or housekeeping staff   Several barking and snarling dogs   Garbage chute and dumpster not maintained and garbage all over   Parking lot pedestrian entrance security not functional  No parking pass or fob in unit at check in and took     minutes to get one   This is exacerbated by further complicating the multi step process of getting in the unit and getting ones car parked   Window coverings on all three windows were damaged and non functional   In one bedroom half of the window covering was missing   The beds were nice and clean   The main area rug and furniture were grungy  i e  it was vacuumed and dusted but also stained and worn  The building has significant challenges including urine and feces in the lobby  elevator and hallways   This happened each day we were there   The lobby was clean but the elevator and the area outside the elevator on floor    were never clean  they would just partially dry then new urine feces would be present the next day   Main entrance security door not functional   Little or no security or housekeeping staff   Several barking and snarling dogs   Garbage chute and dumpster not maintained and garbage all over   Parking lot pedestrian entrance security not functional  No parking pass or fob in unit at check in and took     minutes to get one   This is exacerbated by further complicating the multi step process of getting in the unit and getting ones car parked   Window coverings on all three windows were damaged and non functional   In one bedroom half of the window covering was missing   The beds were nice and clean   The main area rug and furniture were grungy  i e  it was vacuumed and dusted but also stained and worn 
419503429263702554,Nice space  will need salt  pepper  dish soap    laundry soap  The pool is a wading pool  completely metal lined  so be careful  but perfect for lounging and chatting  The key tag wouldnt open the garage gate ever  had to wait for front desk person to answer call button to open it  Also  you must have a tag to exit the building which was challenging as you are leaving the key inside the space at check out  I did appreciate the space  had a lovely stay  the black out curtains were amazing  beds comfortable  and the walk in closet was ridiculously large  The key tag wouldnt work to exit the garage  and in order to exit the building you have to have a key tag  This made it difficult to get to the garage to leave after leaving the key at check out  The space was very nice  there werent many towels  however there was laundry  Unfortunately there was no dish soap  or laundry soap  There was an empty container of ALL on top of the laundry machines  Overall  it was a nice space  however communication at check out wasnt very speedy  Still waiting a response regarding my blow dryer that was left behind 
419495390935709191,Great Location  Great accommodations and a very clean place  Check in Check out  is not complicated   Host are extremely good with communicating back  The only issue was not having a dedicated parking spot  however there are tons on street parking spots  I will definitely stay again and recommend  Your place was extremely efficient   The location was great and the accommodations were perfect and met my needs  The only mishap was the opened bag of chips that we discussed  im pretty sure this was a little mistake and not the normal   The only improve that I could possible think of would to be including a parking spot  Parking on the street  finding parking can be a bit hectic    All in all  we enjoyed our stay and will definitely book again 
418790748382349404,Would stay here again  Comfortable bed  great front desk staff  awesome location  absolutely quiet even on a Friday night  Seems larger in person than in the photos  Rooftop views were gorgeous   didnt spend much time up there  but wished we could have  We got lucky with street parking and only paid for two hours of a meter on Sunday morning with the rest of our stay finding free spots  Theres a drive in front of the building so you can load a car if need be when leaving   Only eh was that the living room smelled the faintest bit like smoke  think its due to the window A C unit   cant do much about that   Im sensitive to that sort of thing  but it didnt bother me too much and wasnt present in the bedroom or bathroom 
418066446556413044,Great location overlooking Forest Park Thanks  ZenCity staff
416660617627419746,The room that I slept in was very warm  there s only one A C unit in the living room for the entire Unit  It does get noisy in the area throughout the night  make sure to bring white noise  Parking can be an issue  but street parking isn t monitored after  p to  am  but if you need to park there during the day  be prepared to find a garage or pay for street parking    Other than that  it was a cute apartment  but I won t be booking again because of the parking issue  The room that I slept in was very warm  there s only one A C unit in the living room for the entire Unit  It does get noisy in the area throughout the night  make sure to bring white noise  Parking can be an issue  but street parking isn t monitored after  p to  am  but if you need to park there during the day  be prepared to find a garage or pay for street parking    Other than that  it was a cute apartment  but I won t be booking again because of the parking issue 
416588299992540836,No free parking        great location The bathtub backs up and needs to be snaked or plunged  filter in AC needs changed  When you advertise     night and it ends up being       thats very misleading  And the parking situation needs to be said Up Front  not after Ive already paid for it  because that added more  
506489573684996753,Great location  neighbors are nice as well  Thank you for the stay 
758047618,A good base of operations for a stay in Hyde Park   this lovely pedestrian friendly neighborhood is loaded with parks and pocket gardens   The apartment was nicely laid out and easy to access   Appliances and furnishings were all up to date and clean  It was terrific to see a full length mirror   I think the blinds should be replaced with something that blocks out the outdoor lighting better   We are southerners and the heat seemed too hot at night   We did not open windows b c of outside noise   Also  the living room couch could be longer so occupants can sleep nap separately if desired   But  the proximity to travel and shopping and my daughters apartment was the main selling point of this apartment for us   We would stay here again 
515279391478078930,Nice place  Would definitely stay here again Entry is sort of difficult
415149407848966428,Pro  The location of the apartment was great  Directly across the street from Forest Park  Lime scooters in front of the building  lots of restaurants to choose from  and a   min walk to the link for easy access to downtown  Whole Foods and another small gourmet grocery store are only a few blocks away  Pro  The rooftop terrace was great for evening sunsets  absolutely beautiful  Pro  The apartment closely matched the pictures and AC worked great in     degree temperatures  Con  The check in procedure did not go well  no access to lockbox and no answer from customer service  Building concierge is not able to assist  Eventually  ZenCity resolved issue  but over an hour after arrival  Con  The WiFi access given did not work  only showed up as an available connection on the last day  Workaround was using modem directly  All in all  I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone traveling in the area  I mentioned this in the checkout text  but the check in process did not go well for us  The lockbox code was not sent via email and there was no way to get into the apartment for over an hour  The customer service number was not answered until we picked option    third party calling on behalf of a client  The front desk staff of the building is not able to help  and is not present to answer any questions after hours  Another couple checking in at    pm was not able to find the lockbox and their code did not work   They also did not receive an answer to their call to CS until we told them to pick the third party option  The concept is great but there needs to be a backup plan for access   Also the router was not functioning  so we directly used the modem for internet access  This may be problematic for anyone without tech skills 
415147280033497059,Great location for a reasonable price  There is nothing fancy about the unit but it was easy to get to and access  fit our group of   adults   a baby well  and has a washer dryer available  Lots of restaurants within walking distance and conveniently located for driving  More convenient than a   star hotel but definitely has its own set of quirks to adjust to  Great location  There was a sewage y smell throughout the apartment the entire time that went a long way from preventing us from loving the place  it was also not particularly clean  missing grout in the bathroom  stains on the area rug  etc   The bottle cap keeping a table level was tough since we couldnt leave it on the floor to do its job with an infant around  but the table was very tippy without it  All in all  it was fine for the price and the location but it was clear that this is not a meticulously maintained unit 
744142585,Nice studio right on the university of chicago campus  plenty of places nearby for coffee or food  I enjoyed my stay and it was in a nice part of town but i wish it was cleaner  When i walked in on the first day i noticed change on the ground  then i noticed that there was also loose hairs on the sheets that were clearly visible  There were also hairs in the towels and there was hair in the shower and there was urine underneath the toilet seat  Then on the second day of my stay i found an open box of condoms in the drawer next to the bed so that was cool 
410838608733917054,The apartment was not as clean as we thought it should be  The side bed tables had food particles on both of them  The remotes did not look clean  The floors were sticky  My husband and I we re here for his oncology treatment so he has a compromised immune system  I went to the store to buy disinfectant wipes and wiped things done  The bathroom was clean though  The apartment was close to the hospital so that was very nice and convenient  We wish there was better parking as I had to park   blocks away to find free parking as we were there   days  Other than that  we enjoyed our stay   Thank you again  
410828129676234907,Nice location near Union Station and not all that far from the Arch and ballpark area either  The room was spacious and clean and I liked that the tv had Netflix and several other streaming apps ready to view  Would be nice to have a disposable parking pass so that when I left I didn t have to go get my car and they park and return to the room to drop off the parking pass  Though I realize that is probably something you can t control 
410795323784027518,We had to call literally    times but we finally got a hold of someone on the   th try  the original passcode given was wrong and we were giving so many wrong pass codes after before getting a correct one which kind of made us hesitant to leave afraid we would get locked out and not be able to get a hold of someone  Outside of the actual room we stayed in the building smells horrible  like urine 
410789182359147294,Was a great place  Everything you need  Great having a washer and dryer as well    Thanks so much worked out great for us 
409416308001109015,This was a bad stay for me  I expected to fully enjoy my weekend vacation  but yet found out that I would end up dealing with clear procedural failures of the property owners    On the Positive    the place was clean and welcoming  On the negative  Be prepared to find somewhere else to sleep if any situation happens to your room key  and you get to the facility during the off hours of the front desk attendant   After a night out on the town  my key FOB fell out of my pocket in the uber during the ride home  Shortly there after  my cell phone died  Thus I was limited to contacting the Zencity through the buildings call box  However  come to find out  the building has no front desk support  nor anyone available to let guest gain entry into the building  Therefore  using the call box  transfers you to other front desk attendants located in the apartment buildings near by  I attempted to call Zencity      times using the call box and received no reply  Finally I tried the front desk and was able to reach the   other nearby front desk workers  Who again noted  that they would be unable to  provide me access  One attendant was able to reach a Zencity representive on the hotel landline after I walked over there to meet him  Although  the rep was  sympathetic and understanding to my situation  he still could not provide me access to the building nor the room  The      on call building technician was called repeatable and never answered the phone  Thus  the only result for me to gain access to the building would be waiting until      am until the front desk representative got to work  This resulted in me sleeping on the sofa of the adjacent building for several hours until  am    When  am came  I approached the front desk which was able to open the lobby doors for me  but had no idea who can or how to access the spare room key   SN  I was finally able to charge my phone and confirmed the FOB was left in the Uber at this time  However  the driver would not be available until the afternoon to bring the key   The attendant contacted the      tech who finally picked up and came  However  for some reason he forgot to bring the key himself and I was told that he wont be back for an hour  Now its closing in on  am  and I was finally able to reach a Zencity rep over the phone who can provide me a solution  The rep was able to remotely open a lock box that for some magically reason no one else knew excised  and contained a secondary master key that would open my guest suite   Ultimately  this was a horrible stay for me  I will never stay with this provider  or do I recommend anyone else making that choice  Not negating my responsibility of losing the  key FOB temporarily  However  I did not foresee the only solution would be to sleep in a neighboring buildings sofa as the solution  It was one of the most embarrassing feelings watching people walk by possibility thinking who is this bum on the couch  knowing I paid a considerable amount for a bed  Furthermore  I happy that i attended this vacation by myself and not with my family  I cant even imagine paying for an AirBNB only to watch my kids sleep on a couch for hours because Zencity does not have a plan in place for lost keys   Lets be real  you can purchase a cheaper hotel and ensure at least they have a procedure in place to make accommodations for entry  at the minimum  unto the property    Like I said earlier the place was clean  but the service was beyond poorly planned and executed  Develop a process that allows people the ability to enter the facility and access the property
409409604017394107,Wonderful location and very nice accommodations  Had a great stay  The only thing that we would change is that the love seat in the living area was incredibly uncomfortable  A couple of concrete blocks would be better  LOL  We had a great stay though and really enjoyed the accommodations  Thank you for everything 
409386893779292739,The place was clean and the game room in the building was super cool  We used Uber for most of our transportation and didn t pay more than     for each ride  but the metro is also an option  If you plan on cooking anything  make sure you make a list of everything you need because there are zero essential grocery items   not even cooking spray    they do provide all the cooking ware you ll need though   Other than the lack of basic grocery items  the place was great and very clean  Would definitely recommend staying here The place was great  just would have been nice if there were the basic groceries condiments provided  It was a pain to have to purchase the bare minimum to then just throw them all away  Also the outlet in the room close to the closet didn t work for some reason 
407168311948281126,Was a great location and a beautiful apartment  Easy check in and great restaurant on the main floor  We did have issues with noise  thin walls and ceiling  we heard upstairs walking around and at about  AM were startled awake by yelling in the hallway  It was a great spot and a lovely location  Accommodated my last minute booking which I appreciated  I did ask and request an earlier check in and it said it was approved but then was told not tell    We just had issues with loud yelling in the hallways at  AM 
406433787735196337,Always a pretty good stay with Zencity   clear instructions good unit from time to time theres a small issue but thats going to happen  The door knob on one bedroom is broken and there was a lot of gnats in kitchen 
405736480200330689,Perfect for a quick overnight stay during a cross country trek  as it was very close to the interstate  Great location close to Forest Park  easy to find on street parking  and the Whole Foods right across the street was super convenient  The studio was simple and clean  Comfortable bed and quiet so got a great nights sleep  Thanks for everything  It was a great location and it ended up being super easy to park overnight  In case its a continuing issue  you might want to tell people about the back entrance  I just lucked out with the guy who showed me  Also it was closer to the parking spots so easier to bring bags in  There was definitely an odd odor in the bathroom that I think was just from not enough ventilation  Noticed that the fan was pretty blocked up with dust  Tried to  clear it out a little and that helped a bit  but definitely needs to be checked  Overall though  it was great and I really loved being close to Forest Park 
405077738261628016,My husband and I went there for our anniversary and loved the place it was a beautiful apartment very clean and a absolutely wonderful  The neighborhood we were was a fun and had everything from restaurants art to bars and we were close to everything downtown we are absolutely reserving this place again when we are back in the city it was a wonderful experience and the host was very friendly  I really enjoyed your place and will absolutely be recommending it to others and hopefully we ll be back 
405060395372112854,Trust these reviews  Just dont book here  The unit was FILTHY  Hair on the bathroom walls  Toilette had a dirty ring  Dirty rags in the bathroom  Rug was FILTHY  Wall were filthy  Obvious ceiling leakage in the kitchen  The unit you see here is NOT the unit you get  The only plus is the location  Yall are dead wrong that place is filthy and those pictures are not of that unit

404315849795300418,Wonderful location  The mattress seems to really sink down into the middle and was pretty uncomfortable for my husband   Kitchen needs new sheet pans and over mitts    With a while like foods downstairs some  like us  may want to throw a pizza in the over etc so that would be nice to have   Check in was bumpy being locked out in the rain  luckily a person coming in let us in too through a different entrance    Other than that   great

402115792858886734,Great price  Real good location  Pubes on the bathroom wall were rough to take  I didn t know the router was controlled by the light switch  No TV for awhile 
401437329061760858,If you stay at this Airbnb you ll not only love the great location  and stunning rooftop views  but the staff is in my opinion is top notch  We checked in at  pm on Monday the  th  the doorman   please forgive me I can t remember this sweet souls name  was the most above board enthusiastic  positive  and outgoing  He should us how to use the keyfobs and told us if we needed anything to let him know  I would definitely stay a       if I could leave ten stars I could                       The door man when we checked in at    pm on Monday the  th was the most welcoming man  So helpful and always remembered my son and that he was in the hospital  He definitely deserves a fat raise    
401414424379579121,The apartment appeared very similar to the photos posted   It was tidy and professional   However  it hadnt been properly clean   There was a significant amount of dirt  food scraps  crumbs  etc  on the main carpet and entry way  empty bottles of shampoo conditioner in the shower  and a lot of hair in the bathroom     I wasnt happy   I emailed management and they said they would send someone over to clean   Nobody ever came   To make matters worse  management sent me an email asking if I would like to pay      extra to have the space  freshened up    I expected it to be fresh in the first place   I shouldnt have to pay extra to have a clean space     The building is located right next to a hospital and extremely loud ambulances and sirens drove by all night long   I was shocked at how loud it was and had to wear ear plugs and keep the AC running to sleep through the night     Parking near the building was also a nightmare and added an additional headache and cost to the stay   I wouldnt stay there again or recommend it to a friend 
401348577714519732,My bf and I booked this during our drive to St  Louis  roadtripped east to west   nd stop  so excited to stay based on location and since it was labeled super host  When we arrived it was around       and the check in app didn t work door man had to give us a key  When we got up there it was absolutely gross  Stuff on the bed and floors  black hairs   Had taken pics and sent to zen city in which they only would refund me     of the clean fee which was literally only       I messaged regarding my concern again hence we didn t even stay there that night  And no response not even the small refund  Moral of the story I had to reach out to Airbnb directly  Poor communication I appreciate the efforts however your communication was awful and required me to go through air bnb directly  Very disappointed with what you considered clean and a fair refund 
399962045938654133,We did not enjoy our stay here  The bed was extremely uncomfortable and bedroom was very hot and customer service refused to help the AC issue  The building smells of smoke constantly  although a  non smoking  community  Appliances were not working and the window shades offered no privacy or light darkening  The d cor and location were nice  but not worth the other downfalls  We had an awful experience here  The bed was extremely uncomfortable   especially since the bedroom was not cooling properly  No one helped me when I complained regarding the cooling issue  Also  the washing machine and dishwasher were not working  The washing machine would start to run water then quit  the dishwasher would not close the compartment that the pod goes in  The hallways smelled bad of cigarette and marijuana smoke in the building  The blinds in the apartment do not provide privacy or block the light 
399958589028962863,The location of this AirBnB was excellent  as it was close to Forest Park and great local restaurants   Unfortunately  I cannot recommend this listing due to two main issues  lack of communication from the host concerning check in and the cleanliness of the apartment   With respect to check in  the hosts initial message upon booking stated that they would send check in information a few days in advance   They did not   I messaged the host when I was about an hour away from St  Louis to ask for check in information   They did not respond   It was not until about three hours later  when my family was standing outside the apartment building and calling the number  that we finally got the code to the building and apartment   It was getting to be late at night at that point  and we were concerned we would have to cancel the booking and secure a last minute hotel room   Second  although the apartment was architecturally interesting  it was not clean   The wood floors were sticky  the carpets and furniture were stained  and there was visible dirt hair dust along the trim  baseboards  and in the corners   The kitchen sink faucet was also broken   I wanted to like the apartment  but these issues would cause me not to stay here again 
397752031143151683,The unit was spacious and was within walking distance to the Arch  The unit was not very clean  The laminate floors were dirty and the carpet had a lot of hair in it  Also  I had a few issues with my stay and the time it took for Zencity to respond and resolve the issues was not appropriate  I have been home   days and am still waiting for a response  I am disappointed about my experience with Zencity 
397730476672025600,Great spot  nice accommodations    Cons   I had a week long thing at the convention center  and it was a bit of an inconvenient walk in the summer heat    Scooters are the way to go    There is only one key card which gives you access to the elevator and the garage   Since there was more than one person in my group this became a significant inconvenience     Pros   The apartment is very spacious and sparsely appointed  which is a good thing imo    It was incredibly clean and well taken care of   There are plenty of good spots for eating  drinking  and sightseeing within walking  running  or scootering distance    I loved having an indoor gym for a rainy days and the included parking spot was a huge advantage      Took me most of the week before I realized there was a good coffee shop IN THE BUILDING   Which is awesome  wish Id have known sooner  Great spot  nice accommodations   The lack of a second key card was a significant challenge for us   I loved having an indoor gym for a rainy day and an included parking spot was a huge advantage 
397721941982465026,Great place to stay  Centrally located  safe  wide open windows with a gorgeous skyline view  and lots of amenities  The kitchen was stocked with pretty much anything you might need to cook your own meals  and there were fun bonuses like a rooftop pool  The host was available to answer questions  Definitely recommend staying here  We had a great stay in your apartment  Thank you for all the amenities provided and the quick response to our question  Everything was so beautiful  clean  and comfortable   One suggestion we have is to provide a second key so that more than one guest can leave at different times during the day  However  the backup access was certainly adequate  It just made things a little more complicated for four guests  Also  we had three towels for four guests  so we ended up buying one 
397108227618219405,This place was unclean 
397084702670784592,I had a terrible experience    Problems      The  smart  lock on the door was unable to lock itself  This left us with no way to lock the door from the outside  ZenCity had no solutions for this  no interest in helping us  and after an unbelievably Kafkaesque conversation with ZenCity we gave up  We had to take everything with us in our car the when we weren t in the apartment and just leave the apartment sitting unlocked the entire day       The washer was broken  In the midst of our   hour attempt to get ZenCity to do ANYTHING about the lock  we decided to wash some clothes  The washer filled with water and then promptly stopped  The dryer wouldn t turn on either  Now  we are sitting in an apartment we cannot lock with a washer full of soaked  dirty clothes  It was around this time that ZenCity stopped responding entirely  We had to wring our clothes out in the sink and go to the laundromat at the crack of dawn the next day    The short of it  the apartment is fine if everything works  But if it doesn t  no one will help you  And you will drive yourself crazy trying to get even a response from ZenCity  And after hours of sending messages  ruined clothes scattered around you  you will get a two sentence response like     Sorry to hear you are having trouble  Just know that this is not the usual experience of ZenCity guests    Well good for those other guests  Maybe they can come over and help me wring my dirty clothes into the sink 
397027678293330190,Awesome location with great views of downtown  Awesome place  If I m ever in the area again it ll be my first choice 
396320808364897852,Thank you for hosting my first visit to St  Louis  My son and I enjoyed our stay and will always choose Zen City for future trips there   The temperature was too cold for me and it would ve been nice to be able to adjust the thermostat  Thank you again  Thank you for hosting my first visit to St  Louis  My son and I enjoyed our stay and will always choose Zen City for future trips there   The temperature was too cold for me and it would ve been nice to be able to adjust the thermostat  Thank you again 
395618659632023244,Reviews are accurate  GREAT location  BEAUTIFUL apartment  amazing view  I had the easiest time getting into the building  Parking was no problem at all  However  definitely found multiple types  and strands  of hair on the sheets and pillows  So much so that my   year old son had random hairs in his diaper  I had to lay my own blanket on the bed to sleep on it  and pulled the sheets off before leaving in hopes that would encourage them to put clean ones on for the next guest  I also had to wipe my babys feet off both nights of my stay before bed due to all the dirt that got on him while he crawled on the floor  Still a BEAUTIFUL experience and the view and pool are extravagant amenities  I would definitely stay again  Just be sure to bring extra covers  your own towels  and shoes to wear while you walk around  there is different strands of hair all over the sheets  please just start changing the sheets  people could have had sex on those sheets and a child could be laying in that mess the next day 
395596908058192483,My wife and I took a family trip with our two small children to St  Louis  The place itself is not bad at all and its in a great location  However  it wasnt clean well and we had a particularly negative experience to mention  Our first night there as we were going to bed  I noticed a wet spot on my side  It was not wet on top where the comforter was  it was deep in the mattress and fitted sheet  I smelled it and it was definitely urine  Thankfully  I found a waterproof mattress cover in the closet and put it on  otherwise I would have been on the floor  My wife emailed the rental company that night and they got back with us the following day  They said they would clean the issue and have it taken care of that day  We came back that evening after being gone all day to find new sheets on the bed  However  the urine stain in the mattress had not been clean and was still wet and seeping through the new sheets  We called them back and asked for them to address the issue asap  They told us we could leave and get half off the second night  and still have to pay for the clean fee  but with two little kids and it being late  this was not an option for us  I put the mattress cover back on and we left the next day  I subsequently called their company at least   times and could never get through to a manager  They kept saying they were reviewing our complaints and after about   weeks  they were willing to give us a discount on our stay  The whole experience was quite unpleasant  I do appreciate them ultimately making things right but their communication with guests and ability to address problems is quite terrible 
395592082470553448,My stay would have been great if I was a ale to conduct business as usual during my stay  Not only did I not have Wifi  as listed   but I had to jump through hoops to contact customer service and when I did  they couldn t help  I didn t get a follow up until   am the following morning after sending a message at   pm    Elevator also didn t work so I had to climb up and down   flights of stairs with my luggage My stay would have been great if I was a ale to conduct business as usual during my stay  Not only did I not have Wifi  but I had to jump through hoops to contact customer service and when I did  they couldn t help  I didn t get a follow up until   am the following morning after sending a message at   pm 
394905988166545966,Really easy to contact host  Location is great for visiting downtown for a ballgame  the arch  the Dome  etc  Apartment and building had an odor of smoke  We bought a candle and lit it during our stay and that helped  Kitchen is not fully stocked to be able to really cook a meal  No skillets  cutting board  cutting knives  Just not what we have been used to with Airbnb s  Location was perfect for our needs  Host was easy to contact when we had a problem with check in 
394197845081551002,Biggest frustration is being charged full price after having a delayed check in  when I d asked to get in a bit early  months in advance     Otherwise the place was where it said it d be  relatively clean  Had some broken blinds and a cheap couch  but not a big deal  Value wasn t great   but needed a place to stay in the area and it worked well enough  Biggest frustration is being charged full price after having a delayed check in  when I d asked to get in a bit early  months in advance  
394161655659142143,The elevators in the building can be expected not to work  The entire building is old and unmanaged  The trash by all other residents gets piled up by the only exterior door that works and you have to walk over it to get in the building  There is no parking that is offered by the tenant  The room is hot  one ac unit is not enough  It is close to everything in the central west end  but at the price point  I would have spent a significant amount more to have something nicer or I wouldve been happier in a hotel  I would highly suggest a better clean method  The amount of dirt and dust was outrageous  If you arent going to add an AC unit  I would suggest mentioning that the room can get quite hot  If its going to be the bare apartment that it is  at least have a luxury item so people have some things to overlook  Coffee  coffee pot  some decently comfortable seating  ect 
392749197746024366,Ive been using airbnb for years and this the worst experience Ive had this far   Zencity was absolutely awful at communication   The wifi didnt work and when I asked about it I got multiple different wifi networks with a different passwords every time they responded  none of them worked   I was never able to connect to wifi and missed out on work and money due to this   When I notified them of this and the fact I was filing a complaint they stopped responding completely until they gave me checkout directions   The place smelled like rotten eggs  there was throw up on the wall in the kitchen  and there werent any towels left to shower with   I had to go purchase towels to shower   Awful experience  do not stay here 
391954425536960608,We had a great time staying here in St  Louis  Some minor issues getting checked in  but we got answers pretty quickly and were able to settle in  The apartment was as pictured  The parking garage isn t too far and having the parking space was super great  Parking in downtown is not easy  Seems like the owners are not in town and it creates some mostly minor but annoying issues  Check in was a little tricky with the key box outside and the code on the outside door not working  There are exterior doors on the east and west side of the building and the lock box was on the east side  But walking up from parking garage we went to west doors    The emailed instructions referenced a gravel lot on one side of the building but there isn t a gravel lot  That created some confusion about being at the correct place    The long code for the door lock is annoying    The cleanliness of the shower could use a little attention  One of the lamps was broke  bulb burned out in another and the blinds were broken    We still did enjoy our stay   I m just picky 
391922758897881305,Good  The apartment itself looks just like the pictures  its well stocked in kitchen supplies  and is the perfect amount of space for     people  Messaging response time on Airbnb was quick and the people at Zencity I spoke to were very friendly   Bad  My check in experience was not ideal  The code that I was given for the self service kiosk did not work and when I called the support line  it took    minutes to get resolved  I was on hold first and then had to wait while they remotely unlocked the locker with my key   While communication from Zencity through Airbnb messaging was pretty quick  they did not fully answer the questions I had and I was left without answers or had to repeat my questions   Neutral  There is no guaranteed parking available with this property  I rented a car and was gone for most of the day between   am and   pm  which is when the paid  two hour parking near the property is enforced   For the few hours I did pay for parking in the evening when I got back  parking was cheap and readily available  I parked max   blocks away  and then I was able to leave my car on the street overnight  As another option  there are also parking garages for the hospital nearby but I didnt utilize those options 
391307632070591493,This place was so nice   It was spacious and very clean  The communication was great  We even got a text to let us know the water was shut off in the city  We were out  so it didn t affect us  We really enjoyed our stay  We will definitely use Zencity again  Thanks so much for allowing us to stay at your place  It was spacious and very clean  The communication was great  We even got a text to let us know the water was shut off in the city  We were out  so it didn t affect us  We really enjoyed our stay  Thanks again   The only downfall was microwave did not work the last day there  It was something going on in the breaker box 
505019253142348627,Great location  The tub wasn t clean   lots of hair left in it  Also  there was no mattress pad  We eventually found it folded up in the closet on the last day  but it really needs to be on the bed before guests come 
560144868992035380,he will charge your account for EVERYTHING   still havekey fob becauseIm too uncomfortable to return it    HATED IT   
390498666751800893,Great place to stay  Sorry if I spell this wrong but Teiler at the front desk was the best  Very nice and so helpful always 
389084489076197197,My husband   I had such a great stay here for our first time ever in St Louis  Not only was it a beautiful building   apartment that looks exactly as is in the photos but it s a quick walk in a very safe  beautiful neighborhood to the supermarket  coffee shop  brewery and more  Deff recommend 
389051472470334807,This apartment was in an older building in the Central West End  so some aspects of the building and the unit are somewhat dated  but they did a good job of modernizing the apartment  All in all  the apt came across as advertised  Great location for exploring Forest Park  The apartment itself was nice  I m not sure if I overlooked this in the instructions  but the front entrance to the building was completely under construction so we had to figure out how to use the side way  This wasn t an issue once we found it but might be nice to give people a heads up for the time being  The place was lovely  Thanks 
560137753833391184,I wasn t very happy here  There s a smell in the building and lots of drug deals in the elevators and will take place regardless if you are there or not  The parking location is down a couple blocks and hard to access  There were roaches on the walls and on the cabinets  I sent pictures but no actions were taken and they weren t addressed via phone text or in the app until I followed up  I always have a good reviews so this is a first for me but wanted to let others know  Pretty disappointing overall   The shower head is not secure  there are roaches  I sent pictures  Lots of drug deals and smoking  The door to the patio doesn t have a lock  Seems like someone could drop climb the balcony but maybe that s just me  It was an odd feeling to know it was unlocked though  This was my second multi day stay with Zencity just this month 
423110117557985610,Nice little spot in a great neighborhood of Chicago   It is walking distance to the lake and all the great restaurants and shops of Hyde Park  including Whole Foods  Close to the museum and U of Chicago  There is also a cute little park right outside that is really quiet and serene   The entrance is a little funky so be sure to get dropped off on the Hyde Park Blvd side  This is a really nice apartment to stay for a few days  Thank you for the apartment  There was some confusion about the two entrances as AirBnb lists the address on the Madison Park Entrance  And your instructions listed the other side so we had to walk around with all our luggage  When we got to the room  the code did not work since we had arrived one day late   We were able to call and get reset but it did add a level of stress to the whole check in process    Once we got in  everything was fine and we love the neighborhood 
560111635249235253,No parking and wished the beds had been a  little higher   Great having a washer and dryer   There was a parking lot real close that was reasonable   Location was great  No parking and wished the beds had been a  little higher   Great having a washer and dryer   There was a parking lot real close that was reasonable   Location was great 
560130839131888536,Great location  Great value 
458628238803287594,Nice place  Great location in Hyde Park  Hi    The mattress  was extremely hard  That s why I don t give the  a   star  The internet didn t work but you guys were kind enough to give me access to a different network the last morning I was there  Thank you   The apartment had very small roaches  mainly in the bathroom area 
387683799348861741,Neat historic house  We were only there a short time but the house suited our needs  It was clean and spacious  We enjoyed our stay  All we did was sleep and leave but it was a neat place  Thanks for accommodating us 
767273240,We loved sitting on the front porch  We enjoyed meeting you and your family  and liked your Airbnb house and porch   BTW  Important for you to know that your refrigerator freezes the food   Sally
755916904,Really lovely space  so much character   The windows and dark wood along with all the cute design elements really went a long way   Also the beds are phenomenal  The only issue we had was the bathtub upstairs wouldn t get hot water   We left it running for quite a while but barely got to room temp   Other than that everything was perfect
750342446,All in all  its a great property at a great price in a convenient location   I enjoyed sitting on the big front porch and taking in the neighborhood  Our hosts were accessible and promptly responded to our messages  All in all  its a great property at a great price in a convenient location   Your instructions were clear and detailed   Your handbook on points of interest was very helpful   I enjoyed sitting on the porch and taking in the neighborhood   The upstairs toilet generated weak flushes so we avoided using it  I would have communicated this to you during our stay but Im not technically adept enough to navigate the airbnb app over my mobile phone  All my communications with you have been through my desktop at home   Im    with an arthritic knee and I would have found a handrail for the front porch steps helpful   though I dont know how that would affect the aesthetics of the house   We had three family members to the house on Saturday night for pizza and everyone enjoyed the visit   I would definitely recommend your property to my friends  I dont care about such things  but I read that there would be refreshments in the bedside mini fridge upstairs but it was empty  and there was a circular  residue stain on one of the empty shelves 
764289578,Amazing place to stay  We were sad to leave 
389030193696666278,The apartment was nice and as pictured  It was plenty of space for our group of    Our group included   adults and a   year old and at no point did we feel on top of each other when lounging around the apartment    The issues  there were a couple     The garage card didn t work  We had to push the help button and wait several minutes every time we entered and left the garage  Annoying  but bearable for a weekend stay      We were only given   bath towels for our group of   for the weekend  There were plenty of pillows  sheets and covers  however  bath towels were scarce    Overall  we enjoyed our stay  The building residents we encountered were all quite friendly  The front desk staff was helpful and the location was good for our needs during our stay  The key fob to the garage didn t work  The front desk attendant told us that maintenance would need to reset it but it probably wouldn t happen during our stay  Also  we had a party of   and were only given   bath towels for showering and the pool 
388385545310149985,The place is nice  clean and in a good location   It was hard to sleep at night due to the loud noise at night from neighbors and people downstairs  That s something to be mindful for  Also  parking is not included so you either have to park on the meters or parking garage nearby  We parked at Barnes Jewish Hospital and paid     per night  I would like to suggest offering a parking voucher for the guests or adding it to the cost  We had a child with a wheelchair and it was very inconvenient having to park at quite a distance  We wish that it was included in the description that parking was not included with this property   Another side notes  we found hair on our sheets which made us feel uncomfortable to use them  It made us wonder if the sheets were changed from the previous guests 
388326524414210486,Great place to stay  right down town  Safe neighborhood and place to be 
387694193689147863,One of the best Airbnb s I have stayed in  Great spot in a lovely neighbourhood  a fantastic roof deck and gym   everything you need to enjoy St Louis  and a very efficient team running the listing  Highly recommended 
387659895839564078,We loved our stay in Zencity  Everything was comfortable and clean  I will there might have been a few more items in the kitchen  but we went to the store and bought some staples  Great restaurants within walking distance  We loved our stay in Zencity  Everything was comfortable and clean  I will there might have been a few more items in the kitchen  but we went to the store and bought some staples  Great restaurants within walking distance

770810041,The room was great to stay in  though I had a hard time getting in contact with the host  The front door is currently under construction  not sure for how much longer  so I had to find a side door on my own  The room itself had everything I needed for a single nights stay in St  Louis though  and the location is great for traveling around the city without a car  Hi  I was overall happy with my stay  but a few things stood out to me  It was difficult getting in touch with the host  Ava  I had messaged a couple of times  and received no response   And still havent   The wifi password written in the room and in Avas instructions were incorrect  and I only got the correct password when I received an automated response after messaging Ava about it  Also  there was no mention that the front door to the building was being renovated  so it took me a long time to find the side door entrance  I was glad that the passcode was the same for the side door  but I was frustrated that it took so long 
770576005,We really enjoyed this place  The building does smell like cigarettes and marijuana  but it s not necessarily in the unit itself  The bed was amazingly comfortable  The restaurant downstairs was great and there s a store across the street for snacks or other things you might ve forgot  There s also a parking garage across the street  Overall  we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again  Also  it s only about a    minute walk to the baseball stadium and lots of amazing restaurants there too  We really enjoyed the stay  I appreciate when someone adjusted the thermostat for us  Something to possibly look into  there is a crack in the tub and the light over the sink didn t work  I m not a super picky person so I don t care but thought I d let you know  Also  maybe some plug in air fresheners could help offset the smell of weed and cigarettes from the rest of the building  Overall  the rest was great 
770556033,Spacious and great location to things to see and do  Parking is super secure  Instructions for parking and the door lock weren t very clear  The parking was not explained to me in a way that I understood  It s free if you know how it works  You ll literally be stuck inside the parking garage if you lose the paper ticket that you never even needed if you knew how the parking worked  Instructions could have been provided as the front desk lady was new  The door lock on the door to the unit was confusing when you ve never seen one like that before  The elevators had to be explained by a tenant  The furniture is cheaply made and a couch leg broke off on the first day there  The towel holder in the master bath was already broken out of the wall   Overall very clean but there was some spots on the furniture that I could tell had stuff on them  body fluids idk   Good location and the unit was spacious  The beds and linens were very nice and comfortable  The washer and dryer were convenient and handy 
744984628,we enjoyed our stay in the Hyde Park property   the piano was an unexpected surprise  lovely flowers in the front yard  hi slawik  we enjoyed our stay and it was probably an unusual oversight but closer attention to your clean crew after they finish might be wise   outside garage  washing machine had wet clothes in it  ie dirty freezer and dirty dishes in the oven
743627804,Very nice location and the comfort of home A very very beautiful area I really enjoyed the quietness and the house was just beautiful will love to return in the future
559417839531919963,my car window was smashed n broken into at       in the morning  be careful  my car window was smashed and my car was broken into  so maybe consider having on site parking 
770156625,This place is walking distance to some pretty dope food spots  Pretty central location  not too far from the things you would want to do while in town  Cool place to stay for a short stay in St  Louis  You should really change the air filter in the air conditioner in the room  the air hardly worked and had the room pretty hot  Also pour some draino down the tub because it floods badly while showering  Also fix the lock on the door  using the key was alright in its place but for check in the code not working was a pain 
770134554,Close proximity to everything 
769976170,Clean  great apt  easy check in  and not far from anything in the city  It may be an great idea to up grade the air conditioning unit in apt  It was a little warm even with not units set on    degrees 
769957939,It was a great stay in such a convenient location  Had everything you could want  just be aware of the limitations in parking 
769387453,The  response of host is always quick and the information provided is clear   It is comfortable to stay at this apartment and the condition is also as described  It is a great experience to stay at your place 
768917857,The location was excellent  and the apartment was very well equipped  While I did feel like it was clean  there were dirty areas  and hair in the bathroom floor  This would not have been a dealbreaker for me  The building itself was nice when you walk in  but when we actually got off on the floor there were discarded torn up mattresses right outside the elevator and it looked like a pretty rough place  This could ve just been somebody moving out  but it also had a high smell of marijuana  Not a big deal except that I don t smoke anything and I don t care for the smell  The lobby of the building was lovely though as with the apartment    The communication with the house manager was excellent and the check in process was flawless  The beds were comfortable  and the window unit air conditioners kept the temperature of the place perfect  It was close to everything  Parking was about a block away as stated by somebody else but this was not a big deal for us  We just unloaded everything at the front of the building and then came back down and moved the car without any issue  You will need to go to the room before you park the car in the garage because your parking pass is located inside the room    The kitchen was very well equipped  and I would say this place would comfortably sleep    I would rent from ZenCity again without hesitation  The house was excellent 
768691304,The trip was great  Location was great  Thank you  It was a great trip  We think the app that we were told about  when we called about not being able to get in  should be told about from the beginning  It was easier than typing in the password each time 
768421653,Would recommend and or stay again 
768349281,Overall  our stay was a mixed experience  There are many great things about the unit  It is clean  well decorated  and well stocked with amenities  The location is central and there is great access to street parking  Further  the rooftop patio is wonderful   we ate many meals up there and admired the views of the city and the park  However  there was a very serious issue with our stay  When we turned on the oven  the apartment filled with gas  This not only meant that we were unable to cook  but it was also dangerous  Despite bringing the issue to the host s attention on the first night  it was not resolved at any point during our week long stay  Further  much of the communication we received from the host was irrelevant or unhelpful to solving the issue  We were disappointed with the inability to cook and concerned about safety  but had the issues been resolved we would have recommended the unit with enthusiasm  We really wanted to like this apartment  However  the broken and dangerous oven  alongside the lack of helpful communication and especially the lack of resolution of the issue meant that our stay was significantly negatively impacted  In the future  it is important to test and make sure that the appliances function prior to people coming to stay 
767890671,Very clean and accessible spot  Great parking lot that is safe and protected  Everything you need is pretty much provided in the apartment  Will definitely be back here again when I get the chance
767785983,Perfect Budget Room  Quant  Quiet   Zen centric   More for either quick stops just need a good location and a good nights rest  or the adventurer out and about     of the time  The room is perfect with all the necessities  If youre in town and looking for a room under      I think this would do nicely  Also  if youre not from the area and looking for late night eats  try Hooties Burgers  they do not disappoint   Constructive Feedback  I think the filter on the air conditioner may need to be vacuumed replaced  Some dust accumulates around the corners and crevices of the room  I dont mind  but I think it would definitely up the scorecard so to speak  I also found a few dirty dishes and a cracked glass Maybe plastic instead      Positive Feedback  Perfect budget room  pretty close to most  go to  sights  the buildings property is nice  though dont stray too far in the nighttime  I would definitely recommend longer adventurous stays for anyone in the area 
767423862,the place was amazing and everything I had expected and more  The only issue was  that the washer was not working Hi  Thanks for letting us stay the place was amazing  My only complaint is that the washer was not working
767354019,Very central location and great place to stay  Felt like it was our own home with plenty of space  Easy check in out process Hi Zencity  sending this note separate as we were able to manage the weekend anyway  the white key fob for the garage parking ticket stand was not working  We had to call into the building each time for them to let us out  I still have a   star review as it wasn t a huge issue but just wanted to let you know for the next guests   Everything else was great and exactly what we were looking for 
767272683,We were extremely disappointed by the apartment   It was very dirty and in a substandard condition   The amount of dust and dirt indicated that the apartment had not been properly clean for a substantial period of time   There was a large hole in a bathroom wall where there had been a plumbing repair  but no effort had been made to patch the wall   The blinds were broken and filthy  many of the mirrors are so old that you cannot properly see in them  the carpet is filthy and needs to be replaced  and much of the furniture is extremely worn and dirty   In addition  the pictures posted in the advertising by Zencity are of a different apartment and not this one    The apartment does not have cable as advertised but only offers Roku   The Wifi is problematic as it is often goes out   The only positive is the location of the apartment but this is of little solace  given its condition 
767270194,Great place and stay  Exactly what we expected  Thanks for the stay  If you could add info about the laundry to the listing once it is booked  that might help others in the future  we figured it out but couldnt find any info in the apt or on the listing 
766674561,Awful service  Had to wait over an hour in the lobby as their check in instructions were incorrect  only to get a call back that there was a key at reception to which no one at front desk knew about  Lock didn t work properly for the rest of our stay despite advising Zencity 
766319397,When I came to this location there was a  Condemned Building  sign on the front door   After a little investigation I found out that the unit I was in had been condemned be cause a portion of the buildings exterior fell off   It had since been deemed safe for habitation but the unit right next to mine was condemned and there was construction next to and above my unit   It would have been nice to know this in advance from the host but I got no warning this is the situation I was walking into   I work remote and the sound of construction was loud and not conductive to working and video conferencing     The sign in the unit that said when it was last clean said it had been a few months since it was last clean   Also  when I went to take a shower the water in the bathtub first came out brown  the water would not drain and there was hair from a previous person in the tub   I did not take a shower   I also killed a roach that was crawling near the bed when I woke up in the morning   I communicated this to the host and they relocated and upgraded me to a different location    The upgrade and new location was very nice   However  when I checked in one of the door key codes did not work but the door was open so I assumed it was just an oversight   Unfortunately one day I came back to find that the door was locked and the code that I was given by Zencity was not correct and I had to wait for over an hour to get the proper code from a tenant of the building  Zencity was not able to give me the correct code or send any one out to assist me     Overall this was the worst experience I have had with AirBnB   I would not recommend staying with Zencity   Although they do eventually communicate  it takes too long to get the answers you are asking for to make the trip enjoyable  Both locations were not a clean as I would have liked and the amount of runaround I had to deal with really made this trip more stressful than it should have been 
766297647,We had a great stay  The location is absolutely perfect  it is so close to everything   There is pretty much only metered parking around so know that  There s a laundry machine and dryer but don t forget laundry soap  Nice kitchen and comfy bed and really private  Would return again Had a great stay  good response time 
766226920,LOVED MY STAY  Tysm 
765126443,The location and room was awesome for   people  The biggest hit to the review is that the front door is currently having maintenance and we cannot use it  if it wasnt for two random people  we wouldnt have figured out that you can use the back gate to get in  At       am  that is not fun in St  Louis  Cleanliness was okay  was a lot of dust on floor but nothing bad  The location and room was awesome for   people  The biggest hit to the review is that the front door is currently having maintenance and we cannot use it  if it wasnt for two random people  we wouldnt have figured out that you can use the back gate to get in  At       am  that is not fun in St  Louis  Cleanliness was okay  was a lot of dust on floor but nothing bad 
765009698,Great location and excellent building support at the front desk  Unit was clean and functional and served as a perfect home base for our various plans around the city and within the park  Thanks so much  The stay was great  We were super pleased with the location   it made it very easy for us to get from place to place  Even parking wasn t nearly as difficult as I d feared 
764984880,This apartment was extremely clean and well stocked with paper products if we needed them  Just as pictured  The reserved parking spot in the parking garage is an absolute perk   The apartment building itself was dirty  Only one elevator worked  But the people that live were very nice to us  The apt was super clean and well stocked w paper products if we needed them  The apartment building was sketchy   dirty  Only one elevator worked  There was no rooftop access which was no big deal but should be left out of the description  A secured parking spot in the parking garage was greatly appreciated 
764925287,Remarkable location with access to city  Good location for food within walking  distance  Loved the laundry fitness area and roof top with spectacular views  Parking close at moderate cost  Outstanding staff had issue with security code not activating locking system  Would like to commend Sharon who did a remarkable job assistingwith check in  Bath tub coating peeling in tub  Got message about noise when only viewing television  Were respectful to those around us in same term  a fair cost to pay being unable to view a basketball game  
764922426,Sleek  clean  and modern feeling apartment  Sleeps     perfectly   I m not sure the love seat qualifies for a third to sleep here  The location is close enough to everything we wanted to see   never more than a    minute drive  There s also a nice walking park  microbrewery  and coffee shop a few minutes of walking away  Loved it  The apartment was excellent  close enough to a lot  easy to access and very sleek  Loved it  I would suggest putting signs in the hallway to keep down noise   we didn t notice hallway noise at night in the bedroom  but any noise in the hallway was very loud if you re in the main living space 
764884788,Great airbnb  very spacious and lots of rooms  Thanks again for a great weekend  Very comfortable apartment that was thoroughly enjoyable to stay at  Thanks again for a great weekend 
764836595,All I can say is the furniture was what was in the picture  The place was filthy and in need of proper maintenance   They said they were sending maids  they didnt  The mgmt company is in California and hard to reach  does not flow up like they said  Listing is wrong with amenities  parking  etc  Im wondering who wrote the ad  if they have ever even visited the place    it was just the worst AirBnB 
764485926,     worth the stay  Very stylish spot  I was very pleased with my stay  Id love to stay with you guys in the future 
764414605,Great stay  Very detailed instructions and everything was easy to manage  The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed  We felt very safe and would stay here again  We loved it here  It was perfect for us  Our only complaint was the inability to cool the place down  It didn t matter for one of the days because the weather got cold  but the other days it was really hot 
764285719,The location of this apartment was excellent   Right by shops and restaurants  which was great  Close to Forest Park  which is beautiful  And the streets around are just beautiful  The reason I m leaving   stars rather than    the apartment wasn t as clean as it should be  especially during a pandemic   the carpets were visibly not vacuumed  the host offered to have the clean crew come in and do them during our stay  but we declined that offer  preferred no one come in while our belongings were there   but no other negotiation was offered  Communication is the other reason  it seems this is a property management group and so when they respond it s not always the same person and then they respond in a way that isn t related to what you first wrote  Lastly  the value isn t there   I sadly hadn t checked sooner  but some of the beautiful hotels by the arch were the same rate as this Airbnb  and frankly I would have chosen a nice clean hotel had I known 
763826154,for three nights it rained while I was in this Airbnb and because of the rain I really couldnt get out and enjoy the attractions around the city  the Airbnb television did not work the first night had to text and ask for someone to fix the television which wasnt fixed till the next day  and that really wouldnt be a problem if this wasnt portrayed as a five star establishment type Airbnb       for three nights not worth it  not worth it at all  then when I finally did get the television to work the next day at      in the afternoon I get a call from ZinCity telling me that someone was complaining about the music being too loud LOL now there is no external speakers in this hotel room I was only listening to the music on the television that was broken the day before  and due to the fact that I cant get out the apartment and enjoy the attractions Im listening to music in the apartment at      in the afternoon and someone complain       for three nights  again definitely not worth it stay away from this place unless youre an old couple coming to see a Cardinals game LOL for you guys to be charging as much as you do to stay in this Airbnb you need to accommodate a little more and be a little bit more open to people listening to music at      in the afternoon  we thought this was an Airbnb not a nursing home
763816725,The pictures come from another Zencity s listing and do not match this apartment  but it is a great one  The location is perfect   close to everything  It s clean and spacious enough for    The decor is industrial style  The only downside is that the bathroom is really small for over   people  and there are signs of wear and tear on the walls  Plus the wifi does not work sometimes  I hope Zencity could update the pictures and I would recommend it 
763786337,Great place and great location   Being across Forest Park was awesome  we really enjoyed that  as well as having restuarants  coffee shops and a Whole Foods within walking distance  everything was great   Thanks a lot and would love to stay here again   Thank you for everything  It was a great stay  woul dlove to come back soon    Great location    Good communication   I would only recommend to have the carpets washed   they are quite dirty  especially the one in the living room  Our overall stay was great   Thanks again   
763442983,This place was clean  had an amazing location and a great price   I had a few critiques  but would still stay there again   The bed linens smelled of BO when we arrived   We quickly stripped the bed  comforter etc when we arrived and threw them in the washer which is provided in the apartment   This took care of the smell  Note on the electronic  you need to pull on the door when unlocking and locking so that the deadbolt locks flush into the door frame   Even with these critiques  I would happily stay here again   You can t beat the value and location   The Bordeaux building is nice and just a short walk to several restaurants  breweries  etc   and a short drive to major attractions such as City Museum  Zoo  Downtown  etc Great overall value  I just wanted to mention a few things   The bed linens reeked of BO   We had to strip the bed and pillow cases and wash them shortly after arriving   The thermostat would not let us heat the apartment when it was a cool night   Lastly  you have to pull on the door when leaving the apartment so the electronic lock will deadbolt flush into the lock and same when you re unlocking   Even with these critiques  it was a great stay 
763409831,Highly recommend  This place was amazing  It s safe  doorman   a great location  next to forest park and a few min walk to the center of CWE   has incredible amenities  a gym  game room  study area  etc    and the room itself was perfect for two people  The only negative is that I was woken up a few nights by the sirens going off near Barnes Jewish Hospital  Super minor though  Overall was wonderful and I d return in a heartbeat  Thanks so much  The place was amazing  All the amenities and the view  etc   The only bummer is that I was woken up every night by the sirens going off near Barnes Jewish Hospital  Nothing you can do about that though haha  It overall however didn t trump the full experience   
763363151,Very upscale units with cleanliness and amenities an obvious priority   Lovely neighborbood surrondings and conxenietlyocated to everythng Redponse time for emergencies needs improvement and hallway area needs more attention due to heavy traffic  Less tenant requireme ts when emervency situatkons habe been communicated clearly 
763081110,This place was exactly as photographed  It was very clean and comfortable  The only reason I didn t give   stars is because of the parking  You are provided a parking pass to park in the garage for free  The only thing is the garage is a block away  The   Bird  scooters are very handy for those trips the garage  Also  if you like warmer hot showers  run it a little early  it takes a while for the water to warm up  Otherwise  this place was perfect for me 
762863724,I had a terrible experience with Zencity  Our shower was clogged for days and my family wasn t able to shower  They took forever to respond and had the audacity to try to charge me an extra      at the end of my stay  DO NOT stay here  You are so inconsiderate having the audacity to charge me      even when our shower was clogged for days and you didn t respond in a prompt manner 
762621025,Living space itself was well kept  Unfortunately when we went the neighbor was being evicted and had apparently left things in their apt  next door to rot   The smell was horrible and seeped into this Airbnb as well  Location is on the rough side of town  even when I asked for directions we were warned away and while waiting to use the entrance call box we were told by other residents not to stay out late in the area  This in conjunction with the parking space being at the other end of the block led us to cancel our stay 
762574982,This place is so homie and comfy  Super close to many restaurants and a whole foods  There netflix and other streaming services available  The shower is amazing and the bed is super cozy  Since it is downtown the parking is kinda hard to find during the day but at night it is fine  Definitely will be booking again the next time I come 
762547225,None The washer needs to be leveled it bangs into the wall while operating 
558759779673315896,Clean
762260324,Perfect apartment for two  Great location  just a short walk from Busch Stadium for our Cubs game  Would recommend this spot for a St Louis weekend getaway  Thank you  We had a great stay 
762250567,This apartment is a great find  It places you in a part of town that looks sketchy at first  but I had no problems  They provide parking in a private parking garage half a block away  The building the apartment is located in doesnt leave the best first impression  but the apartment itself is fantastic  The noise and smell of the building stops at the door  and you will get a private  quiet stay in this very well kept apartment  The folks at Zencity are attentive and provide very clear instructions for your stay  I would book here again if given the chance  Thanks again for an easy check in and stay 
761790154,This apartment was a good spot to stay in Downtown STL if youre going to Busch Stadium for some games  The one downside  and it was a big one  is that guests are not allowed to use the thermostat  If you want the temperature adjusted  you have to send a message thru Airbnb to Zencity and they will adjust it for you if they see the message  It didnt always happen  and it was really frustrating  particularly in the middle of the night   Also  be aware that this host is a large company  so various people will be responding to your messages without reading the whole thread first  It gets a bit tedious having to repeat yourself several times   Aside from that  the apartment was lovely and very spacious  Free parking was a huge plus 
558747111390131412,Very clean   spacious Great space very clean   spacious
761570837,Expect only a bed to sleep in and cool coffee table books   No customer service  no salt  pepper  coffee  inadequate soaps   Dont do it  The customer service with Zencity was vastly inconsistent with the usual customer service of AirBnBs  it was absent   I could not reach a person by phone and when using the phone prompts was cut off   There was no response to email messaging  When we entered until we left   days later the place held a mysterious sickly sweet odor  even with the window open all day   There were none of the amenities which would make the kitchen or bathroom really liveable   No salt and pepper  no coffee or tea  and only enough soap and shampoo for one shower   The coffee table books belied the quality and usual  but lacking  warmth of an AirBnB   I would not consider staying there again   BTW   after many dozens of stays globally  Ive never been so disappointed 
761535250,Good location  good communication however the shortcomings were that the a c was very loud  sounded like a plane taking off  and we were disappointed to see soap scum on the inside shower curtain which made us suspect to the cleanliness of the flat  And  the      night attracted me but with all the fees added it turned out to be      night which is comparable to many of the nice hotels in the area the future I will probably just stay at a hotel  The shortcomings were that the a c was very loud  sounded like a plane taking off and we were disappointed to see soap scum on the inside shower curtain which made us suspect to the cleanliness of the flat 
761031557,Great place   fantastic location close to CWE center  There are several great restaurants nearby   Place is pretty well equipped for limited breakfast cooking reheating meals   Be aware there are a few stairs in the courtyard and is       flights of stairs to the unit   Our elderly parents found them a bit tiring  Thank you  Great location   Suggestions  info about TV channels  Keurig coffee maker would be nice   More bath products too   Also notes about stairs   We had elderly people who had some trouble with several up down flights of stairs
760666484,Great location in CWE near Forest Park    Nice set up for a family    Apartment dated Hi ZenCity staff   We frequently stay in your properties in the Central West End area in St  Louis   This unit is definitely is in the worst condition of all the other properties we ve stayed in  like Parc Frontenac and Montclair   The place was filthy   A maid arrived on day    of our stay   No lights worked in the kitchen  including refrigerator   It took   days for maintenance man to replace bulbs   The apartment is in desperate need of a paint job   once the gaping holes in the bathroom and elsewhere are repaired    I won t give this a terrible public review  although it s definitely warranted    I generally like staying in ZenCity properties 
760652666,If you are looking for an easy  quick check in  THIS IS NOT THE PLACE  We got in late  were met with a code that did not work  and were unable to reach anyone through the number listed  The parking a is a   minute walk from the apartment building and the address is not accurate  In addition  bathroom and kitchen floors were sticky  However  if you don t care about any of that it is a convenient location  Some suggestions     Make the check in process less complex  We had difficulty with one of the codes working and therefore had to call  twice  with no response   In addition  the address of the entrance is not clear   address was on Olive St but actual entrance was not     Improve communication  We were unable to reach anyone when we had difficulty with check in  The number given brought us to an automated machine which was extremely unhelpful  especially at       at night      Provide a very explicit warning that the parking is a   minute walk from the place     improve clean  Shower floor and kitchen floor felt sticky
760356985,Great place in walking distance to anywhere downtown  Thank you so so much 
760154441,It was ok  Place had somewhat of a musty smell 
558008774742620608,Nice place
760126776,very easy to get in no problems great location enjoyed the stay had a great time the worker was very nice and I had no trouble with the wifi I would say u might want to think about adding a TV in the bed room the living was great but I do like to watch TV while in bed after driving
760123968,The room and location were great  Easy check in process  and the bed is extremely comfortable   My only issue in staying here was other Airbnb guests   there was somehow a mix up with the rooms and when I arrived  someone was already staying in my room  From what they explained  the couple had stayed previously and didn t follow their new instructions to the next room they booked  So instead I was put in what was suppose to be their room  but felt a little uncomfortable about the situation since I was able to get into the room with the information I was sent   All and all it was a wonderful stay despite the confusion  and I didn t have any problems after getting it resolved with the host 
759622555,Very nice stay  the parking lot is down the road a block or so which wasn t an issue for me 
759334441,The apartment is perfect in all ways  A separate bedroom from the living room with a great bed    comfortable pillows and air conditioning  Plenty of extra towels  While we didnt use it  the kitchen is fully equipped  The living room is spacious and cable TV with lots of channels is available  The WiFi is very high speed The location couldnt be better  Its across the street from Forest Park and a few hundred yards from Whole Foods  Restaurants are nearby within walking distance or a very short Uber drive  its in an upscale building with    hour lobby door service manned by a knowledgeable  friendly person  Its   star in our opinion and we will try to get it again on our next visit to St  Louis  The apartment was perfect in all ways  The only suggestion I have is in the instructions  say to leave the key FOB on the hook next to the apt  door  not on the table  
759216199,This location feels incredibly safe  There is someone at the door at all times and you must have your key fob to ride the elevator  The apartment looks exactly as advertised  The only downside was the floors were sticky from mopping and the bathroom walls needed a good wipe down because there is no fan to run while you shower  All in all we would stay here again 
759097748,Great location  very clean  very safe  The Zencity team is also very helpful   the response time is quick  Thanks so much for providing a clean   safe place to stay  And thank you the quick response time  The only issue that may need some attention is the parking garage  It s very hard to get in   out of  I think it may have to do with the card 
757803779,Very nice space in a great location in CWE   Surrounded by great restaurants and bars  Very nice place and a great location   Having lived in STL for the past   years and returning for graduation over a   day stay   this place was a prime location at a great price   It was a perfect sized place for a short stay for someone like myself   Also  the bedding was amazing   I tried to find the brand but was unable to   Could you provide me with those details    That would be much appreciated   Thanks again for the great stay 
757589891,Everything was awesome   and I loved the location  Such a beautiful neighborhood  The apartment was incredibly styled and very chic and modern  The check in directions were smooth and we were so close to everything we wanted to see and do  Would definitely come back  Loved everything  Id just consider a new spout for the bathroom faucet  Its too short and the water gets everywhere  They are relatively cheap and will make a ton of difference for guests experience 
757539015,Positives   Great location  walking distance to many restaurants and barnes jewish hospital  for those who work there   Blackout curtains  comfortable bed   Negatives    Only street parking is available and you can only pay for two hours at a time so I received several parking tickets   Unit was dusty when I arrived but I also checked in a day late and the AC was on so it could ve just been the air filter   Almost halfway through my stay my washer broke and when I reached out to the host  my initial message went unread ignored so I had to follow up few more times to finally get a response  The maintenance request took a few days to be addressed  but then it broke again  The second time the maintenance guy came by  he said there was a major leak so I should not use it  This is extremely inconvenient bc I stayed a little over two weeks and I was unable to do laundry at all including my work scrubs  So by the time I checked out  I had to travel with a bag of dirty laundry to my new destination
757352525,This Place Is Well Worth It  I really enjoy myself and I  Cook a nice Breakfast and I  Was well relax  Thank you for the Stay  I really enjoy myself  
757335244,It was hard getting in   out of this place   Oh   they only gave us one key card for   ppl  by the way it was super cold   Only have access to one tv   Well at least it was really clean Only one tv in living room   one key card for multiple guests  It s hard to get in   out of the parking area as well     it was really cold
528977330251669909,Amazing location and space  Highly recommended  Will stay there again without question  Thanks for the amazing space  My family loved everything about it  One thing  we broke one of the plastic towel hooks in the master bedroom bathroom door  Would definitely want to stay there again the next time we are in Kansas City 
407208650886998896,This is a great studio apartment  Fully equipped with a gas range and oven  microwave  full size fridge with freezer  hardwood throughout  Very nice place for a stay  especially if one is doing work at U Chicago  Dear Zen   Wonderful stay  Thank you for being so hospitable and accommodating to my needs  You guys did an excellent job   The only thing I wanted to let you know is that I had was two repairmen came by while I was there  One to look at the oven and one to look at the apartment in general  I didn t think anything of it until later on when I was leaving I realized that they may not have been repairmen     That does not affect my experience at all  You really have a great team and I felt safe and comfortable at the property for the entire month  I did my best to clean  I left unopened food for the next person  Th  AC unit works wonderfully well  Everything was great and I hope to stay with Zen again    Peace   Brian
557300919941477671,It s was great everything in the pictures are accurate  The bed was sooo soft      I will return It s was Great and the bed was soooo soft       
757335179,Very clean apartment as advertised Secure Parking is a block away and you cannot park there until you ve entered the apartment to pick up the key FOB that allows you to access the parking 
757315328,Una estancia muy agradable  cerca del arco en St Luis Misuri   muy limpio y me encanto tener el servicio de lavander a    Gracias  Zencity  nuestra estancia en tu departamento fue muy agradable    es como llegar a casa  seguro que volveremos   
557261918449545002,Zencity is really nice  Studio is pretty perfect and ideal also a great bang for your buck  No complaints    Hey there  the place was absolutely amazing  I really have no complaints but just a note that the bathroom sink pressure is pretty weak but other than everything was great 
757313147,Nos encant  el departamento   Vistas muy lindas al parque   Esta todo a minutos caminando  Para nosotros fue clave que estuvi ramos a   minutos del hospital  Todo limpio  y muy bonito  Cocina con todo lo que uno necesita  hervidor de agua  tostador  platos  fuentes  etc  Toallas y sabanas extra   Lavander a aparte y de pago  Los conserjes siempre dispuestos a ayudarte   De verdad que fue una buena elecci n          recomendable Todo muy bien  El departamento es incre ble  muy c modo y tiene todo lo que uno necesita   De verdad fue un acierto haberlo arrendado  Lo  nico fue el tema del WIFI  fueron   d as con problemas  pero lo solucionaron 
757121334,The unit was clean and comfortable  The location is fabulous  Both of those things made my stay great  But don t expect much in the way of amenities  This is a step up from a hotel room  Although there is a full studio kitchen  oven  range  microwave  dishwasher  you should not plan to do much cooking unless you bring most everything else with you  Still it s a great place to stay for a weekend in the trendy Central West End  The unit was clean and comfortable which I definitely appreciated  The location was fabulous as I was hiding my son  his wife and their infant daughter and the literally live next door  But the kitchen was woefully under equipped  A bowl or two for mixing foods would have been nice  While I didn t  expect a full complement of spices even salt and pepper  which the description indicated would be present  was missing  Also  not everyone makes coffee in a French press  Trendy yes  But a drip coffee maker would have been very much appreciated 
757079951,Great apartment in a great location  Wifi was a real struggle but outside of that no issues Wonderful place   Thank you 
756792200,This apartment is exactly as pictured  It was stocked full of amenities ie  pots  pans  plates  salt   pepper  kitchen utensils  extra towels  extra linens  seriously anything you could think of that you might possibly need was there  Great property and a great location  Will definitely stay again if I m ever back in St  Louis  The check in process was easy and they even accommodated and early check in for us  Thank you for accommodating an early check in for us  We appreciate it  I do think communication could have been a bit better  but other than that we had a great stay and would stay again   
492076905720016384,We loved our stay  I d definitely recommend it   plan to stay here again in the future  Very spacious   open apartment  Very close to wonderful restaurants   easy to take the bus   the blue line from there  It was lovely  Thank you so much  It was lovely
756779119,Really enjoyed my visit to this property  Wonderful location in Soulard  awesome amenities  and comfortable environment  Street parking was not an issue at all  Would happily stay here again in the future  Thanks so much for the wonderful place to stay it was perfect for my short visit home to see family 
756762522,Comfortable  clean and the location is great  Thanks  it is a really nice studio 
756727880,Very clean   Super location to shops  parks  and more  Just a bit pricey 
449260907580329729,great apartment the smell of the construction was obnoxious and the chemical smell was enough to make me pass out and the pool was under construction which is the whole reason why I booked the apartment in the first place
756703914,This place was incredible and clean great location definitely worth it and will be back
756657515,It was great  Very much Enjoyed and felt like home each time we entered   Thank you  It was an amazing stay  I would say check up on the hot  warm water supply sometimes when we would shower it would be cold for a long period of time and we would have to choice but to take cold showers
756628815,Beautiful apartment building and great location  We loved everything about our stay other than lack of communication when something went wrong  A very beautiful apartment to stay in while visiting St Louis  However  the lack of communication on the hosts part is the reason for   stars  We didn t sleep at all the first night due to the fire alarm going off and no one came to fix it or even attempted to  When we asked for a discount or free stay for our uncomfortable first night we never got a response  I find that quite unprofessional especially seeing as how it was an apartment complex 
756595826,Please read  If you like beautiful  neat and clean surroundings  this unit will disappoint  I could never recommend this place to anyone at the price I was charged for three nights  I stayed Thursday  th Sunday  th  so I got the weekend rate at      night in addition to the other three fees which brought my total to nearly       Allow me to tell you what I received for        There is no parking  so you have to park on street  We are fine with this  You have to enter three codes to get into the apartment  The second door requires a bit of force to get open   all the while it s buzzing annoyingly loudly    Upon entering  there is an awful stench  In the living room  the couch is horribly stained and the pillows flat and lifeless  My sister was going to sleep there but I wouldn t allow it  so I slept with my mom and let my sister take my room we were four total   This was not the plan for sleeping arrangements and was a major inconvenience to me  The blinds are almost all bent and broken   something we have never allowed in our homes  There are also no curtains  on any of the windows  There was tissue inside the second toilet and a jacket hanging on the chair in the first room  The back room door is broken and you can see inside the door  There is no lock and the door does not shut   The oven is so dirty and black with burnt food that wasn t scrubbed away for months  The kitchen trash can  fridge door  and stove tops were not wiped down properly  The floors were not properly clean  There were ants all over the apartment and mainly were seen in the kitchen around the sink and behind the toaster    The shower curtains were not clean  Both were stained and one of them had a spot of what appeared to be blood  The master bath soap dish in the shower had soap residue in it  the tub drained slowly and the sink drained even more slowly    The paint job on the walls is unacceptable  It bleeds onto the baseboards  The walls are also very dirty  Like someone with dirty hands touched them and no one bothered to wipe it off  There is also an uneven texture to the walls  It s not aesthetically pleasing in the least bit  Where the wall meets the floor  there is another lining that is not true base boarding  and it s falling apart and full of what appears to be wood dust    I have taken pictures of everything and will be in touch with the Resolution Center about the lack of cleanliness and poor condition of the apartment  I was mainly in communication with Alejandro and he gave me the runaround for three days and I was completely ignored for an entire day  He offered to send a cleaner over on Saturday at  pm and we were scheduled to leave the next morning at  am  We also had already clean and there was no point  I am pursuing a partial refund  which the  team of managers  has so far agreed to refund the     clean fee  We left the apartment clean and used our own sheets  Hopefully the apartment gets more than a ten minute clean job before the next guest  Please refer to past messages and read my full review  I ll put everything there  I m disappointed in the communication  I was clear and asked to have a productive discussion so we can handle matters in private  You all are well aware of what the unit looks like  so I was hoping for an honest discussion  but here we are   I complained because your unit is sloppily painted  the only couch is stained with God knows what  and your broken blinds have not been replaced  etc  Barely anything has been done to keep this unit aesthetically appealing for guests    My family and I all live in very beautifully decorated homes and the furniture is always clean  dusted and we would never leave up broken or bent blinds  This was upsetting and embarrassing to walk into  I ve lived in a historic home before and I ve visited dozens upon dozens as I am from Charleston  SC and many homes downtown are very old  but they are charming and beautifully renovated and kept up  so there is just no excuse    I feel you re attempting to get away with doing as little work as possible and it shows  It s carelessness  I will be sending in all pictures and pursuing the refund I requested 
756589907,Clean and Stylish place close to St Louis Arch    Thank you so much    
756173933,Nice clean place in a great community   No Automatic coffee make  just a french press  An automatic coffee maker would have been nice over the french press 
755891372,Didnt check in until    pm    A M  before able to retire for the night  Only to be rudely woken by a representative of Zencity  asking me to confirm a   A M  check out at      the next morning  Calling back to back until I answered   i did not leave the room after entering the apartment  I paid for a room to shelter and rest after an   hour drive and a    a m  photo shoot that i needed to be well rested for in a room I purchased the until    A M   Please consider another BnB service if rest  respect and  appreciation for yourself and traveling companions is a priority   Didnt check in until    pm    A M  before able to retire for the night  Only to be rudely woken by a representative of Zencity  asking me to confirm a   A M  check out at      the next morning  Calling back to back until I answered   i did not leave the room after entering the apartment  I paid for a room to shelter and rest after an   hour drive and a    a m  photo shoot that i needed to be well rested for in a room I purchased the until    A M   Please consider another BnB service if rest  respect and  appreciation for yourself and traveling companions is a priority    id like compensation for the inconsiderate treatment as a guest of Zencity  
755838674,You will enjoy staying at the Bordeaux  It is conveniently located near everything you would want to do in downtown St  Louis  Once you cross the bridge  the neighborhood is beautiful and quiet  doesn t even feel like you re in downtown   Everything is as pictured  Thanks for allowing us to stay  This was an incredible place 
755628143,Very dirty found blood  and pee stains on beds  Blood spots on all sheets   the  new  sheets in the closet There was a hole in the wall and owner asked for permission to have the maintenance guy in the room and I said no but came back to the room and the hole in the wall was patched 
755614273,right next to CWE and forest park  easy in and out  parking is the only slight issue since its street metered but other than that  happy stay  I appreciate the stay  Only issues I had was the internet not being available and having to troubleshoot and then the bathroom seemed to have some black stuff kind of growing on the shower  could have been a stain but Im not sure  nice place 
755575747,Good location  Tight quarters  One or two people only  Late ish check in is very convenient  Hi      Either a hidden air odorizer or very smelly clean products was used and the smell was overwhelming     The instructions to enter was emailed to my personal email and not included in the airbnb communication  That was unexpected so I couldnt locate them  It made it difficult to get in       Rug needs to be replaced or at least clean washed     Needs new blinds or shades 
755096202,I m usually pretty flexible with Airbnb s and understand and don t rate very harshly  But I found this place disappointing  There was no hot water  and I was on a work trip for one night and needed a shower  that s pretty unacceptable     the floors were all super sticky  and just dingy overall    I shot them a message asking a question  and they didn t respond until after I had already checked out  After all fees this place wasn t worth       it s like a hotel room  but worse and the same price  Sorry
557246666057227065,The only downfall was the parking  Wish there was designated parking especially for longer stays  The place was the perfect size for everything  We loved it  Would stay there again for sure    As a side note  the dryer was very noisy  The only downfall was the parking  Wish there was designated parking especially for longer stays  The place was the perfect size for everything  We loved it  Would stay there again for sure    As a side note  the dryer was very noisy 
755066935,Everything was nice just like the pictures  The place is beautiful  Zencity responded in a nice timely fashion  The only thing was the shower had hair on the wall and a used face towel was in the caddy when we arrived  The tube was clogged and we had to stand in dirt   We told Zen and they apologized but maintenance was only able to come after our stay  The bathroom wasnt thoroughly clean     well the shower that is  everything else seemed fine we used our own sheets though  Nice stay The bathroom wasnt really clean  Took while for us the find the door but it  was fairly easy to check in The bathroom shower had hair on the wall and a face towel in the shower caddy when I arrived  The tube was clogged 
754788453,Great location and perfect  for me and my companion   Would definitely stay here again  Thanks for making this stay so easy  u would definitely  recommend  Zencity to others in the future 
754782132,Great place would definitely stay there again  Close to everything  Secure place looks really nice Another key card would be great  Especially wen you have more than one guest
754281480,Place was great for the price  To be honest  would not recommend for working professionals  Very noisy building especially on weekends  If not traveling for work and if you are a night owl  perfectly fine  Lots of parties   loud music  NOT the host s fault at all  Just being honest about the atmosphere  Place is beautiful and spacious and has everything you need  Decent but not the cleanest  Sticky cupboards  hair on floor  greasy streaks on tables  Lots of downtown activity
556558730880720002,I ll definitely recommend this stay clean   nice   comfy     I loved my stay    Highly recommended
555815755204177830,Nice comfortable space  good locations  Definitely would stay again   Thank you all I enjoyed the stay  
442677700977502888,I have stayed at a few units by Zencity in this building  From time to time I work in KC  The units themselves are nice  The number one grievance is the check in process  They will tell you to type a code into an intercom  The system has never worked in my past three stays over several months  Other guests have also had issues  You have to wait for the kindness of a resident at the building to get you into the building and up the elevator    Once you are in the apartment  you get a keycard or fob and that gets you where you need to go for the rest of your trip 
754222280,close to everything in st louis a little expensive
754126916,This location was great   Cute   cozy  Easy access to the building and within minutes from attractions downtown    The host informed me that parking was not selected  but it was a     minute walk to a nearby parking garage and plenty of street parking  I definitely will stay again when I m in the area  Thank you for a great stay  Everything was clean and in order  however that trash in the restroom had not been emptied prior to our arrival  Not a huge deal at all  I appreciate it 
753660702,Fantastic location  nice apartment for a quick getaway  Could have used some better communication but all in all a good place to stay if you want to explore St Louis and especially the Central West End 
438318942691798679,This place has a beautiful view and is nice and clean  The building has some nice features like a quick shop open    hrs  We had a great stay  having a bathroom off each bedroom and huge advantage  wonderful view too Thanks for everything 
435489463626337890,A great value  Good  clean spot for a good rate  BUT communication is nonexistent  Check in was enabled by a resident who let us into the building  Without a random passerby  you will NOT be able to enter the building    The sink faucet in the bathroom aggressively sprays water and the sink doesn t drain  We used the kitchen sink to wash our faces  No reason to contact the host  though  as I m pretty certain the inbox is unmonitored 
753653897,Great Studio apartment  Within walking distance of plenty of landmarks 
753389692,Very clean  great location and alot of hospitality  I loved the place  this is my  nd stay with Zencity  This will be my go to place whenever im in town 
753381543,This is a spacious  light filled apartment with a tasteful  minimalist feel to the furnishings and decor  The bed is as hard as a rock   Im used to a firm mattress  so I would guess this one is extra firm  If youre a stomach or side sleeper  you may want to bring some kind of pillow crate topper with you  Unlike other reviewers  we found the WiFi in this apartment to work great  The big surprise for us was the ongoing construction on the property  which meant jackhammers right outside our window  the apartment is on the  nd floor  all day  every day  starting at      in the morning  The construction has been going on since January of this year and  according to the front desk staff  is expected to go on at least another month or two  If you plan to be out of the apartment during the daytime  this wont be a problem for you  If you plan to rest or do remote work and online meetings during the day  you may need to find another space for that  The front desk staff told us about the WiFi Lounge on the   th floor  which was helpful and had a beautiful view of Forest Park  The rooftop deck is also beautiful and is a nice place to get away from noise  though if you need WiFi  it wont be a place to get work done   The front desk staff was very helpful and very friendly  and the building was safe  clean  and in a perfect location for access to the hospital  the park  and the great dining spots in the CWE 
752666822,Beautiful   bedroom loft style  great location  I would highly reccomend 
752663152,Perfect location   Space was clean for the most part and decor was simple  The bed is SUPER comfortable  the couch not so much  Love the Whole Foods across the street and there are numerous restaurants and bars within walking distance  Metrolink station is close as well as  Forest Park  The dryer sounds like it is going to fall apart  Took a minute to receive key pad code  otherwise it was good  There were some dirty spots throughout  nothing too bad  but noticeable 
434802452466556430,There were A LOT of stains on surfaces  i e  the curtains   one of the sconces in the bedroom was broken  the blinds in the bedroom were broken  the kitchen faucet handle was broken  there was NO cold water  closet doors were off their track  we could not change the thermostat for the whole apartment  only able to control a window unit  and ended up having to have the bedroom window open just to keep at a decent temperature  There were A LOT of stains on surfaces  i e  the curtains   one of the sconces was broken  the blinds in the bedroom were broken  the kitchen faucet handle was broken  closet doors were off their track  and the fact that we could not change the thermostat for the whole apartment was absolutely ridiculous  We had to have the bedroom window open just to keep at a decent temperature  FIX YOUR PROPERTY
434687448089262106,Such an amazing view and amazing amenities  It was the perfect place for catching up with friends and still having TONS of space  The security guards were incredibly friendly and a big help in planning our trip  The free trolly train has a stop infront of the building at the Library making getting around super easy  Thanks so much for the stay  Loved the view and the design 
752470893,The location of the place was great  The style was fine  but I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the place   floor  bedding  rug  and couch  The host didn t respond to my questions at all  but only sent out generic messages regarding booking confirmation and check in info  I found some hair in the bedding  The floor doesn t seem like it s been mopped thoroughly  I only received generic messages regarding booking and check in  Other questions were not addressed at all 
752457962,This place is AMAZING  The host responds promptly  Upon entry  I immediately wanted to extend my stay  if it werent for work   The place was clean  open  and had everything that was recorded in the reservation  Located just outside downtown St Louis  there are great views and perfect local shops  restaurants  and bars  The pics of the place and surrounding area dont even do this place justice   it is pure beauty    In regards to previous comments of cleanliness   is there a corner that was missed  Sure  Dont nit pick when on vacation  Smell  its not a bad smell  Towels  theres a washer and dryer if you absolutely NEED clean towels every day    The location is safe  Gated parking lot  fab key entry  Other residents were friendly  This is the perfect place for a weekend getaway    star across the board  Do NOT pass on this place  Thank you for an AMAZING stay  Your place was BEYOND expectations  I would have extended my stay if it werent for work  This has been one of the best AirBnBs Ive had  I will recommend      over 
752430655,Lovely space  so fun to walk around and explore food and coffee shops nearby  We enjoyed it and it was a perfect   day stay in st Louis 
752392313,First I was a bit upset after I had rented this place for      a night and then see after I had rented it that the price had dropped down to     a night  i have screen shots     The location of the building was not in the location of the map provided  Was in a bad part of town which lots of gun shots were heard  If there was not a private parking lot I probably would not have stayed there   Building reeked of pot smoke all the time  I thought it was a non smoking building  People who had dogs allowed them to go to bathroom on the roof top patio  Nice seeing dog turds on the fake grass   The last night we stayed there which was a Monday night  Young folks had a party on the roof right above us that went until     am   Blaring music and screaming  In the morning the patio was littered with beer cans and wine bottles   The place was clean as advertised 
430385495574600846,Amazing location  Host was great  Would definitely recommend if visiting KC  Thank you so much  Your awesome  Appreciate the great stay 
752154555,This is basically a clean  nicely staged vacant apartment   There are none of the personal touches or amenities I have become accustomed to experience with AirBnB   No insider guide of where to go for food or recreation   If one was staying here for a week or more  one would be able to exist   but you would have to buy pots and pans to cook   There are plates and silverware  but no sponge  dishcloth or cookware in the apartment   It did the trick for a short trip  and for someone from NYC  the apartment was spacious   From now on  I will look for individuals who host their place There is a foul smell in the building   First it was on the   th floor  smelled it through my mask  and then in the lobby   Check in   well  late at night  I could not see where to enter a combination and the instructions never mention how to make the numbers appear or that one has to also press the   sign after the passcode   Thanks for leaving a coffee carafe  would have been nice to have coffee and or cream on hand   No dishwashing liquid  or sponge to clean dishes 
752126973,Well designed  comfortable  and well situated  If you expect to watch TV  you MUST BRiNG with you any access codes to the apps shown on the TV otherwise you will be unable to watch TV  We did not know this  Whoever designed the redo of this apartment did a terrific job  I love the simplicity and comfort  Were it my place  I would take a paintbrush to the baseboard area of the bathroom  as well as to an area just above the towel rack where one can see the grime that the new paint must be covering  Also suggest you consider hanging two towel racks horizontally to the right of the kitchen sink  The WiFi did not work which caused me to use up virtually all of our data plan remaining over the next       weeks  I let them know the evening we arrived for our three night stay  it seemed that some clean gals came by late the next afternoon  but nothing was remedied  It would have been helpful to have had a phone number to reach a support person  I would have said they were excellent  but when we had a problem with wifi  it was inadequate 
752105761,Great location  comfortable bed  stylish space   Would stay again any time 
752025623,Very nice  and stylish  Was a very nice place 
751951119,Honestly wont book with Zencity again   The room was not clean very well  especially to be up to regulation during a pandemic   There was visible dirty and stickiness on the kitchen floor and garbage can  the whole place just seemed  dingy    I also tried to contact Zencity regarding the key pad at the main entrance because it was open and the electrical part of it was exposed and had a VERY hard time getting a hold on some directly  Honestly wont book with Zencity again   The room was not clean very well  especially to be up to regulation during a pandemic   There was visible dirty and stickiness on the kitchen floor and garbage can  the whole place just seemed  dingy    I also tried to contact Zencity regarding the key pad at the main entrance because it was open and the electrical part of it was exposed and had a VERY hard time getting a hold on some directly 
751941658,This was a great space for our weekend away  The space is clean and welcoming from the moment you enter  Plus the Metro was just a quick walk away  which made getting to the baseball game really easy and hassle free  We enjoyed walking to Forest Park and enjoying the local shops and restaurants nearby 
751279259,Definitely great for the price  Better even  The bed is so comfy and the place was nicely put together  The only thing that sucks is parking  I stayed in the parking garage near by  but walking back to the place in the middle of the night as a single woman was not ideal  If you re okay with waking up early and lucky enough to find a spot you can park out front for free from  pm  am  I did that on a few nights  All in all  a great place  It does need a coffee maker though  There s a coffee shop right down the street if you re addicted like me  Thank you so much for the stay  It was a great time and the bed was SO comfortable Fry on kitchen floor and some dirt or soap in the bathtub
751274294,Make you feel at home  Just a problem with parking but worth the stay  Microwave didn t work
751263801,Great location  very clean  cute and quaint  We would definitely come again  We only had one issue really  described below  but it wasn t something they had control of  I would still definitely recommend this place to anyone     They had some construction going on   days we were there and it was literally shaking the entire apartment  I was unable to make important phone calls for work due to this  I know they only have so much control over things like this  so I still think the place was awesome  We got a noise complaint because our music was too loud  even though it was during  awake  hours    am ish   We turned it down of course because we definitely don t want to upset any neighbors it only got on our nerves due to the fact that we had dealt with very our construction noises for   days  Otherwise  this is a gorgeous place and we loved staying there  The construction that went on for   days was a bit upsetting because I was unable to make phone calls for work  The place was awesome though and we really enjoyed staying there  Thank you  They had some construction going on   days we were there and it was literally shaking the entire apartment  I was unable to make important phone calls for work due to this  I know they only have so much control over things like this  so I still think the place was awesome  We got a noise complaint because our music was too loud  even though it was during  awake  hours    am ish   We turned it down of course because we definitely don t want to upset any neighbors it only got on our nerves due to the fact that we had dealt with very our construction noises for   days  Otherwise  this is a gorgeous place and we loved staying there 
751261467,The stay was amazing and everything thing was nice and clean and put away the only thing was the communication  I texted to try n figure out where the dumpster was to take out the trash but I never received a text back but all in all everything was great and I would recommend it to everybody to try it   Everything was amazing but When I texted you guys about that trash I never got a text back so can you go back over the room and put everything away and take away the trash and I had put all the dishes in the dishwasher also the covers need to be wash and or replaced 
751207905,Nice and Clean  good location with safe parking  I would recommend this place to anyone  Thank you    
751205634,Beautifully decorated  with lots of natural light  comfy bedding and furniture  and well stocked bathroom and kitchen  The location was perfect for our needs  we were there for medical treatments at Siteman Center  just down the street   Loved being so close to Forest Park as well as to great eating spots in the CWE  The building maintains a firm masking policy in public spaces  which we appreciated  and the building felt very safe  Do note that if you are counting on having reliable high speed internet access for remote work or school  you will likely need to find somewhere else to work  The WiFi router itself works fine  though it doesnt extend the WiFi to the bedroom   but the internet service is weak  perhaps the service is being shared by every Zencity apartment in this building    We had to reset the modem multiple times a day to be able to use the internet on our laptops or to livestream on the TV  There are some WiFi lounges available on the main floor  including a private one  Even with the WiFi issues  we really loved our stay in this beautiful apartment  We loved this apartment   it is beautifully appointed  in a great location  and with super easy check in  Loved also that it included all the basic things guests would need   toiletries  clean supplies  toilet paper and paper towels  etc  The apartment was mostly clean but in the bathroom  there was a layer of dust and grime along the baseboards and flooring  Also  the flooring outside the bathroom needs to be secured   whoever laid it did not permanently secure it  and it slides  One other small repair need   the off on knob for the bedroom radiator doesnt seem to work  Finally  the WiFi needs to be upgraded or else not advertised  It was often nonfunctional  and when it did function it was slow  laggy  and kept dropping  We are techies and know how to do the typical troubleshooting like resetting the router and modem  checking our own devices  etc  We had to reset things multiple times a day and it still didnt keep the WiFi operating for long  Even with the WiFi issues  we really loved our stay in this beautiful apartment 
751014806,Everything was great  The unit looked like it did in the pictures and there was so much space  The only issue we had was there was only one key card for building access and the card didn t work for the garage so we had to wait for the attendant to buzz us out every time we left Thank you  Your place allowed us the accommodations we needed while waiting on our unit to be completed  However there were   adults staying there and we worked different schedules so not having   key cards was a hassle
750637271,I loved the experience and it was very clean when I arrived  They answer all questions   have great parking for your leisure They where great and responded rapidly every time I had an issue  I would recommend them to anyone to book it was great   
428894370239804741,Check in could be kinda stressful if they don t have the keys for you ready when they say they ll be ready  And the layout of the building could be confusing but the security their are great and very helpful  The view was cool  Could see the power and light district and was in good location to many things  When you say your guests can check in anytime after    maybe just have what they need in order to check in at that time there   I was at the lock boxes to get the keys around      or so  enough after   o clock to think that it d be ready  And the keys weren t there yet and I had events to go to after  So I wasn t able to actually get into the building until almost    because thats when I was finally headed back from my event and I had to walk back not knowing if I was going to be stranded outside  Thankfully I was able to get in when another guest was using the doors which I understand is a security issue and the security guard was delightful and a major help  But I was worried being alone  at night  in a city I m not familiar with  not knowing if I was going to be able to access my own car which was in the parking garage attached to the building or get inside at all 
428887659327831464,It is a clean place but it is very confusing on how to enter the building to get the key fob  Luckily  there was another dude from Minnesota there to help out  Also  they claim that we are being too noisy which we are clearly not  There must be a sensor or something in the room  Last  there isn t any good onsite parking so you have to park far away or find a spot on the side of the street where you won t get towed  We will just get a motel next time with good parking 
428272816607177774,Good location   fair price
427487040170377478,great place to stay everything was great  thank you  ps the only problems was with the initial getting in the building  the day before someone else was having issues with the putting in the apartment number and saying a code  I never got it to work finally someonethat lived there let me in as Ishowed them proof of my notes and everything 
424551170105720969,Really nice place lots of amenities location terrible The place was extremely saying well put together with lots of amenities  Location was absolutely terrible  I didn t know the area very well select partially my fault  Had a little bit of a difficult time getting in the building originally but after that it was smooth sailing
424546042084942543,Great people to deal with  Great Communication  Great Experience
750631017,First I want to thank the staff for helping get the WiFi issue situated when we first checked in  The location was perfect or our staycation  We were able to walk to relax or simply walk around the corner restaurants and enjoy the weather  We brought our own clean supplies but there were plenty available in the kitchen bathroom and extra closet   The bed was comfy and there was plenty of space  Loved the decor as well    We made a playlist for the weekend so it was nice that there s a speaker to plug in your phone to play music    I will definitely book with this company in the future  First I want to thank the staff for helping get the WiFi issue situated when we first checked in  The location was perfect or our staycation  We were able to walk to relax or simply walk around the corner restaurants and enjoy the weather  We brought our own clean supplies but there were plenty available in the kitchen bathroom and extra closet   The bed was comfy and there was plenty of space  Loved the decor as well    We made a playlist for the weekend so it was nice that there s a speaker to plug in your phone to play music    I will definitely book with this company in the future 
750630791,Please read the reviews before you book     As other guests have noted  this home  unfortunately  falls quite short of it s price and how it s depicted here in the listing  Definitely won t stay again 
750602022,The local was beautiful    This is where I will stay every time I m in St Louis  
750592158,Beautiful apartment in a great part of the city  Very close to a variety of restaurants and downtown area  Interior was beautiful and we loved the view  Most comfortable bed I ve ever slept on  The clean fee is as much as the advertised fee  but it was an overall great stay  Absolutely beautiful apartment in a great part of the city  Loved the view  and the interior design  I would really love to know what kind of mattress that was because that was the most comfortable bed we ve ever slept on  The only downside is that the clean fee is the same price as the advertised stay 
750421984,The apartment was not so clean and my family and I felt too cold  because the thermostate could not be set without the PIN and just after   days  Zencity increase the temperature remotely  But in general  it was a good apartment In general  It was a good staying  Thank you  The thermostate was not working for thebfirst three data  So the house was too cold  colder than out side 
750377504,By staying here  you run the risk of not being able to get into the room because you either do not receive check in instructions or the instructions you receive are incorrect  You also risk not having a safe place to park if the parking lot is full despite being promised a parking spot  We were told we would have one unassigned parking space  There were not enough parking spaces for all of the cars in the lot  We were instructed not to park on the street because we could get towed  We ended up parking in the parking lot in the driving lane  which was not a parking spot and put our car at risk of being hit by other cars  Someone else pulled into the parking lot after us and had to park in a handicap spot because there was no other option   The person was not handicapped  Door code provided didn t work  We had to stand around until someone left the building  which is not exactly safe to have people coming into the building though an open door I didn t realize this was a corporate run Airbnb  It was apparent once we arrived I had to ask for check in instructions  I didn t receive them until almost two hours after my check in time The price was listed reasonably but then with all the added fees  it was much more expensive than we had planned on paying
750077666,The stay was excellent  central location    Easy check in  communication  and overall stay Enjoyed the stay  so comfortable      Just the parking  nothing else
423910815364007458,It s a great apartment  with easy access to Westport and Plaza area  We found it quiet and safe and exactly as advertised  The Zencity staff was reliable and provided clear communication for check in and check out  We hope to stay here again in the future  Thank you  No issues or problems  we had a great stay 
749475483,My partner and I had a great stay at Zencity in St Louis  House was very clean and tidy  nice channels and we loved the neighborhood  We talked to the host prior to check in and didnt have any questions after  everything was explained really well  Parking is about a block away which isnt bad and we were able to explore downtown  I would suggest taking an uber to the bars but each one is in walking distance from each other  Thank you zencity  Completely enjoyed your stay  thank you for making everything so peaceful 
749158528,The place was great  The only that needs to be fixed is the WiFi  It s very weak  Like really WEAK  Could not even stream a video on my computer  Everything else was perfect though  Please fix the WiFi  It s really weak   my computer   game system could not stream 
748899151,Really great value and many close restaurants nearby  Definitely would rent again when I m back in St Louis  
422968065983512439,We arrived at night and the checkin was easy  the place was nice and clean  We were happy with it  We were woken up early on the loud noise from the construction site right across from the apartment s windows  Contacted zencity and after many phone calls and messages they provided a list of their other apartments that I can relocate too  The problem is all we re booked and not available  After many calls and chat messages on the second day  I was told to cancel which I did and got back      out       Note   zincity knew about the construction site and noice  the are building a building next to the apartment and it has been going on for a while and will go on for a while too  I had to rent another apartment from Airbnb for an additional       Zincity is my black list and will not rent from them even if it is free  You are by far the worst host I ever had  You are money hungry and you do not care about your guests  You failed to report the the noise coming from the construction site right across from window  This is something you new about 
421733147092938312,The place was so comfortable and peaceful  I work nights and I was able to rest well  The location was great  The parking was a bit complicated due to no on site parking  The atmosphere of the neighborhood revival was inspiring  I loved  the apartment decor and the simple space was perfect for my work trip   I would definitely stay again  The place was so comfortable and peaceful for my work trip  Thank you for the great stay 
421031191441706794,Nice Stay  Just Need A Few Improvements and Better Communication Thank You Kindly For Allowing Us To Borrow Your Space   The Overall Room Was Okay  The Comforter Was Stained And The Under Sheets  The Room Has A slight Odor  First Night   Workers Were Talking Really Loud Outside The Door Around  am  Second Night Someone Was Up From The Hours Of  am  am Slamming Doors Back And Forth  No Communication From Ava  Not My Best Experience With AirBnb
420944345493229880,Excellent location in Kansas City  Just a couple blocks from the Street Car on Main St to access most of downtown  At first we didn t have our parking pass but the situation was handled well  Overall a lovely stay  We really loved this stay  Excellent building and location  Our only issue was the lack of parking pass  Whoever was supposed to leave that for us or eventually bring us one definitely dropped the ball  It was only a   night stay so the parking garage wasn t too expensive but guests with a longer stay might have issues with that  Despite that  we still loved the apartment and I just wanted to say thank you for an affordable and lovely stay  We had a great visit 
748687681,Stayed here for a few days to go watch a cardinals game  Very clean  friendly neighborhood  communication was easy  Overall  would stay again  Had an amazing stay  Very clean and very friendly neighborhood  Thank you 
748681206,Great  easy place to stay for access to about everything you would want to do in STL  I stayed for one evening so I could catch an early flight  so I paid a heavily discounted rate  booked the day before   Across the street from Forest Park and near some good restaurants  Whole Foods is around the corner  You do have to check in at the front desk and there is not designated street parking  However  the staff was welcoming and helpful  and street parking is from     am     pm  then it is free  Download app from the street sign to pay for parking   Keep in mind you are in the hospital district  so sirens at all hours is to be expected  Otherwise  fairly quiet neighborhood   Side note  I did overhear a conversation about an Airbnb guest being kicked out  may not be related to this host  for not complying with the sites rules  Please read the house rules and abide by them  Dont ruin it for the rest of us 
748500700,Pretty good place in town 
748324227,The location is convenient if you re interested in spending a day walking around or eating at the many restaurants  However  this stay was too expensive for what it was  The clean fee was     to fit the host s  obsessive standards  but there was plumbing issues with the bathroom sink and shower that could have been fixed with clean the drains  The Wifi was very laggy  and I felt the host wasn t considerate leaving only one towel for two adults  both registered for the stay   It may be beneficial to add either a filter on the facet or even just a cheap pitcher in the fridge for drinkable water  Too expensive of a clean fee for bathroom sink and shower drains to not work properly  WIFI lagged tremendously  Only one towel was provided for two adults 
748048681,very good  very safe   great roof top balcony with epic views of the park    block walk to whole foods  sushi  bars and cafes   very nice and lots of outlets that all work and Roku  great place  thanks 
420209910954707446,A great location at Mcgee and   th  Close to everything that we wanted to do  Private secure entrance  Comfortable space for two people  Parking is close by  I would highly recommend this apartment  Thank you for such a great stay  The only issue we experienced was at check in      was not on the list  Luckily someone was coming out at the same time  No other issues were encountered  We had an amazing time
419559942855390211,The pros  Location is very convenient  in the middle of the city with easy access to most tourist attractions  Building is modern with sleek and stylist d cor   Unit does have nice open layout feel with full kitchen  Neighboring units are quiet  Check in was relatively simple to access key to unit   The cons  Unit doesnt have the best view itself  you have a view of another brick apartment building and parking lot and garage  Parking pass was not provided as stated  management team communicated quickly that this would resolve issue and I would receive the parking pass the next day but this issue was never resolved so I ended up paying for parking myself through my stay  management team still has not resolved this issue one week after my stay ended   There was an off putting smell in the unit  this smell was not noticeable in the building  only the unit  I had to buy multiple air fresheners but it could not cover the smell  Im not sure of the source as the unit looked clean but it smelled like a toilet most of my stay    Overall  I give this stay   stars  I would recommend staying in a different unit if possible  Waiting to hear from management team to resolve not having parking pass during stay and having to pay for parking myself in the garage 
419473589750384870,Communication with the host was good  We had a little trouble with check in  It was not clear which keys to use where in the building  two key fobs on the keychain   We also found out after leaving and coming back that in order to lock the door as you leave you need to put the key fob to the door and listen for it to lock  One of the guests staying with us went to pretend open the door and it actually opened without the fob   The place was clean and worked well for our short trip  In the bedroom at the end of the long hall though you could hear an elevator all night long  I m a light sleeper so I heard every time it went up and down and opened doors   The building itself was nice and secure   We parked on the street next to the building all weekend and didn t get a ticket either  Thank you for letting us stay in your place  We appreciated it 
418766049289323969,Really nice apartment  The value was excellent  Very nice and quiet neighborhood  I would definitely stay here again  The keypad was difficult to get working  You had to press very hard on the keypad 
748030737,Clean and exactly what we needed  Thanks much 
747999523,My sisters and I stayed here for a girl s weekend in STL  The front desk staff were incredibly helpful and friendly  and the apartment complex was beautiful  The accommodations that the room had to offer were great  the bedding was incredibly comfortable and Zencity was prompt to answer any questions I had        would stay here again 
747890452,Loved the place  I would maybe stay again  My only   complaints are the key fob that doesn t open the lever to get in and out so we had to use the front desk multiple times to let us in or out since they wouldn t get us a new one  Lastly the inability to use the thermostat was very frustrating  Loved the place  I would maybe stay again  My only   complaints are the key fob that doesn t open the lever to get in and out so we had to use the front desk multiple times to let us in or out since they wouldn t get us a new one  Lastly the inability to use the thermostat was very frustrating  The key fob doesn t open the garage gate
747865831,Neighborhood friendly Thanks
747838407,Came here for a girls weekend trip  It was such a great location  Everything was so close  The views were amazing and the beds were so comfortable and clean 
417341053223353277,Great location and very comfortable bed  The check in was super easy and exactly as the instructions described  Zencity was responsive to questions  The only thing to note is that some of the amenities werent available in the apartment complex because of a flood in the basement  Also  the clearance for the one alloted parking spot was       so if you have a larger vehicle  van  pick up truck  etc   you will not be able to park there  Id recommend checking out  Curry In A Hurry  for lunch which was on the same block  Bad smell in the apartment from someone burning something in the microwave   we tried to fix this by leaving the door open but since the windows dont open the smell unfortunately never left  Other than those minor things everything was great for the price  The couch pillows were stained and dirty  and the room smelled awful  I guess something was burnt badly in the microwave   No air fresheners under the sink or anywhere else to fix the issue 
416655457623932262,Want a great place to stay near Country club plaza  Look no further  This place is just as it looks in the pics and is so super close to shopping and dining    Off street parking and the pool put this place above others we looked at  Thanks for a great stay   One thing to note  There was a maintenance man when I arrived and he headed out and was not able to address three things of note   One light out in the bathroom   Shades not operating property in one bedroom   strange   trash odor in the apartment    None made our stay bad  Just notes 
416568604026592976,I didnt mind the apartment so much it was a little bit ran down compared to what the pictures look like and the building was a little sketchy I mean the people in it but it was pretty nice experience except for the fact that they hadnt clean it I couldnt get a hold of any property manager to fix it and it wouldnt refund my money so I had to take all the bedding and everything and wash it myself it was ridiculous I was up here for a funeral You need to really check your property managers I had to do my own sheets I had to clean my own room I couldnt get a hold of nobody I couldnt find nobody to tell anything to neither could Airbnb  its ridiculous  The master key was laying on the counter in my room somebody been sleeping in the bed the bathroom was a mess and its covid season
415908600400160170,this location is awesome  you are blocks away from a ton of things  the plaza  the nelson atkins museum is free   there s putt putt golf that costs but it was so worth it  the only hiccup we had with our stay was with check in  the access code they sent us was invalid but luckily there was a girl who lived there who called the building manager   released our keys  this place is very modern   the perfect amount of space for   people  the view was also cute    i recommend this place to anyone wanting to explore the area     minutes from everything    there are also electric scooters to navigate around  parking is a little difficult but manageable  this place is awesome  i would recommend leaving some salt pepper or some other necessities for cooking that don t go bad or salt   pepper packets 
747819996,This unit needs more attention to detail  The sofa is stained  the microwave didn t work  there was no coffee pot  there were dirty towels and tub ring in the shower  The clean tag showed it hadn t been tended to in a month and you can t adjust the air conditioning  which would be a problem in warmer weather  Otherwise  the location was nice and if the other issues were addressed  we d stay again  This unit needs more attention to detail  The sofa is stained  the microwave didn t work  there was no coffee pot there were dirty towels and tub ring in the shower  The clean tag showed it hadn t been tended to in a month  Microwave didn t work and there was no coffee pot  I have photos that show that apparently someone took a shower in one bathroom and left their wash towels and a ring in the tub  In the kitchen  the floor wasn t clean  The sofa cushions need a steam clean there are stains  According to the clean tag  the unit had not been clean for a month  Only communication was us being asked to turn the tv down  I can t imagine residents being asked to turn their tv s down  The microwave didn t work and there was no coffee pot  One bedroom door is  hollow  and open  you can see inside it  I have a photo that illustrates this 
747806490,Great place and location 
747380903,I ve stayed at this location a number of times and always enjoy it  The Bordeaux is low key  super stylish  and within walking short driving distance to a number of restaurants  coffee shops  and the Soulard Market  The price is simply unbeatable for the value  Will be back  Hi Zencity   This is my third time staying at one of your locations  twice in STL  once in Chicago  and I LOVE staying with you all  The Bordeaux is my little hone away from home  I literally live   mins away lol   Since I ve been working from home for over a year now  it s nice to have a little change of scenery  Looking forward to returning soon 
747072358,Great place  Good communication  really good location  Highly recommend 
747067560,It was perfect for an overnight stay
746865398,The apt is beautiful and located within walking distance to sights  restaurants  and the Arch  There is only one parking spot provided so if you have multiple cars  you will need metered parking  It is a very secure place  you need a key card to go anyway  but only one is provided so we needed to coordinate meeting up if my group split for the day  The apt has the bare minimum amenities provided  no coffee or condiments   There are sensors inside the apt that will alert Zencity if the noise is too loud  I received a text message from watching a movie too loudly   I think it is more sensitive after      pm   There was a hiccup of getting locked out and it took over an hour to resolve this  the door has a numeric code that somehow was deactivated   It took some time between messaging on the AirBnb app and sitting on hold when I called the host to finally have access back into the apt  I dont think I will select this host again just for the slow response time in a urgent situation  The customer service response needs to be quicker in the event of an urgent situation  We were locked out and I had to call twice even after messaging through the app  I think this warrants a call from you guys to fix this  Im not sure what happened with the code not working in the door  but I suspect someone forgot to update the code after we were granted the request to extend our reservation  When I called the provided number  it took a while for a response when it was rather urgent to get resolved  I was disconnected from a call and the agent didnt all me back  it took   mins of sitting on hold to finish the resolution  There is the bare minimum of amenities there 
746822332,The instructions to enter weren t correct  which caused some confusion  Building address is different than listed and locked doors prohibited direct entry   Host said to go up the stairs after the building entrance  This lead to a locked door  which you could enter if you had the fob  It took some exploring to find the unlocked entrance  requiring backtracking   I informed the host  so this may be resolved already    Although the building smelled normal  the apartment itself faintly smelled of cigarette smoke for a few minutes upon returning each time  Maybe neighbors smoke   I had some air conditioning problems the first day  but no problems after contacting the host  Not sure what they did  though    The blinds weren t effective in keeping out the sun in the morning  making it difficult to sleep in past dawn    Great security and safety features  Great tv and kitchen  Great bedroom and bathroom  The instructions to enter the home weren t accurate  I informed the host  though  I also messaged about the air conditioning  and they responded but I didn t feel they followed up well enough  Fortunately  the problem was fixed  The street address says       not what is listed  Added security made it more difficult to enter the building  which wasn t included in the instructions  Business like responses  without seeking a full satisfactory experience  Problem solving instead of experience improving 
746802847,Accurate description  The parking was a bit tricky at first  but once we figured it out it was a nice feature that isnt always included  thanks for the stay  The furniture needs a bit of help  couch is very wobbly  but it was a comfortable stay 
746617299,Everything about this space was wonderful  The location was great  within ten minutes drive to everywhere I wanted to visit  The parking and security of the building were very safe  I would stay again easily 
746607826,Perfect location  Bed and linens are super comfy  Very clean  I definitely plan on booking again in the near future  I love your place  The bed and linens were super comfy  The light is rather bright through the kitchen window  so some type of curtain to maybe block that lol 
746591520,Very nice and clean  Close to aquarium and city museum  When checking in no one answered the intercom to let me in but someone inside the building let me in  Other than that everything else was amazing 
746459050,I read reviews prior to booking so I had a sense of how the overall experiences have been prior  There were some small uncleanliness issues  the main restroom had what looked like salt or white residue on the tiles and the shower did not seem the cleanest  We noticed handprints all over the walls and oddly above the master bedroom doorway  Check in was delayed and I had to reach out to find out how to check in since the host did not send information prior  The apartment overall was quiet outside was nosy but didn t bother our stay  We did like the overall apartment and location was great for our stay and activities while visiting St  Louis  I read reviews prior to booking so I had a sense of how the overall experiences have been prior  There were some small uncleanliness issues  the main restroom had what looked like salt or white residue on the tiles and the shower did not seem the cleanest  We noticed handprints all over the walls and oddly above the master bedroom doorway  Check in was delayed and I had to reach out to find out how to check in since the host did not send information prior  The apartment overall was quiet outside was nosy but didn t bother our stay  We did like the overall apartment and location was great for our stay 
746455905,Location doesn t get better for a CWE stay  It was great for our needs and check in out was super easy  Thank you so much for the stay  It was exactly what we needed for our trip and the location can t be beat 
746451871,great location big enough space great view the host just have to work on responding to guest faster and not hours later also they need air fresher in the apartment and make sure the bathroom is deep clean   the location was definitely great but I feel like your respond show of been alot faster and also the apartment need air fresher and deep clean everything else was fine great view and the space was great the bathroom was not so clean the shower needed deep clean and the area rug in the living room needs to be replace I feel like the host didnt respond to me soon enough with nothing the location was beautiful but the buildings was very dirty
746208848,Excellent location and just fine for short stays   Overall decor and upkeep is a bit dated  but everything works just fine   Note that there is no laundry in the unit  but a common laundry in the basement   There is      coverage at the entrance  Some of the floor molding is not attached at all   the bedroom entrance and the closet across from the bedroom   Would also be nice to have an electric coffee maker 
746201015,great place to stay  very comfortable  and I recommend this bnb to friends thanks for being very accommodating
746128699,Garbage place  garbage communication  Pictures are misleading  It s essentially a tenement apartment building with garbage all over it  someone had peed in the elevator  which was also covered in garbage   After our parking pass turned out to have no spot with the number on it and the landlord hadn t replied to and maybe hung up on several of our calls  we gave up and got a hotel elsewhere  I want a refund Area s gross  building s worse  We walked in  took one look  said this is gonna suck but we ll get through it  and then after our parking pass turned out to be to a nonexistent spot and the renter wouldn t respond  we got a hotel room in a better part of town  Again  front door broken open  no parking space with our number on it  no response to our calls  Very sketch  Lots of codes involved in the instructions but the door had been wrenched open and didn t require them  Lots of druggy looking folks coming and going  Elevator seemed to have been recently urinated in and was covered in trash  So disgusting I ate the hundred plus bucks they charged  ironically mostly in clean fees  and found a better place 
745656122,I would not stay here ever   It was very dirty   No parking   if there is it is very expense   Not what the picture looks like on site  Need to get a new clean team and do some maintenance   I well never stay there again   I well stay in a hotel  Parking was a nightmare    There was nothing said about the parking  There was a parking for the condo   Why dont you let renter use the card so many numbers to remember It was very dirty    I clean airbnb homes and I would not be able to leave it like it was   I took picture but they well not load on here    the stove would not work  we had to unplug and clean plug every time we used it   it would not stay on  need to do some maintenance on it   Showers where not good either need to work on them   Hardly anything to cook with but got by with what there was   The whole place need some TLC Just did not like For the cost it should of looked like the picture and let people know how much parking was and that a lot of the parking spots you could not go in and out and stay overnight
745651211,Yay
745560763,I really enjoyed the stay  location is great restaurants near by  grocery across the street  parking is by but not included  walking in it was a little suspect and directions were abit confusing  PLEASE BEWARE host does not respond at all  only get automated responses about staying there   besides that it was pretty clean and comfy and for the most part it was quiet  will consider staying again only because Im comfortable with the routine  please respond to questions next time  and in a timely manner  anything could happen and theres nothing worse than an unreliable host  the details for getting into the complex are confusing and some isnt relevant  Also some furnishings are different  host doesnt communicate very well at all   host does not respond  even when asked repeatedly  only get automated responses about stay 
745541359,Everything about our stay was easy and exceeded our expectations  We appreciate the fast responses and how accurate your listing was  May I suggest just adding to the listing the fact that there is a garbage Shute as we did not know this was available until the last day    And it may be useful for guest staying for longer than   days  Other than that    thank you for allowing us to stay here    Everything about our stay was easy and exceeded our expectations  We appreciate the fast responses and how accurate your listing was  May I suggest just adding to the listing the fact that there is a garbage Shute as we did not know this was available until the last day    And it may be useful for guest staying for longer than   days  Other than that    thank you for allowing us to stay here   
415222018800544382,This apartment is great   Very very clean   Quiet atmosphere   Beds are super comfortable  kitchen is large and location is perfect   short walk to our new favorite restaurant  True Food     Will definitely return and stay in this apartment  Initial entry at the door of the building did not work with putting in   digit code and then speaking   numbers   Had to keep pressing the  call  button until someone came to open the door 
415213836244288877,while the place was as expected based on photos  we were disappointed with several factors  first the smell  which I imagine is impossible to remove since the whole floor smells like a mixture of pot and attempts to cover the smell  The appt itself smelt a bit better than that but still not good  the whole first evening I was uneasy feeling like the place was dirty since there were several areas that were obviously unclean   Several of the lights throughout the place did not work  making night time a bit more difficult   the bed was pretty comfortable though and water pressure was nice  there were several amenities in the kitchen but was disappointed to find the water boiler was broken  stay was fine but I prob wont stay with zencity again we were disappointed with the cleanliness when we arrived  there were obvious dirty spots on the stove and table and on the floors    we also were incredibly disappointed to find that all the main lights in the apt did not work  first the main light in kitchen which made arriving in during early evening extra difficult and the light beside the sink in the bathroom  making it pretty impossible to see well in there
415130828243999035,The check in instructions at the point where you enter the hillside g and use the intercom to obtain access to the proper floor simply does not work    We spent    minutes and three different calls to support  first wrap  Said they would call back since their connection  Was poor but never did call back  to get access to the floor      All this after paying extra   for early check in     Other than that the room was as  advertised and in a good spot    Easy walks to P L as well as Riverfront    Room was tidy and perfect for the two of us   Just plan on an extra  hour or two to check in if they do not update check in process  Check in process required calling three different times to get a person who could handle the issue   First person said they would call back in    minutes and never called back   Access to the proper floor via elevator did not work when following the instructions listed   Please update the process and or instructions to match   We wasted     hours once we got to the building before we could access the suite    This wasted more than     of the time we paid extra for early check in for    I feel ripped off on the early check in due to this issue 
414479003737561746,Great location  like a      minute drive to everything we wanted to do  plus some coffee shops  restaurants  and stores within walking distance  Has limited parking but we were able to find street parking easily over the weekend  The room had a bad smell  couldn t see anything that would have caused it though but it was a bit off putting  Great location and directions for check in and stuff were super clear and helped a ton  We had a great time
414448875911459719,Overall a great stay and good value for the price  There is an automatic noise monitor and it is sensitive  Loud laughter triggered a warning message  Music needs to be in the background and kept fairly low to avoid the warning texts  Location is a few blocks from Power   Light and many things nearby close on the weekend so be prepared to walk a bit for amenities  Hello  overall our stay was great  I did want to mention that the glassware was not clean  smelled of bourbon  when we arrived and there were dirty smelly sponges under the sink  I think both the kitchen sink and one of the main bathroom sinks leak a bit 
413752914810317002,Beautiful apartment in a great part of town   Walking distance to so many nice restaurants and shops     Its also a terrific value    My only suggestion   complaint was the living room furniture is not very comfortable    Also  with a  two bedroom apartment   there was not enough glassware  cups  silverware  etc     All in all  we would ABSOLUTELY stay here again     Kansas City and Zencity far exceeded our expectations  Check in was very awkward   The code for the front door did not work and we had to rely on someone letting us in to get to our room    Once inside we were able to use our fob from that point forward 
413047435553143562,The location  and apartment itself were pretty nice  Parking was a breeze    Check in was an entire mess  I ve stayed at similar places where there are just a lot of steps and it s confusing  no  This wasn t confusing  the instructions were inaccurate  The steps to get into the building  fail  A nice person let us in the building  into the elevator and onto the floor  bc you need a key fob to do all that  which we didn t have   Get into the room  no key fob as promised in the directions  Getting one later was a HASSLE  This seems like an easily preventable situation  yet there are repeated reviews saying the same thing  This absolutely tainted my experience  The check in process was a mess  I followed the instructions and from the very beginning could not access the building  I couldn t get into the front doors  there was no key fob in the room  the lockbox by the door was unlabeled and also empty  so the backup plan didn t work   and then it took a few hours for it to be rectified  I was only able to get in and out of the building bc of the help of other nice people  This seriously would deter me from booking with you again 
410863876724273410,Clean  comfy  very enjoyable stay  Small issue buzzing in initially to get the elevator to work  Also internet was very slow   Mbps   Very clean  comfy  enjoyed everything else 
410857878910085119,Great room once inside  The check in process was horrible  We lucked out and met somebody who is staying on our floor that could let us in to the elevator and get us to our floor before getting our key   If we wouldn t have found them we would not have been able to get into the room  She also had a ZenCity Airbnb  She said it took her about two hours to check in  If they fix the check in process this would have been a five star review  We loved the room and the experience after the check in process  The directions to get into the room were unclear and also in accurate  The code we were given did not work  The only way we were able to successfully get into the room is because we happened to find somebody staying on the same floor as us since we needed a key fob to access the elevator  We got lucky bumping into another person staying there  If it wasn t for that person we would have never gotten to the room since there is no attendant in the lobby 
409326218806831286,Loved the location    right on the streetcar line  which is awesome  Plus  the apartment view was great and it was clean and comfortable  Also loved having access to the gym and convenient store  Overall a great place and would stay here again  Loved the location    right on the streetcar line  which is awesome  Plus  the apartment view was great and it was clean and comfortable  Also loved having access to the gym and convenient store  When we came home yesterday it did smell like smoke  which was strange  And when we arrived all the furniture was wet  I m assuming it was from being clean  but it was a little uncomfortable   Overall a great place and would stay here again 
408645036700857194,Great place in general  Sparkling clean  Nice beds and pillows  When we get back to Kansas City  we ll try to get this apartment again  Everything was great  only we have a little trouble getting the key 
407894914975195282,Check in  as other have stated  was not smooth at all  We did not have a fob and the intercom at the entrance did not work as it was explained   they did however respond within an hour attempting to provide a solution  we had already been let in by another guest   The place itself was clean and comfortable   I actually loved the space  I would stay again provided they updated corrected the building access  Thank you for the stay  The only thing that could be greatly improved is the check in process  The fob should be easy to find and access to the building should be quick and easy   the intercom was not effective at all 
407235588861943722,I think when I stayed  maybe the price was lowered because the nice pool area is under construction and closed  At the reduced price it was a great value   Comfy bed  full stocked kitchen  clean supplies  iron   everything I needed   I think they have a big team at Zen City so communication was a little off but with persistence I got in and had a great stay   If you don t have a car there are lots of buses and scooters to use  One broken couch leg  ceiling fan very dirty  French press missing a part so unusable  windows need clean   otherwise really a lovely stay thank you
745426541,Location is key when visiting a new city  This spot is within walking distance to a fabulous park and local eateries and grocery   By car only minutes from downtown  The host is very quick to respond with any questions or concerns  We would certainly stay again  
745426471,This is a nice apartment building  It used to be a warehouse  The building renovation was completed in       I stayed in a two bedroom two bathroom unit  It have a nice modern look and very high ceilings  The neighborhood is nice and quiet  Youll receive check in instructions a few days before your stay  After you enter the unit number and access code on the keypad by the front door  youll have to walk up some stairs to get to the interior door on the first floor  Just a heads up  youll need someone to let you into the building so you can get to your assigned unit  Overall  I enjoyed my stay at Zencitys place  Overall  I like the apartment  Aside from being brand new  Its spacious  have a nice color scheme and looks very modern  As for the parking   I would suggest that the host either assign a spot to future customers or provide a short list of unassigned spots on the property for the customer to choose from by way of the check in instructions  Once I checked in  I messaged the host wanting to find out which spots on the property werent assigned to anyone  I didnt receive a response  Consequently  I chose not to park on the property because each spot is numbered and I didnt want to take any chances of parking in an assigned spot and risk my vehicle being towed 
745412731,Honestly a nightmare experience  We arrived in the evening for a relaxing weekend getaway only to realize the apartment was not clean  Though it appeared tidy at first  we discovered that the bedding was covered in hair the floors had lots of dirt  dust  and hair  As we arrived in the evening and had no other accommodations  I spent over an hour stripping the bedding and picking hairs off the  clean  sets in the closet  The hosts couldnt be reached by phone  only by email  The next morning they emailed me saying someone would be by to clean  likely before  pm  we packed up all our stuff to make it easier for them to clean and went about our day  We arrived back that night only to find that no one had been by to clean  No explanation or response from the hosts  Even now  no one has responded about the situation nor the lack of follow through on their part  I am extremely disappointed and aggravated at my experience in this listing  The apartment was not clean and I spent more than an hour picking pubic hairs off of the  clean  sets of bedding in the closet  because the set already on the bed was disgusting and COVERED in hair   The sheets were wrinkled in a certain way that almost seems like they hadnt been changed at all after the previous guest  The floors and carpets had dirt and hairballs  I was told by Zencity that someone would come clean  likely before  pm   We gave them all day  No one came  Once again  we arrived  for the  nd night in a row  to a dirty apartment during what was supposed to be a relaxing getaway  I reached out to explain that no one showed up to clean and recieved no response  no explanation  nor an apology  I still have yet to get any response  The host said they would send someone to clean and they did not  The actual apartment inside the building was a bit difficult to find based on the instructions  The place was tidy  but the floors were visibly dirty  dirt and hair  and the bedding was a nightmare  The bedroom carpet had numerous large hairballs  There were     hairs  mainly pubic hairs  all over the sheets  comforter  and pillows  In combination with this  the sheets were very wrinkly in areas where they would be if someone had slept there and not changed the sheets  I spent at least an hour late at night when we arrived picking a strangers pubic hair off of the  clean  sets of bedding that were in the closet  Very difficult to reach host  Slow responses  if any  Promised to send cleaners and did not  Plenty of ovenware but no potholders  Bathroom sink was very difficult to use as the faucet was way too close to the counter 
745072291,Very clean  spacious  centrally located downtown unit with in out dedicated parking spot   Within    minute walking distance to Bush Stadium  the Arch  City Musuem  and many breweries and restaurants   TV included streaming services and there were no issues with loud noises or smells  Detailed instructions were provided ahead of time  though a bit misleading   There was no  welcome packet   just the key card and fob  and no unit access code   Last thing I wanted after a day of travel was to reach the unit and not be able to enter   The host responded with the code    minutes after an initial message was sent   Phone call to the host was an automated system that hung up on me without connecting to a rep  Overall  responses were typically within an hour   The escalation phone number was useless  For the price  I would have liked a few more amenities    like a toaster and more storage shelving in the hall bathroom  In Out dedicated parking was a huge bonus 
745055464,Improvements needed Dishes were dirty and tub needed to be refinished   whenever we showered we had paint chips on our feet Place wasn t clean   cleaners was just getting started at the time we supposed to check in and dishes still were dirty
744377635,Love this place  I slept so good  Thank you so much hopefully I can stay again
744353785,Great for value
744132789,It would have been ok if I would have had a place to park  if I had been able to enjoy music with my adult grandchildren  only   of them  and movies instead of getting messages about loudness when it was normal and when I arrived there was music blasting but when I entered my space I could barely hear it and that wasn t a problem  It just wasn t what I was use to  I meet them twice a year and this was my first at this place and I won t be returning  Couldn t enter upon arrival  No parking at night  Couldn t play tv loud enough to hear or music  I m in my   s hearing is not superb  Got a message to not park in handicap and I have handicap plates and a sticker
743862360,It was a very cute and stylish place  It was also super close to everything we wanted to go to and had a nice well lit enclosed parking lot that was nice There was something wrong with the tv everytime you clicked on a show to watch the colors were off
743613355,Great location  easy access to the building 
743603209,These are clean  spacious apartments right in the middle of town   you couldn t ask for a better location  And while some of the fixtures were a little cheap and occasionally came out of the thin walls  watch the towel bars    the towels and linens were perfect  they brought us more soap when we needed it  the amenities were great  washer dryer in unit    Wow    and the views couldn t be beat  The parking garage was safe and so convenient  Thanks  This was a gorgeous apartment and it was located exactly where we needed   and ultimately we were well cared for  There were some bumps  but in general our memories are happy ones  The host didn t include the right info for our electronic lock  plus the parking spot we were assigned was mysteriously filled by another car halfway through our stay  We were not given all the codes we needed to unlock the front door  it delayed us getting into the apartment by about a half hour  at the end of a long travel day  On some topics our host was  very  responsive   replacing broken appliances  and someone did get back to us within the hour when we were missing the code to get into the apartment at check in  But there were other times we had questions and we just didn t hear from anyone at all 
743574848,This is a great apartment in an amazing location right in the heart of downtown    We woke up  grabbed coffee a few doors down  and took an invigorating little walk down to the arch before starting our day     The apartment is just as it appears in photos  Kinda minimalist  kinda modern  kinda urban  plenty spacious      bathrooms and laundry is very convenient  as is a fully stocked kitchen    The beds are super comfortable   The apartment is somewhat loud and drafty  The draftiness was not an issue for us although I can see how it might be during cooler temperatures   The street noise wasnt an issue either   though I expected it to be I actually slept amazingly well    As others have mentioned  we did experience flushing issues and would have appreciated a more thorough clean  towels  bedding  and hard surfaces were all very clean  living room furniture needs a good clean    Our stay was positive overall  Id gladly stay again  but I do hope the mentioned issues are able to be addressed  Thank you so much for hosting us   We loved the unit  the location  the beds  the temperature was comfortable at the time we were there  we appreciated having a stocked kitchen as we ate in    We did have toilet flushing issues  the smoke alarm was chirping the entire time which was very annoying  and  as others have mentioned  we would have preferred it to be cleaner     For me  living room furniture that can be wiped down would make a huge difference in this unit   Thank you again for hosting us  despite the issues mentioned  we had a good stay 
743304744,Very good for the price  pretty good location  without walking distance of a bunch of different restaurants   attractions  Had trouble getting back into room due to passcode not working
743128904,Great place 
743107909,This apartment was clean  convenient to many areas of St  Louis  had comfortable beds and was very secure   The only thing Id say is that if you are a light sleeper  the sirens might be an issue due to the proximity to Barnes Jewish Hospital   There are white noise machines and window A C units that can help block some of the noise   Parking wasnt horrible   We parked on the street and had to pay the meter between the hours of  AM and   PM   Its free on Sundays   We were not in the apartment much  but it had everything we needed for showers and sleeping   I would stay here again 
742657189,Strong discourage anyone from renting this unit  The unit stinks of stale cigarettes and marijuana smoke  Nothing felt clean  The walls are paper thin and the neighbors party and fight constantly  There was a dog that wouldn t stop barking  The door lock is improperly installed  The floor sounded like you were walking on a sound generator from a horror flick  The bathroom looked like it was designed for hospice and the toilet seat was broken  We tried cancelling our stay the moment we walked in  fully prepared to drive the   hours back home we had just driven  but Airbnb could not reach the host  We left the next day and cancelled the rest of our   day holiday  No one should ever rent this unit again  Entire unit felt  grimey   Smoke smell was on everything in the unit  Unit is neighbored by awful neighbors 
742648679,Great location next to Barnes Jewish Hospital   Short walk to some neat restaurants and bars and quick drive anywhere you would want to go   I    about   blocks away   Couldnt ask for a better spot location   Check in easy     need key fob for elevator   We did not get one but not a real issue as there is a doorman until midnight so they can access the elevator for you   All of them were very hospitable   Room was just that   room w bed and TV on the wall  bathroom w tub and a skinny kitchen   studio or hotel room   which works for my wife and I     Pictures do the space good justice  neutral grays and whites   very comfortable bed     would stay here again no parking   garage cost     for the night
742435503,The place was comfortable and mostly clean  a couple of corners and harder to reach spots had accumulated some grime  the parking structure is a couple blocks away and I got soaked in the rain walking back to the building but other than that it was perfect
742419199,Very good  Take advantage of the rooftop Very good  Instructions on getting in could be better
407210480044165187,Spacious Elevator non working  locking the door impossible  The humidity made the trash shoot outside the unit stink terribly and could smell inside unit  There was a short in one of the lamps so it was like a strobe light while on  The microwave function was not right  the table turned but didn t get hot   Obviously these were not deal breakers but wanted someone to be aware of the punch list 
407165489330668421,Love it   A favorite   Thanks Zencity for your hospitality  Lovely place would stay again   Limited supplies in kitchen but not everyone stays in for dinners   Definitely a recommended stay 
406517775690203602,This unit is in a great location downtown  and in a very secure apartment building  However  I was somewhat disappointed with how many cleanliness issues I found  especially considering how small the place is  I noted the specific issues with the host  I did also have issues with check in  as some of the codes provided did not work  The host usually responded to my messages and questions in a timely manner  which I appreciated  The place was fine for what I needed  but sadly I m not sure I would stay here again due to the issues I had  I was a little disappointed by the amount of cleanliness issues that I found  for it being such a small space  I just wanted to note those things so you are aware for the future  Perhaps there s just an issue with the clean service utilized    Several utensils and dishes that I pulled out of the cabinet drawers were clearly not clean   The fridge and freezer had a strong odor to them   There was a couple pieces of trash left in the bathroom trash can    The electric kettle was dirty  and contained a sour smelling dark liquid in it    It looked like all the clean towels were folded and sitting on the bed when I got there  However  I found one on its own still hanging on the bathroom door  which makes me think it was a dirty one that was missed  Perhaps I m wrong  I also had several issues checking in  as some of the codes did not work  Again  I appreciate that you all responded to every message in a timely manner  My main issue was the cleanliness 
406429388219832460,Nice spot  KC is awesome
405729764834413959,This location is in a good spot  My issue with it was the entry process wasn t smooth  I had to wait until someone was exiting and I had to ask someone to grant me access to use the elevator  for entering the first time and the room s floor was pretty dirty  Please make sure the intercom system works  I had to wait until someone tell me in the building and they had to swipe me into the elevator    The room s floor was dirty and needed to be clean 
405071814377780398,Great little apartment  Close to the deck where parties happen do it could be noisy for you  All the guests were friendly   the party did not go late  I love staying here  I love the places in the Wonder Building  This one looked very clean but the floors were very dirty  I played on the floor with my grandkids and wish I had known to mop them first  All in all I loved my stay 
405054475022979780,So close to downtown  Great place for a girls weekend  Such a fun place to stay  Will be back for sure   Great spot for a girl weekend  
402181751369410737,Cons  Older building which has people living in the units  so management does not like people staying there through AirBnb  No direct communication through ZenCity before arriving  Questions were not answered  The check in process given was faulty and incorrect   A security guard had to let us in after some time of waiting in the vestibule  No toaster or kitchen towels  Few eating utensils  Horrible smell permeated the unit and building because on ongoing construction in adjacent building    Pros   Older building    was a hotel with Art Deco style  which was very cool  Bed and pillows were comfortable Towels were fluffy and soft  Would not recommend Hello   I am requesting that half of our stay be reimbursed  Please respond that you have received this message  From the very start  I had no direct communication with Zencity about the rental  I had asked questions through the app after booking before arriving that were never answered  The only responses were about check in and rules  My questions were never answered  The check in procedures were not correct and we were stuck in the vestibule with no way to enter the building or the unit  I tried calling but no one answered  We were about ready to spend the night on the ground in the vestibule   it was after midnight when checking in as our flights had been delayed   and we were rescued by a security guard who happened to be walking by and was able to allow us access  Once we got in and were able to use the key card  all seemed fine  You do need to know that the directions in using the keypad DO NOT WORK    The security guard even told us that the keypad is faulty  Even he tried the keypad and it would not work with the sent directions   On the day before check out  a strange and horrible smell started to enter the unit  It smelled like nail polish remover times     It started to burn our nose and throats  The hall did not smell  but the lobby and and elevators did  Our next door neighbor  who lives in the building  was also experiencing this smell  We were told that there was construction going on in the connected building and that the smell would dissipate  I called ZenCity and spoke to Karen  who seemed to want to help but didnt seem to really know what to do except call her manager supervisor  She never followed up with me about these calls  even though she said she would  We left the unit for several hours hoping it would be better when we returned for the last night in the unit  When we got back  the smell was even worse and the lobby seemed filled with a haze  It was intolerable  There was no way we could sleep in such a situation  I called ZenCity again  asked to speak to Karen  who had left and the person on the phone was able to offer money back for one night   We are still waiting to see if this happens  I have had refunds from AirBnb before  and they are very quick  if not instant  I was told      days  which seems suspect given my experience at other times  We had the inconvenience of needing to find a hotel for one night  which was more expensive and very inconvenient as we had to pack up  move locations  and unpack for only one night  At added expense  which was not counted upon for this trip  This inconvenience needs to be compensated  I am requesting that half of our stay be reimbursed  Please respond that you have received this message 
402144634257794923,Please be careful about booking your stay at this place  The listing states that there is a rooftop but that is a complete lie  My friends and I booked this place in order to have an outdoor space to enjoy and meet friends that are nervous about being in doors with COVID and we felt very let down by this listing  Prior to the booking we contacted the host company and I was told there was a roof top area for the building  Upon arrival and further communication with the host we were informed that this information was not true  Also the way in which the guest acquires the keys to the unit is very confusing and takes time to figure out  It is not user friendly at all  AirnBnB management will be notified about your false advertising 
742396292,Amazing place to stay my sister and I had a great time and will always look forward to coming back here
742372439,Great location and super stylish space  we loved it 
742368284,The place is perfect location   beautiful building  beautiful view  The inside was very clean  the beds were comfortable  it was stocked with plenty of towels and pillows and all the extras including laundry soap  I would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again  The place is perfect location   beautiful building  beautiful view  The inside was very clean  the beds were comfortable  it was stocked with plenty of towels and pillows and all the extras including laundry soap  I would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again  I had multiple emails stating to return the key fab to the front desk then after we had checked out we were asked to leave it in the room  Not a big deal and they did respond very quickly to emails 
742161496,I found parking behind the building for a great price and only a minute  or two walk from the apartment  Entry in was very easy with the directions given  The place was absolutely beautiful  Close to anything youd want  Loved it  It was the perfect location for my stay and I loved the apartment   Hopefully its available on my next trip to STL 
741968799,Our code would not work when we arrived  I called and the situation was fixed immediately  We were also able to check in earlier  The carpet in the bedroom had stains by the bedside and could use deep clean  I had to go buy spoons as there were only   so every meal we got done eating  I had to wash spoons  When we got there  every window was unlocked and cracked open  We started to shut them all  The window in the smaller bedroom would not close enough to lock so it was a little unsettling to sleep with an unsecured window  The beds were absolutely wonderful to sleep in  I would stay again  given the carpets and window were updated  The carpet needs deep clean or replaced  Very disgusting in the smaller bedroom 
741739790,Very quiet and chic room close to the park and WHOLE FOODS  Also  in a great area to take walks  Definitely recommend for couples or someone needing to get away  Thank you for the great hospitality  Always enjoy staying with ZenCity Hair throughout the bathroom
741532354,Great location  near great coffee shop and brunch places  awesome place  spacious  and  modern  would definitely return 
741271835,This space great  Especially if you are attending an event at the Enterprise Center  Clean space and easy check in and out  Fast response from host as well  I feel it is a great value for the money and great location  I can highly recommend  I loved the apartment  I was close to Enterprise Center and clean  Easy check in and out  Only suggestion I have is hot water takes a long time and add a coffee pot  Other than that we will be back when we visit St Louis again    stars for me
741084758,Great location  Great location  We had to wash all the dishes again before we used them  We also found the magazine to a firearm in one of the kitchen cabinets 
741078738,This is an affordable apt building  there were trash bags and trash in front of the apt door  Also the apt has a strong cigar smell  Loud neighbors  I ended up not staying there  host didnt give me full refund  in times of Covid this building is not prepared for health safety  this is an affordable complex for elderly people it was difficult to find and the code plus speaking didnt work the common areas had trash bags and trash in front of the apt door  it is too expensive for the type of building
401443884101904348,Stayed in this cute and modern Airbnb for a night and loved the overall vibe of the apartment  The apartment was somewhat confusing to get into but other than that I really enjoyed staying here  Was a wonderful and cute apartment but struggled with getting into the building especially when we were not given a key fob we also were awaken early by barking dogs so maybe mention in further listings that the building is pet friendly  Loved staying here other than that 
401368505859560272,Great spot 
740602133,The place was clean but had some minor broken things but nothing major  The place also had a cigarette smell when the rules say no smoking  Other then that the place was very clean and was exactly how pictures are  Also the balcony door didn t lock and no shade over door  Enjoyed our stay and would recommend  Went to check in and put the code in the lockbox but the code wasn t working had to call the host  He gave me a few different codes and then finally he told me a way easier to get in the apartment 
740352083,Nice space and a perfect location  We would stay here again as you can walk to so many nice restaurants and stroll in the park   We did have trouble getting into the apartment with their battery operated key pad but ZenCity  was quick to respond and got us in without a problem  Bring your own shampoo  cream rinse and soap as only a hand soap is provided  There are no extras in the kitchen bring your own food and essentials  there are plenty of pots and pans  The shower faucet is out of reach so you have to be in the shower stall to turn the water on  But overall a great experience  parking on site was easy and convenient  We re so enjoyed the space and especially the location   I would replace the door lock with a lock box key  much more reliable  A few more amenities in the kitchen would help  we would have liked a spatula  Shampoo  cream rinse and soap for the shower would help though we did have our own  Overall good  it fit our needs perfectly  We had trouble with the battery operated for entry  the host walked us through a procedure to override it 
400714053609429884,Arrived and followed instructions for check in  but the apartment FOB was not in the apartment  This is a problem because without the FOB you cannot use the private parking  you can only enter and exit the apartment building from the front door by entering a code  and you can only enter the apartment by using a different and much longer code  Having a small child with us made all of this much more inconvenient  Plus  who knows where the FOB was  It didnt make me feel confident in our security that the last users may be walking around the city with the FOB to our rental   Communication about the missing FOB was extremely poor  First message went unanswered  after a second message hours later  we were told the FOB would be delivered  as soon as possible   That was the last we heard about the FOB  we checked out five days later without ever receiving it  or ever receiving an update   The whole thing was a pretty bad experience  and I would never book from this group again 
399994271853046732,Run away from Zencity    This management company is a joke  The apartment required use of a call box in the foyer to gain access to the building  It was broken  so entry was impossible  They suggested having a resident let us in  that works great if you can find one  and whos going to do that at      in the morning after an evening out  They made zero effort to fix the issue throughout the weekend and we ended up on the floor of my daughters tiny apartment  They were very slow to refund a partial amount  then sent a checkout message with an attached bill for an additional       Airbnb has done very little to advocate for my wife and I throughout this mess  Very disappointed as a consumer and shareholder  Sell sell sell     This is a disaster  The call box that is required tho gain entrance to the building does not work  I used the Airbnb chat function without reply  so I called the commercial number  Fortunately  after being on hold for a bit  Francis  picked up  His suggestion was to find a resident of the building to let us in and that they have been having issues with this call box for several weeks  Yet no one tried to communicate that beforehand  It was a complete disaster  We had to sleep in the floor of my kids tiny apartment  No effort was made to correct the issue throughout the weekend  Then the icing on the cake is that I got an email saying it was time to check out and there was another      charge   I NEVER SET FOOT IN THE APARTMENT         Your  service  is terrible  thank you for the stiff neck from sleeping on the floor 
399926417169251130,Let me start by saing checking in was a nightmare  It took us literally two hours to find a key they  placed  in a keybox  in the end there was no key in the key box  So they asked us to go to the room and check if ths door was open  we went up to the room and the door was open  the room was not clean there was trash all over the place  bedroom was a mess as well  so they told us all they could do for this ome night is relocate us to another building  so they relocated us to another building  We HAD TO WALK through kc to another location not only that they seemed to give me attitude about the fact that they had to relocate me and on top of that the relocation was only for that one night since i was going to return to the original room I booked once they actually clean it  The next day when i return to the room i dealt with the same issues again  and it was about half an hour until i was able to retrieve a key from this ridiculous key box  when we finally made it up to the rolm realize the door was not even capable of locking I sent them a message and they never got back to me about it  so I spent the whole trip taking my bags with me in and out so that i was sure they were not stolen  they also never got back to me about the door never locking  literally was ths worst booking experiance of my life  I highly do not recommend  on top of that small things like Old dirty dishes  no air filter on the ac that bothered me quite a bit  Never use zen city  thank you for communicating me the first night but I felt I could not trust you after I told you the door cannot even lock and you guys never contacted me back about it 
399275727425333832,Thank you for the use of your apartment   The location was great   Thank you I would have given   stars if the things in my private emails to you didn t happen and my safety concerns were met   Thank you
398552181000128263,Clean apartment and convenient location  Right on the KC street car line so easy to get to union station and river market  Area also seemed safe  Thanks  Overall the apartment was great and worked well for us  It was convenient and clean  The check in was a little messy   they couldn t find the key  Also a little frustrating that the parking spot was sometimes taken and I was told to park on the street  Only other complaint was there was a dog barking loudly next door one night  But overall happy with it  Thx again
396325721431662106,Great location and great communication  The kitchen and bathroom were very clean but the rest of the apartment was not up to par   Overall a good value  all things considered Hi   everything was pretty good about the listing it the biggest issue for us was that the apartment was not very clean  The bathroom and kitchen were clean which was great but the rest of the place was not very clean  There were marks and stains on the walls and the apartment smells like a febreezed carpet rather than actually clean
394149229905684189,The apartment was clean and as described  A nice sized suite for my girlfriend and Id stay  Checking in would have been impossible if not for other guests helping us after their own difficulties  If intending to check in when other folks arent coming and going you may want to skip this stay  Otherwise it was quiet  close to the Power and Light District  and the shower head was excellent  If they fix the intercom or improve check in procedures I would stay again  Have to get that intercom fixed  luckily other guests helped us get in  and we were kind enough to pay it forward
394141744785373960,Everything was amazing except the instructions on how to get in didn t work  We ended up having to call the office to be let in  Other then that the apartment was amazing  Everything was amazing except the instructions on how to get in didn t work  We ended up having to call the office to be let in  Other then that the apartment was amazing 
394117806202890932,A beautiful place  and great location  Our only negative thing to say was check in instructions were not fully accurate and took some help from the apartment complex staff  otherwise great host  great place  it was a beautiful place  one star off because the check in instruction didnt work and were confusing  we couldnt get in through the front door callbox  and neither could other people who had airbnbs  not sure if they were through you as well  and then out instructions said to find the elevator on the right but it was down the hallway on the left and we didnt even need to take it  we were on the first floor  otherwise a great stay  just confusing to get into the complex
393423430305190385,Great big space  Lots of light and clean Place was very nice  Huge and modern place
392704087318082892,Great location and lovely apartment  Little troubles checking in with intercom but Zencity was quick to respond and I was able to get in quickly  Intercom was down but the gentleman from Zencity was very helpful and we figured it out
392023302329709668,I would be cautious to stay here  I arrived and never received the appropriate key card to enter the building and the gym  I was able to get a code for the exterior door  but was never able to access the amenities  even after communicating this issue to the renter several times on multiple days  The apartment had not successfully been clean and was dusty with dead flies in the window sills and the floor dirty  The toilet did not work appropriately and was never fixed during my stay   I had to go to the lobby to use the bathroom  There was also no hot water for the shower  which was also never fixed  I communicated all of this to the renter via Airbnb messaging and phone calls multiple times and they never fixed any of the issues  When you make commitments to communicate with guests  please keep them  You told me you would communicate to me what my refund would be  then never responded
391305241129192377,This was a cool modern apartment with concrete floors that I didn t expect but that my kids loved  There were great views of the downtown area and overall it was a great stay  My kids enjoyed the amenities  rock wall  basketball  video arcade machine and ping ping table   Unfortunately the equipment needed for some of the amenities wasn t readily available and only able to be checked out at certain hours  Thank you for the info and helping on check in and out procedures  We had a great stay  There are a few things I would like to bring to your attention however    The apartment was not swept vacuumed when we arrived  Also some of the dishes were unclean and had food residue in them  The wi fi signal was not very strong and so there were a lot of interruptions while trying to stream shows 
391302353719975035,Great location  zen city was very responsive and friendly
391242754663117274,Cleaning staff returned the key   min after check in to the lockbox  was not masked  unit did not look like it was actually clean  air conditioner for room and living area was not adjustable  sofa back looked like it was broken and was not properly fixed assembled  no coffee pot or basic hotel Airbnb amenities  fob did not consistently work for the door  booked for a week stayed one night and cancelled and left the following day  first bad experience with an Airbnb after using for years 
389779075129777751,the bed is all messed up cheep frame pretty much slept on the floor there was literally no remote to the tvs I told support they no remote untill I left pretty didnt even stay my last night because i was uncomfortable nosy up rooftop party the bed is all messed up cheep frame pretty much slept on the floor there was literally no remote to the tvs I told support they no remote untill I left pretty didnt even stay my last night because i was uncomfortable
389140413882102486,Great location  Right on the free local train  Near many excellent bars restaurants and attractions  Quiet  Nice view  Lots of space  Perfect location to explore a really fun city  The place was great but I do wish there had been some food amenities  I understand it is probably a covid precaution but salt and pepper  Coffee etc would have been appreciated
389121809902844810,Great place to stay great location will come back
770024677,Zencity was an excellent place to explore Kansas City  It wasnt too far from Westport and it was right on the Plaza  There is no shortage of excellent restaurants and enjoyable activities within reach  The place itself was spotless and update  Overall  I was very impressed with this stay  The only downside was the parking spot  Unless you drive a smaller car  good luck getting into that spot  There is however free parking within walking distance of the apartment  so it was not a huge problem for us 
769935427,Apartment was dirty   food in the sink  hair in the shower  stained sheets  cupboards drawers open  I m not typically too picky about those things  but for the additional clean fee  I was disappointed the space wasn t clean  I love downtown KC and this is a quick walk to so many things  The lobby of the apartment is absolutely beautiful 
769378272,This place was awesome  I was staying in KC for two weeks for work and the location could not have been better  Right out front is the  free   tram and is within blocks of a ton of restaurants   The gym was great   One thing to note that I did not know upon my arrival was that although the listing specifies  coffeemaker   that meant a kettle and a French press  which we wish we would have known  Other than that  wonderful stay  Communication between the host was great  as they responded pretty quickly  Some of the outlets near the counter and couch do not work   Otherwise  great stay and location  The amenities were also nice 
769272129,Not recommended  Check in is horrible  The machine does not work  And the code to get the key is invalid  Response is so slow  It took    minutes for them to confirm that the code is invalid because of the key is not there for pickup  And another     minutes for them to figure out a way to get me the backup key  I think this should be all set before the check in and they definitely can notice this issue earlier and fix it  Parking is also not easy and they did not mention it in the listing  instead they said free parking is available  And they will message you a picture with only     free street parking spots which is a few minutes away  And it is first come first served  So you probably have to pay for the street parking yourself  What s worse  the street parking usually has     hours limit  Host usually reply the message after   day or just ignore your message  You can expect your questions to be answered only if you call them and wait for a few minutes for them to answer the phone  Or keep asking the same question for a few times and wait for at least a day to get answered 
769032685,Zencity provides  terrible  customer service   The electronic lock of my apartment door would not lock  and after repeated  unanswered requests for assistance  I gave up and found other lodging     No refund  no assistance  no communication  no help  no apology  nothing  I have repeatedly tried to communicate with you  with no response from you   I had to vacate my apartment early because the front door electronic lock did not work   I have requested a refund of the last two nights of my stay  because I had left  and yet again no response    Youll be happy to learn that I am now traveling to the cities where you operate on a weekly basis   I used your apartment as a trial to decide if you would be my housing provider   You wont be 
768967380,A good stopover from Interstate      a very clean place  Nice view on high rise building awesome place for quick stopover off Interstate       nice view nice hot shower
768951166,Beautiful place clouded by inaccurate  information and urine soaked sheets    I booked a month long stay in this Airbnb  Prior to arrival  I messaged the host and asked if parking and the gym would be included  They assured me that both would be free for my stay  Upon arrival I was disappointed to find that in reality  neither of these amenities we re available  I had to spend an additional      lining up separate parking and finding a comparable gym   Additionally  the place was not clean  There was hair all over the ground and in the carpet  If you do decide to stay at this Airbnb  look at the mattress and comforter that they give you  Both are covered in urine  I took some pictures but I do not believe that I m able to post them here on Airbnb  I would highly consider staying somewhere else  I have friends staying in other Airbnb s in the power and light district  These places are just as nice and quite a bit cheaper  For the price you pay this place simply is not worth it 
768945219,The only thing is that you don t have access to do laundry without a card of some sort from the main office  I was confused as to whom to speak to so I just waited  Other than that ZenCity was fabulous with any issues that I came across and it being my first experience with Airbnb I absolutely love ZenCity  Thanx Again AMSmith The only thing is that you don t have access to do laundry without a card of some sort from the main office  I was confused as to whom to speak to so I just waited  Other than that ZenCity was fabulous with any issues that I came across and it being my first experience with Airbnb I absolutely love ZenCity  Thanx Again AMSmith
768686849,It was a nice room  but I couldn t access it without the assistance of other people  which is frustrating during a night check in  We never got a key and scheduled to stay for   days   There was food crumbs under a coach pillow  a fork in the disposal  and we ran out of hot water once  I m not picky  but anyone reading this may want to know this if they have high expectations   I was not happy with my stay because I couldn t access the room I paid for without doing something strange  The problem was never corrected because they probably manage multiple properties and I am one person with one problem  Room should have a keycard Ran out of hot water on day   at night  but it wasn t a big issue  May be to someone else  There was food or something behind the coach seats  There was a fork in the disposal for some reason  The room is pretty nice  I wouldve stayed there if I could ve accessed the room without assistance from someone else
768619703,great space  great price  great location  thank you
768152351,Thanks again  I ve stayed here before   Nice place  Nice location 
767844477,Great stay in a very walkable location in KC
767841112,The apartment was nice and had perfect space for two people  It also had a fully working kitchen  including stove  oven  refrigerator and dishwasher  which was great  But overall we ended up having a bad experience  One of the main reasons we picked this listing was because it offered access to a washer and dryer  The key fob we got did not work on the door to the washer and dryer  Neither did it work on the door to the gym  We reached out to Zencity and they said they tried to reach out to the apartment management but got no response  They were not able to get us fresh sheets  towels  etc  despite this inconvenience either  Sometimes it was hard to reach them as responding to messages sent on Airbnb was slow and calling them resulted in long wait times  Also looks like calls are not well documented on their end because we first talked to one of the agents on the phone who said she will look into providing a reimbursement for the inconvenience caused  But next day  another agent said that they have no record of such a conversation  The space itself is fine  but I would not recommend this listing due to the poor customer service  I believe all the issues experienced are already documented over the messages that were sent on Airbnb  But basically it was the lack of access to the washer and dryer and lack of or slow response to questions 
767341732,Parking is a little difficult if you ve never been to KC  I had issues with the FOB but that was resolved easily  Overall an excellent experience in a gorgeous part of downtown  Everything was excellent  Parking was a bit tricky  I had issues getting the FOB but the call agent helped me easily  My only complaint  the fan didn t work 
767267301,Everything was as expected  Very nice place to stay especially if you are looking to explore downtown  It was great  Please replace the smoke detector battery  It was beeping during my entire stay 
765933257,Great location  great vibe  great locals  You shouldgive a heads up that there is no salt pepper oil  I left salt and pepper 
765704817,Everything was as stated  Not a ton of kitchen amenities   but they did have the basic necessities  There was a hint of odor smell in the apartment  Couldn t really nail down what it was  just slightly off  Only other complaint was the parking  as in small spaces with parking neighbors well over the lines multiple times  Otherwise  the space was nice  bathroom was big  awesome closet for storing bags   clothes and the windows doors to the balcony let in beautiful natural lighting  Building door code did not work when arriving  had to wait for someone else to let us in 
765655019,Fast check in  It was late  I needed place and they went above and beyond to accommodate my needs  Check in was super fast and it s in a pretty cool location really  Thanks  It was really late and you still took care of me  I really appreciate it 
765415756,Im planning on coming back       I am planning on coming back      
764916412,This rental is owned by a very large company  reducing this to sort of a Residence Inn  but without any phone or on site support  not to mention an Escape Room like check in      Got a problem with check in   Stand there in the hall and email them     Now beyond that the clean was hot and miss   Candy wrappers on the floor  crumbs in fridge  personal lubricant in bedroom  etc    The TV remote did not work   The Internet would not stay connected   no fix it was a weekend    The neighborhood is rather iffy at night   And noisy   The unit is across the street from a night club that blasted music with the door open  And all guests there were frisked on the way in  Yeah that kind of place    The unit itself was actually pretty decent  Nice view  well laid out and nicely decorated    It is about an easy   mile walk from Westport  the Plaza and the museum   And close to     so good location to get in and out of town    But no off street parking and during the week that is an issue with parking rules in effect    Zen City as an organization is clearly highly dysfunctional  A shame  This unit has potential  For the love of God  make it easy to make a phone call to you 
763729583,This unit is in a really great location and is very affordable  It s a two bedroom apartment with two bathrooms which extremely uncommon at the rate they re offering   I give Zencity four out of five stars  it was a great choice  I just didn t like the inability to control the temperature or inability to Access the laundry room       If you intend to use the laundry room check with  Zencity  Zencity booked  my stay fairly quickly and were not extremely hard to contact  Calls did take a little longer than most individual owners but it was nothing outrageous   There are a couple things that I didn t like like the inability to change the temperature in the apartment because the thermostat was locked with a code       overall it was very affordable in a great location and I really enjoyed my stay 
763472996,At first  Zencity was just fine  I was able to check in easily  I was a little frustrated that there wasnt a key to use for the door  just a   digit code  but I got over that  What I couldnt get over was the long curly hair that was all over the bathroom floor  For reference  I have short straight hair  I sent them a picture of it the first night I was there and requested a credit for the clean fee  They questioned whether or not it was from me and eventually offered me a       credit  Customer service  while responsive  was a different person every time  They just dont have the same human touch that you get from someone who cares  I didnt leave scarred or anything  but I will avoid them in the future  The property was not clean and Ive been ignored in my requests for a refund of the clean fee 
763374984,Great location and very nice apartment  Really great spot  awesome location  We had a really good time  apartment was very comfortable  Thank you 
761764258,Great location right in downtown   walking distance to a lot of fun places  Very clean   nice to stay in  Would definitely recommend it to anyone going to Kansas City 
761758411,Go here for the great location and easy check in out process  but nothing else  The apartments here are very poorly made  Here are some things we found in our AirBnB  a missing refrigerator handle  A hole in the bathroom door  as if someone had punched it   Walls so thin you can hear conversations and smell weed smoke from the neighboring unit  It all just felt cheap  The apartment served our purpose for our brief stay in Kansas City  but I cannot recommend this to someone else  Thank you so much for organizing our stay  but there is a lot of room for improvement  Yes  the location is excellent  and yes  the check in out process was simple  But the apartment itself was so janky and poorly put together  A missing handle on the refrigerator  A hole in the bathroom door as if someone had punched it  A wobbly toilet seat  Walls so thin you can hear conversations and smell weed smoke from neighboring units  A luxury apartment this was not  The whole thing felt very impersonal and unprofessional  especially considering it cost over       The apartment served its purpose for our brief  lovely  stay in Kansas City  but we will not be using Zencity again in the future 
761740201,Awesome location  Within a couple blocks from the power and light district The building was a little different I didn t see the laundry area or anything else  No signs  Read super closely before the checkin  Kind of a process  I thought it might have been nice if there would have been some bottled water in the fridge and or some snacks  Overall Super cool place 
761574435,I ve never written a negative review for an Airbnb before but my experience with Zencity was poor   When using Airbnb I expect small mishaps to occur  check in problems  something missing  etc   as it s part of travel and it s never materially affected my experience til I rented from Zencity  My fianc e and I were working from the building during the week and the WiFi was unusable  readings at several times were     mps download and    upload   It occasionally did work at a rate of roughly   MPs download and    upload but these times were unpredictable and lasted for under an hour and communication with Zencity was incredibly poor  I reached out several times to Zencity during the week regarding the WiFi problems and only occasionally received a response and no solution  The WiFi they gave us was the lobby WiFi which has its password posted in the lobby  There s a separate WiFi for residents that Zencity was not able to provide us  Upon leaving we mentioned our WiFi issues to one of the small restaurants in the building  all of which are great and I would recommend  and they said it was a known issue  The actual apartment was fine  the restaurants in walking distance were good  however having no internet connectivity is a deal breaker for me  and I would guess many others  at an Airbnb that mentions having WiFi 
761052072,Good location downtown  It was very quiet but we felt safe and the building was in a good location for exploring the downtown  Its an old historic building with a lot of charm  Thank you so much  Us and two other groups that we met all had a lot of difficulty getting into the building the first time   the voice box code does not work  The unit also wasnt super clean but we were able to deal with that  We would stay here again   thank you
761045312,Check in was difficult and not well explained  Great location and plenty of street parking  Apartment was decent but definitely not sparkling clean  The code we were given to get into the building and access the elevators didn t work  A key box would be      times more reliable 
760692954,Very nice location near the free streetcar  The apartment building is pretty fancy   However  this studio apartment had a distinct smell of cigarette smoke that was pretty strong inside the room  which was a bummer  The check in instructions provided did not work to get into the building  Luckily  a person working with a different Airbnb host company was nice enough to let us into the building and scan his keycard on the elevator to allow us to access our floor  Without this lucky timing  I dont know how long we would have been waiting to get in  Once we had access to the room  there was a keycard provided that allowed us into the building and elevator  so that worked out okay   The room was clean and very modern  sleek d cor  It is a cozy  th floor space with expansive windows  natural light and almost no drawers nor dressers in which to organize  Laundry pods had just run out and the bathroom soap needed refilling when we arrived  There were fresh towels provided and the bed and sheets were very nice  Was also very nice to watch a movie on the TV   if you have trouble getting it to work  try unplugging and resetting 
760688724,This place is terrible they charge you allot for clean fees and the place is clean half fast with hair on pillos and foot prints on coffee table etc  I don recommend this guys at all  This  guys need to do something about the cleanness of their apartments  So far I love the locations and the buildings but the  quality on customer service and clean place  is very poor even though We pay a very large amount as a clean fee when the places is clean half fast  Also I m a repeat customer and a business man that have use their properties many times and I got back no respect so they  have lost a loyal customer and I ll make sure my colleagues don t use their properties  You guys need to do something about the cleanness of your apartments  So far I love the location and the building but your quality on customer service and clean please is very poor even though I pay a very large amount as a clean fee when the places a clean half fast  Also I m a repeat customer and a business man that have use your properties many times and I got back no respect so you have lost a loyal customer and I ll make sure my colleagues don use your properties 
760175660,Great location and perfect for what we needed  Parking onsite was great as well 
759882016,Zencity is a helpful company with good customer service  The location of this Airbnb was great  I enjoyed being in downtown KC  I appreciated Zencity being willing to help me change my reservation  However  the checkin process was difficult  The code to get into the building didnt work  It took me    minutes before another resident of the building let me in  The man on the phone who helped me was trying but it would be helpful for the company to have a lockbox with the key downstairs at the entry  The room also smelt like smoke when I walked in the door 
759310826,This was a clean and convenient stay locationally  It is very minimal  which is what we were looking for  Only heads up we would have appreciated was there was a lot of street noise being located on a busy street  Thank you for hosting us  One note  we had   of us staying but there was only   bath towel provided  which was very inconvenient Our access code to retrieve our key fob did not work  The process of calling and retrieving it delayed our plans that evening Without receiving a response from the air bnb messages  it took us a while to realize there was another number to call for help Facing the alley and being on Main Street  it was very noisy
759118899,Check in was chaotic because the intercom was broken so everything in the building was locked  including elevator access  Zencity  couldnt get a hold of the building manager  so we pretty much fended for ourselves for an hour to even reach our apartment  There was also no assigned or reserved parking for guests  The intercom was disabled so we couldnt even buzz in or use the elevator until a tenant just happened to walk by Said they would call back but only communicated with me through texts No parking provided by building
759080847,Good location and room looked just like the listing 
758121789,Was a little disappointed in the cleanliness of the place  but it is in a great location and the building amenities are amazing  Would stay here again after a good clean  Messaged you about the shower and didnt get a response  I think the place could use a good clean  Both other than that  it was a great location  and loved the building and amenities  There was mold in the coffee pot  stains on the carpet  and blood on the shower door handle  The shower door was broken and it didnt look like a vacuumed 
756806933,This apartment is placed perfectly downtown  Parking is very easy to come by  it s within walking distance of major events and streets  and the price is unbeatable for anything else in that specific area  This is our new go to spot  Thank you for the great trip  See you next time 
756764220,Really good place overall  nice spacious single bedroom place  Could easily get an air mattress next to the couch to fit a small family  Pretty easy checkin and check out  Only issue is parking  it is street or alley parking  Thanks for everything  overall a really good place  Our check in number at the kiosk didnt work right away  however the host did a good job of getting it figured out and getting us checked in  The bathroom had hair on the ground  the rest of the bathroom wasnt clean  The couch was dirty and looked like it hadnt been clean  The rest of the place seemed decently clean  I liked the area  it really worked well for us  The cleanliness hindered it  parking wasnt ideal either  It worked well  we had no issues parking on knickerbocker as we found spots easy every time  The only issue was being such a tough side alley road 
756668690,The location and building are amazing   The apartment is in great shape and great   The host is awful at communication   It can take an hour to get a response and took me    minutes to get them to let me in the building     Do not schedule anything the day you arrive  it can take a long time to get checked in  Although the listing says there is a washer and dryer both of them are a paid for service in the building   These also require you to download an app and then the app charges you extra to use it   Be warned    Also the messages from the host tend to be canned messages and are not completely accurate  OK  checking in was a nightmare   First  I requested an early check in     am  and the host accepted the request   When I arrived at that time the current renter was still in the building and not leaving till    am   I left and came back at      pm   Then I could not gain access to the floor of the apartment   The instructions for using the intercom did not work   I had to wait an    minutes for them to get someone to me to let me in  The host responds vert slowly   Can take up to       minutes anytime you send a message  I loved the building and the location   The value would have been five stars if the host had put forth the effort to have better communication 
756655480,Exactly as pictured and described  Host is very responsive and thorough in providing details about parking  checkin and checkout  Location was fairly close to some popular areas  street parking was never a problem and the coffee shop downstairs was an added bonus  The noise from the hallway and other tenants proved to be quite annoying both nights we stayed  Additionally  the windows allow a lot of street noise in  The power went off from about    am one night  which was fine except for the large and extremely loud generator that kicked on and ran the entire time  The noise of that was impossible to sleep through  I m sure that is a very rare occurrence though  One of the bathrooms only had hot water  which you would think would be fine  except the shower was impossibly scalding  I did not tell the owner this during our stay though  so I m sure they will have that fixed quickly before your stay  Overall the place is a good size  clean  and feels pretty secure  It was well furnished and we were content with our stay  As with all Airbnb properties  be sure and check all the fees like the clean fee  service fee and local tax or regulatory fees  These fees definitely add up and may influence your decision about where to stay  Thank you for your quick responses  and detailed instructions  You made our stay effortless  Fairly close to several decent areas  but the other tenants in the building and the street it was located on was less than desirable
756173411,Bed was comfy  location was amazing  and the water was good and hot  However  we had trouble with building entry  and there wasn t any way to make coffee short of bringing our own coffee pot and coffee  I m not that difficult to please  Give me a smooth checkin and morning coffee and I m happy  I don t like giving negative feedback at all  but I want you to know where we felt the experience was lacking  bc maybe someone took the coffee maker  Maybe the person who last clean the unit  on April     forgot to leave coffee packets and sweep the floor  Maybe the entry process has changed recently and the instructions haven t been updated  All these things combined left us with a less than stellar experience  but we did sleep great  the water was hot and things were generally quiet  See below Instructions on how to enter the building were not correct  It said to enter on the side at       th st  The correct entrance doesn t have       anywhere around it  It says       just like the other side of the building  A kind gentleman who lives or stays there directed us inside the entrance    We were instructed by you to enter     in the keypad  then verbally deliver a   digit code  We entered     and got a busy signal  We tried entering the   digit code and were given entry  but the elevator would not go to the  th floor  We ultimately had another resident help us gain entry to our floor  The entry process was nerve wracking and stressful  No one likes feeling lost in an unfamiliar environment  Thank goodness for the kindness of strangers  Rug was dirty  had no been vacuumed  The awful instructions for entry  I ve never stayed in an airbnb OR hotel that didn t have coffee  until now  No elec coffee maker  There is a French press  which is great bc that s what I use at home  However  there is no kettle to heat water and no carafe or container to heat it in the microwave  There is also NO COFFEE  Absolutely nothing in the cabinets besides drinking glasses and plates  No Salt or pepper  Airbnb s are appealing to me bc they have more comforts than a hotel  This one doesn t  It has a lower level of comfort than a hotel  If you wish to continue providing this level of  amenities   you might want to warn people  It s an amazing building and the setup is great  but we were left wanting much more 
755624837,Well  there were several things that didnt go as planned  So the pros  the unit is nice and clean  Its also in a great location  right downtown    The cons  the check in process was a huge headache  When we arrived  we were told that we can enter a code to access the building  The code didnt work  We had to wait until a security guard let us in to the building and escorted us into our room  Without a functioning code  we cant enter the building nor can we access the elevator to reach our room  We were also expecting a key fob in our room so that we wont need the code to access the building  There was no key fob in our room  We proceeded to contact Zencity  and Zencity promised that we would have a key fob the following day  They also provided us with several other codes to try for the building access  On the following day  we left the Airbnb and upon return  we had the same problem  we were unable to access the building and elevator with the new codes we were provided  Again  we had to wait for the security to escort us to our room  Luckily  thy key fob was waiting in our room  Besides the check in process  the Airbnb was great  Thank you for letting us stay at your place  A few suggestions for improvement  make sure the code given to enter the building works  Second  make sure the fob is accessible in the unit  Otherwise  the place is nice and clean 
755366642,Was the absolute worst AirBNB experiencE I ve ever had  I couldn t gain entrance to the building because the apartment number wasn t in the call box  Then couldn t get to my floor due to no key fob  Had to take the stairs to the  th floor  Once in the room I was informed that the key fob was in the room but it wasn t  When I contacted customer service they took forever to respond which led me to not be able to go to work that night because I wouldn t have had any way back in the building  So I was stuck in the building all day and night because they didn t get back to until the next day  After asking for a refund things started happening but still not in a timely fashion  After  pm the next day I finally got a key fob  Never again will AirBNB with this company  Make issues a priority  Call box didn t have apt number in it so I couldn t get in the building until someone let me in  Took forever to respond to my immediate issues 
755345730,Enjoyed being close to the Plaza  Enjoyed our stay   A private note to let you know there is a light bulb out over the bar and the extra ones in the condo do not work in that fixture   Also  the curled carpet corners are a tripping hazard and the old carpet tape isn t holding any longer   only a nurse like myself might care  Pretty good detail except this property did not require an elevator as stated so was a bit confusing at first 
755076960,Thought place was bigger says it sleeps   but it do not only one bed
754306250,We enjoyed our stay at this location  We only had one little hiccup when checking in  the key cafe number provided did not work  Thankfully when I called the number in the listing someone opened our key box remotely   We appreciated the availability of dishes  silverware and cups in the apartment  There was also a stash of other cookware that you might find useful when preparing a meal in and there were supplies to clean up afterwards  Everything we needed was already provided  we really enjoyed our stay  We enjoyed our stay at this location  We only had one little hiccup when checking in  the key cafe number provided did not work  Thankfully I called the number in the listing and some opened our key box remotely   We appreciated the availability of dishes  silverware and cups during our stay 
754275749,Excellent location and walking distance to the Plaza   Fantastic building  too  pool  fitness center  etc     I would highly recommend  We had a great stay   The check in instructions were great  location and space were awesome  and easy process   The check out instructions could be more clear   I put the key fob where I found it  but wasnt sure if I needed to strip the bed  wash the towels  or do anything else   The bathroom could have been a little cleaner  too  especially the shower    Other than that  it was wonderful 
753498953,I wish I could give an accurate description of this stay but I was not able to access the apartment and therefore didnt stay  The codes that Zencity sends in the instructions for access to the apartment did not work  After contacting a Zencity representative  she was not able to to get the access to work either and promised a full return from Zencity  I am still awaiting return from Zencity and response from Airbnb  I am still waiting for a full refund from Zencity for inability to stay at the Airbnb because I wasnt able to gain access as the codes were invalid and when talking with a representative  she was unable to help and therefore we were not able to stay at the Airbnb  Unable to access I was given instructions to access apartment that were invalid and spoke with a member of Zencity that was unable to help as well Didnt get to assess because I wasnt allowed into the apartment
753384852,If youre in town because of a conference at the convention center  this place would be alright in a pinch  we werent and I wished Id picked a different spot  to get to the key you need to walk into a parking garage and get from a black box on the wall  you can find cheap or even free parking by going a few blocks north and finding a meter or neighborhood  the garage is a waste of money  the building is an odd mix of residents  airbnbs and businesses  you have to check in with the security desk  then use your pass with the first elevator in the right  room      was very hard to open  just keep cranking the key and push hard  the apartment itself is cute and has nice views of the city  the entry layout is weird  the kitchen is small and unequipped  fine its you arent planning to cook  the thermostat was also weird  push the on button until it turns green  then hit mode until it moves to heat or cool  then use up down arrows to change  the bed is kind of small but comfy  the shower drain did not work  I had to prop it open with my fingernail clippers  they only provided   big towel for   guests  the tv remote did not work well  not sure if it needed new batteries  other people were still logged in to most of the apps so be sure to log out on your own  overall  I would not stay here again and recommend you find something else  preferably closer to Westport or north by the city market  hello  I recommend you make a visit to this property and update some items  very specifically  the bathtub drain is broken and wont stay up  I had to prop it open with my fingernail clippers  the door was terribly hard to open  most of the furniture is worn  theres no coffee pot  more instructions on how to use the thermostat would also be nice  however  the views were lovely  I didnt understand we were to walk into the parking garage to get the key  we drove in not realizing what was going on  finding and using the right elevator was also an issue  we asked   questions   different times through the app and never received a response  it was an ok destination  next time Id stay in Westport it was affordable but not as nice as I thought itd be based on the other prices in the city
753354758,broken bed frame refused to fix properly the cleaners are rude and not good at their job broken bed refused to fix and only one key with SOOOO MANY DOORS TO GET THROUGH I was locked out so many times unable to get in for hours
753349664,Great location I wanted to check in at   am  wasnt allowed to check in till after  pm after sending request ahead of time  water was not hot  Asked to check in at   am and did not get a response in time to check in  Wasnt able to check in till almost midnight becuase i did not get confirmation on the   am check in
753315872,great place with the best amenities the pool was great and personal balcony overlooking was a great touch I will say again very soon  
753043399,nice place but very bad heck in and in my opinion that is the most important part so your guest are to get into there place and relax not worry and be stressed out plzz in the future make it to where guest can check in on the weekend because if there have been people going into the building i would not have been able to get in wrong i info to  check in had to wait    before someone answered
752868790,Love the place updated apartment in an older building  Very charming
752700570,This room is beautiful and has everything you could possibly need organized neatly into a clean modern stylish space  I was very impressed and couldnt ask for a better stay  Iloved that there was clean equipment and an abundance of extra supplies and towels  Communication was precise and location is perfect  thanks so much for such a great experience
752375957,The location is perfect  but thats it  After fees this came out to a little over     dollars per night and I would have expected a little more cleanliness  There were foundation stains on the pillow  the headboard has completely broken off and has been held back together with zipties  There was no liner in the bathroom trash but someone left their chewed gum there  There is no real shower curtain  just a thin clear liner  There was a used soap bar in the shower  and the toilet wasnt scrubbed  We were lucky someone happened to walk in while we were trying to check in because the intercom system in the instructions was not working at all  I wont be booking Zencity again 
752134214,Great location  Super amenities  Upscale neighborhood  Safe  The location and accommodations are perfect  You may want your clean person to check the balcony  there were cigarette butts and a bottle with yucky cigarettes and maybe chew  that was left behind  There was also a random q tip laying on the bedroom floor as well  Other than that  which is minor  we loved our stay and slept well 
750763350,Key fob was not in the room as promised and we were given an incorrect access code for the building  otherwise it was a decent place  The key fob for the front door  gym and elevator was not present in the room upon arrival  That alone prevented us from utilizing most of the perks of the place  and we couldnt really leave our room because the access code to the front door and elevator did not work  It would have been fine of we had the key fob  We were given the wrong code for the door  They did not get back to us until   in the morning with a potentially correct code 
750584625,I do not recommend staying here  I could not access my own unit until another resident of the apartments helped me in and used their fob to use the elevator  They took forever to respond  And then there was supposed to be a fob in my room so I could leave and come back as I wanted  There was no fob and they never got me one  My pregnant girlfriend and I were unable to leave because we would not have been able to get back in    I also talked to   other groups of visitors that were coming through zencity and they were also experiencing just as many frustrations  I was unable to get into my unit because their instructions on getting in did not work  The intercom and code did not work  After over an hour of not being able to get in  they set up another code for me to get in and that still didn t work  The floor was sticky and there were dirty utensils in the drawer 
750416098,wonderful place to go It was very peaceful and I most definitely would love to come back  Thank you very much 
750385818,Great place to stay  Went for a weekend trip to Kansas City and this location was perfect  Near many shops and restaurants that are in short walking distance  plus a safe and nice area of town  Definitely recommend and would stay here again     Thank you for a great stay  The only recommendation I d have it providing check in instructions earlier in the day for the guest instead of having me ask for them at       pm the night of my check in  Otherwise we loved the space and it was a great location next to shopping and restaurants  Plus I liked having parking in a garage to be off the street 
750355367,Cool vintage setting  We loved the amenities and the location  Thank you for having us  We weren t informed about an important event that would taking place right next to our room  A photo op was set up right in front of our door  There was glass shattered in the room and we kept stepping on those glass shards everywhere 
750090198,It s a nice location and well worth the price  If it wasn t for the nice employee who was standing next to the intercom when we arrived theres no telling how we would have got in as the intercom just wasn t accepting our code  Also we never found our key fob There was a wet wash cloth  black  left in the bathroom hung on the shower curtain Rod  We never touched it so it ll still be there when the cleaners come in
750041450,The location is great  You truly cannot beat it  The restaurant downstairs  Canary  was absolutely amazing  We ate there twice  The apartment however was dirty and the bathroom door doesn t shut  The walls had dirty marks on them and there was random pennies and coins on the floor and Bobby pins on the window  Overall  the apartment did not feel clean  The tv also didn t turn on to anything other than a screen that said  fbi cam  so that was extremely weird  We tried to have the tv issue fixed and we tried to address the issue of cleanliness and the owner was extremely rude  Such a disappointment because we truly thought it was an amazing location  The lack of help was extremely frustrating and the apartment was not clean at all 
750008914,I had lived at this apartment complex a few years ago and was excited to find an Airbnb in it  There is no better location in KC  It s right next to the Plaza and so many places are walkable  Easy check in and parking situation  The unit was just like the pictures  The only negative was when we got to the apartment  there was a lingering smell of cigarette smoke  I told the host but unfortunately they never replied or acknowledged it  I m not sure what happened but that was disappointing  But overall it s a great place 
749979154,Clean  Good location overall  Not responsive  they were late telling us how to check in  we had to call after    mins  and we asked them to fix the smoke detector which was nonstop beeping and they said they would but never did Not fixing the constant beeping of the smoke detector after we asked   wanted it done within    hours before we went to bed was disappointing  We barely slept last night
749963841,A very clean and tidy space  The building is very secure  and is about     mile from the power light district  There was plenty of street parking  and we didnt have to worry about having our car towed  Pretty much all of the street parking on the weekends appeared to be free  Getting into the building was a bit complicated  I did appreciate the security  Everything was very clean  and tidy  The space was great  Putting in the   digit code into the door every time my wife and I came back was a bit annoying  Also  I believe the main light may be burned out  We couldnt get it to come on 
749915492,My husband  good friend  and I enjoyed our stay at Zencitys place  The location and communication was excellent  the unit was clean and well furnished  and the lay out worked very well for a group of three people  We would stay here again  Enjoyed our stay  thank you  Check in was generally fine except there was not specific instructions as to which two elevators to use and how to use them   We spoke with security about it after having some issues  
748943237,We had a total of   people with no music getting noise complaints  We kept volume to a minimum  Left the same day in case of additional charges for noise because we wanted to be respectful  Overall disappointed we couldn t stay at the place I purchased  We had a total of   people with no music getting noise complaints  We kept volume to a minimum  Left the same day in case of additional charges for noise because we wanted to be respectful  Overall disappointed we couldn t stay at the place I purchased 
748881730,I had a wonderful stay   The place is conveniently located  stocked with basic supplies  and in a great neighborhood   The balcony was my favorite place to rest after a long days work   The owners are very responsive and helpful   You wont be disappointed  Thank you for allowing me to stay at the apartment   Just to note  the door seems to need to be exactly aligned in order to be opened   It took several tries each time I returned   There is a foul smell in the kitchen  I believe its coming from the sink 
748704773,Super convenient place to stay  Everything is super clean and modern  Plus they have a gym which was great to use  Overall a       stay 
748688877,other than a rocky check In the stay was great The building is over the top with security and if course thats going to make things difficult  at check in was a process just to get into the building but where I ran into problems was getting the elevator to go to my floor  You have    seconds to do it and for the life of me I could not get the elevator to take me to my floor  after several attempts an office lady saw me getting frustrated and got me taken care of   once I got in and my access card it was al gravy  I saw several other folks having the same issue  somewhat slow to respond and didnt get me directions on how to get in untill    mi mn after check in I just thought the clean fee was excessive but I guess not in this day and age
748524110,great place to stay
748501448,location is nice  bed was comfy  other than that the rooms seemed unclean towels were out of place and smelled dirty  also hair on sink and tub
748489283,it look just like it do in the pictures  the washer n dryer is located down stairs and it cost so bring quarters  other than that everything was great  it took a while to get the code for the door to open
748367538,Room was not clean and not equipped as advertised  Floor hadn t been vacuumed  Trash under the bed and dresser  Hairs on the sheets and towels  No duvet on the bed  no extra blankets  No coffee maker    Rooftop area is not as pictured  no cushions on seats  Both the rooftop bar and the lobby are still under construction and I never saw anyone at the front desk    Messaged the company through airbnb at   pm upon arrival and at   am the next day still had no response  Both times I called I was out on hold for    minutes before someone spoke to me and then there was no clear timeline on when the issues would be addressed  Ended up asking for a refund and leaving two days early  Would not recommend  Not inspecting the room before checkin  During Covid  Really   The lack of clean and the lack of communication were both infuriating  I didn t feel safe or comfortable during my stay  Please get housekeepers who thoroughly clean and have your manager inspect the rooms before arrival and please please answer the phone promptly instead of routinely having a    minute  hold  time before you even speak to a guest  Disgusted and disappointed  Rooftop was not as pictured  no cushions on chairs and no instructions on how to access  No signage on property to direct either  Hairs on both sheets and towels  Stains on pillowcase  Makeup stain on wall in shower  No can liner in bathroom trash can  Floors not vacuumed  Trash on floor under bed and dresser  Messaged the host through AirBnb immediately on arrival about the apartment not being clean at   pm and at   am the following day I still did not have a response  Called twice to try to get the apartment clean and both times I was on hold for    minutes before someone answered the phone  Apartment not as pictured  No duvet on the bed  no extra blankets or pillows  No soap in the bathroom  Coffee maker incomplete so it didn t work  Apartment not clean upon arrival  Host hard to reach  Will not be staying again  don t bother coming here 
748273804,A nice property for ONE person   Conveniently located   The building entry process is not the most efficient   Security is good  A nice property but customer service remains paramount   Two days in trying to get into the property is absurd  I did not feel a sense of urgency from your team to rectify the issues at hand  Apartment much smaller than pictures show   Insufficient towels and linen provided   Kitchen utensils greatly lacking  A very nice washer and dryer somewhat offset linen challenges  Extreme difficulties checking in   I had to get a hotel for two days because the lock box was inaccessible and no keys were available  Multiple texts and phone calls required to get issues rectified   People were ver cordial but response times were poor  Nice location  Convenient to downtown and highways  Nice fitness facilities added value 
747986373,Great spot  walking distance to the Power and Light District  Clean space and easy check in  Would stay here again  Thanks for a great weekend 
747966333,Waited an hour upon arrival for the apartment to be clean from the previous guest  The host said he would make a few adjustments to the trip to accommodate but there was no follow through after that  I spoke to   different  managers  of the property and they were responsive but not helpful  I do NOT recommend staying here  Host Cleaning lady was an hour late  The host was responsive but unhelpful 
747936172,Great location  Beautiful views of the city  Tram is convenient and it is also an easy walk to get to places  Would definitely stay here again  Thanks Zencity  Bathroom with tub did not have hot water  Coffee pot would be nice touch  Other then slight cleanliness issue  it was overall a great place  Would definitely stay again  Beautiful views  nice style and friendly and helpful security Chips under couch  face mask behind bedside table  squished dead fly over desk  stained armchair Security guard let us know it was for apartment tenants only
747838526,good location   however this felt like an overpriced hotel room with complicated entry and subpar amenities  check in was difficult   the intercom outside to get in was finicky and didnt understand us well   there was no fob inside of the room to get in easier  the bathroom door handle fell off as soon as we got inside   bad lighting and several of the outlets didnt work  intercom didnt register our voice very well  felt like an expensive hotel room   not very homey
747460239,This location is amazing  Walking distance to great shops  restaurants  architecture  and if you are feeling up for it   museums  Not sure if it s COVID related or what  but be prepared to bring your own amenities like coffee filters  unless the ones we left are still there   there were some Splenda packets though    But with great coffee shop s near by  maybe you don t even need to worry about that  I am truly sorry about the noise complaint  Never in a million years would I think it unreasonable to do a quick workout at      in the morning  Particularly when it s raining and when there s a pandemic happening  Im not sure why someone would be so petty  Particularly to go so far as to lie about a pet being with us  I wouldn t even have a dog in my own home  let alone someone else s and without permission  Accuracy was good  Unfortunately  a lot of the reviews were pretty accurate too  There s a coffee pot but no coffee  which we figured due to reviews  but there also were no coffee filters    that alone is a blasphemous  There are nearly     filters in the cabinet now though  The bathroom was pretty clean  The kitchen at dirt on top of the fridge and we found dust bunnies or something in the cups    dust bunnies  The carpets seemed like they hadn t been vacuumed in quite some time  The cleanliness issue is largely the reason for the low rating  We were frankly a little shocked at how rough it was  The location is without doubt fantastic  But the cleanliness was shockingly bad  And the lack of basic amenities was pretty bad too  see the coffee filters comment  Another issue  we received a noise complaint after we did a workout in the middle of the day in the apartment  Had we done this in the evening or at night  I could      understand this  But there s a pandemic goin gym on  and it was raining so outside or the gym were unsafe and not viable  How can you not do a quick    min workout in the middle of the day       AM   in the comfort and safety of the space you are staying in  Prisoners even get that luxury  That said  the staff was very friendly about it  I m just shocked that the neighbors bugged out like that  And lied and said we had a dog on top of it  we had no pet   Aside from that  our stay was pleasant  Come prepared with your own amenities and prepared for absurd unreasonable neighbors and you will for sure enjoy your stay 
747378759,Decent location  Parking is a bit tricky  The apartment is great value
747176200,Amazing stay    Thank you so much
747080028,Good location  easy check in and out  Id stay here again because the price is right  I felt safe  etc  Just wish the place was cleaner  looked like grease on several surfaces  floors not clean   Could see greasy fingerprints on chairs  couch  etc  Floors in the bathroom and kitchen were not clean  I had to wipe my feet to put my shoes on because of something sticky on the kitchen floor   Hair on the bathroom floor  Not a big deal  but looking up from the bed I could see dust spilling over the side of the ceiling fan blades  Otherwise things were tidy enough  The price was right  Id definitely stay here again to stay within my budget  I just would hope that for a couple hundred dollars I wouldnt have to clean the place myself before I enjoy my stay  Location was great  we were able to walk to the Country Club Plaza and could have walked more places if we wanted  Easy to check in and out and I felt safe  Walls are thin so we could hear neighbors moving around and doing laundry 
746839022,Great location right near a tram stop and easy walk to the Rivermarket area  Very secure building and nice new  albeit a small studio  apartment  The apartment had everything we needed for a three day stay  The kitchen had enough cooking items if you really wanted to cook and the full sized washer and dryer would be great for longer stays  Had some questions and got quick responses  Loved the dedicated parking spot  since parking isn t always easy in that area  We didn t even need our car  since the tram or our feet took us where we wanted to go  Will definitely come back again 
746811034,It was a great stay  Was a little disappointed that there was no coffee in the apartment but there was a coffee maker  Other than that it was fantastic  I thought there was supposed to be a washer and dryer but there wasn t  I may have been misunderstood
746801920,This was a completely awesome stay  Wish I had booked it for a longer stay  Lots of amenities and not enough time to use them all  Thank you for all the help during our check in and dealing with building manager  I will definitely choose your units above others  Building manager was completely rude and because i wasnt dressed in a prom dress she almost did not let us access the building 
746594978,Probably not the best place to book  First room I showed up to wasn t clean  so the put me in a second room  which smelled like cigarette smoke  Third room was finally ok  They upgraded me to a bigger room for the trouble  Room was a little dirty and there was definitely a lack of homey ness  This place would probably be fine for a business trip or if you don t plan to spend a lot of time in the actual room  Place is in a good location too 
746383037,We would definitely stay again  Bring your own coffee pods if you want coffee  Place served the purpose well for two people downtown  We really enjoyed our stay  Cute little place  Glad we were only staying one night due to no washer or dryer but it was no problem  Would love to have a couple pods of coffee available  Again don t mean to seem ungrateful just a couple suggestions  And would ve loved to had the check in instructions before we arrived and didn t have to wait  Would stay again  We were there waiting for about    minutes before we were given instructions how to get in See above  Just would have liked to have had the instructions before we arrived
746182482,Such a cute place   Nice location and very clean 
746148053,The apartment is gorgeous  but we had a bunch of problems with check in  Also  the apartment we were in had a large gap around the door  and it felt like the door was barely staying closed  It desperately needed a flip lock like you see in hotel rooms  There was a small selection of pans and dishes  utensils and knives  plenty of silverware  but no measuring spoons or cups  Odd    The location was great  though  and we really liked the apartment  It was minimalist  but very stylish  The gated parking garage was really nice  and somewhat made up for the dodgy apartment door  Also  there were a lot of amenities  It was annoying that the instructions didn t make clear that the remote for the garage is also the fob for the access doors in the garage  pool room  outdoor pool area  workout room  business space  etc  There s also coffee tea service downstairs  too    This a great place to rent  if they ll just fix the door and provide better instructions for accessing everything  There is no seal around the front door  There is a significant gap  wide enough to see into the apartment a tiny bit from outside  and definitely wide enough to let in any noise in the hall  which implies that the reverse is true   At a minimum  a flip lock needs to be installed  so the door can t be completely opened  It really needs a proper seal installed  all the way around   And the instructions  Guys  as good as almost everything else was  those instructions were garbage  We seriously will think twice before staying with you again  And that s really unfortunate  because I travel to KC frequently for work  and we liked the apartment  The process was just way too annoying  After having to text to get the entry instructions  we had multiple issues with the keypad  before a resident actually let us in the building  Once inside  there was a ridiculously long key code for the apartment  The garage remote and fob actually worked great  but it took us a while to figure out that the remote worked AS a fob to access all the amenities  Never saw that in the instructions  With clear instructions  this all would have been okay  but the code for the apartment door was the only thing we didn t have an issue with  We felt that the instructions were sub par  at best  There was several big  obvious  cloudy streaks on the island  which made us question overall cleanliness  There was also something splashed on the ceiling over the island   Dishes were still in the dishwasher  but we d still give   stars  
746123929,Nice condo  Slightly larger than an average hotel but better privacy and a kitchen  The listing had listed a washer   dryer  I assumed it was in the condo 
746102751,Help us with moving into our new home  Thank you
745658345,This place was great  it was the perfect distance away from everything and was super clean  We really enjoyed staying here and everything was super easy as far as checking in and accessing the apartment  Would definitely stay here again  We had a great time stayed at this apartment  It was the perfect distance away from everything we wanted to do while we were visiting Kansas City  The space was perfect for us and we really enjoyed it  Thank you for being extremely clear on how to access the apartment for check in  it was really helpful 
745629484,The place was clean and check in was easy  However the walls are a little on the thin side and we could hear people in the rooms next to ours talking during different parts of the stay  Not knowing the city it wasnt in the safest part of town 
745426285,My husband and I are pleased   can t wait to return   Fast responses   very great place      Me and my husband enjoyed our stay   Very well accommodated   
745424014,Lots of space to move around and very clean  The pool area is beautiful and theres a gym next door to the unit  Location is perfect  You can walk toThe Plaza shopping and restaurants  My family and I enjoyed our stay  Would certainly recommend  Thank you so much for the wonderful stay  Very comfortable for me and my family 
744691292,No comment   We thought we were going to have access to the amenities but we didn t 
744621318,Perfect location and price   Love these Lofts   I always enjoy staying in these Lofts   Hope they are available when I come back in town  Also  Parking was right on the side of the building so that was great   Nice and cozy on the inside  
744613475,Our stay was incredible  Just as advertised  we were in a perfect location to enjoy everything the Art District had to offer  Had the weather been a little warmer we likely would have walked or used scooters to get everywhere we needed to go  The space was comfortable and fantastic for our little getaway  Would absolutely stay here again  Thank you so much for hosting such a great place for us to stay  We truly had a wonderful trip and will absolutely be keeping you in mind for the next time we re in town 
744611583,It was nice enough  but the walls were paper thin so a random phone call the neighbor took woke us up at  am  The walls were paper thin so lots of noises work us up all night 
744374958,ZenCity always has the best Airbnb s available in Kansas City 
744371821,Great location to explore the rolling hills and surprises of Kansas City 
744359588,Enjoyed my stay   I slept well and was very comfortable overall  The cleaner could do a better job  but overall it was still acceptable  There are a lot of options in the area nearby 
744339918,My guest and I enjoyed our stay  Nice area close to the Power and Light district with plenty of options for food and entertainment  The place was nice and clean  and had a nice gym to workout in  I will definitely book again in the future  My guest and I enjoyed our stay very much  No complaints really 
744337380,Great place and location  Was able to get street parking without issue during my stay 
744134661,      minutes to check in  The code to unlock the key box and retrieve the key was incorrect  When the host   Zen City  was contacted there was no immediate response  I then contacted AirBnb who responded promptly and tried to contact the host as well  After a long wait Zen City was contacted and they opened the box remotely  Unfortunately there was no key  I had to reach out to Zen City again and after some time they were able to find the key  Overall they were helpful but slow to respond     Kitchen sink didn t work  The water pressure was off and the water trickled out  I had to use the bathroom sink to fill a glass of water and wash my dishes  After a few days of dealing with it I contacted Zen city  They acknowledged the issue but never took care of it      The fire alarms continued to go off during my stay  Once at     am and another time at     am through     pm  When Zen City was contacted for any information on when the fire alarms would stop or if this problem was going to continue they again acknowledged my issue but never offered a solution   Despite these issues they were not completely detrimental to my stay  The apartment had a beautiful view being on the  th floor  The apartment was well furnished and had a great aesthetic  It was a quiet location and felt very clean as well  The location was walking distance from grocery store  I still would recommend to stay here despite the few rough patches  Great stay overall despite the multiple set backs  The place was furnished very well and felt very clean  Although Zen City responded to my complaints no further action was taken after acknowledging my issues  The log in number to retrieve the key from the lock box was incorrect  The host was very slow and unresponsive  I had to contact air bnb to help contact the host as well  After a   hour trip it was the last thing I wanted to deal with  Once we got a hold of the host  They took care of the situation as best as they could    The host was extremely slow in responding to the problematic check in  I had to contact air bnb to get a hold of the host     The kitchen sink water was only trickling out  I had to use bathroom sink to wash dishes and fill my water glass  I reported the issue and nothing was done     The fire alarms went off for two days in a row  Once at     am  and the next day at around     am till     pm when I left the complex  I reported the issue and asked if they had any info on the situation and when the fire alarm would turn off  The host responded and said they would look into it but never fixed the issue    Kitchen sink didn t work   Fire alarms going off for two days with no info on what was happening     The problematic    minute checkin
744076658,No communication at all   Wrong key code delayed my check in about a hour and the worst part I was woken up by pest control at    am on my second day there and they came in and sprayed while I was there in a studio   Messaged the host and told him what happen he responded asking if they sprayed I told him yes and also let him know that me and my guest left and he never responded I even messaged again later that day after I had to go check in at a hotel and he never responded  Then finally on my check out day he sent me a message saying he hoped I enjoyed my stay  No communication at all Wrong information waited about    minutes till I actually got the key Old soap marks in bath tub left Did not respond Second day I was woken up to pest control at    am and they sprayed pest control while I was there
744045221,Great location  clean place  good amenities  communicative host  Will definitely stay here again 
743842462,A nice little apartment with a good city view for a decent price The stay was good  but the check in was awful  After over   hours of trying to get help  I ended up getting access to the building from another resident staying there  Check in was at  pm  and I wasnt able to access the building after  pm due to a code pad malfunction or wrong codes given to me  I had to cancel dinner reservations because I couldnt access my room  I talked to   or   different people  and they eventually stopped calling me  I needed their help to access the building due to incorrect codes given to me 
743835358,Super clean   modern decor  Everything you d need to stay for a quick trip 
743801891,Accurate according to pictures  Good value for price 
743796476,This far the worst AirBnB experience we have had    The description was wrong  and clearly this host has no quality control or check in  check out process to ensure this place is setup    No coffee maker   There was a French press  but no way to boil water    Not even a pot or kettle    We finally got a kettle after many messages    No cable Tv  Only Roku    No forks  we got some day     No designated work area      Dining table has only   chair    We only had   towels    hand towel    No oven mitts  basically you can t cook in this place   There is only   key   huge inconvenience    They keychain was a plastic straw     The bottom line in my opinion is that this is why some cities hate Airbnb    This isn t someone renting their home or subsiding their vacation home     This is a company whose mission is to complete  badly  with hotels     I would avoid ZenCity in all of their locations  Find a new business It too far too long to get responses and it was clearly nobody read what we said
743646785,  star service    Thank you so much    stars   
743632523,We loved our stay  We will be going back  We loved our stay   We will be coming back 
743552049,Overall it was excellent  my arrival time  was a bit bumpy because the code to get my key didn t work at all  So I needed to context the host  which helped me remotely  So that was great  The building is incre ble  So incredible That I ask for a tour to see the entire building  Bathroom was super clean  But in the bed area I encounter some hairs which make me go to Walmart and buy detergent to wash Everything before I  went to sleep  The studio apt  Is comfy  has everything that I needed  The front desk service even is not related to Zencity was so nice on helping me with any questions I had  The Best part of everything is how secure I felt in that building  Unless you have the key to access the building you will stay outside  I will recommend this    Things  that I see it can improve  For people like me that works at hospital overnight  I will suggest getting blinds to block the sun light  Because you have washer and dryer   which is a plus  I will always have some detergent for my guests   This simple details makes our traveling more smooth  I did left detergent and coffee so the next person can use it  Over all  It was a great a amazing experience  I totally recommend this place for a single person like me or a couple  without kids  If you have kids you might find this place to small because is a studio apt  Overall it was excellent  At my arrival time it was a bit bumpy because the code to get my key didn t work at all  So I needed to context the host  which helped me remotely  So that was great  The building is incre ble  So incredible That I ask for a tour to see the entire building  Bathroom was super clean  But in the bed area I encounter some hairs which make me go to Walmart and buy detergent to wash Everything before I  went to sleep  The studio apt  Is comfy  has everything that I needed  The front desk service even is not related to Zencity was so nice on helping me with any questions I had  The Best part of everything is how secure I felt in that building  Unless you have the key to access the building you will stay outside  I will recommend this    Things  that I see it can improve  For people like me that works at hospital overnight  I will suggest getting blinds to block the sun light  Because you have washer and dryer   which is a plus  I will always have some detergent for my guests   This simple details makes our traveling more smooth  I did left detergent and coffee so the next person can use it  Over all  It was a great a amazing experience  I totally recommend this place for a single person like me or a couple  without kids  If you have kids you might find this place to small because is a studio apt  At the time of the checking response was excellent  But they say after that I needed the parking pass  Host took   day to respond back to me 
743540136,Very good location  minutes from KU Med Center  Downtown  etc   Quiet street  quiet building   Good restaurants within walking distance  Thank you 
743320826,Perfect spot for our staycation  The basket ball court  indoor soccer field  and climbing wall were such a treat for our   boys  The tram is right out front and we were one stop away from City Market and got to enjoy the farmers market there on the weekend  Youve got a bakery and great coffee shop right down the street and the apartment was clean  stylish  and had a great view  Could not have asked for more  Would have loved a coffee maker but was glad there was a french press  Gotta have that caffeine in the morning     It would also be great to have a basket ball and soccer ball in the room so that we can use on the lower level  We did not find a parking pass in the room when we checked in 
743308000,Wonderful experience for my first airbnb I really appreciate you giving me the chance for my first AirBNB to be such a great experience   
743283610,Great stay  Only minutes from fun places in KC   clean and convenient Thank you for a great stay in KC 
743252487,Nice view and comfortable place  Was locked out of the apartment due to incorrect key in incorrect lock box location
743195070,Perfect location  Add elevator instructions 
742691550,Very slow to respond to messages since you cant call anyone  Place could have been clean much better  No designated parking as described   We had to switch parking spots twice because someone parked in our spot twice  When i texted zencity they replied they would remove the vehicle but they never responded back  Its a great location and also a good value  But those were the only good things No designated parking space as described You could tell the place was clean really fast and with no regard Very very slow responses  Always had to message and couldnt call 
742647942,The location of this place couldn t have been better  It looks exactly like the pictures and was super easy to access  Checking in and out was a breeze  Thank you for letting us stay  the place was really beautiful and the location is perfect  The only downside was overall the place wasn t super clean and there were a ton of cigarette butts on the back porch Sheets had dried stains on them  some dishes were dirty and put away in the cabinet as well as trash left on the porch area
742455326,We love Zencity and look forward to returning to you soon We love Zencity and look forward to returning soon thanks I was never able to locate the washer and dryer on site nor did I get a response from the host when I inquired about it Again back to the laundry facilities location and no response from the host
742424106,Was a good experience  Thanks
742414630,Nice looking place  bigger than we expected  and a great location   The hosts ability to deliver on promises is not good  I have entered a      dispute with CitiBank   Host  Marty  told me in an email that I should withdraw the dispute  to make sure Airbnb doesnt give you any trouble there    Please advise what sort of trouble I might get in by disputing the charge   It sounds like a threat  but I doubt it is a threat from Airbnb  am I correct about that  Two of four burners on stove were unusable  coffee maker but no filters  reserved parking spot not enforced  Host is great saying action will be taken   Host is horrible actually taking action  Nice looking place   just the worst host we have ever had with Airbnb 
742408104,Beautiful space  Nice location 
742370117,love the comfort and smooth process everytime I stay with Zencity  definately Zen and Definately recommend  Really enjoy your spaces   Its easy to  feel comfortable  thanks so much  
742186119,The location  price and room was great  Thanks and I enjoyed myself   I d stay again for sure  The bathroom was not very clean and smelled like mildew 
742185199,This place was very cute and in a really convenient area  However  the apartment was very dirty  I would not stay here again  Said there was  enhanced  clean  The apartment was not clean  Not clean  Dirty dishes and crumbs on the floor  Multiply hair balls throughout the apartment The apartment was super cute  but was unclean  Would not pay the price since it wasn t clean
742183587,Place was really nice for a   day stay  Close to resturants and bars also grocery stores  The apartment was as described in pics but the check in was very very confusing  I would agree with past visitors  Also getting in and out of garage was tricky  Since there was no one to actually call i had to send messages and wait for a response  Well at   pm no one wants to be waiting outside in the rain  We had to lug our luggage from the main entrence and thru long hallways just to get into the room since no garage access  Dont think i would stay here again because of lack of communication from this company
742152406,YOU WILL BE SORRY if you book this loud dump at Roasters Block   Valet  trash stinking up the hallways for days at a time   RB issue not zen city s   Parking is not included although  zen city  will claim that it is  Rude residents slamming wrought iron pool gates throughout day and night  You ll need to bring your own detergents to clean clothes and dishes   I did   Boy Scout motto   always be prepared  Avoid this place like the plague  In case you insist to try it out be sure to remove the hidden listening device  I certainly did  Don t say you were never told  Worst ABB ever  I ll gladly spend more on a true hotel room then ever book a  zencity  property in KC St  Louis or Chicago   Nothing zen about it  Disingenuous and fraudulent  I never leave a property without clean up after myself  see the reviews of me as a ABB guest prior this until now  Was no point to do so  You should fire  kristy  the maid and take your listening device with you  Nothing  zen  about it  Parking pass that was stated to be included was nowhere to be found  Because  zencity  fraudulently claimed parking was included when in fact it was NOT  They attempted to state they were  sorry for the confusion  when truly only zencity is the confused clowns  Then they tried to con me into paying over a         extra    night stay  for parking several blocks away    NO THANKS     Pictures shown were of another unit altogether of similar layout   Parking Included  was a total lie and responses were condescending  Filled with dirt and body hairs that weren t mine  Disgusting    Place stank like vomit  Left the windows open the whole time  Faceless Boston based flunkies   internet company  allowed unit not to be remotely clean although chalkboard note stated that it was  Pandemic has every corporation claiming to be throughly sanitizing every thing but dirt was evident on every surface with a quarter inch of nasty dust nearly everywhere in this downtown  loft   BRUTAL Sloppy Well it was where they said it was  Right on Broadway  Loud as hell  racing cars  sirens all night every night  to be somewhat expected I guess as it is downtown  The loft building Roasters Block allows this unit to be used for AirBB because they cannot least if long term as anyone staying there hears nothing but slamming iron gates all day and night as it faces the pool courtyard  Pool was not open btw as it was last week of winter first week of spring  The Five people that congregated by the pool sounded like a riot gone wrong    nd floor right above stereo speakers made it worse  People who have rented it for a year have broken thief lease to get out 
742130499,Really nice room  There were a few things that were not stocked super well  and the patio was a little dirty again  but overall it was a really nice stay 
742115350,The place is just great  Clean  confortable  safe and so easy to arrive by walking to different places around the area        recommended  Thank you so much for hosting us  I love your place  I will recommend definitely 
741956008,Great place close to alot of stores  Keep in mind city parking though   
741951428,I love these Zen City places and to be honest I don t know if I ll stay in a regular hotel again  The clean fee is a little high but the location is amazing 
741788230,Fell in love with this place  modern  stylish  cozy  and the location is great  Absolutely a great place for a great price 
741600271,This place was perfect  Clean and comfortable with great location  Walking distance to everything we came to see and do in Kansas City  Perfect location  comfortable and clean  I might suggest a side table for the bed 
741584107,I had a great stay here  It was clean  nicely decorated  had a great view  and was only a    minute drive to the airport  Centrally located downtown  as well  We were surprised with how spacious it was and would absolutely stay here again  Highly recommend  We had a great stay  Thanks so much  Ill be in touch on my next trip to KC 
741579687,The place is not clean  Communication with the host is poor  I sent my concerns as soon as I checked in along with photos of the unclean areas  they offered to send out a house keeper the next day but one never came to clean and the host stop replying to my messages at that point  Photos are enhanced  Bed slept ok  Apartment complex is old  The place needs a new vacuum cleaner and the sofa needs shampooed Floors needs vacuumed  tub needed scrubbed  oven is filthy  sofa has stains and ash on it  surface tops sticky Responded to my first message about the concern on the cleanliness of the place  then stopped replying  said they would send someone the next day and never did
741571260,I d rate this a     Only thing good about the place is  Great location   nice place   The Airbnb we booked said it came with parking   Once we arrived they informed us that it doesn t include any parking   They just forgot to update their website   That was a little annoying    Main thing we look for is parking included    We drove around for awhile to find street parking    Also another thing   you can literally hear everything happening around you    Rooms very nice as shown in photos    If you don t mind hearing everything around you   maybe not getting a promised parking spot this is your place  Update your website for accurate agreements   You could hear literally everything   Place was nice at least Site said parking but actually wasn t available  Update your website information  People book with parking included  Kinda confusing when the person helping you out doesn t live in the state we re staying in   Also have a back up plan when things go wrong 
741257203,This place was ok at best   If you need a cheap place to stay then stay here   But if you are looking for hotel like qualities this is not the place for you   They can do a lot better with very little effort    It s the small things that matter and they have not yet grasped that  Things that would be helpful    A full body mirror   Non stained sheets  Matching pillows on the bed  as in the types and firmness    Two should have been one firmness and the other two the opposite firmness as the first two   Two extra towels and wash clothes   An extra blanket in the closet  A small thing of detergent or packs  Decent light fixtures in the bathroom  it was incredibly hard to see yourself in the mirror    The fixtures were utility room fixtures   Step up your game    A better bed frame   Very uncomfortable and not supportive   A COFFEE MAKER When you claim to have a  hotel  like stay it makes one think certain things   Hotels have matching pillow cases   No stains on their sheets   An extra blanket for the bed   More than two towels for their guests   Also  hotels  don t just have porn hub saved as a app on their TVs with full access   That was a grand surprise   Glad my kids weren t with me when that popped up  The floor you could tell was not swept or mopped   If it had been they did a very poor job of it   I was walking barefoot and my feet were so dirty afterwards   Also the bed sheets had stains on them  Well I thought it was a great value until I got there and realized their idea of cleanliness and mine was a really different idea   I have stayed at other places at the same cost and had a much better cleaner stay 
741244617,Outstanding and seamless
741144870,Great location  close to everything  nice clean place  Thank you  Asked about a missing parking pass and never got a response  Fees drove the price up quite a bit 
741094288,Good location  easy check in and out  Besides the smell and toilet situation  the checking in and out was very easy and the location was good  The price was also very reasonable  Toilet was not secured to the floor and moved   Living room had a musty stale smoke smell 
740351542,Great and affordable place to stay  Close to a lot of food places and shopping centers  Thanks for being a great host 
555066079611721310,This unit looks good in pictures but the building it is located in is really not nice  There was trash all over the grounds including the entryway and elevators  The hallways smelled horrible and the smell leaks through the door into the unit    Zencity staff are very responsive via messaging but there s no way to tell via this listing how rough the location of this unit is  We will not stay here again  We were really disappointed with how much worse this unit was compared to the photos and description on air bnb    The apartment grounds had trash spread all over the grass outside  entryway and elevators  The hallways smelled awful and the smell leaked through the door to our unit    When we arrived  half the lights in the building didn t work  The sheets had stains on them and the unit was clearly very old    We didn t feel very safe in this location either    The listing doesn t address the roughness of the building or the area and we would not recommend this unit to anyone else 
510894134424615150,Overall a good experience
746453152,A beautiful stay with amazing views   This apartment is located in the perfect location that is close to everything  Also  Extremely clean and stylish 
745459497,Family had an amazing stay  Locations is perfect  Apartment looks just like photos  Definitely would stay again 
554381501648889646,The bed was really comfortable and it was very close to where I needed to be but they charged me     for a dirty sink that was there before I got there The bed was really comfortable and it was very close to where I needed to be but they charged me     for a dirty sink that was there before I got there
747463390,Poor communication   would not answer a question we had about where to park  Relatively clean except the dishes and cabinets   cabinet handles were sticky and a lot of the dishes were still slightly dirty   sticky  Also no dishwasher  Apartment building is pretty nice though and in a good location Thank you for having us 
538436520762700090,Great value and location  Host communicates on well and always on time  Thank you for the great stay 
497889865161733681,My car was stolen while parked in front of the entrance   This listing does not include parking in the garage or gated area   I should ve NEVER stayed here   What a mess  My car was stolen while parked in front of the building   Right next to the entrance   Unacceptable   
745490965,Great place to stay  The only downside was the washer wasn t working   
745490080,Great location and views  Easy access 
397052238061570600,Great 
744708148,Great place and location  It was good for someone wanting to spend time exploring the city while having a good home base 
744705898,Zen city stay was pretty great  It was affordable and in a great location in St Louis and it was also fairly priced The blanket smelled of men s cologne as if hadn t been washed from the last guest use 
744687767,We had an issue with parking  If you book here  make sure you get your correct parking spot that is assigned to your room  Obviously we were disappointed in the stay  I hadnt mentioned to you yet that there was no hot water  The parking situation was frustrating to say the least  It definitely could have been prevented  I appreciate the gesture of reimbursement but it still didnt cover the cost of the tow and theres no way you could compensate for me not being able to get to work on the morning that it was towed  the time and resources it took for me to find where my truck was and go get it  It was      and they only accept cash  Im trying to communicate this to as directly and straight forward as possible without being unreasonable  I hate to say this was by far the worst Air B B experience I have had  I ill not post that publicly though 
744666239,The stay was great as always  Zencity has the best places available for the best price hands down  Thank you for another great stay 
744609744,This was a disappointing stay  We were supposed to stay   nights but left after the first night because the place was so dirty   We feel like this was falsely advertised for its cleanliness and the reviews all talked about how clean it was too  The place was dirty in a way that felt like it hadnt been deep clean ever  We reached out to the owners and they did respond and offer to have it clean for us but it wasnt one thing that was dirty  We felt too uncomfortable there to stay another night  The whole place was dirty  The description talked about how clean it was and that they were doing extra clean because of COVID  I feel like the reviews are false too because they all talk about it being clean and it was NOT   It was dirty in a way that shows it is not clean well ever   We actually left after the first night because we of the dirt 
744421891,Super cute place  Great location but parking is not great  You have to pay to park near the place you are staying  Slow and didn t really answer to what I was asking or saying 
744360651,Convenient location  Clean  Modern decor  Good for a short trip  Thanks for a lovely stay  Super affordable place that was in a perfect location 
507210434676810344,Everything was great besides the hiccups with the door code throughout the duration of my stay  Other than that great location  true to images and safe environment  Thanks for a great stay  everything was great besides the hiccups with the door code throughout the duration of my stay  Other than that great location  true to images and safe environment 
744139478,Parking isnt close  so be prepared to drop off at the door then park the car alone  There wasnt clear instructions about check out located anywhere  Overall  worth the price and convenience  to the hospital and Forest Park area  Thanks for the stay 
505030773780241080,You get what you see     good basic place to stay    Thanks    enjoyed the stay   
504468560596773211,Gross  This place literally wreaked of human feces  It filled the lower floors and slowly the upstairs  We left because of how bad the stench was  We tried multiple times for them to make it right and refund us  even brought in Airbnb  they couldn t be bothered to respond in a timely way  They also wouldn t respond to Airbnb outreach  DO NOT STAY HERE  Or if you do  go in eyes wide open  You re paying for the photos  not the accommodations  Stay away    Worst experience ever  You should be ashamed of yourselves for how bad the smell was  how bad your communication is  and your inability to connect with Airbnb  Literally  if will disparage your company any chance I get 
744124198,Great location  very close to the highway and downtown  amazing view from the rooftop  and located in a beautiful  quiet area  Thank you very much for hosting us 
744094927,Bathroom had a terrible odor  hair on pillows  dirty counters 
744057182,Was nice and close to the city 
744042885,The accommodations were great for our short stay  The street parking took a little bit of getting used to but there are plenty of spots around the city  This was a wonderful location because of its proximity to the places we wanted to visit  There were some construction noises heard through our walls during the early morning but other than that  everything was great 
510936149111642621,Place was great there is little parking though especially if there is an event at uptown  The worst thing was check in and the call box for us  They didn t relay the information to the maid of being another check in at    we got there around    and the key was missing from the box which ended up being that the maid still had the key 
743808215,Was clean and in a good location for the stuff we wanted to do  I would put the toilet paper in a holder instead of on a roller  Its really awkward when youre go to bathroom  It was a great location and space for our family weekend  getaway 
492719269710476742,Place was great for location  The studio is huge compared to  BRs in New York  Good value Loved the space  Hope to come back soon 
552857602859072002,Stay away from this place dont spend your money here very very outdated no Central air   The radiators made noise the entire time I was there  No sleep bed was not comfortable bathroom was disgusting they need to replace the sink and the bathtub and the flooring in the kitchen and the bathroom  I took us over   hours to get into the unit because the keypad was not working properly and no maintenance to help  We were sweating our butts off the first two days we were there because we could not figure out the radiators and no maintenance to help us The last day we were there they wouldnt come on at all so we froze and they constantly made loud annoying noises  The dishwasher is sticking out in the middle of the kitchen because it was not installed properly  The freezer and fridge were dirty and rusted Soooo many issues  This property needs major updates  unit is very outdated  radiators were too hot and couldnt figure them out and last night they didnt work at all  radiators were constantly making loud noises dishwasher needs to be installed properly  bed not comfortable  need dresser in bedroom  need new flooring in kitchen and bathroom and tub and sink need to be replaced in bathroom  and bathroom needs to be painted
743322028,Lovely space close to everything  We enjoy being walking distance from the park  restaurants and shops  Clean and comfortable  will stay again 
743304536,This is a great place  Very modern and clean  Its also in a wonderful location     minutes walk from the metro station and surrounded by great restaurants and bars  etc  Theres a little bit of traffic noise and the check in with door code was a bit difficult  but mostly it was a great stay  We loved it  but would have liked if the check in info would have given the detail about pulling the door toward you when putting in the code  The code to get in didnt work  had to call several times and wait on hold to get someone to answer  When I called about the code  I had to call twice and wait on hold  Its a bit more expensive than I normally like to pay for similar kids of places 
510912524300098482,Only bad thing is that there isn t really any dedicated parking  The place was nice and clean  easy to get to and super convenient Thank you
743238969,The apartment was a good size  great location being in the city  The heating and cooling controls didnt work    and the surrounding neighbors were really loud throughout the night  Thank you for the stay The parking was a bit confusing and it wasn t clear that I had to check in before I could park 
743131836,Great views  Great location  Clean and spacious  Parking spot is tight  but nice to have it included  Loved our stay   Communication before our arrival was very timely and helpful   We did have one question about parking once we were there that we never received any response for   Overall fabulous customer service  but would like to know we could have a contact after our arrival in case anything did arise   Hope to stay again and would definitely recommend 
742697878,The place is in a good location and we found street parking easily available  The kitchen was fully equipped and there was a comfortable desk for working  However there was strong smell that we had to manage with candles windows  The dishwasher and garbage disposal was not working and we contacted the owners and received no response  The washer and dryers are extremely loud and felt uncomfortable running it due to the noise to neighbors  Overall mixed experience  would have appreciated more transparency about the condition of the home  Smell
495644506909446797,Loved my time here  cute little studio perfect for me n my boyfriend would definitely stay here again      enjoyed our stay the place was great n clean for such a good price will be back
471019005227044425,Key fob was nowhere to be found which made it extremely difficult to get in and out of building  The entrance you are told to use is not the correct one  Additionally  communication was terrible  Responses all seemed automated with no real information to questions and response time was a day later  Communication was good until the stay  some help would ve been appreciated  Not having a key fob made the whole experience very difficult 
742694511,Great location and quiet neighborhood  Host was responsive with all inquiries  Very stylish place and plenty of amenities that made for a great longer stay   When having an issue with gaining access to the building  host was very responsive and helpful is providing the right information  Clean and awesome location  Thank you so much for allowing us to stay  had a great time 
552227616306672671,The apartment is in a nice but older building  The radiator heat can be found and controlled under the windows in both the living room and bedroom  I had a hard time finding it the first night  The apartment was very clean and had what we needed   Unfortunately  the shower stopped working while we were there  but Zencity was quick to respond to my messages  Though the shower was unable to be fixed during my stay  Zencity and Airbnb worked with us on a financial compensation and we moved into a hotel for the remainder of our trip  Im sure if the shower hadnt been an issue  the stay would have been great  just a heads up  but the recessed radiators on the walls of the living room and bedroom are hidden behind long window curtains  which may present a fire hazard  but also prevent heat from escaping into the room as it should  thats probably why it was cold the first night when I was there 
742386219,First off  this place is huge  I didn t realize how roomy it would be being a downtown apartment  The views of the city were incredible  It was very clean and super friendly staff  My only complaint would be we couldn t adjust the thermostat and it got warm in the apartment at night  We would absolutely stay here again 
742364970,Wouldn t recommend Bad door man Door man at building was a creep 
742191341,Always a great stay with zencity
742151737,I would not stay here ever again  Terrible communication  cold water in the mornings  they towed our rental car from the garage for no reason  refused to put us in touch with the on site property management to problem solve the situation  the common areas and elevators were disgusting  there was a constant cloud of weed and cigarette smoke  and the building was routinely left unsecured  I sincerely hope someone with some decision making capability reaches out to me soon so we can rectify this situation before I need to take it further  Every time I messaged the host to voice a concern I was connected with a different person who was not up to speed on any of the issues that we were dealing with  It was even more difficult to get someone on the phone  Texting is not the most effective or efficient means of communication especially when you are working      days teaching and presenting to several hundred attendees   With regard to the hot water issues  we had very early mornings because of the conference we were presenting at across the park at the St  Louis Union Station Hotel  The second or third time that we notified Zencity about the issue we had explained that the water was cold early in the morning and would be fine later in the day  They sent another person to our rental while we were AWAY without notifying us that they would be there  and our personal items and equipment were un secured   Zencity REFUSED to put me in touch with the on site building manager so we could problem solve the issue of them towing our rental vehicle   The fact of the matter is  there is ZERO guidance in the rental or in the house rules manual with regard to a specific parking space within the parking garage  There was zero signage or warning about having your vehicle towed if it was in the wrong parking spot  The parking pass was visible on our vehicle and it had several numbers on it  not to mention that the garage is a key card key fob secured structure with garage doors  By the way  the key fob also had a number on it that did not correspond with the apparently  assigned  space either   In fact none of the numbers visible on the pass  fob  or apt  appeared to correspond with any of the parking spaces in the garage  The garage was never full and it did not appear that spaces were specific to the cars in the garage as every time I parked there I observed different cars parked in different spaces   Here is how the situation should have been handled   If I was parked in someones space then when that person contacts the building manager and let them know someone is in their space   The building manager would then see that the pass hanging in the mirror shows that the vehicle does belong in the garage  and furthermore  the driver must have had a key fob to gain access   They would then cross reference the pass number to find the Apt    that it belongs to and then Zencity would have reached out to us to say   Please move your vehicle to the assigned spot  XXX    Instead  someone gave the tow company access to private property and towed our rental car  We have been incurring late fees  towing fees  and daily rates since then  even though we have been gone since the   th  Budget still has not been able to recover their car from the tow yard  We also were unable to rent another vehicle because of this so we had to pay additional money to get an Uber Lyft to make our flights when we checked out   So now here is how I am rectifying the situation  Airbnb   Zencity owe my business SLC Squared for time lost  we missed meetings the day we had our car towed  so that will be at our normal hourly consulting fee   Budget Rental Cost  Tow Fees  Budget Administrative Fees  and Uber Lyft fees  Also  we are disputing the charges for our stay as it was not what we thought we were paying for   I will be providing invoices for the substantiation of those costs incurred from Airbnb Zencitys negligence and I will be sending a bill to be paid Net     Late fees will be assessed as necessary as we will be having late fees assessed to us until the bill to Budget is paid  If necessary we will pursue civil action  I would prefer not to do that The access points to the complex were supposed to be secure but it was hit or miss if the doors were actually secured  There were several instances where they would be propped open  The outside and common areas of the location was gross  The elevators would have trash bags stacked against them for hours on our floor  Whenever you were in the lobby or on our floor it smelled like cigarette and marijuana smoke  One morning there was a whole to go box of food that was strewn all over the elevator and it was not clean up until the next day and even then there was food that still remained from it  Also  smoke and smells would come into the listing through the vent in the kitchen  Every time I messaged the host to voice a concern I was connected with a different person who was not up to

significant amount of money and lost time 
742148555,Zencity was perfect for me  it was spacious and very close to downtown  yet far enough away from the hustle and bustle  I loved the gated parking area  the sheets were very clean and there were extra linens and towels  The view was also very nice   I would stay here again  Loved staying here  Only problem was the cleaner didnt do a good job of clean under the couch  there was some old food and a toy under there that my godson got a hold of 
526083644269201782,Great place to stay in the city  
741954799,Unable to enter the interior door   messaged the Airbnb several times and no remedy  I was not able to enter the interior door 
741769686,We enjoyed our stay here and had absolutely no problems with the loft  I loved being able to walk to anything and everything that we wanted to see  the location can t be beaten 
524090834150844082,I did not check in to this reservation  Made reservation   hours prior to arrival   The strict reservation policy is a money grab  The location was not safe  I did not know this until I arrived   Did not feel comfortable here  Will stay away from Zencity reservations for the foreseeable future as well as pay closer attention to any hosts with strict reservation policies   Even airlines give a person   hrs to change a reservation before you are locked in  Airbnb has really changed not as awesome as it use to be  Guests pay attention 
524673626542309275,Great space  Record player wasn t plugged in and didn t have the chord so it s a bummer that it s promoted  Wifi is rough had to use my hotspot  Other than that open space  clean  comfy  and a beautiful building 
741745528,This apartment is located in a great part of St  Louis and was perfect for my wife and I as new visitors to the city  The space is private  clean  decorated well  and furnished with plenty of amenities  Check in is simple  Zencity is really on their game with messaging  and we couldn t have asked for a better spot while we were in town  Highly recommended  Hey guys  We loved our stay   the apartment was great  Wanted to drop you guys a note for this particular unit in the Bordeaux  G    The signs inside the building aren t clear that you have to go through the door at the end of the hall on the ground floor  which at first glance looks like it leads straight into the gym  in order to get to another section of apartments  You guys  instructions alluded to this but we still spent a few minutes walking around hallways until we realized that door was the one to go through   We re not upset in the slightest   just wanted to let you know that the instructions along with the building s signage were confusing  in the hope that it might help you clarify for future guests  Thank you for an otherwise effortless and awesome stay 
741604940,Beautiful room and great area  Thanks for having me  Technician came by to install thermostat without prior notice
741584952,The building has great access to Forest Park and the Central West End  There was plenty to do walking distance for the weekend  The check in process was very easy and exactly as described in the email I received prior to check in  The doorman at the building was also helpful and seemed to have a lot of knowledge on the rentals in the building  The apartment was clean  had plenty of linens and the kitchen was stocked with the essentials except a way to make coffee  There are coffee shops within a mile walk  My only issue was the noise  There was no way to sleep due to another apartment on the same floor  The doorman does not work overnight so I attempted to message Zencity through the website but never received a response  I did speak with the doorman the next morning but the apartment was another Zencity rental and not a permanent resident so there was nothing they could do  Overall  it was a nice space for a weekend and exactly as the description and pictures state  I sent a video and email regarding the unbelievable noise in the room down the hall that went on until after   am  It was awful with yelling  screaming  door slamming  alcohol  and weed  There was no one in the building to contact and I received no response to my message  It was disappointing because the buidling is in a great location and everything else was exactly as expected  Communication was great initially  I was able to check in as soon as the room was ready and was given clear instructions on how to check in and find the building including parking  I reached out regarding the noise levels and still have received no response 
741051613,This unit was a nice place to stay at in downtown St  Louis   It was a short walk to most everything we wanted to see   I love the easy check in and check out   Awesome   It was very spacious and bright  First  I really liked your place   You are welcome to call me if you would like   I am a Master carpenter   In short i know how to fix and identify things that need fixing   Here are some things   The toilet flush handle in the bathroom adjacent to the bedroom   Was not installed and just inserted into the tank   I fixed it as best i could  but it sticks if you dont lift it and the toilet would run   The garbage disposal does not work   It is locked   I did not take the time to do anything with it other than not to use that side of the sink   The dishwasher needs replacement   It does not spray water adequately enough to clean the dishes   The Roku TV had too many apps on the TV   It had a difficult time time loading   I took the time and removed a lot of apps   It then was able to load apps and airplay   I like to walk down stairs instead using the elevator   The stairs and main entrance were quite dirty and smelled   I know you cant directly control that  but you should definitely say something to the building manager   I would stay in this unit again  but i feel for the overall cost per night is a little high considering these items and overall condition of the unit   I am a business owner and always appreciate good feedback   I thought you should know   Be well  Cheers  Larry Allar
505850847878024942,We had a very nice stay at this apartment   It has all modern amenities and everything was spotlessly clean   We found it to be as represented online  with very good entry instructions for secure access and the folks from Zencity were prompt and responsive   It is literally right next to the train  but although you can hear the trains  we did not find the noise to be excessive or bothersome   Others might have a different opinion  but we did not find it to be a problem    and easy access to the train was a real convenience for us  We enjoyed our stay   There were a few things I will mention privately that were really minor issues  but it did have an impact on our enjoyment of the place   the glass coffee press had a hole in the bottom and leaked coffee all over the counter before I realized it was leaking  of course  we clean it all up  fortunately it did not get on the floor   the light over the dining room table is either burned out or we were not able to figure out how to turn it on  the black chairs are quite stylish  but we found them to be very uncomfortable  there was no shampoo and only one small tube of body wash available for the bath shower  but instead there was lots of conditioner and lotion  and we could never get the key fob to work  maybe because of our own ignorance  but we did try many different ways to place it on or near the key pad and couldnt get it to work    Admittedly these are very minor matters  but the cumulative effect caused me to withhold a   star rating overall   Otherwise we did enjoy the amenities in the apartment and its location actually worked out really well for us    Since operating these Airbnbs seems to be your business  I am perhaps being more nuanced in my criticism than I would otherwise  Thank you for making the place available 
741574721,It was a nice space  very clean  good amenities  Location is great   walking distance to many restaurants  coffee shops  whole foods  the park  science center  and zoo  Easy entry and clear communication  HOWEVER  and we seem to be alone in this opinion based on other reviews but  it was hard to sleep in this apartment  There are sirens at least once a night  its very close to the hospital   Theres an old building clanking that happens randomly throughout the night and woke me up every couple hours  The temp was warmer than were used to    F  and theres no thermostat in the apartment  just a ceiling fan and AC  The above problems are obviously not anything the host can change but the biggest reason for my insomnia was probably the pillows  Theyre big and puffy and strained my neck  There were four pillows and all were the same  I might be alone in my pillow preference  I just wish there were different options  Keep in mind  Im a very easy sleeper  If sleep is important to you and you have similar preferences  I would not recommend this apartment  Im sorry for the average review but it was just not an easy place to sleep in  which was the main thing we needed it for  I want be honest so others know what to expect  Some of the things you cant do anything about   the hospital sirens  the random clanking throughout the night  the warm temp with no option to adjust  But the one thing I wish you would do is offer more than one type of pillow  You gave us   pillows each but they were all the same kind   very big and thick  I ended up folding up the wool blanket and putting it in a pillow case  This was more comfortable than the huge pillow that strained my neck all night but I still woke up often  The rest of the amenities were perfect  which is why I still scored it high in the category breakdown  We did not consider the proximity to the hospital  It was a nice area but sirens were guaranteed every night
741542821,Great location and awesome space 
741049325,Great stay  Old cigarette smoke old building smell  Didn t like how the bedroom had no tv  Large window in the living room has a crack causing wind draft  Thin walls  Bedding wasn t clean  Stain on pillowcase and bath towels were damp 
544170739190654525,The place looks exactly like the photos  Clean and quiet  The host was always answering questions with in few minutes  excellent communication   Definitely would stay there again  Thank you for hosting me and for the quick communications
541263795758488605,Super clean  very nice location  staff was very friendly  and there s endless things to do  Definitely worth the stay  Thank you so much for letting us stay here  It was such a pretty home and it was in a very convenient location because everything was right by it  The staff was super friendly and helpful and I also had communication with you guys which was so helpful  Overall it was an amazing place we enjoyed our stay so much and will definitely be back 
741508548,We can t wait to come back  This place exceeded our expectations and it was absolutely perfect  In the best neighborhood and the rooftop was incredible  We can t wait to come back  This place was absolutely amazing inside and out  It s in the best neighborhood  We will be staying again next time we are in town  The rooftop was incredible and everything was absolutely perfect  Can t wait to come back 
741044103,Had a great time at this Airbnb  Great location near Lafayette park and an easy drive downtown 
540633885631512142,Bathroom not fully clean  Relatively poor communication in confirming my stay here made planning a bit of a hassle  Decent area of St  Louis   close to quite a bit 
540619850485588802,spacey comfortable setting
741193098,Best seat in the house when staying in St  Louis  Great stay  very simple and stylish place in an amazing location  Thanks for a great stay  Very stylish place    Do you think the faucets could be upgraded to get a nicer flow  Would really complement the vibe 
539825921792479519,great place and wonderful customer service I am very happy with zencity in my last email it showed me saying the F word it was supposed to say booking  talk to text was jacked up 
493502459345673323,Good
740612329,The building is secure  The workout room is amazing  The distance from the elevator to the apartment is a hike  Zencitys place is purely a rental  and the cleanliness of the apartment wasnt up to my standard  but maybe my scale is off  I found long black hairs on the bed as well as short black hairs on the window sill  Several pieces of debris were laying on top of the shag carpet which let me know the space wasnt swept   I found long black hairs on the bed and short hairs on the window sill  The carpets had not been swept as I found several pieces of debris on the carpets throughout the apartment  The distance from the elevator to the apartment was a hike

740123595,Beautiful but not very clean 
539088477079374795,it is good but it is a little cold and there is some water in the ground after i inquiry on the owner they deal with very efficiently and well but the smell of the paint is not good and i still smell it at night
740044054,The apartment was great  Clean and modern  There was a lot of extras such as linens  cooking eating wares etc etc  I would highly recommend  We had one issue of a missing key fob that was needed to access the amenities but it was resolved relatively quickly  As mentioned in the review  the key fob was missing from the apartment when we checked in  We didn t realize we needed this to enter certain areas so we went out into the courtyard without the fob and we were unable to get back into the building  It was late afternoon so no one was in the admin office but after a while some tenants came out and let us in  I think this should be something that is checked when the room is being clean  The key fob was missing from the apartment when I checked in  This led to missing a day of using the amenities of the apartment such as the gym or the courtyard until one was reissued to us  We even got locked out in the courtyard before we realized we needed a fob to get back into the apartment building  luckily some other tenants came out and let us in after about    mins  It was after hours so there was no one in the admin office of the building   I feel like the housekeeper someone should have checked for this when clean the room to get it ready for the next tenant  There was a lot of hair on the carpet in the living room  Otherwise  everything was clean and great 
500754789180103918,Great place to stay  Super Clean  Clean towels on every bed  place was neat and tidy  Great location as well with plenty of options to eat around town  We lucked out with this place and would recommend to anyone 
537696917197657118,Amazing clean modern unit in an amazing location seconds away from all of CWE s eateries         You guys are awesome
537658093499530021,Wonderful stay  Clean and simple loved the stay  Everything I needed was there  The Netflix was a nice bonus so thank you   And thanks for accepting my last minute request
521001525778760841,The thermostat  as other guests have noted  is a HUGE problem  My wife and I stayed in the middle of December  which it was cold  It took way too long for representatives to alter the temperature  You cannot alter it yourself because a password is required  Outside of this  it was clean and everything was accurate  The hosts have to alter this  I would not want anyone or their spouses sleeping in a jacket like my wife had to  The thermostat is a serious issue  There are other reviewers who have noted this  I stayed in the middle of December  which is the Winter in Kansas City  There is no reason why a guest should not be able to turn the heat up  especially when it is this cold outside  In addition  the apartment has many windows  which will cause even more of a draft  Honestly  outside of the thermostat and the detergent dispenser for the kitchen sink  I would have rated the stay fairly high  My wife had to go to sleep with her Nike jacket on as a result of how cold it was  The customer support staff took way too long to get back with us in terms of remotely altering the temperature  I did mot even feel a need to ask to turn it up again as a result of how long it took the last time 
454278599000158906,The apartment was beautiful with a great view of the Arch  The courtyard is amazing and a great added bonus  Parking was very easy and accessible  I would definitely stay here again  With no fault to our apartment owner but the building really smelled awful  I think it was marijuana mixed in with another smell I couldn t quite figure out but our specific apartment was very fresh smelling
541334723962352068,Definitely worth the money very cozy place I appreciate the opportunity and appreciate your patience  Would stay again if given the opportunity
522412410763508653,The location of this Air bnb was amazing  However  the toilet had mold in it  the tv didn t work  and one of the living room curtains was stuck  making our room cooler than we wanted  Their communication was fast  but constantly was with a different representative  I was told they would send someone to clean the toilet and that never happened  The location of this Air bnb was amazing  However  the toilet had mold in it  the tv didn t work  and one of the living room curtains was stuck  making our room cooler than we wanted  Their communication was fast  but constantly was with a different representative  I was told they would send someone to clean the toilet and that never happened 
505098822126433551,The Airbnb was a nice getaway  very ducked off  I would definitely book again  my only use is the parking and the main entrance door code doesn t work sometimes  Other then that I liked it  I really appreciate the stay  You are a good host  I liked it so much the only down fall was what we talked about  Other than that I enjoyed my get away stay 
525332101237055374,great start
541317336187029780,Fantastic place all around  The couch  while decorative  is not very comfortable 
518846978870547885,Overall great location  easy communication with host  very responsive   beautiful apartment   a comfy bed  I didn t notice that there wasn t dedicated parking or valet carts available for loading in luggage prior to booking  I spoke with the host about this  but the check in process was a bit cumbersome   confusing  which is why the mark down   There was an event going on   elevator maintenance as well that I guess was not relayed to the host  That definitely added to the convolution  Otherwise  all went well   it worked fine for my use as it was very close to everything  Thank you for your help throughout 
517374823204283392,This is a great value place  Location is great  the apartment was clean  full of amenities and I think you get a lot for your money  I will definitely stay again with Zencity and I will use them again on my next visit to Kansas City   Check In was a bit of a problem  but nothing that the customer service  wouldn t resolve and ended up having a great time and place 
531853472230171796,Check in was a little complicated but overall good stay
478936193134544119,Great quiet room  Will be back to stay here  I had a great experience at your place and will be back soon
512335728287728073,When we arrived  they could not find the key  We had to stand for a good half hour before they sent us to our room without a key  We then had to wait another hour for then to get us the key  Terrible check in to start with   Then the place was dirty  with food crumbs on the carpets  stains on the floor  a hair tie under one of the chairs  The bed sheets and towels had some hair on them   They were however very responsive 
511555100684632807,Everything was great  It was clean and the host always kept in touch with me  Overall I would stay again and would recommend this apartment to anyone 
478964251335535407,Great place  Great location  Great Airbnb  This place is the epitome of why anyone would forego staying in a hotel but choose Airbnb instead   All the stars  Thank you for the opportunity to stay say your wonderful place 
511541787833378997,Great service and area Great service   
508740122743363136,Love it  Definitely will be back 
505767634992732723,A great spot for a Chicago weekend  The apartment has  charm   an older place with the patina of age  The rooms are bright and airy  the beds and bedding comfy and welcoming  The location was a good launching point for exploring the city  The Belmont Avenue neighborhood is lively and interesting  a real life Chicago commercial strip  We found many satisfying restaurants around   Other comments mentioned cleanliness concerns which we did not experience  Its a nice older apartment in  reasonably decent shape  plenty of character  not a   star hotel  Entry stairs took some getting used to but the apartments great  Heating system did not cover the whole space evenly on a cold weekend   hot in the back near the source  very cold up front where heat never reached 
541371973770641975,This space is basically as seen  When reading the reviews  most of them are spot on  The location is great if you want to make Lincoln park your base   its safe and beautiful   tons of amazing architecture   both new and old  So thats a plus  Parking is hit or miss  with permit parking directly by the space  but youre going to need to find parking elsewhere for long periods of time   The space itself has a charm about it  Its old and its huge  Four to six people could stay here no problem and feel like they are not on top of each other  Youd have to share a shower   but there are two bathrooms   As you read all of the reviews youll notice the comments about updating the bathrooms  Yeah  they could use a facelift  and the shower curtains should be replaced on a more regular basis   but Ive been in hotels with way worse   The kitchen is large   very basic but large  There are ample glasses and dishes  not a lot of cooking utensils  but you can get by   and with so many amazing restaurants in the area  youll be fine   The beds are super comfy   and the large windows in the bedroom add a super cool old city touch that give the place some charm   At the end of the day  if youre not looking for the Ritz  but want or need a larger place in a great location  then this place will satisfy your needs  Hello  We really enjoyed our stay  As stated  the location is great  especially if youre going to be staying in the Lincoln Park Area   which we did  Check in was super easy too  The beds were nice  clean and comfortable   I would only comment  as others have  on the main bathroom  It was nice to have two bathrooms  but the main bath shower could use some updating  At the very least  just change out the shower curtains more often   especially with Covid and such  people are more aware of the  lack  of cleanliness as how clean something actually is  The shower isnt so bad  but the curtains need to be replaced  I would also take one hour  and go around the house and change all the burnt out lights and exchange the mismatched light bulbs with matching  Simple things like this can really make a difference  When you attempt to turn on a light and it doesnt work  and thus the area is dimly lit  this can force a bad review   All in all  the space is really cool   weve stayed in far worse  and its large and open  Along with sprucing up the bathroom  the kitchen could use some TLC as well  We enjoyed the kitchen while our daughter visited us  we had a bite to eat  and it is a great size  just a little worn  Just hiring an inexpensive interior designer  on a budget can make the world of difference   We would definitely stay here again   you have a nice space on your hands  just a little loving and Im sure people will rave about it more 
450638399537257297,Nice place  Would stay again  Parking wasn t fun though   Just on street parking   Main Street construction made things all the worse 
539117272657884554,Great location 
511586062621621445,No thoughts  Great booking 
768409585,the place is great for   ppl  nice location and it has everything you need  communication was a bit weird Zen rentals would only reply half of my questions so I had to bump questions again  it was really hard to ask questions over the chat  it was clear that I was talking to a group of people dealing w multiple rentals  I would send multiple questions in my messages and get a response to only half of them so I had to insist
507241982419742098,This was an excellent place  The place was as advertised Free  off street parking was available Perfect for a long weekend Even when the heat button was pushed to off and the air temperature was on coldest the heat continued to blow
504334465590563435,This is a very nice apartment  large  with a good kitchen  well equipped   Good shower   Has good light  but not a nice view  looks to the center of the block   Good bed  It is just besides the elevators but that was not a problem for me  The building is well maintained  and there is a good restaurant and bakery  Piccolo Mondo  just a few steps away   Furnishings could be improved  the apartment needs better chairs and a sofa would make it more liveable  It certainly has the space for it  Has a huge closet  Overall my stay was good   There is one aspect in which I beleive Zencity should improve and that is communication   They are frustrating  confusing  it takes a lot of time to get a correct answer   For one  there is the issue that in each followup question a different person answers and may contradict what somebody before said   Secondly  much of the tardiness and confusion comes because the person answering does not look at the particularities of the apartment or of the stay one is inquiring about   They respond generalities that would apply to any stay or any person   Hence  when I asked about the kitchen appliances available  what the person from Zencity answered and what the apartment had where unrelated  It turned the kitchen was better equipped than what they led me to believe  A second example is when I asked about the policy for leaving some days earlier  It took some days for the staff to give me an answer that applied to my particular case   In the meantime generating confusion and a lot of frustration    My second message would be regarding the apartment itself   It is a very nice apartment  but it is not well furnished   Specially for a long term stay like mine   The two chairs are very fragile and one cannot really use them  They have to be repaired or changed   Such a large and nice apartment needs a sofa  even if it were an individual one   There is no comfortable place to sit and read  one ends having to read in bed 
489137265642621615,I overall had a good experience  It was clean and in an amazing location  I did find that the fob key didn t work very well and I had to put in the code every time  I was also quite frustrated with the fact that every time I reached out  I had to chat to another person who clearly hadn t read the previous messages  It made it difficult for me to feel like I could reach out a lot and made the stay feel less friendly and welcoming than I would have preferred  But overall  everything was fine 
511580393422618376,Thank you lovely home
763071055,Great location  close to cute little coffee shops  shopping  and downtown area  Very clean home inside  and owner was super friendly and very attentive to our needs  Will definitely visit again  Amazing host  I do wish there were TVs in bedrooms upstairs though 
764851755,Such a great space   
452142768463434428,I have literally nothing negative to say about me stay  Great place  Incredibly clean  Well appointed  Great value and location  I literally have nothing negative to say about the stay  If I were gonna nitpick  it would be nice to have coffee provided 
478939613534017870,The cleanliness of the apartment was not up to par  The apartment was not very clean when we checked in  It looked clean but when you put your hand on the counter it felt dirty  The towels smelled  The room smelled like smoke 
536938609348637063,This was a very comfortable  clean and convenient stay  There is a Whole Foods right next door so we were able to get some groceries and the host provided everything we needed to cook with  Also in short distance to other restaurants and forest park  I would definitely recommend  This was a very comfortable  clean and convenient stay   There was one bug but understandable being in such an older complex  Thanks for being a great host 
471662771457822221,Getting inside and getting the key was like being in an escape room  maybe some people will find it fun  I didnt really  I asked if someone can help me secure my bags for the   hours before check in  early check in wasnt possible  and neither was anyone making an effort to just stash my bags  The apartment is so minimully decorated its incredibly uninviting  I was extremely dissapointed no one seemed to be willing to make any effort to at least secure my bags while I waited the couple hours for my room  I was told that the room was occupied the night before  but according to the chaulkboard in the room it was last clean weeks ago  The apartment is so barely decorrated that it makes it not feel hospitable at all 
531124280502654899,This listing was not as described at all  No washer and dryer  it was unclean  furniture was literally thrown in place  no coffee maker  if you see it listed as available it s most likely not available  Heads up choose the other place you were looking at 
469561786201500816,This place was really dirty I don t think it was clean at all  Would not stay here again  Building is under construction This place was really dirty I don t think it was clean at all  Would not stay here again
488347113311939711,Loved the location of this place  The place was just as expected and clean  Would definitely stay again  My stay was perfect   thank you 
536282262808232764,Nice apartment  Kind of hard to find and difficult to enter  but the host was very helpful 
536202501538895821,If you get a chance try this location The wifi didnt work but that is the only negative ish thing i can say  The room was very comfy and adorable hopefully i cam get the sam one my next visit
533337013529407646,Pleasant stay  The location is amazing  a lot of great restaurants in walking distance  The doorman is nice and helpful  the whole check in process is smooth  Definitely recommend 
490575052972643293,For the price  the room had a lot of issues  No hot water  Toilet leaked and the heater was loud  Also it smelled bad  Not to mention you could hear everyone around us in the building  fighting  yelling  kids running around an lots of bumping from upstairs  I was not happy    The place had a foul sulfur like smell  Only had hot water for a few minutes the first night and none at all after that  The toilet leaked after flushing and the heater in the front room was loud 
535500407649341807,The unit was great  Location was closed to Enterprise and it was an okay area 
534750052690385309,Cute and comfy room in a nice area right off LSD so it was easy to get to  Parking was a bit of a pain  Be prepared to look for parking for a while  Some basic cooking utensils but useful  The poor heat situation in this room was a big downfall for this unit and the mold in the bathroom could also get addressed 
502933903953743637,Bright and large but very sparsely furnished   Location is excellent  beds and linens are high quality  Kitchen has basics but very much basic  The place was NOT clean   There was junk around the kitchen sink drain  hair in the LR carpet and dirt and hair under the tub  We put up with it but it was bordering on gross 
455753526191253249,BEWARE   I really wish I could write a better review  We booked this place starting on a Wednesday that went through to Monday and had planned to work from the apartment during the week  Unfortunately  when we got there  we found the router completely disconnected from the wall and the power supply in the night stand  The Ethernet port was actually just a large hole in the wall  I contacted them multiple times throughout the stay  The place is hosted by a management company  Each time we contacted them  we were responded to by a new person who hadn t read the previous communication  We were told that our issue would be escalated to management on Saturday  But I guess they decided that since we were checking out Monday morning  we were no longer worth their time  Bc even after me reaching out several times  we never heard back  The location is amazing  I wonder if the actual owners of this apartment knows how poorly their place is being managed  Oh  and there is only one mirror in the entire three bedroom place  If they just put one more mirror in there  it would make the whole place better  I really wish this could ve been resolved without me having to write a bad review 
505020711461568699,great place and we loved the location 
534778223626470713,I saw a roach in the bathroom  a late rent notice was left on the door  and someone pulled the fire alarm that night  twice  The elevators were trashed  I saw a roach in the bathroom  a late rent notice was left on the door  and someone pulled the fire alarm that night  twice  The elevators were trashed 
500749656480095906,Awsome Host   
439082369793740087,This is my third time staying at this Airbnb  Its a really lovely space with a great layout and comfortable furnishings  Slawik is an excellent host  super friendly  and he takes great care of all of his properties 
478973505433302311,Very clean and nice stay  Response time was very fast 
534734842240233612,Really comfortable beds  Building itself isn t the best but it isn t too bad   Street parking is awful I m this area so if you re planning to use the car  especially during winter  know that you may have to walk blocks and hunt for parking spots any time you leave and come back    Also make sure you really know your dates because you can end up paying a lot for nothing even if you re not using the unit  I could understand like     of ONE night extra if you have to check out early but it s one night full price and the rest is endless     days  This is not just the hosts fault really but Airbnbs as well   It s been a thing lately on Airbnb so if you think you may have to leave early  hotels are often a safer option now  Decent place but one time I couldn t get in the building  The keypad just didn t work  Thankfully it was nothing important at the moment so I could just leave  Beds are really comfortable though 
533336795776365234,Great space and lovely building in a great area  Make sure you remember to put the thinly laminated parking pass back though or they will try to charge you the same amount that they charge for the digital key fob  The entire parking pass situation was an absolute and complete fiasco 
511582209225242764,beautiful place
454315584780107648,It was a cool space it could ve been cleaner  The bedspread was st  at ones   the bathroom wasn t the cleanest but overall comfortable space 
511580823495361937,The place is decent for what you pay  The parking space was not on the premises  It was an assigned spot in a garage nearly   blocks away and up   flights of stairs  Also  there is a lot of light that comes into the apartment at night  It will stay this way until the blinds get repaired or replaced with dark curtains  Lock is smart lock which means I had to remember a long string of numbers to get in  Maybe shorten the code or offer a key lock for after check in   A chain lock on door would be helpful too  I had an internet issue that I asked the host about then fixed myself shortly after  turns out WiFi router is plugged into a socket that can be turned off by a nearby light switch    The next day  a maintenance person came to fix the WiFi  which was already fixed and communicated to host  and knocked then let himself in the apartment before I had a chance to get dressed and open the door  Kinda crazy that someone can just come in like that and there s no chain on my side of the door to prevent it when I m home   Parking space was not on the premises  It was nearly   blocks away and up   flights of stairs which was annoying to carry my luggage down the stairs and then nearly   blocks in the freezing cold   There is a lot of light from the parking lot that comes into the apartment at night through the windows  Many of the slats were missing from the blinds which prevented any sort of darkness  At the very least  get those blinds fully repaired  It would be better to get a blackout or even just a normal curtain 
506519691507066737,It was a good rental over all  parking wasn t as bad as I thought it would be as far as on street  Thank you for the last minute booking   And the extra day
534835056574515791,Great  clean easy spot for seeing Chicago 
504413484830757451,Nice apartment  good decoration and style  Key missing items   coffee pot   totally essential for us   broken microwave   no shampoo and shower gel  No functioning sink in our bathroom   After a lot of message we managed to get a coffee pot and some shampoo on day    of a   days stay  Zen city answering our messages kindly   but no action   not quite the spirit of Airbnb I feel Too many issues during the stay  All  reported immediately but not addressed until the very end of the stay and partially
501467327760948735,Great location we came to town for the Cheifs vs Cowboys game  The microwave didn t work which I hoped it would after previous reviews  Also  the lock to get in is tricky only one person could get the door open in our group  Other than that we had everything we needed  Thanks for hosting my friends and I  We enjoyed our stay  If possible I would recommend getting the microwave fixed and having more than one key and access card 
496340055837834425,What an absolutely beautiful historic home  My family met here to celebrate my mother and sisters   th and   th birthdays  This house was the perfect place to accommodate all of us comfortably  It really does go on and on  So fun to explore   From the basement to the attic ensuite  there is ample room for a large crowd  I believe there are   bathrooms    The beds are quite comfortable   Beautiful kitchen  Bright sunroom  Quite the collection of historic books  Childrens toys  Family games  Even slippers for chilly nights  Many beautiful touches   I would note there are lots of steps to this property and may not be suitable for elderly or those with mobility issues  I counted    steps from main floor to the attic ensuite  but well worth the climb  Sadly  due to Covid  Trumans Library and home were closed to the public  Hopefully this will change soon  We were hoping to tour both   Slawik was a very thoughtful host  communicated promptly and provided wonderful amenities  We would definitely stay here again  Thank you Slawik for helping us make family memories we will forever cherish  Hello Slawik    We had a wonderful birthday celebration and appreciated the space to accommodate all of us comfortably    I would like to make a couple of suggestions privately     My husband and I slept in the  rd floor suite  As it is chilly now   the window air is not in use  There was a definite cold breeze coming in as the accordion extensions were not sufficient  It felt as if a window  was open  Also this amplified the street noise with sirens  trains  people shouting  and such at   AM  It is a busy thoroughfare  This may not be an issue in the summer when the air is running  But the street noise did interrupt our sleep   We live on a busy highway and know about street noise    Perhaps we just stayed at a time between seasons and you hadnt gotten the windows ready for winter     Also  you asked that we keep our disposable plates and utensils to a minimum  but there was a lack of silverware  especially spoons  This was certainly not a game changer   just wanted to pass that on    And lastly  a house Book with check out instructions and other house tips would have been helpful  We looked but could not find one     Please note we had an absolutely fabulous family weekend and our hearts are full  Your beautiful home made that possible   Thank you for sharing your wonderful home  Best wishes to you  Wendy
500003188377194783,Great place  Very clean   Perfect for a short stay for business    Also nearby KCs best entertainment districts  didnt communicate check out instructions   had to call to find out what to do with the keys
531120936408162865,Great location  very clean  Parking is a little tricky but other than that very nice and clean  Everything was absolutely perfect I thank you guys so much for the fast response and the cleanliness of the apartment 
531118878949572912,The Skyline location is indeed ideally located  decent view  mostly peaceful  The entrance is on   th  not Olive  The space was nicely laid out and comfortable  and I liked that different streaming services were provided  The kitchen was well stocked for cooking needs and there were adequate washcloths and other towels  The spraying faucets were a bit messy and the water got just hot enough  but could stand to be increased about five degrees  Id add a charging hub near the bed  The wifi info on the board was wrong   but the modem router was easy enough to locate and get the correct input  The gym  rec room  and laundry were easily accessible  It takes a bit to figure out the laundry  but it was an awesome app feature used to pay once you do  Someone was parked in the assigned spot when I went to use it two days after checkin  but they do have alternative parking  Unfortunately it was the top floor of the garage and the elevator was broken  A tenant I greeted in the stairwell said it had been out for months  The building was not as secure as they say  as the front door lock was broken  so entering codes into the keypad or using the fob was unnecessary  A tenant entering as I was arriving my first day nearly scoffed at me for not knowing  The tenants were overall polite  some questionable  especially the one swaying precariously near the entrance when I first got there  It made me walk past the place  that and the entrance being on a different street from the address   Either the neighbors next to or below me smoked because it filled my space  but fortunately they seemed to limit it to the bathroom  because if I kept the bathroom and closet doors closed it finally stopped permeating the apartment  This means I couldnt leave my clothes in there so they wouldnt stink  and every bathroom visit was a mad dash not to be engulfed in the odor  Thank goodness for the little bottle of Bath and Body Works air freshener I travel with  Make sure to screenshot your room entry code  Its strangely long and you wont remember it and hopefully your battery hasnt died after a long day out  I was glad no one was ever chasing me  Id suggest it be made shorter or even the guests own phone number for better ease of entry  I was able to use my travel lock securing mechanism with no problem   Overall good bang for the buck  especially compared to hotel prices  Great location for walking to all the major attractions  restaurants  and grocery stores  Ill probably stay again  The daily  friendly reminders  are kind of obnoxious 
536221601339888199,Pros  location  kitchen  laundry Cons  temperature control Temperature outside in the teens when I arrived  No heat on in the room  window unit poorly insulated  Took over   hours  after turning on the heat before I removed my winter coat and gloves  Second night room stayed much warmer  Suspect the room below had an occupant who had its heat on  Blinds broken in places and insufficient against city lights to provide a dark room  Heavy curtains could provide both warmth and darkness  Nice kitchen  laundry  bed  bedding  reading chair  Bathroom decor upgraded  but edges raw and room very cold  Door trim paint flaking off and badly stained from room into laundry  bath area and not possible to close  Overall effect a bit like lipstick on a pig 
530406391271916605,Great stay  Clean and tidy  Kitchen utensils  hair dryer  and some toiletries included  Tv has Roku  Free wifi had a strong signal  The key fob didn t work to open the gated parking lot for me  but its a very safe neighborhood and parking on the street for a few days seemed to be acceptable  It s a little bit hard finding the unit numbers since the ground floor has a few diverging hallways  but generally I had a great stay  Great stay  Just a minor snafu with the key fob not working to open the parking gate  but it worked fine to park on the street 
541359032835069807,Great location and spacious   We enjoyed our stay  We really love the place but it was SUPER frustrating when we had an issue and need to reach someone at Zencity   Im not sure it is even possible to do so without being logged into AirbnB which was not possible at the time 
490552340925534308,Spacious and great location  However   could have been more clean  Sheets  counters  bathroom surfaces were clean but floors and basebords were grimy  Window blinds were torn up  a door was broken off it s hinges   no hot water in one of the bathrooms  no furniture to unpack luggage  Received a noise complaint for simply laughing  talking in the living room at night  Overall got the job done but unfortunately this property doesn t deserve a good review  Back bathroom had no hot water and door was broken  Window blinds in very bad shape and missing pieces  Overall cleanliness lacking
529702906811153993,I ve had better stays with Zencity  The walls are thin and the people at the Airbnb across the hall let their baby scream and holler all night  Also  I did not receive an access code upon arrival  so I had to wait about    min before I could actually check in  customer service had to call me back  and my access code was also changed in the middle of my stay I ran to the store just to come back and discover that I was locked out  I had to call customer service back and wait about    min just to be let back into the apt with a new access code    Other than that the stay was fine    Also  there s no washer and dryer  the laundry room is downstairs  I found a bug in the sink on the last day  I think you all should exterminate    Also  check in was difficult and you all changed my access code in the middle of the stay which was inconvenient
511553884797303447,Great place  Fit my needs for a quick trip  Thank you  Place was great and fit my needs 
530390048284977507,Great location  lovely view from the roof top  overall great space  The bed is a bit low  not an issue  its very comfortable   just took some getting use to getting in and out of it  The TV randomly stopped wouldnt turn on the last day we were there  Not sure if the battery died in the remote or something 
526763189542497870,Great place to stay 
539141302144267920,This apartment was perfect  Close to Westport  the plaza and crown center  and not far from the highways it was the perfect place to call home for a couple days  Comfortable bed and even though it s close to a major steet  it was super quiet  Thanks Zencity  Thanks so much for letting  me add a night in last minute  You guys are great 
475339049082926294,I would stay here again  but that s me  so that is what this review will be based on  because you might want a different experience   It was difficult to get past the secure entrance  but once you did  using the key fobs was kinda great  I wish I had them at my house   The location was great for us  because there was a coffee shop  an awesome coffee shop  right next door  good and great restaurants within     blocks  a vintage clothes store  a few bars  and other businesses  At night this section of Broadway seemed a little sinister  and loud with sirens  but during the day  it was people taking walks  shopping  and getting coffee   The apartment functioned pretty well  low water pressure in the shower  a bulb was out  The bed was really comfortable and the bedding pillows were nice   In an apartment building  you hear your neighbors  and you smell their food  If this isn t what you are used to  or don t want  be ready  Another note  other apartments in this building are used for vacationers  so you don t have to feel like an interloper   Finally  as I said  this worked for us  but it s loud at times  It s Kansas City though  one of the greatest cities in the US  get out and enjoy it  Hi Zencity    your checkin process was really hard  We followed all the steps you sent and they didnt work  We finally just entered a random number that showed up on the intercom box and thankfully it worked  The intercom readout was hard to read because it was broken and crooked and showed only a portion of the information  It was stressful and a difficult way to start our weekend  Also  this is a small thing  but some of the blinds were broken in the apartment and some of the lights didnt work  Also  every air bnb Ive ever stayed at  and there have been many  has included coffee and a a drip coffee maker  We used the french press  but it seems like a small thing you could include for your guests  We really liked the location and once we got the key fobs everything worked fine 
452834399380772005,The studio is fine and clean  but if you need any help don t expect anyone from this corporate company to support you or have any real human interaction  Customer service takes days to get back to you  Limited flexibility  Communication the entire tire was terrible  extremely delayed and my questions left unanswered  When I called I did not get a response  rates per night fluctuated grately and there is no humanness to the experience I will never stay at a corporately owned Airbnb experience  not only are you contributing to high rent prices ans gentrification but your customer service and value is terrible 
452883830013836105,Our stay here was great  Zencity provided all the information we needed for an easy check in and check out  We were close enough to a lot of places so we could walk and we were provided a parking space in the parking garage so we didnt have to pay to park at a meter or fight traffic  Definitely recommend  Thank you for letting us stay with you  we had a good time  There was just a couple things I wanted to let you know though   The toilet leaks on the bottom every time you flush causing a puddle on the floor and there was no hot water two different times we tried to shower  Other than those the stay was perfect 
529041268591597673,Quality  clean stay for a reasonable price  Thanks for the quality stay  I d say the only comment on the experience is that it would be helpful to communicate with one or two representatives rather than several  I had to repeat messages through the inbox rather than the rep scrolling up to previous messages  Thanks again 
528942322231222102,Beau logement  propre et bien situ   Merci  Merci  mon s jour dans le logement  tait super 
495597705611738340,Clean  bright  airy space  Plenty of parking available  in spite of there being no assigned parking       was lovely  A few suggestions      Fix the microwave oven      Correct the map for this apartment  It says Grandview  which is incorrect  This apartment is located in the Power   Light District  a good    miles away from Grandview  When my daughter asked for the correct address  you sent her to Independence      miles away  That s a lot of wasted time and gas      I would have appreciated more than one dish towel for a three night stay      I had to purchase salt   pepper  which you said was provided  We left it behind for the next renters     A little more lighting in the bedroom next to the kitchen would be helpful      Finally  the mask mandate has been lifted  and masks are no longer a requirement in the building  merely a suggestion  You should remove the scary language from the listing about being refused entrance  etc   Thank you for the ample towels and pillows  It was much appreciated  The beds are very comfortable  too 
510904338417062530,An amazing place to stay for long and short term in KCMO  Everything is super clean  and it is a brand new apartments with all the necessary amenities specially washer and dryer inside the unit  The Zencity team is hands on if you need any support during your stay  I will definitely stay again Thank you 
503630877363931409,This spot is very clean  its close to the high ways and markets  Definitely would come back if I see this listed again  Thanks for letting me stay here  I will definitely come back if your listed again 
510918785130318501,DO NOT BOOK DO NOT BOOK DO NOT BOOK  First off the box that you have to put the code in to access building didnt work  I brought my work clothes and my childs clothes the dryer didnt work  I would have booked a nice loft on Washington if i knew the washer dryer aint work  The microwave didnt work when my daughter went to warm up her food  I didnt trip off of any of it i let it slide i didnt bother the host     THE SHOWER DIDNT WORK   That was a deal breaker for me i wrote them about it at     pm it took for me to call them around  pm for them to finally respond with NO SOLUTION  This was unbelievable i have never had issues booking an airbnb  I felt like I was in an apartment in the HOOD  And it stank when you walk in   I hope they refund me at least one night since they kind of did mess my whole weekend up  The only good thing about this place was that everybody was LOUD AF so it was cool that my kids didnt have to stay quiet  Fuck off
528327258849329299,the kiosk for the key did not work  my room was dirty  there was drugs and drug paraphernalia in my room  the floor was flooded from sewage water  they did not get me a new room by the end of the night  and the next day they accused me of breaking the refrigerator  I will never stay here again  I strongly suggested if anybody stays here that they do a walk through first  maybe before you accuse people of breaking things in an apartment  maybe you should make sure the door wasnt left open for housekeeping staff to come in  and perhaps it would be a good idea for you to actually check the rooms before checking in a guest  that way theyre clean and dont have drug paraphernalia  being forced to be around drugs is not something that I appreciate and not something that I should have ever had to deal with in my life coming to you 
528301233343456305,Great room near Barnes Jewish and Forest Park  Great place for a little shut eye before continuing to explore St  Louis  Getting into the unit was a bit frustrating  the keybox didnt work properly and chat didnt get us a response  We managed to get in though 
528248608895685806,Very nice property will definitely stay again 
526091696184626340,Nice building and neighborhood Thanks
502205194840654719,Great location  Clean Nice restaurants and bars Great communication with the company   Parking and storage space for longer stays would be my only thing I would knock but not enough to detour me of another stay next time I m here   Dope space   It s an old building and the fire alarms go off randomly  Usually false alarms  The location is amazing  Food  Bars  Coffee shops and restaurants in walking distance  I enjoyed my stay for a month in this location  The Penthouse rooftop with a nice inner city view is dope Not a lot of space for storage but it has everything you need  Definitely recommend 
525549931873763748,There was feces on the floor when we entered the building  We were in the unit less than    minutes   roaches took over the kitchen  We left immediately and they refused to give us a full refund  We sent pictures of cock roaches in our unit and feces on the floor as we entered the building  We requested a full refund in the amount of      and was only given     
532642464069292872,The space is great and exactly as advertised  The lack of response from Zencity about a maintenance issue was surprising and disappointing  The kitchen sink didn t work and despite messaging the host  Zencity   there was no resolution to the issue  No sink and no dishwasher made it really challenging to use the kitchen  Four days of receiving  we ll get back to you  messages is unacceptable  Your inability   or unwillingness   to resolve the maintenance issue was really disappointing and an inconvenience 
495696776250642317,Great listing and place  Some small issues with check in and checkout   Parking is also a struggle at this location  Overall  great place  had issues with checking in  as the combination box wasnt set to receive me when I did the one day sooner check in   Also  had the clean crew surprise me in the room when they didnt learn checkout was pushed right to  pm   all and all great place  thankyou 
481103518880649560,Convenient location right above the L  also comes with train station announcement noise   easy self checkin  others fine  Sliding glass door on shared balcony did not have complete blinds  so neighbors on their balconies could look in on the bedroom at night  Many blinds panels missing from the blinds on the balcony sliding doors   did NOT feel safe to have neighbors the on the shared balconies able to look in at the bed at night  Also  inability to deadbolt the unit door was not great either 
510201483076844178,Clean and efficient 
475368619122105848,Great location and easily accessible apartment  Think the beds are full beds and not queens  Shower drain is a bit clogged
495028752403261528,Needs better parking instructions  Host controls climate in apartment area  No television in small bed room area  just dinning area only  I was also told about noise complaint  Which funny that all happened the night of me canceling my reservations early  when in fact I did not have any loud music on and it was around     pm before   pm quite hours  You will do better just getting an hotel in that city  Area need to be climate controlled by person only  Needs specific parking instructions included  Faster response from host   Add television to bed room wall not just dinning area 
385402203993944298,Place was filthy when we arrived and reeked of marijuana smell  Toilet seat actually had fecal splash on it  Kitchen had dirty pans  Kitchen is poorly equipped if want to actually cook  Apartment is totally dead for Verizon cellular phone but at least provided wifi was reliable  We saw at least two centipedes and a couple mosquitoes in the apartment  Once we clean the apartment ourselves and the marijuana smell finally faded location was quiet and convenient for Hyde Park  Zen responds quickly to emails but no follow through on anything that needs action  Building code stopped working a full hour prior to check out time  Luckily one of us had stayed behind to let others back in  Our first and probably last Airbnb experience  Your leaving us a dirty apartment that reeked of marijuana smell for the first two days was no appreciated  Also blowing us off on our request for waive of clean fee is crap on your side 
493493021836526388,Awesome apartment and location with an amazing view  Everything was super clean and made us feel right at home  Building staff was very kind and accommodating with whatever we needed  Would love to book this spot again in the future for sure  The only real issue we had was not being able to unlock the front door  We had to get security to come open it for us every time we needed to get in the room which was frustrating as well as time consuming for both us and security  That being said everything else was awesome  Super cool apartment  location  and view  Thank you so much for providing an awesome stay  Would love to be back in the future 
541371636621199106,Our stay was pretty good with Zencity  The location was unbeatable  despite having limited access to free parking  The desk attendants were all sooooo wonderful and kind  Check in was easy as well  We had continued issues with several outlets not working  as well as the oven and microwave  which made it difficult to reheat leftovers we had  We also had ice cold showers  I ended up washing my hair in the sink because I couldn t tolerate being entirely in the shower with how cold it was  Overall good stay and worked for us as we were mostly out and about  but definitely some comfort measures to improve upon Hello    We had continued issues with several outlets not working  as well as the microwave and oven  We also had two nights of ice cold showers
491297289499458565,Great location   Getting into the building is a bit of an ordeal  We couldn t lock the door once inside which feels unsafe  Bed and linens were great  Lovely coffee shop in the building  All in all we would stay here again 
491290138412062898,Muy buen lugar y excelente ubicaci n Excelente ubicaci n y comunicaci n
410097004724471723,Most importantly   Great Location  Great communication  A great stay  Great stay  Mattress a little thin  but all in all   stars  Get a thicker mattress LOL   Until next time  SC
521746462217365794,This apartment is in a great location but since it is on a more commercial street  the business signage and street lights are pretty bright  The bedroom windows face the street and the blinds and curtains dont do a very good job of keeping the light out  The apartment is quite sparsely furnished and is on need of a thorough clean  The apartment location is great  The space needs a detailed clean and a paint refresh   Good quality blackout curtains in the bedrooms are really needed  I was able to read a book in the bedroom at night with the lights off  some sort of shelving unit in the living room to hide the internet modem router would be good  The rug has been tripped over on one corner so many times ti now always sticks up and is a trip hazard  Alsosome sort of luggage racks would be nice 
530501881115048726,Cleanliness was not up to standards  floors  kitchen surfaces  refrigerator  sinks  furniture  and place smelled like smoke   The front intercom system was broken communication through AirBNB system  if we would ve showed up at  pm or after no entry would ve been granted  No parking pass  thermostat is controlled by nest and once again communication through the app to get someone on site to adjust temp  It s a basement unit so was dry no circulation and hot  very uncomfortable   The blinds do not close      and bc this unit is ground literally sidewalk level no privacy bc of this issue   No actual running kitchen water hope you like making trips to the bathroom to wash dishes  Terrible  Reference messages sent
764827715,We truly loved this AirBnB  It was great for our first visit to Chicago  We loved the cleanliness  the beautiful wood floors  the amenities  kitchen  appliances  etc   the air conditioning  the location  such a beautifulneighborhood   the ease of check in out  parking  wifi  tv  comfy blankets  etc  Overall  it was just so amazing  We definitely plan to stay here again  We truly appreciate the space your company provided  It was great for our visit to Chicago  We loved the cleanliness  the amenities  the air conditioning  the location  the spaciousness  ease of check in out  parking  etc  Overall  it was just so amazing  Only suggestions   Softer bed  either a softer mattress or a mattress padding    Additional seating in the living room  Either a chair or a larger couch   And clear instructions on who to contact if tenants need help with any issues 
468693122747827927,Overall great stay  The front desk people are so kind and helpful 
505813939080964019,This apartment is in a great place just west of the Country Club Plaza    I wanted a quiet place due to the holiday season  and Christmas lighting ceremony   A very quaint spot hidden off the quirky yet neat little roads in this neighborhood   Easy access for someone who is fit to walk to the Plaza area    The parking spot for this apartment is small  not sure if a big car or truck would fit   Good thing I drive a medium to small automobile   The brick steps were loose and gave way on the walk downstairs to the apartment building  ouch  but Im OK  really  with neat little French doors with a touch lock   Cute mid   s charm one bedroom with small shower bathtub   Missing one pane of the plastic nylon vertical shutters to outdoor balcony where I immediately made the acquaintance of a nice little kitty poop   Did I mention that the towels that were set out for me smelled like cigarette smoke   Yes  unfortunately they did   Shame  I really wanted to give you a   star rating because of your swift email correspondence   Respectfully submitted  Clementine Nice location    Fast email service   Towels that were set out smelled of cigarette smoke   Blinds dont shut all the way and one panel is missing   Cat poop     left on balcony  and brick walkway a bit dangerous and bricks on steps were not cemented in and fell as I walked down them to get to apartment   Also if you have a big car  parking spots are small and only allow for one parking spot  though it is free 
488322692352953948,Great place to stay  Very clean and incredibly large apartment and great location with a fantastic pizza place in building  Super easy check in process  Would definitely stay here again  Nice place  Didn t want leave any negative reviews for others to see it but wanted to let u know that the toilet wouldn t flush  it was and easy fix to reconnect to water gauge lever in the tank  with a string but you should have it replaced with chain so it doesn t  become issue with other guests  Also just a heads up on Tuesday night there was a super loud party on the wall behind the living room couch  So loud the picture over couch would shake  I just put in headphones so it wasn t bad for me but if a family was staying there I can see that being a complaint  Again I really liked the place so rated it   stars as the problems with noise is not anything you could control  But wanted to give you a heads up so your aware if fate guests bring it up  Only noise was Tuesday and it was a big party  Maybe a onetime thing  Overall great place  Have a good day 
486949363314766157,Definitely not a let down  Very nice and well maintained place Very nice place   Loved the view  We will look for you again when coming back to kc  Thank you 
450646563678893355,This was a great stay while we were in Kansas City  Its in a great location and just the right amount of space  Communication and checkin with Zencity was wonderful  Wed stay at this property or anothers of Zencitys again  Frequently during our stay our room became very muggy and I think it was because there isnt a working fan pulling moisture out of the bathroom  The AC worked well but didnt do anything for the mugginess  If a fan isnt able to be added to the bathroom  it would be helpful to have a box fan in the closet   The unit could use a fresh coat of paint 
478923632966509371,Very clean  modern and spacious room  The listing was very accurate  Close to the entertainment district  Nice sized water heater  SO no issues with that  Id just be patient with the sign in process  The instructions were not accurate and the Host will leave you waiting for a response for an hour  So be friendly and try to gain entrance to the main building   based on your smile and personality   The access code and instructions for the room door was accurate  unless you extend your reservation  then they will change the code and not give you the new one  until an hour after you request it  This was a really nice  spacious  location  Clean and contemporary   Location was close to the Power and Light district  the entertainment district  The only recommendation that I have that for the host  is that they make sure the sign in instructions are accurate  I had a Very difficult time on two separate days  being locked out of the main entrance and out side of my actual room  It took   to   hours to get a response and better instructions or codes  I waited outside with luggage for   hours  Luckily  two people allowed me to come in with them  But I feared leaving the building because I wasnt sure when I could get back in   I sat outside next to a homeless man  He was also trying to help me get into the main entrance  Very humiliatings and unsafe  It was a nice experience  other than that 
486893549469456804,Everything you could ask for when staying in KC  Was in town for the Giants Chiefs game from NYC and this was a great option for the stay  Would definitely recommend  Really nice apartment  perfect for the stay  Thanks for hosting 
486189512550222077,Beautiful and modern secure place to stay  Love the location and cleanliness of the room  Will stay there another time I appreciate the cleanliness and location  Thank you
457988617518411673,Overall very nice  The apartment is oddly set up very short  The TV and couch for example sit very low 
394133900057814268,This is such a beautiful and wonderful place to stay    it is in a great location  and Slawik is a wonderful host     Thank you Slawik for allowing to stay at your place  it is indeed beautiful and I can tell all the effort and love you have put towards it  I think the only spot you need to figure out is the shower upstairs  For me the water was getting out of the curtain but was little difficult to put it in the right spot  it could be dangerous if someone falls  but I appreciate you in jumping in so quickly at every time I reached out to you 
455748720919576389,STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNIT   WATCH OUT FOR FAKE REVIEWS    This place was a dump and the photos of the unit are from years ago  The unit came with   less sofa then pictured in the description  It also came with a dog bed that was supposed to pass as a place for a human to sleep    Be careful coming up the stairs as the handrail is loose and some of the wall anchors are coming out of the drywall   Theres was dried blood on a few of the walls of the unit when we checked in  There is no WiFi as advertised with the unit  The place comes with the minimal amount of bedding blankets  pillows  many without covers   and towels    I made multiple requests to management and to improve our stay  Management usually took over a day  sometimes    to respond to any of my requests  I was told I could go out and buy the things I requested    The outdoor heater is broken  the record player is broken  the outdoor furniture is filthy and most of the pillows in the living room are stained  I could go on and on  stay away from this sh t hole  This was hands down the worst Air B   B Ive ever booked 
486150547575645369,Be sure to check ahead of time if the call box to get in works  Otherwise you will have to rely on people leaving the building to let you in  The check in was awful  I had to rely on people to come out by chance to let me in  After multiple phone calls  still no resolution after two days  Other than the shower light fixture crashing down and barely missing my head  the actual room was awesome  I really do think a refund or discount of some kind is warranted for all the trouble 
528936976475398485,Overall the place was awesome  Super clean  affordable  and in an awesome location downtown  It was super roomy with everything anyone could want  The only issue we had was with the parking garage  We checked in and used the parking pass to move and park our vehicle into the garage with no issues  Then later that night we left the apartment and tried to enter the garage on foot to use our vehicle and the key fob would not let us back into the garage therefore we had to sit and wait for someone else to come into the garage so we could access our car which was a little frustrating  We were told that the parking pass needed to be left in the car but we ended up just taking the parking pass with us anytime we left the garage because this was the only way we could access our car  The place overall was great  super clean  awesome location and very affordable  The only thing we had issues with was the parking garage  We assumed we used our apartment key fob to enter the parking garage on foot but the key fob never worked for us therefore we had to sit there and wait for a car to enter the garage to get back to our vehicle that was parked in the garage 
534825377469221662,This place was amazing  Checkout was simple  Really close to downtown  and has a market for simple needs and snacks would recommend to anyone who needs a safe and clean place to stay for any type of trip  Thank you so much for hosting and being understanding on such short notice  The apartment was really nice  extremely comfortable  and in a great location 
475300111062849056,great trip  amazing location  walking distance to so many different restaurants  bars  amenities  parking was kind of confusing  had to get a ticket each time I entered but then could never scan ticket and just drove out of garage each time  hoping I dont get charged later  but didnt take away from the overall experience  check out Swordfish Toms  Chartreuse Saloon  Johnnys Tavern  and Riegers Distillery  amazing places 
454988772051631449,The Elm Cottage was absolutely lovely and perfect for our needs  Highly recommended  Thanks 
539157559557596502,Whew  I wish I had believed the reviews when they said the check in process was a hassle  To start it off  our garage opener wouldnt work  Luckily a kind resident used his for us on his way out  Once we parked  which ends up being the  th floor  you have to find the door leading to the main building  once you go through the door you walk around which felt like a maze to find the elevator and take to the  th floor which felt like a maze to find our unit  luckily our code worked but for the remainder of our trip  with contacting the front desk  them giving us a spare one that ALSO didnt work  trying to explain to the host but no solution was given  we never had the garage opener work so we had to either wait for another resident or park on the street and ask the front desk to come out and open the garage door for us  it was very frustrating because it was such a hassle entering the garage  Other than the lack of timely communication from the host  we liked the unit  it was clean but beware the toilet clogs easily and when I messaged the host for the maintenance number  I never received it  luckily it was the morning of check out  upon checking out  the rules say to leave the card key in the unit but you need it to get to the  th floor and for the door to get out into the parking garage so what we did was have   person bring the car to the front and the other go back and drop the key off  when my friend got back to the unit   the clean person was already there and said to just leave it at the front desk  we were hesitant because thats not what the rules were so I messaged the host again and they just said  thanks for letting us know   they need to update their rules and have better instructions on how to find the unit from the garage  ultimately  it is in a central location and the parking being included is great but there was too much hassle to get in and out of the buidling each time  Very good location but the check in instructions need to be explained better  please include the maintenance and front desk number so we can call with any emergencies 
491323824649045225,Dirty  old but good location  Blood on bathroom floor  Smoke alarms were removed from ceiling  unable to turn heat off  Shower unsafe  Bathroom floor had blood on it 
476029132907302883,Great location right outside of Wicker Park  Parking was decent and usually I found a spot in front of the apartment  The bed was great and overall a comfortable stay  The TV came unplugged from behind the wall and I was not able to get it back plugged in  Thanks for the great stay though 
485435348249614453,The apartment itself is fine and the location is good  The apartment is managed by a company and not an owner who is invested and it shows  We never received confirmation that the original keys to the apartment were found  we used a back up set since the key box was empty  and we were never given a pass to get in out of the building to access the apartment  The fire alarm was chirping when we first came in  No one fixed or addressed issues after being asked multiple times  We were told that no one would enter the apartment   the previous renters  probably had the keys     Good apartment but would not stay with this company again  Resolutions need to be more swift  If someone stays at an apartment building they should be able to come in and out of the building  A card to access the building was never provided 
406438927250611361,Had a great stay very nice place and zen was very responsive when needed Had a great stay nice place and was very responsive when needed
528269863049747553,Nice location  very spacious   bedroom with   and     baths  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay  Hi Zencity  I enjoyed my stay but noticed dust build up on the ceiling fans in the big bedroom  You may want to address this  Thanks  Jenine
500774842037690636,Great location  Cute apartment  I was a disappointed that the amenities included  cable tv and there was none   Also  there was a smoke detector chirping in the hall   I was assured someone would come out to fix but nobody ever showed up   Next to the couch is a large heat register   This needs to be clean   It had clumps of dust all over it 
489122959532045765,very big and spacious rooms and living quarters if coming in by car  be wary of parking  the Airbnb was great  very clean and orderly  great location for food and cafes the only downside is parking  there is street parking but barely any spaces since the building itself doesnt have parking provided for its resident 
510917968614242496,Location was perfect  Easy commuting to the different areas around KC  The space was excellent for my fianc e and I  Check in was easy with the step by step instructions  We ll definitely be using Zencity for other trips  Thank you so much for letting us stay at your location for the weekend  The only thing that bothered us was getting a message about noise at          pm when in the house rooms say quiet time starts at   pm  Maybe revisit the rules  Other than that  the location was perfect for the activities we had planned 
521734416491433743,Great price   However the dirty towels piled on the floor  dirty sheets   and trash cans not empty after a   hour drive was a bit irritating  Definitely not very clean  Price was great  However the towels were still dirty and piled up in the bathroom  trash cans weren t empty and sheets were dirty 
434748826821910383,Exactly as advertised  We we re sure if there would be an A C unit  but luckily there was a window A C unit  The bed was pretty uncomfortable  but the whole apartment was clean  Overall  we enjoyed our stay  We appreciated the cleanliness  but we did wish the bed was more comfy  considering a bed to sleep on was really all we needed 
487693586581529393,Great location with an outstanding view and comfortable bed  Could use an actual coffee maker or at least a Keurig  Couch was good but that leatherette chair was not really practical  Kitchen was well supplied  And good internet  Took me a few attempts to speak the code in at the front door for the initial check in  Great area of Chicago 
473183985846723619,i loved the place  loved the location  all the amenities are included  beautiful view from the windows everything was nice  maybe a good idea to buy a water filter
500743459713865846,Super convenient location 
484011875503266245,Stay was great   Check in was easy and Zencity was responsive  Layout was good for my small family  adult and   kids  Really appreciated the washer dryer  I hesitated when I saw the reviews about smoking and a bug  but this place was very clean and smoke free so apparently they ve corrected any issues   This is a classic city apartment located in a   floor walk up  right on the division strip in wicker park  It met expectations for accessibility walkability and cleanliness  I d rent this place again  Stay was great   Check in was easy and Zencity was responsive  I m still waiting on a reimbursement correction since I was offered an extra day for     and I was charged      Layout was good for my small family  Really appreciated the washer dryer  I d rent this place again 
415145448981524881,great location  Small  but efficient studio 
510157780015856521,This was   without a doubt   the worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had    Zencity provided an incorrect door code and thus I was left stranded in a hallway that smelled of garbage masked with weed at midnight  After reaching out to ask for a new code  radio silence  I heard back from them at     am  which was just someone asking  If I had gotten in alright   without even including a new door code or any acknowledgement that their failure to provide the correct door code had left me locked out  I found a hotel with an available room  booked it  and when I woke up wrote to Zencity to request a refund and a cancellation of my two day reservation  which they refused to provide  They then said that they hoped to be able to provide me with a better Zencity experience  which clearly they did not want to provide or they would have answered my requests  I had to elevate the issue to Airbnb to get a full refund for my trip  Zencity has continued to refuse to provide a refund or compensate me in any way for the expense of the nearest hotel  I had a lovely trip  thanks to the Hoxton and the Ace hotels  I cannot stress enough how much I recommend avoiding Zencity when looking for your next Airbnb stay  Hello  I just wanted to   yet again   reiterate how terrible of an Airbnb experience this was  After you failed to respond to me as I was checking in  the response  at     am  did not even include the correct door code  And you ve continued to refuse to provide a refund  despite my requesting several times  AND I continued to receive messages from you as if everything was fine and I was able to check in  That is just terrible customer service  especially in hospitality  This is not to mention that getting into the apartment building felt unsafe and the hallway smelled like rotting garbage masked by the smell of weed 
478975644623516894,Great
482553259045549913,Lovely and cozy apartment  perfectly equipped  excellent location  we highly recommend arriving  Yoram and Pascal Thank you very much for the hospitality  a lovely and cozy apartment we enjoyed very much and we will return again probably Yoram and Pascal
404359705698881648,the location is unbelievable  in five blocks  you can walk past the Truman house and to the downtown square for ice cream   great communal space  perfect for our family of   to feel together but on vacation  great kitchen and new bathroom renovations too  we did see a mouse scurry across the kitchen at night  not worried about it  but the house was so clean that I thought youd like to know
538462236749613474,The location is great and closer to everything  Good for a couple who is exploring a city and having a busy time during visit 
494156230021082450,Great value  clean  cute room  walking distance to grocery and dining  perfect location for my business visit  Great value will leave a positive review  A couple notes   the kitchen sink drain seems to need a clean  water was draining slowly   the coats hooks have been abused previously  just a windbreaker moved them from the wall 
510934479218328231,Broken glass french press  no Wi Fi  no cable  back door locked stuff  dirty and broken decor  broken lights with exposed glass   DO NOT stay here listing us not how it appears  Broken glass french press  no Wi Fi  no cable  back door locked stuff  dirty and broken decor  broken lights with exposed glass 
405045197708391420,Easy check in  Clean  Bed and bedding very comfortable  I have no complaints about the rental l  Would rent here again  The ONLY thing that the light outside the bedroom window was bothersome when trying to go to sleep even with the blinds closed  We easily moved passed it but people who are maybe sensitive to light and want total darkness in their room might find it more annoying than we did  Otherwise it was a great rental 
479713664322342206,Great place in a great location  We couldnt get the volume on the tv to work  And the fans in the bedroom wouldnt turn on  but we finally got the main bedroom to work  Great place and great location though  We are very appreciative 
523926811215689835,Great location near BJC and right across from Forest Park  clean apartment  nice building with helpful concierges  lots of linens  enough kitchenware  large screen Roku TV  and pretty much just like how it looks in the pictures   Minor negatives   the couch is small  two seater  so if someone needs to sleep on it  that doesnt really work  Also the wifi is a bit slow  One time it actually wasnt working  but I called and they told me to reboot the modem and that worked   There are a couple of spots in the apartment where the finiishes are a little off   one piece of baseboard molding missing  a slight gap between the laminate floor boards in one spot  but otherwise everything is just how it looks in the pictures  Overall  nice place and excellent value  Just a suggestion if you ever switch out the furniture in any of your places   it would be nice to have a bigger table   The little bistro thing is only barely big enough for one person to eat at comfortably 
522683901746036416,tl dr  Avoid Zencity properties   This was my second time staying in the same unit  First booking was fine  This time  as multiple reviews have pointed out  the heater is impossible to turn off and runs full blast         By the time I checked in  not only was it always running  but it was also emitting a high pitched screeching sound  making the unit uninhabitable   I reported the issue the evening I checked in  spent one sleepless night there  and when about    hours had passed with no resolution  no maintenance sent out  I cancelled the booking and moved elsewhere   Im now close to two weeks into a fight for a refund  which they have refused  and are now ignoring my messages   My only recourse was to dispute the charge on my credit card   The whole thing was major  and completely avoidable  pain in the a    They could have sent a maintenance person  they could have moved me to another unit in the building  there were units available   or just refunded my booking  They did none of this   If youre wondering why their properties seem below market price  this is why  They buy up a ton of property then skimp on maintenance  customer service  etc  I wish I had realized this before booking 
518071120847374508,The good  The best part about this Airbnb is hands down the LOCATION  As a St  Louis native  the location is truly unbeatable  Shockingly  I was easily able to find parking every single day I was there which was very surprising given how busy the area can be  The kitchen was very nice  the studio space was very nice  big TV  nice bed  and cute chair and ottoman   Now  the not so good  The bathroom is RAGGEDY  This apartment is in a very old building and it s evident  The bathroom was almost uncomfortable to be in  It lol just looked like it was falling apart  Also  there was this weird steam coming from the bottom corner behind the bathroom door  Sounded like it was coming from a boiler room or something idk  The bathroom sink also wasn t clean properly  The washing machine didn t smell very nice and didn t get some of my clothes clean    The host  Initially  they acted like they didn t want to approve my stay because I m new to Airbnb  They told me this in a message and sort of interrogated me about the purpose of my stay  This was a little off putting and I was about to cancel and go with another place  but they approved it right before I cancelled  I liked the location so I decided to give them a try  The self check in process was very easy  I ended up needing to stay another night because I mistakenly booked my stay one night short and I asked for them to extend  This host does take a lot longer than others to respond to messages  BUT they did extend my stay  They did charge an extra     blaming Airbnb for putting the incorrect lower price  They also forgot to ensure the code to the door remained the same  so I got locked out of the apartment for a few hours which was very inconvenient    Overall  it was just okay  The location really is the selling point here 
515988601203594317,Great stay  Would stay again  Only down side was broken and or missing blinds on most of the windows 
487609098635519348,Great place  great hosts  extremely kind crew  Worths every penny  Thanks to all the crew in Zencity  mainly for its support and kindness 
475358878633158563,Had a ton of difficulty getting into the property  First at the building entrance  using the call box would only take you to their help line and not ask for a code like it says in their  how to get in  message  If it wasnt for other people coming and going from the building  we would have never gotten in  Secondly  their key fob system didnt work with the code that was given to us and it took    min to actually get into the room despite being in the building  Customer service times are aweful  Work on getting into the building and customer response times 
475358774369058302,Very nice apartment  host was very thorough and check in instructions were very clear  Great location right on the streetcar route and close to all the entertainment  We enjoyed our stay  Ceiling fan in the bedroom didnt work a used wash cloth was left hanging on the back of the bathroom door  over all happy with everything  We will return 
465949027702775611,Amazing place  Waaaay bigger than the pictures  Very pleasantly surprised    Would definitely stay again  Amazing place  Waaaay bigger than the pictures  Very pleasantly surprised    Would definitely stay again 
468798813537923679,This was a great stay  The parking was a little challenging  but it was in a good area where you re able to walk drive to restaurants and all in good timing  The check in was a little challenging  However  once we were able to get in it was much better  The apartment looks just as the picture depicts  I enjoyed my week stay here  Thank you so much for an opportunity to stay at your home  It was very pleasant and comfortable 
476780674696251018,Small studio apartment  perfect for a solo traveler or a couple  Easy parking access directly behind the apartment via the Spothero website  Had an issue with the entry code into the apartment but the host was able to resolve it via phone quickly  Train is right next door  Lots of shops and places to eat nearby  Wonderful stay  would return  Thank you for hosting me  I had a wonderful time 
506562278214242064,Nice place  Great view
506480272616885463,Clean and quiet
452825938223414676,This place is as described  We were given very thorough check in instructions which helped immensely  There was no parking pass when we arrived   we parked in the lot anyway because the street was short term parking only  It took nearly a day for a response to our message  and we were given a replacement parking pass for the remainder of our visit  The space is nice and quiet  well lit and huge windows in the living room  It felt very homey  We d definitely stay here again  I wish I had made time to utilize the workout room  We liked being able to do our laundry with the in unit washer and dryer  As with most efficiency models  it was quite noisy so if you do laundry  do so outside of sleeping hours  Thank you for a nice place to stay  We appreciated the coffee table books 
468845855224197576,Thank you for another great stay  Thank you for another great stay 
515924785437961606,The stay was great  Only problem we had were the microwave and dryer didn t work 
490594530052119767,Great view and great location  Great location  would have liked an easier code to access the apartment  Place was nice but had a strong oder  Not the best on cleanliness but not dirty  Parking wasn t good and couldn t control thermostat  Would have liked more timely responses 
500760917147657822,Good area SMELLED VERY BAD AND THE TUB CERTAIN WAS NASTY AND DIRTY
482550346422610784,The apartment was nice but the check in process was a nightmare  We were road tripping and stopped in Kansas City just for a place to sleep  We showed up late in the night and no one answered the intercom as instructed  We would ve been stuck sleeping in our car if it weren t for a family coming in late at night  There should be a better process where the renter has freedom at night 
480456523902241128,So nice and relaxing  Great  quiet spot  Check in was somewhat confusing and didnt work at first   Once I was in it was great  I would like to go back again  It was a nice place to stay  I had a great time  Check in took about    min  It was confusing and the code didnt work the first few times then it all of a sudden worked   But once  I was in it was great and I loved the security 
480459619628586766,Really cool space and easy travel to several local places  Loved the Combine food and service  Highly recommend and would stay again next time  There were no trash can liners so we had to just use our plastic bags for our trash  Otherwise it was a perfectly fine stay 
542094493559984597,Great space  super clean and close to everything in the heart of the city  Practice your parallel parking  sometimes a challenge in this busy area of the city  Beds were awesome     very Zen modern  Loved the books and the interior design  Sea of calm during a tumultuous family visit  The only suggestion I would make is to have a more expedient type of coffee maker  I did my best but I am no barista with a French press Starbucks minutes away saved my life    
542024370914380171,Overall excellent place and great location  We found that the wifi wasnt properly setup prior to us arriving and the replacement information the host provided was also not correct  Id suggest looking at the flooring installed and covering up gaps and loose boards 
418092951744335077,The house was spectacular  The house was very clean  well kept  and comfortable to stay in   The house was located to several places around the community and places were easy to get to  It is located in a very quiet neighborhood  I would recommend anyone traveling to this area to book the house   The house that I stayed in for a week while I was traveling for was awesome   Slawik was great to respond to any questions that I had and if I did  they quickly took care of it  The house was spectacular    clean  well kept  and a very nice place to stay  I would definitely stay there again next time that Im down there a gain for work 
476015457382680052,Great location  Thanks     The tub could use a mat  a little slippery  Great location 
479664339949535515,Look at the photos  read the reviews  if youre here you already know the deal  Sure there are a few scuffs here or there  but the location and the price are hard to beat   Parking is tricky  but there are options  and I had some extreme difficulty getting in the lobby  Its kind of an involved  unintuitive process  But when I called  they answered and coached me through it   All in all  a good place to stay if the location works for you  Thanks for the stay  Sorry it took us a few extra minutes to get out the door  but we were prepping for a wedding and just lost track of time 
439842686583085943,solid apartment  good for checking out Hyde Park  thanks for the great stay  there was a lot more A C options available for the summer heat than I realized or expected 
511577713029587983,Pretty awful experience  Room smelled like cigarettes  Wi Fi was really slow  Most people in the hotel or place never wore masks  Parking was a nightmare    Tried to talk to one of your staff members and she just made me feel stupid for not mentioning how the room smelled when I first entered    The clean fees and extra costs are really steep as well  Overall I couldn t be more disappointed with Zencity   Jerry Retired USN Pretty awful experience  Room smelled like cigarettes  Wi Fi was really slow  Most people in the hotel or place never wore masks  Parking was a nightmare    Tried to talk to one of your staff members and she just made me feel stupid for not mentioning how the room smelled when I first entered    The clean fees and extra costs are really steep as well  Overall I couldn t be more disappointed with Zencity   Jerry
527573983002872284,Great location 
542039512953981085,GREAT PLACE    
476066970196403905,Great location in Hyde Park  Spacious   bedroom apartment  Very comfortable  Hey yall  just a heads up that it would be great to have some spices in the cabinet  And my wife clean the outside of one of the front windows   it made a huge difference  Otherwise  we loved the place  Thank you 
454992587125776549,Great location  Close to downtown  Lighting could be better  Many did not work or were very dim 
429649497835950699,Firstly  we are grateful for the space as well as the hospitality of the staff    We were assured that the space was going to be clean when we entered but in reality we felt like more care could have been placed into the space   When we checked in  we found significant amounts of dust all over the picture frames  on the window sill and on the air conditioner  We had to take the liberty of wiping down every surface in the apartment ourselves    Also  the sinks faucet was detached and seemed to not be fully installed  It was an ordeal to use the faucet because we had to hold it down first before we did anything   Honestly for the price we paid  we were expecting the space to be a little more put together  At the very least  the space could have been properly and fully clean  It felt more like someone went in  saw that it hadn t been touched  made the bed and reported it clean  Firstly  we are grateful for the space as well as the hospitality of the staff    We were assured that the space was going to be clean when we entered but in reality we felt like more care could have been placed into the space   When we checked in  we found significant amounts of dust all over the picture frames  on the window sill and on the air conditioner  We had to take the liberty of wiping down every surface in the apartment ourselves    Also  the sinks faucet was detached and seemed to not be fully installed  It was an ordeal to use the faucet because we had to hold it down first before we did anything   Honestly for the price we paid  we were expecting the space to be a little more put together  At the very least  the space could have been properly and fully clean  It felt more like someone went in  saw that it hadn t been touched  made the bed and reported it clean 
479701646226894081,Believe anyone else here when they say how terrible the check in process is  It s so inaccurate  The fob in the room does nothing  The elevator in the building sometimes works with it  sometimes doesn t  The building itself only has one working elevator and there is a lot of construction going on so it s dusty  The pool is under construction so was closed    The room itself was okay  The shower did not drain correctly so you do stand in your shower water every time  The bathroom lighting is super dim to begin with and a lightbulb was out so it made it worse  There were some holes in the wall which was weird to see    You do have to type in a long code to get into your room every time which is a bit annoying  Overall  it wasn t the worst place to stay in the entire world but ZenCity needs to get it together and make some changes  Please please please update your check in instructions  Literally everyone complains about it and you ve done nothing to change it    Also there are light bulbs out  Change them  It s pretty simple 
532628652824760725,Fire alarms went off   time s during our   night stay  each during the middle of the night forcing us out of bed  Just something to be aware of  Thanks for the stay  The reason for the rating was because of how many time the fire alarms went off during the middle of the night  I understand it s not your fault  but maybe something to mention be aware of 
542016084990402270,Clean and cute apartment  great location  Host gave clear instructions for both check in and check out  Would definitely stay again  Everything was great   My only note would be that a throw blanket would have been nice for the couch or added layers on the bed but otherwise it was a great deal  Thank you so much 
532582573729332149,Great place near the park and Barnes Jewish  Easy check in  Easy check in and a very nice place right by the hospital and the beautiful forest park 
453632867791253947,My group and I had a wonderful stay  It was somewhat confusing trying to find the parking garage and getting into it  it looks da felt like a treasure hunt  However  overall we had a wonderful experience and stay 
511648202586158860,Not a great stay unit is not clean at all  This was not a great choice to stay The stay would have been great but the room was terrible  You can tell no one is properly clean the unit  Kind of disappointed considering it was my girlfriends   th birthday  I would not return to this location

494932663101511465,Awesome apartment  Location is great  I liked the coffee shop on the corner  Street parking was available  please watch out for street clean days  the apartment was very clean  fully functional kitchen no pots or pans   I extended my reservation twice and the host was very responsive  Would definitely stay again Thank you so much for having us  Everything was awesome and clean
478923334385202547,Would highly recommend this place  The whole process was seamless  The unit was very clean and a great view of Kansas City from the top floor  Location is perfect for dining and night life  If you re looking for a place to stay in KC this is the spot  Thank you so much  Everything was seamless and it was a great night stay 
394900622998807163,I ll start by saying that I booked this Airbnb by mistake  My partner and I were traveling for a family member s funeral  and I thought I was simply sending a message  I had a question about parking  but the interface actually was a  Reserve  button instead of a  Send  button    I was on hold with Airbnb for over an hour before a senior representative said that it would be up to the host to refund me in full due to the mistake  Zencity is a company with no remorse for my situation  so they stood by their cancellation policy  I was going to lose out on a significant amount of money if I had cancelled so we decided it would be best to just go ahead with the reservation  The neighborhood  it s location to where we needed to be  and fairly easy street parking were the ONLY positives of this listing   We checked in around   pm because we were driving from NYC  We were tired from the road trip  and grieving being back in my partner s hometown  To say we needed comfortable accommodations is an understatement  We could not afford to find another place to stay given the circumstances of our visit   The apartment and building is dirty  dingy  and dilapidated  The chair in the studio is absolutely disgusting and looks to be covered in what were human fluids  I m assuming this was not checked by someone from Zencity after it was set up by whatever housekeeping company is used  The linens were not soiled and had been washed  but we still found hair  a giant ant  and light stains in the bed  dust and dirt on tables  headboard  windowsills  hair in the bathroom  the main rug is absolutely dirty and dingy  dust caked onto the ceiling fan  grease oil and food stains on the walls  The trash can in the kitchen won t close all the way  Dirty eating utensils in dusty kitchen drawers  I wish I could upload photos  We decided to sleep on top of the comforter because of how uncomfortable the mattress is and after finding a second bug  silver bug  the second night  The bed squeaks at the slightest movement and feels terrible    When notifying them about the condition of the apartment  their initial suggestion was to send a cleaner when we were not there  Were we supposed to repack our personal belongings  and lug it out and lug it back  In the middle of our visit  Or did they expect us to leave our personal things there while cleaners worked around it  Either thought is ludicrous    I requested a refund of some of the fees  and they refunded only the clean fee        I ended up buying a few sanitizing clean supplies to wipe down the surfaces that our stuff came in direct contact with  There are some clean supplies  but I barely wanted to touch anything in the room  The mop swiffer thing was as dingy and dirty as the apartment   Some of the hallway lights leading up to the room were broken  and the light sign right outside our door is broken flickering  The hallways and lobby smelled  Throughout our stay there were random pieces of trash throughout the hallways and stairway  The listing also said that this unit includes a washer and dryer  which it does not  There are communal W D on the basement ground level  When walking through the basement ground level to use the staircase by the apartment  the floor was littered with dead cockroaches  You can t make this up    On our last day night  we came back to the unit with the light switched on and we were POSITIVE that we had turned off every light  We think that someone at Zencity must have notified the cleaners to come that day thinking it was our checkout day  and they arrived  turned on the light  and quickly shut the door seeing that it was still inhabited  I don t know if this actually happened  but we KNOW we turned every light off    Please save your money  Zencity does not care about hospitality and comfort  They just want to get paid  We should have been given a more significant refund due to the condition of the apartment and building  It s absolutely disgusting  and makes it feel like you are really scamming people   On our last day night  we came back to the unit with the light switched on and we were POSITIVE that we had turned off every light  We think that someone must have notified the cleaners to come that day thinking it was our checkout day  and they arrived  turned on the light  and quickly shut the door seeing that it was still inhabited  I don t know if this actually happened  but we KNOW we turned every light off 
477556439153579386,Would recommend  Great stay  very clean  Thanks so much for having me on such short notice  The place was very clean and even showing up at     am the security guard was very helpful        would love to stay here again and see some more of beautiful KC 
453557615672156741,I really enjoyed this new building and the location  The stay was immaculate as can be expected with the Zencity name  The only thing downward of mention to me was the staff that worked at the desk  They never greeted me in the many passing we had  sort of had the demeanor and body language of being judgmental  Luckily  the comfort built into this Zencity stay  made light work of any bad vibe  Thank you for providing a great product and service  they are truly exceptional among all other hosts  It may not seem like much  allowing me to stay  but amid going through a great deal losing my house  it meant a great deal   Please accept my apologies to you and your staff for being late checking out  Ive been having to learn a few new skills I was hoping to never have had to learn   You have always been my first choice and referral to everyone  and hope you will keep me in your good graces for future stays 
452879927669098582,Great location   easy access to cta and metra  Short walk to beach  Close to UChicago  Clean and well maintained  Highly recommend  Thanks for a great first visit to Chicago  A little confusing with the fob   as it looks like   fobs   thought one was for building and one for apartment door   and that is a long code  Apart from that  everything was good  Under kitchen sink was roll of paper towels that looked like they got wet sometime in the past  Chair by window a little wobbly  Also would have liked availability of  nd dish towel or dish strainer for wet dishes  Access to public transportation great  Also  nearness of beach  Hope this is available next time we visit Chicago  Thanks for hosting 
528285625862465243,We loved our time staying here  The location was close to everything  and also easy to get in and out  The check in process was very clearly communicated and easy  There were lots of families staying there as well  It was very family friendly  Very clean and cozy  We would definitely stay here again 
452911769630198399,Good location building  Parking is a little tricky  The place was not very clean when we arrived  Worked in a pinch  but would not highly recommend The place was fairly dirty when we got there
453588940417233689,Front desk people  super helpful  Apartment had everything we needed for our stay  My biggest worry was being safe  We were   young girls coming in for a concert  It was reassuring knowing that you needed a key fob to not only get into the building  but also then had to use the key fob to access the elevator  The beds were super comfortable   the window units kept the bedrooms cool  There was a parking garage that you could pay for  but we always found on the street parking that was quiet a bit closer  When checking out I had a question  they got back with me very quickly  Will be staying here again when returning to stl  Thank you so much  Will be staying here again  if we return to STL 
494189778663428157,All fine  In a quiet neighborhood  close to a supermarket  Well equipped kitchen was definitely a plus  Good value  thanks a lot   all fine  but it was the wrong passcode for the door downstairs 
469560978780509330,A delightful stay  wonderful location   home was quaint  and slightly quirky  A terific value  We would stay again when in Kansas City  Host was very cordial  The lack of handrails for outdoor stairs was quite dangerous  Also the bathtubs being so deep with a curved  bottom made them quite slippery and difficult to get in and out of  Also dangerous  maybe some handles on the walls would be helpful 
445577968379184481,This historic home is full of charm and comfort and character    We loved the bathtubs and all the beautiful wood details   The staircase   The little built in library in the bedroom   The piano   The sleeper sofa is even comfortable  as are the other beds as well  The location was very conveniently located for all the different directions we traveled to in the area    The owner is also very responsive if you have a question or do a dumb thing and lock yourself out   and he was so nice and cheerful about coming to our rescue   Rent this one   you won t be sorry     Thank you so much Slawik   The house was perfect   Love a quirky old historic house    We enjoyed every minute of our stay and I personally loved baths in the tub      You explained everything so well in the house manual and I am still feeling bad about how dumb I was with the front door lock  You were so kind about it so thank you for that too   My mom says the couch bed was the best one she has ever slept on    I loved the built in closet bookcase in the living room  and the library cabinet in the main bedroom is amazing  We did think of a suggestion or two  Some paper towels in the kitchen would be really nice   Maybe some tie backs for the downstairs curtains to bring the sun in    The only other thing is we were surprised that milk and bagels weren t in the fridge because we read that things like that for breakfast would be there   No worries   breakfast items have never been provided at any rental we have stayed in and we have been in many   So we were not counting on it  but you may want to remove that from the reading   We loved our trip and we loved your house and thank you for sharing it    
496370118850955444,This is a great location in Hyde Park  The beds are super comfy and the living space is big enough for you not to feel cramped   Clean and plenty of towels and bathroom supplies   Words of warning though   really for    not    as the sofa is just that   not a pull out sofa bed  And the kitchen is not massively well stocked with appliances  But would we go back there  For sure  Ok   a couple of things here  Great apartment in a great spot    But only for   not     the sofa is too small and there was no duvet for it    Secondly the kitchen equipment was shockingly sparse     teaspoon   Seriously  And no corkscrew   so we had to shell out       at Wholefoods for one  Which I left there  Maybe you could reimburse me 
541985460343731670,It was a great spot for us was able to walk to the blues game was very convenient and  Perfect for our trip
494227926431325396,Great location and easily reachable by public transportation  Great spot for a couple days to discover Chicago  The apartment is clean and as presented in the pictures  I would ve wished for some basic pantry such as coffee  salt  pepper  cooking oil etc 
389830478937118978,You can expect the host to be readily available for your every need 
542020265371064858,Nice place great location  nice view quiet place
468774929150711572,We really enjoyed this cozy space  the bed was like a pillow and we were able to get lots of rest after our long flight around the world  Thank you again 
512294895098252811,the neighbors were strange and keep coming by my door  felt like everytime I left  stuff was moved around inside apartment  when I reported this to zencity  I got no reply  It was a clean apartment but parking is terrible at this location  please make sure no one can enter into a guests room with prior knowledge 
536924174787213967,Nice place  very comfortable and quiet  O would stay again  Overnight  parking from November  st to April on Division street is not permitted  You will get towed  Floors were dirty and the rug hasn t been clean in a while 
767913155,beautiful house in a great location  would highly recommend this place to anyone you have an awesome house  thanks for the great stay
476832446329971748,Good things     Apartment and building looked like the photos   This is an old hotel that has been converted to residences and it had a charm about it   It was clean and well maintained         Security measures included card or fob to select your floor  so no one entering the building who wasn t supposed to be there could get to your floor        My floor was quiet during sleeping hours        If you do get through to customer service on a phone  they were very pleasant and they maintain a      operation for concerns   However  their ability to resolve most situations appears limited        One security guard was on rounds during early morning hours    am      Barriers to an excellent stay     Ghost host   There is no onsite or  in the area  host   Any issues one faces must be managed via text message on the AirBNB text platform   Further  there was no telephone contact provided for customer service   I had to look this up online and it took a while to find   They are based in Palm Springs CA  which was nearly      miles away from my site   And  it s clear the messages sent out prior to and after the visit are auto generated   There really is no  Ava  at Zencity  someone just copy pasted a message or pushed the  before  and  after  messages through   Low marks for impersonal service        Host does not know the property   For the conglomerate of Zencity  which apparently runs properties in Chicago  St  Louis  and Kansas City  they do not keep up with any changes to the property unless they hear about it from customers or residents   In my case      the pool had been closed by the health department   I had hoped to use the pool  as I had seen it on the photos   A kind update would have been appreciated     the original call box I was supposed to use for entering the building  at a side entrance  was disconnected and not operational   Signs had been posted directing people to go to the front entrance   Zencity customer service staff were clueless about this and asked me to text them photos    the address for the side entrance  where I was originally supposed to enter  was just plain wrong  promoting added confusion     the other call box screen at the front entrance required different codes  which I did not receive until the next day     of the two lobby elevators  one was broken down   Permanent residents did not know when the other elevator would be repaired     the area is frequented by a transient population pressing for handouts  presenting some safety concerns        Rough first day   Because of their lack of awareness  see      I was given the wrong entrance codes for the building   I spent  h upon arrival trying to contact someone  the mysterious  Ava   by text message on the AirBNB platform   I got in via a resident  who used their elevator key card to help me access my floor   The codes for my room were accurate  so at least I could get that far   However  the HID key fob they left in my room that was supposed to operate the HID panel at the building entrance  to release the door lock  was non functional   With neither a working key fob or working building entrance door codes  and no one getting back to me  I had to find other lodging that night   I eventually talked to a customer service agent by phone  but my issue was not resolved until the next day  after a    minute session over the phone    I only used   of my   prepaid nights there   A resolution for a partial refund is still pending on this matter         Residents and guests bad mouth Zencity overall   Every resident I met said Zencity was worthless and should not be running apartments there at all   Other guests using the space said the same thing   lack of response to concerns  no way to meet with or talk to a human about a problem onsite  bad key cards or fobs  inattention to building concerns  and other issues     Only   star for this property  because there are no zero stars  and because all the good things I listed above  I could get somewhere else routinely     Run away from  don t walk towards  a Zencity property   Regrettable experience  I had a very difficult experience  which can be re read on the AirBNB text platform as well as in my public review  While customer service reps were as helpful as possible over the phone  the business model you have as a remote host is not a suitable match under AirBNB  largely because you are reliant on text and email conversation  not in person communication   You are missing the point of hospitality   building relationships    I have requested a refund for the one night I was denied  as I did not receive a resolution for entering until the next morning   For the      apt at     McGee I noted the towel bar was coming loose at one end and the soap dispenser was too tall for easy use at the bathroom sink   Also  the tub did not drain well at all   Soap scum from bathing showering adhered to the tub floor and made the surface very slippery  a distinct hazard   You would do well to install an ADA bar to help with careful entering and exiting the tub  even if you clear up the slow drain   But  you would do best overall to discontinue your connection to AirBNB and pull this property off their site 
533379283256467698,Zencity has a great Chicago host   We have used their property a number of times this year   communication for property access is easy and convenient  Our apartment in the Chicago Wrightwood neighborhood was clean   convenient   Communication with host  Zencity  was flawless 
450015903992766795,Fantastic location sighing walking distance to a ton of great spots  Check in was smooth and easy  Would most definitely recommend  Amazing location  Thank you for making this a great stay 
490613002387830243,Fantastic location and space  Great for a getaway  As described and would recommend and or stay there again  Only issue was no coffee maker or supplies in unit so if you like morning coffee bring your own  Thanks so much  It would have been great if the unit had a coffee maker with supplies  We loved the location and the space  Would recommend or stay again 
457199097010787509,The apartment was right above a Starbucks  in walking distance to Wrigley field  Great open space   the pictures dont do it justice  On days without Cubs games there isnt much to do in the area  but on gamedays the area comes alive    The only issue we had was there was no key left for us in the lockbox when we arrived  When we called to try to get it sorted  we were told they would call us back to work something out   they never did   We luckily got let in by another tenant in the apartment above us  but we couldnt leave the building because we didnt have a key to get back in  Finally    hours later    pm they told us there was a backup lockbox in the back of the building that may have another key in it   it did  Definitely frustrating to spend the day in the apartment waiting around and unable to leave    The floors are very creaky and loud  and the keypad lock on the apartment door required a    digit code to get in  It auto locks the door  so anytime you leave youll need to enter the    digit code to unlock it  Two minor bugs  but not major    Enjoyed our time here and if it wasnt for the building key snafu it wouldve been perfect 
534012629878872811,Beautiful apartment however as a multicultural man I feel discriminated against during my stay here  I received phone calls and messages via text and the Airbnb app threatening to kick me out of the Airbnb I paid for and was accused of apparently smoking Marijuana in the apartment that was in fact before I denied any of the allegations as I do not even smoke Marijuana however they continued to kick me out of the unit until I refused to leave until they sent somebody to verify the smell was not coming from the apartment I was in  This was handled very unprofessionally and made me feel uncomfortable for my remainder of my stay there knowing that I was being accused of something I didn t do and was automatically being kicked out without any proof of the allegations being true  After they found out the allegations weren t true I didn t even get an apology at the very least Beautiful apartment however as a multicultural man I feel discriminated against during my stay here  I received phone calls and messages via text and the Airbnb app threatening to kick me out of the Airbnb I paid for and was accused of apparently smoking Marijuana in the apartment that was in fact before I denied any of the allegations as I do not even smoke Marijuana however they continued to kick me out of the unit until I refused to leave until they sent somebody to verify the smell was not coming from the apartment I was in  This was handled very unprofessionally and made me feel uncomfortable for my remainder of my stay there knowing that I was being accused of something I didn t do and was automatically being kicked out without any proof of the allegations being true  After they found out the allegations weren t true I didn t even get an apology at the very least
425334499463447464,Great location and very affordable given the local amenities 
460804192697711505,Great place to stay   The area around this place is super cute and it is in walking distance of a bunch of restaurants  A great place to stay and we had such a good time   The only thing was that there were a lot of bugs that we had to kill  I am super that is not      your fault but just something we thought you guys should know  
476087699611871447,Location is great  Apartment needs improvement  Hello  thank you for having us  We really enjoyed being in Kansas and being so close to everything  The apartment however could be better improved  I d like to leave the note here as I wouldn t like to leave it on public wall    The clean was not that great when we arrived  There was a lot of hair in the bathroom and also in the bed sheets  We didn t feel comfortable sleeping in the bed after we saw that but we didn t have other choice  The floor in the living room was very dusty and the carpet was stained with wine  If you look under the couch  there is still a broken wine glass there  The couch was also was stained with some white thing  I don t think the person doing the clean is looking at these thing s very well  Also  some more items in the kitchen to help us prepare a meal properly would be great  At nighttime  there was a lot of noise from some neighbors  It was al ways during    am  On Saturday night we were really scared as someone almost broke a door knocking on it  I believe it was next to us  On Friday night someone we didn t know came knocking on our door as well passed midnight  I hope you take these suggestions into consideration  It would help you grant your future guests a better stay  Thank you 
530722229389477117,expect the shittiest stay of your life  Ive stayed with you guys before and had no problems  The second time I made a reservation with you guys literally every part of it was fucked up  I was able to get through the front door of the apartment building but after that everything went to shit  Yall gave me the wrong code for the keycafe so I couldnt get my key to go any further than the lobby because you need a key fob for literally every door and the elevator  it took about   hours to get ahold of someone and finally get a key for me to use  So me and my girlfriend made our way up to the apartment  When we got to the apartment door the door wasnt locked  Instead it was open and when we walked in it was fucking disgusting there were used bandaids on the floor  the bathroom had someones hair all over the sink and toilet and shower  dirty towels on the floor  used wash rag in the shower  there was trash all over the apartment  and the bed was dirty and had obviously been slept in by someone  its was just disgusting and a horrible new years eve and experience all together
480358404794953152,Great accommodation   nice location  very clean  Nice unit  It would be nice to have seating besides the bed    Thanks
476110946949368957,Place is exactly as advertised and worked out well for our weekend trip  Only issue we had was at check in when we were provided the wrong code to the front door 
504397907913406277,This is our second time spending a week in this home   Its a great centralized location to stay when we come in the area   The beds are comfy and we love the history of the area and the story of how this home was rehabilitated  Thanks again for a great place to stay   We are sorry to see this great home go but will definitely keep your other listings in mind for future KC trips 
413708747696676822,We loved this big  spacious house  It was perfect for a big family gathering   The kitchen was nice and well stocked  We cooked most of our meals here   We also liked that there were so many sights within walking distance  The nearby park was perfect for kids with a fun splash pad   We also loved that there were a couple of work spaces for those of us that had to work a bit on our trip   The host was very responsive when we had questions  I would highly recommend this beautiful  historic house  Hi Slawik   Thanks for the lovely stay  We had a couple of things we noticed that were not in great shape  due to heavy use  Im sure    Almost all the hand towel rings in the bathrooms were loose   falling off the walls   The bedding   specifically the mattress pads and blankets smelled bad   The sheets were clean  but it smelled like the rest of the bedding had never been washed   It was warm so we just stripped them off the beds and washed the mattress pads ourself  But it was pretty unsavory   The handle in the top floor bathroom tub would fall off if you touched it  So we couldnt really use it easily   And of course you know about the mice  It was pretty gross that we had to wait days for mouse poop to get clean out of the kitchen    The air conditioning went out every day and we had to reset the breaker   You seen like a really conscientious owner  so I wanted to let know about the opportunities privately   But for the most part  we really enjoyed our stay   Thank you for trying to take care of things from a distance   I know its hard when your property manager and cleaners were less responsive   Best  Lydia
490617537726470522,We had the best experience  Forest Park is directly across the street  There is a trail head directly across the street  I highly recommend walking through Forest Park  it s beautiful  We were also walking distance by many restaurants  bars and shopping  We had no issues with parking  There is street parking with evenings and weekends free  And a parking garage around the corner that is very inexpensive  The room itself was clean  comfortable and had everything we needed  We loved the decor as well  I would definitely stay at a Zencity property again  including this one 
476049824768810973,More space than we needed for our weekend stay to watch the Packers beat the Bears  Located across the street from a park and a delicious coffee crepe ice cream shop  Stumbled upon Yoga Six a couple blocks down and Deep Purple smoothie bar to get our morning started  Ended our first night at Jolly Pumpkin which had a great selection of beers and the best truffle fries ever  The bartender shared a list of great local breweries and distilleries  We only had time to hit a couple  Headquarters Beercade   District  but they did not disappoint  Loved staying in this cozy neighborhood xx Thank you for accommodating our late checkout and a great stay over the weekend 
473845668585728644,A nice spot to stay in St  Louis  We were just passing through town so arrived late and left early in the morning but it was in a great location if we had more time to explore the city 
495702426086457828,Location was good  Great spot for a weekend trip 
480457993936168432,Filthy and freezing is how I d summarize the stay  I have never had a negative Airbnb experience until this one  I truly feel like the other negative reviews were hidden or I somehow missed them this time   You ve been warned     Code they gave to the apartment was wrong  got locked out and took about    minutes before it was resolved  My booking also said it was for the rear apartment  but when we got there the check in instructions were from the front apartment  this matters because it s a busy street near a hospital   it was noisy     apartment was not clean  Floor was absolutely FILTHY like it had been weeks since it had been vacuumed  Dust on walls  grimy blinds  etc    biggest issue was NO HEAT  we called and messaged multiple times to let them know the thermostat was either set low  or the furnace was not working because either no air or cold air was blowing whenever the thermostat  said  it was heating  It stayed a frigid    degrees the entire weekend  They never offered to fix it    furniture was stained  greasy  broken  and basically was from a frat house or a dumpster    Terrible communication with Zencity  hours between responses  and no contact ever from the  host   If this was a much cheaper apt I wouldn t have such an issue  but this was an expensive stay for bare minimum  The worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had  Either you are ripping people off  or your management company is ripping you off 
466669462672796184,love place  very nice neighborhood  convenient location  very clean  we had a great time we love this place  the best one yet  thank you guys very much  will definitely be doing it again 
468832631740514424,Location was good When we arrived at   for check in the cleaners were still there and said they wouldn t be done for    minutes   When we did check in  the unit was not clean   Garbage in bathroom trash cans and floors were filthy   The location is great   I think you need a new clean crew   Also  there was a letter taped on the door one day when we got back that your lease expired         and plan to vacate in December  rd   I have a copy of the letter and left it on the coffee table in the living room 
526800151336643840,I had to step over trash to get on or off the elevator anytime I left the appartment   The elevator also smelled like a trash can   The fact that the appartment had a balcony was a deciding factor in renting the room   The balcony was directly about a couple dumpsters and a grease trap   This is the first bad experience I have had renting a Air BnB  I had to step over trash to get on or off the elevator anytime I left the appartment   The elevator also smelled like a trash can   The fact that the appartment had a balcony was a deciding factor in renting the room   The balcony was directly about a couple dumpsters and a grease trap   This is the first bad experience I have had renting a Air BnB 
512321746008128242,This place has everything we needed in it for a two night stay  It is an older building so the building was noisy in that sense  but overall a very nice apartment in a great location  Beware that parking in the area is metered  We found a public parking garage for     day  so you may want to factor that into your price  but we enjoyed our time and would definitely stay again  Thanks so much for the stay  We had everything we needed in this cozy apartment and would not hesitate to stay again if we are in the area 
452184680199669420,Great place to stay for a quick overnight  Had everything I needed and in a great location  Everything was great but just to note the code for the front door didn t work for me  Luckily somebody happened to be leaving and let me in but good to note for the future 
536990327522446200,Great place and location  Host is very responsive and helpful  Great place and location  Only suggestion is the apartment could use a deep clean  However  I would book again and suggest to other friends 
475371688836603585,Unsafe   inaccurate entry instructions  People travel with luggage  No where did it say I have    seconds to RUN     yards through   gates at   pm at night next to the train tracks from the first entry gate through the second entry gate and then through the lobby door that has no pin pad  I was stuck next to the L entry way fumbling to reenter the pin until I realized I needed to sprint   The person I called only read the instructions that I had as well  Useless   At the condo door itself there were no instructions about the condo door pin pad needing to be activated before entering code  Again  unsafe   Then the condo was unclean with sticky floors and smelled like beer and marijuana   Can t sleep with the windows closed because the L is too noisy  the neighbors are too noisy and the air conditioner is too noisy   Owners should warn guests to proceed with caution  enter at your own risk if you can figure out how to enter   Did they fake the reviews  This rental ruined my trip  with dirty and unsafe conditions  Shame on these opportunistic hustlers  Unsafe   inaccurate entry instructions  People travel with luggage  No where did you say I have    seconds to RUN     yards through   gates at   pm at night next to the train tracks from the first entry gate through the second entry gate and then through the lobby door that has no pin pad   The person I called only read the instructions that I had as well  Useless   There were no instructions about the condo door pin pad needing to be activated before entering code  Again  unsafe   Then the condo was unclean with sticky floors and smelled like beer and marijuana   Can t sleep with the windows closed because the L is too noisy  the neighbors are too noisy and the air conditioner is too noisy   You should warn guests to proceed with caution  enter at your own risk if you can figure out how to enter   Did you fake the reviews  This rental ruined my trip  with dirty and unsafe conditions  Shame on you 
490586138364396627,We had a great time staying here for a long weekend in Chicago  The house was nice and clean  had all the amenities youd expect  and is in a great spot for getting anywhere in the city without costing an arm and a leg  Wed definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago  The only thing to note is if you drive there  parking isnt easy to find  We missed a street sign about permits and ended up getting a ticket  Not Zencitys fault at all  just worth noting  Thanks for letting us stay at your place  we really enjoyed our time in Chicago and your place played a big part in it 
527543301263992251,Very nice stay  Finding the building not a problem  finding a parking spot is a problem  Besides that  it was clean  comfortable and had everything we needed  Thank you for allowing us to stay at your Airbnb  The only thing we suggest is maybe purchasing a parking spot for people who stay  We asked around some people who live there and they said they pay monthly for a designated parking spot  We worried if we had a ticket or no car left there 
475341614532299081,This is a simple but lovely apartment  The location is about    mins from downtown which is super nice  you get the Chicago feel without the chaos of staying downtown  The hosts instructions were easy to follow and check in was a breeze  There isnt assigned parking  but there is plenty of free parking around    The only negative is the cleanliness of apartment isnt the best  it seems like the place is disinfected well but isnt deep clean so there is dust and build up in certain areas  But this didnt dampen our trip and over the stay was wonderful  The apartment is lovely but the cleanliness could be better  The fan above the bed was COATED with dust to the point where we couldnt use it  The bathroom needs to be deep clean  there were a lot of areas that hadnt been clean in a long time  For example  the handles on the vanity had build up  the wall behind the toilet was dirty  etc  The toilet lid seat was also very loose  The pillows are quite old and yellow   they either need clean or replaced   Other than cleanliness  our stay was wonderful  Great location  easy check in  and parking was easy  Just thought it was right to let you know about the clean 
542052435007403046,Extremely cold at night  the toilet didn t want to flush nor could i make it flush with the plugger at the end i had to put a lot of toilet paper on top and spray some perfume  It was so stinky  Bad pressure of hot water as well  Old building 
475300893075913062,safe and quiet location be sure to order from La Boulangerie was disappointed only in no prep for coffee tea ready and that shower was problematic to work at least for me was beautiful  in a great location with excellent communication and quiet
746843630,Great Place  
474620207957625607,Great stay in this room  The location is perfect  checkin was easy  and the place was very clean    Noise from the train isn t bad  it is a little bright at night so bring a mask if that bothers you    Will book again on future visits  We had a lovely lovely stay  I only have   small suggestions    The blinds over the balcony window were missing several panels so our privacy was reduced some  It would probably be best to get them fixed since they look out onto a shared patio area   The room could use thicker curtains  It is quite bright at night due to the train station  The noise isn t bad  it s just super bright    Besides that it was great 
449989721926840995,Cool spot in walking distance near power and light  Lot of stuff to do around the area   The apartment itself is cozy  I d give it a   star if the check in process was smooth  I want to start by saying thanks for letting us stay  Location was great as we were able to walk anywhere we wanted  Place was clean and felt comfortable  My only complaint is the check in process  The intercom to call doesn t have the room number  Once we got through to someone from zen city they had us open the lock box and there was nothing in it  I would suggest putting the key in that lock box  The tenants that live there clearly aren t appreciative of how renters are bugging them to get inside  It was very awkward asking to get in when a couple people gave us attitude  Once we got in and made it to the room everything was fine   Thanks again  Justin
473925357596220393,As others said before  not terribly clean  but conveniently located and the front desk staff is very friendly and helpful 
542094299579514613,  The apartment needs some updating due to the age of the property  Winter   drafty
542094139500443356,Overall great stay great location easy access to get in    I had asked about the thermostat and it was disappointing that nobody responded to us it was    degrees inside and couldn t even be In the kitchen  living room area comfortable because how cold it was
539912830792890005,Nice clean property  Excellent communication when if there were issues 
509468452637206860,Beautiful park  Thank you for our stay  A fresh coat of paint could go a very long way and filling in some cracks here and there    Fun place to walk around  but only during the day   Best  Alex
480458926705630025,Location is great  and apartment was ok but wifi never worked    Sofa is not a pull out even though I made the booking for   people Wifi hotspots didnt work and Zencity network never worked    If you allowed me to book the room for   guests the sofa needs to be at least a pull sofa   And lastly I insisted with that sofa and never got an answer   
480406224659969918,Clean and comfortable  Great view  Had to wait a while for checkin  as concierge was away from desk for almost    minutes  Otherwise good stay 
512294995474976552,Comfy stay  Space is bigger than pictures show  Fully stocked kitchen making it easy to cook  Thanks  Two keys might be helpful or having door automatically lock 
531895280767599934,My comments were private and intended to improve the facility  Hi this is private   I don t want to leave a bad review  Most of the problems involved technology  The communication when we arrived was poor because I kept getting incomplete texts and had to communicate through the website  It was cumbersome to do outside in the freezing weather  We were never able to access WiFi in the building  even though our hostess sent us additional options  none of them worked for either of our phones  The three legged chairs were dangerous  both of us nearly tipped over when we sat down  Finally  the turf between the parking lot and building was covered with piles of dog feces  We needed to walk across the turf to avoid ice on the sidewalk but it was almost impossible to avoid the dog poop  The trash cans were overflowing and there were no bags for guests to use to scoop the poop  As we were leaving in the morning we saw a fellow clean the grounds  but it was a mess the evening before 
527580999068491585,A clean affordable place close to downtown 
424583467932708056,Old  historic home with the expected charm and quirks   Pleasant host and overall positive stay   Tips  Shower is not convenient  showerhead affixed to curtain rod with zip ties and requires constant handling   and the loft area has a very tight triangular entrance that would only be usable for small yet careful persons  Overall  the rental experience was positive   The historic characteristics of the home were charming  however  I do have the below feedback that you will want to consider and address for future rentals     Second floor shower convenience   The most inconvenient aspect of the rental was the shower   The first floor shower had no curtain  and youd have to sit and use the handheld shower head  so no one could shower there   The second floor shower had the shower head ineffectively affixed to the curtain rod by zip ties  and it had to be manipulated the entire shower to try to aim it on your body and also not to spray over the curtain   The zip ties are not a practical solution  please purchase a connector to affix the shower head to the curtain rod in a way that aims it properly and doesnt require constant handling     Loft space accessibility   The crawl space to get into the loft area is very small   It would be very helpful to measure the triangular entrance space and include that in the listing description   Also  the right side of the ladder to get to the loft space is not connected  which is a safety liability that needs to be fixed     Towels availability   The towels were in the dryer when we arrived   Presuming they were clean  we folded hung them in the bathroom for use   I definitely encourage you to make sure all household items are not in a clean appliance  washer  dryer  dishwasher  and are ready for guest use upon arrival   Also  there was one white face towel with a large stain     Kitchen cleanliness   Availability of requested appliances   When we arrived and started to cook  we noticed     that the counters and cutting board had not been clean  i e   food remnants stuck on the surface   and a partly full water container was inexplicably in the sink  also     that the food processor we agreed would be available was not present   Needing to clean the area ourselves  and the inefficient communication re  the food processor  multiple Airbnb messages  three different appliances provided through two trips  delayed our plans and should have been a nonevent   Overall  the home itself was what made the experience pleasant  but the above points of feedback  mainly items    and     were not what we expected from a Superhost 
444671955794535659,Beeindruckt von dieser Herzlichkeit und Gastfreundlichkeit  Die Gastgeber sind ebenso gro artig wie die Unterkunft und die Lage  Tolle Menschen  Tolle Region  Ein rundum Wohlf hlpaket  Herzlichen Dank f r alles   Beeindruckt von dieser Herzlichkeit und Gastfreundlichkeit  Ihr seid ebenso gro artig wie die Unterkunft und die Lage  Ein rundum Wohlf hlpaket 
537002083355132755,Nice and lovely unit  Had some issues but host communicated very well to resolve the issues 
455049177958755812,Our party of   was very happy with our stay at this location  They were very helpful and answered all of these questions  The condo was very clean and the beds were comfortable  The couch pictured has been updated and is comfortable  The only issue we had was a lack of bedding for the person utilizing the couch  Luckily we had packed our own   Overall great stay  parking garage was relatively close and the neighborhood was friendly  Would definitely stay again  Thank you for the beautiful condo and an affordable rate   We really enjoyed staying with you all   I was very happy to see that the couch had been updated   The location was very clean and inviting  Felt like home immediately  Only issue we found was a lack of bedding for the  th person utilizing the couch   Luckily he brought his own or he would of had a very chilly weekend   Thank you  we would definitely stay again 
419559447246847164,Great apartment  Great communication   location  A little time consuming getting in each time but all   all wonderful  Thanks again 
527576141904562874,Good amount of space  vibes are nice during the day
473850913728684442,We enjoyed ourselves during our stay and the location of the listing is perfect to get around the neighborhood  Parking was fairly easy to find on the streets during the day but if you return later at night  it s a challenge  Everything else was provided as listed except the Wi Fi  The network did not pop up so we could not connect to it but other than that  it was worth the stay  Hello Zencity  thank you for the comfortable stay at the residence  The only issue we really ran into was with the Wi Fi  The Wi Fi would not show in the networks listed so we were not able to connect to it but other than that  we enjoyed our stay 
526819917927851184,Cute studio The stay was well overall  Whoever is doing the clean of the place is not doing a well job  The rug looked and felt dirty and there was an actual booger on the comforter on the bed 
456506265349623145,Great home  Had everything we needed  Clean  lots of charm  The host was very responsive and great at communicating  Will stay here again when in the area  The house was wonderful  even for just the two of us  It had everything we needed  However  the internet was pretty slow and not very useful  Didn t bother us  though  as we didn t really need it for work or anything  Just something to note  Thank you for your quick responses and communication with me  Will recommend you and your home to anyone visiting independence 
531901360399301354,Perfect for our needs  And clean And you get a full function kitchen  Tne living room is good for two people but not really a lot more  there are two bedrooms with queen size beds   But it was perfect for us  And the location is excellent  I would definitely stay there again Hey I broke a glass   one of the tall ones for drinking water from as I was hand washing it in the sink Do you want to charge me for that 
480406579346200649,My dad and I visited for NASCAR weekend and It was an excellent stay with Zencity  We loved your apartment  Thank you for letting us stay 
473833202543271036,Everything about staying is perfect beside checking process was really frustrating    We did checked in after   pm with all bags  not that many  The room is on the second floor and the the stairs are steep  So carefully walking    We couldn t be able to get in the room as the instructions they provided    I called and   mins later one of hosting answered the phone  asked me to download the application and follow the steps she said which is work for me   tech savvy    And everything else is fantastic  Everything about staying is perfect beside checking process was really frustrating    We did checked in after   pm with all bags  not that many  The room is on the second floor and the the stairs are steep  So carefully walking    We couldn t be able to get in the room as the instructions they provided    I called and   mins later one of hosting answered the phone  asked me to download the application and follow the steps she said which is work for me   tech savvy    I do recommend to provide more step before checking in    wasting both side time unnecessarily 
512315910702946892,Great location  clean and comfortable  roomy with everything we needed  good value  Lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance  including Target  Whole Foods and Trader Joes  Train is a block away  Parking was a bit of an issue   Two hour limit outside  but parked in a church parking lot for a reasonable price   There is free parking on the east side of the building in the residential neighborhood  Wish we had known that  One thing I forgot to mention  the instructions to check in were good except the picture of the lockbox location was not of the actual property  But we figured it out 
476069047454646799,Apartment was clean and had everything we needed  It was in a great location  The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed  Host responded when I had a question and communicated well 
511624858634918324,Lovely neighborhood  lovely apartment  lovely shops  bars  restaurants  etc   The place was not very clean  but overall had a great stay  The coffee table was not attached at the top and there was a strange smell in the apt when we got there that remained for most of the weekend  Also  adding a body mirror would make the females staying in the place much happier  Also  there are visible spills and boogers wiped on the walls  dusty fake plants  and there were also food remnants on the floor in the living room 
527551838951602572,We were unable to check in and had to stay somewhere else over a simple key issue  Worst Bnb experience I ve had with a host  Customer service was unhelpful and had no clue what they were doing  Steer clear of Zencity Very disappointed with the lack of customer service and problem solving  Shame on your business
417351339552629567,Worst stay ever had   Too many problems to list  but to name a few   no way to contact host about problems  difficult to access  no internet  broken tv  and non working elevator  Worst stay ever had   If I could rate it less than zero  I would  All the problems are too many to list  but to mention a few  difficult to access  elevator not working  no internet  tv didn t work  broken chair   No way to contact host with problems 
472427706692072401,El departamento es bonito  pero est  muy sucio      La entrada est  llena de telara as  el piso ten a mucho polvo y pelos  los ba os con hongos  la cocina y el refrigerador estaban sucios tambi n  Y adem s huele feo  La comunicaci n es lenta y despu s de entregarme el departamento sucio  cuando les ped  tener late checkout me dijeron que no era posible  Definitivamente no volver a jam s  Hola   Buenos d as  quer a comentarles que no me gust  que el departamento est  tan sucio  me dijeron que era algo inusual  pero las telara as de la entrada y en los cuartos  los dos ba os con hongos   el piso con pelos y polvo y  la cocina sucia igual que el refrigerador no se hacen de un d a para otro  Les recomiendo que cambien de empresa de limpieza  Es verdaderamente muy lamentable el estado del departamento  porque est  muy bonito  pero muy descuidado 
471700116592169422,Bathroom shower had hair from previous guest on the walls shower head has build up water stains garbage is not clean when you walk in it looks so tidy however they make it look good but they dont thoroughly clean  Make sure the place is clean actually go through entire place   no hair left over from the previous guest garbage can is clean not just taking the garbage bag out and replacing it 
471760015619422250,Really enjoyed my stay here  The bed was comfortable and the place is fixed up nicely    Theres a cafe just below in front of the building next to the elevated train  and it was a great place to hang out as well    Instructions for accessing the building were step by step and detailed  They were responsive and offered an extension of a day  which I ended up needing due to flight issues    I also can recommend Figo Wine Bar just around the corner on Sheffield  Hi  Thanks for hosting  I really liked the place and appreciated the offer to extend my stay  as I ended up needing it  My only suggestion is to add a few small items that people have grown to expect from hotels and airbnbs  like a hairdryer  soaps  maybe a Keurig for morning coffee    BTW  the instructions for getting in were really good and detailed      Thanks  Susanne
488377227051425665,This is a great apartment  It was a challenge to get everything together as far as check in but afterwards everything was great  Thank you for allowing in your apartment everything was great 
745075603,Really nice place about    min from downtown  Still very lively because of the hospital right nearby and the zoo park is super close  The building is great  Parking is a bit hard but we used the parkview tower garage by the hospital which I recommend  Its     per day so we were able to just leave the car all week and use lyft  It can be a bit pricey if you plan on going downtown a lot but other than that its a great place to stay   Perfect amount of amenities and super comfy bed    hosts answer questions very quickly too  Thank you   The silverware wasnt very clean in the kitchen and the bathroom had dust dirt hair on the floor  It wasnt too bad but just looked like it couldve been clean more
452890397045789680,Great stay  Great place  Great location  Great neighborhood   Clean  bright  and well maintained  Lots of windows   Rooftop access  Great views  Gym access  Unit entry door seems thin to voices in the hallway but there s minimal  foot traffic  Restaurants  shops and Walgreens within walking distance  Park is   blocks away for a nice stroll  About a    min walk to Cardinals stadium and to Union Station  though I wouldn t walk to from them alone at night  If you stay in the building  I recommend keeping the key fob with you when you venture out  The exterior keypad gets rather warm in the afternoon sun and doesn t function properly  if at all  I was stuck outside for a bit because I couldn t use the keypad and didn t have the key fob  I would definitely stay here again  Great stay   A few observations      Water stains on bathroom ceiling from possible roof leak      Coat hooks on wall near entry door were loose and not usable      You may want to advise guests to take the key fob with them upon leaving the property after initial checkin and during their stay  There were a couple of times where the entry system didn t work because of the hot sun in the afternoons   Overall a great stay and would stay again 
532663413838468063,A clean safe place close to WashU Medical School  Stayed for one night after dropping my daughter at school  Would love to stay again in the future when I attend my daughters graduation 
531113287125165402,This place was incredible  Would stay again
471657891028909792,recommended place  good location  easy access  what they offer is what you find  clean  easy and fast transportation to the downton  Thank you for all the attention for responding so quickly and efficiently to the needs that arose  place in a very good location  clean  spacious  comfortable 
527504019657137087,Great  well clean  located and organized  at certain times there is a strong smell in the apartment
522469625098443148,Good place i like it this place close to downtown  and I like laundry inside Good place i like it this place close to downtown  and I like laundry inside 
449932310386324381,The location was really great and the apartment had a lot of space  We felt very comfortable  Check in had a minor hiccup for me that I wish was handled differently  but this didnt affect my stay and we loved the place overall  Our stay was great  but the problems with check in were frustrating  Obviously that was out of anyones control  but we had a dinner reservation that we had to rush to after that late check in  Just wish we would have known sooner  Additionally  we were offered in return a late check out of   pm  and then on the day of check out housekeeping came at      am  when I was undressed and not all ready for check out  Just looking for some better communication  BUT we loved the place and overall had a great stay 
539870348033341353,Wonderful little spot  Place was clean and as advertised  Street parking was available just around the block 
450683495016143253,Very clean apartment space with everything you ll need for a weekend  Hi  Thanks for letting us stay  Just so you know  your toilet keeps running   draining after you flush it  concerned about your water bill  
450674764018556669,Checking in was tricky for us as well as an issue with card fob once we finally made it to the room  Room was clean and comfortable  Location was good  Parking worked for us  We found affordable and free parking during our stay that was close to the building entrance  We would stay again  Hi  we appreciate the property you have to offer  Our first issue checking in was caused due to confusion on where to enter  The instructions stated to enter the side doors but didn t state which side  NSEW   I think it would have benefited us if the large building numbers above the doors were  listed in the instructions to add clarity  There was no key fob so I had to use the manual codes for the building and room door  I understand a previous renter could have easily forgot it when checking out  The elevator would not work for me until a resident let me up since the elevator key was in the room  This was not mentioned in the listing  Finally  we were not made aware of the remodeling going on throughout the building  Just wanted to let you all know our issues  The location was great and the apartment was clean and cozy  Thank you for the stay 
450675928462256255,Our stay definitely wasn t a  bad  experience but for sure was mediocre compared to what we were expecting  While the building and apartment are  updated   the complex and the apartment are not  luxury  at all  It s pretty comparable to a basic   star hotel    People got stuck in the elevator and the fire trucks were there for hours which was right outside our window   there were people who appeared to be experiencing homelessness in the lobby one evening when we got back from dinner  and we got an automated message from ZenCity that there was a noise complaint about our music  when we were playing it on our phone which is not loud  but then spent a morning hearing erotic noises coming from the neighboring apartment    The apartment had dust everywhere  scuff marks all over  the bed frame was incredibly bent and we stubbed our toes on it constantly  no extra towels or blankets  just sheets and hand towels   the absolute bare minimum in the bathroom and kitchen  food from the previous occupants left in the fridge  and the thermostat was set to    when we arrived    With all that being said  it served its purpose and was in a great location and included a parking spot 
471671439704670005,Nice location
496379837002346591,the loft was nice and spacious  the basic accommodations were met  the layout was nice  having th washer and dryer is a huge bonus  given I traveled with children  the dry though  was very noisy and the bathroom sink was clogged  I did not reach out to the host to complain  we made due as we had more pressing personal matters  we would stay again though  thank you for allowing my children and myself to occupy your space in a short period  the accommodations were good  the bathroom sink is clogged  we tried to unclog it to no avail  given the circumstances  we werent there alot   but definitely an inconvenience in the morning
473863328490254527,Good space in a good location 
493522730732248404,If you are willing to jump through some initial hoops to gain access to this Airbnb it s a great value for what you pay   The location is great  Walkable to restaurants  convention center  grocery store  pharmacy and more  The unit is newer and modern with nice furniture  Pretty views of the city from the unit  Fast internet  Cleaning I would say could be improved a bit  Area rugs were not the cleanest and bathroom drains were slow   Checking in was a nightmare  It took about    minutes of   of us trying before we made it to the unit  The directions to check in were not accurate  We were locked out of the condo building  it was not late  maybe  pm   We called the host who was not super helpful and basically asked if we were following the instructions  we are seasoned business travelers  it wasn t us just not understanding   My co worker ended up googling the condo building  finding a number for building security   calling them and they buzzed us in  We then got lost   more times trying to locate the parking garage to get to the lockbox to get the keys to the unit  Then made it to the   th floor  The key to the unit is one key hole to control the deadbolt and standard door lock  There s nothing that explains that or that the key must be turned one way and then another to disengage both locks  LOTS of trial and error   All that being said  great price for a great unit  but check in leaves a lot to be desired  Overall our stay was nice  The clean could be improved  The area rugs are pretty dirty  The bathrooms were ok  but the showers were not super clean  As I mentioned in my note during our stay  the drains need to be clean out as they are running slowly  The check in process is nothing short of a nightmare  We ended up googling the building  finding the number for security and calling them before we could get in  Getting into the building   unit took about    minutes all together  There was no fast or easy solution when I called your number for assistance  The key to get into the unit needs a lot more explanation since it s   key hole for both a deadbolt and regular lock  Also you already have my notes on broken items in the unit    Good price  great location  modern finishes and furniture is nice 
494971127502109104,Across the street from a club that rocks pretty hard till  AM 
528264229858516381,I absolutely loved my stay here  This apartment is beautiful  clean  in a perfect location   Everything i was looking for  I absolutely loved my stay here  This apartment is beautiful  clean  in a perfect location   Everything i was looking for 
471657312330524208,Great location  close to trains  coffee shops   but nice a quiet   Parking is super easy at the Spoke parking garage using the SpotHero app   Thanks Zencity for taking such great care of us   There are several pieces missing from the blind in the master bedroom  we had to hang a sheet so the neighbors weren t staring at us sleeping   Also  there is no power to the dishwasher  we tried to tidy up after ourselves but couldn t start the dishwasher  sorry   If I had known I would have washed the dishes we used by hand   Otherwise it was great    Thank you 
513041557263410928,Great spot  Close to bars 
468123878733780025,  stars for location  functionality and beauty of this Airbnb  The room images online are very well represented  The bed is comfortable and the room plan is well designed with unique areas for storage  laundry and countertop space  The room feels very spacious because of the tall ceilings  There is a coffee shop and food market within steps of the building for convenience  If you want a quiet and hassle free room this might not be the first choice  The windows leak noise profoundly and there were delays getting up and down from the   th floor due to the number of people moving and needing to use the   elevators available  Online images of the entry lobby make it look clean and spacious but it is actually quite run down and cluttered  If you don t mind a pretty constant smell of marijuana on the   th floor  the noise and the hassles of getting up and down the elevators this is a great spot  I really enjoyed my stay  there were just a couple of things that would have made it better   Blackout shades would have helped with sleep and the noise factor and a shorter code to get into the door would have been much easier to remember  I appreciate the prompt responses 
471657820683821106,We knew walking in that this place might not be the best kept apartment  but didnt expect it to be as bad as it was  bags over smoke detectors  air conditioning that doesnt work and windows that dont open  and overall pretty dirty  The location is perfect  perfectly in a wonderful neighborhood  and the building is great  Surprisingly the train is nearly silent inside with the door closed   If you can look past some of these things and have a moment to wash your sheets before you start your vacation it can be a nice spot to lay your head  Was very disappointed with both how poorly clean and maintained the apartment was and the response time and ability to help resolve issues  Our vacation was marred by the non functioning air conditioning and having to take some time to clean the apartment before we could get our vacation started 
494977358228390109,Pros  For visits to Hyde Park area  UChicago   the location is great  The building is a beautiful historic location right off Lake Shore Drive across from a park and the Museum of Science and Industry  Parking was easy  we parked for free right across the street with no issue  and the drive up area is very convenient for loading unloading  The front desk staff was friendly and helpful  It s in walking distance to a few restaurants  a Trader Joe s  and a Walgreens  Since this is a turn of the century building in Chicago I sort of expected to see signs of mice or other rodents  but I didn t spot any during my stay over a full week   Cons  As others have stated  the unit is minimally furnished and needed a lot of deep clean  This is the first time I ve ever gotten out the clean supplies and started clean upon arrival to an Airbnb  It was covered in dust  had peeling paint all over  and the carpet is clearly several shades darker than its original state  The bed slats were broken  The Wifi  named  Zencity   was never present and when we messaged about it we didn t get a response for days  we had to find the physical router and connect to it manually to do work  One of the units above us seemed to be under construction the whole time we were there  so there was constant hammering    Overall  I ve stayed in several  professionally run  Airbnb s like this and this is all pretty standard  but for this price I would definitely have expected better 
542015826354134855,Loved the location  Apartment was surprisingly big  I really liked it  Beds were super comfortable  A lot of natural light  I would stay here again 
494898570658823936,Professional 
468810053365773747,Great place downtown  Thank you  the place was great 
510871479380368764,Loved our stay  In a rougher part of town  but inside is amazing  Very nice  Clean too  Well Responsive Loved the stay 
541995361550282313,Everyone should know the building is not a safe place to be at night  There s a lot of drug activity  The main door is not kept locked when it is the key fob doesn t work to get you in  I have photos of coke or heroine bags outside the elevator door  Room      had their door open all night with a creepy man watching you go to   from your car  The shower road was broken   the hot water NEVER worked  I ran it for    min from faucet   shower   it was out  I was approached to buy drugs   was made fun of by the door man when he thought it was funny to make me wave up and down at a motion censor that wasn t their to open the door  There was no good apology   all they offered was a next stay discount   I ll tell you I ll never go back there ever  I ve stayed at several in many big cities all with their own problems   this was horrific  Save you re money   get away from that place  FrontDesk   Bradley s are so much better You already know my problems 
468857877227856689,great location and prompt with communicating
468120258004992473,This well located studio apartment has tasteful  modern decor  The bathroom is quite roomy  the bed is comfortable but there is no table or counter to eat at  We had a great stay  A little table for two to eat at would have been nice 
468083375508300446,Nice apartment  in a great area  As it is not a privately owned or maintained apartment you do miss out on the charm and character of a more  traditional  Airbnb experience  We had an issue with check in where we could not get in right away as the clean crew was late and we re not informed until after we had already met the cleaner and he explained it  The door code also did not work but a new one was generated basically immediately 
453611892491309493,Beware parking is not included and I couldnt purchase a pass for the building garage for the week I was there  ac is not very cold  very close to BJC The bathroom sink leaked very badly  When reported they said they would fix it  they never did so I couldnt use the bathroom sink  I also asked for towels they had only left    since I had used those to clean up the water from the sink  They brought the towels that morning  so good response there  The window ac units even when set at max setting never got cold enough to be comfortable for me  The waterproof mattress covering  I under the necessity  was the cheap kind thats super hot and plastic feeling  As far cleanliness I found trash and earring backs from the last guest  I hope  The location is very close to BJC  Parking was a nightmare 
455038324201908740,The place was good pictures are a BIT nicer than actual but we really enjoyed our stay here 
513086744602781189,Good place  good location  I didn t really like the memory foam mattress but that s personal preference  The apartment is kind of clunky to get into with a really long code to access the actual room  I also didn t really trust the blinds   they let a lot of light in and at night it which kept me up and worse I feel like people could see in unless all the lights were off in the apartment  I could definitely see out   Overall a good stay though   and the gym is very very nice  Would stay again  Stay was good  needed a bit more info about the gym and also the apartment was too hot even once I turned down the heater  Maybe some more info on that would be helpful    Main annoyance was the length of the codes to access the apartment  Very inconvenient and frustrating  I didn t receive a fob either which would have been easier    The apartment is also super bright at night as the curtains are semi see through    Otherwise the place was good 
521762633813334846,Great location  and a cozy dwelling   Id highly recommend for     people 
511618118347175314,The communication was fine but I dont think the owners visit or have an understanding of the problems with access to the building  I had to speak with several residents to find out what was going on and they all expressed frustration about building entry  There was also delivery people from Doordash who couldnt figure it out so how are non resident visitors supposed to  Currently  the front entry door to the building does not work so you must go through the basement garage and it has generally been propped open  but I wouldnt count on it or the keycodes working    As far as the apartment itself  if you like Andy Warhol this might be your spot  The lack of art minimal furniture and few kitchen supplies gave it a minimalist feel but not very welcoming  There was a single book of Andy Warhol polaroids and another small one on some specific architecture  Otherwise one off centered bland painting in each room and cold colors  It feels like no one actually ever lived there and someone just bought an empty apartment and hired someone to put in the minimal amount of art and amenities for cost savings    Its OK for the money if you need this location and dont mind trying to figure out the building  The building has entry issues that need to be resolved  Even residents there expressed frustration about getting into the building  For people are arent familiar with the grounds this is even more of a challenge  Also the lack of art furniture appliances makes it feel very barren    It was clean and communication was not bad so I appreciate that 
510832287930348881,Probably the best location in St  Louis  Out of the city but so close to everything  Pictures are vey accurate to what you get  Would definitely stay here again  Great hosts too
455038380768303420,Great location  good price  Thanks  It was great
513825010135063147,very accommodating and very clean place definitely would recommend this place to others thanks for being very accommodating
534735098804607088,A spacious apartment in a great location   We enjoyed our stay here  so close to the lake  We loved your place   Just had a bit of trouble figuring out the lights in the living room   
509453681363871878,Great place   nd staying here  Always comfortable and affordable  Near everything downtown Thank you so much for allowing me to stay in your space again  The window was raised  when I got there and I was unable to lower it  Did not end up staying over night due to the noise from the open window  But as always everything was very clean and cozy
513080942227674514,The house was nice  no trouble in the area  the local food was kinda of lack luster  Very quiet area  The house was large accommodated us well  plenty of rooms and privacy  The common areas were nice as well  they just had a lack of Window Curtains which is a bit rough in the morning with the sun  the heating in the house was great everyone was quite comfortable  Would absolutely stay again if we re back in the area      Everything was nice  the one thing that s a bit odd is the lack of curtains in the common rooms  sunlight in the morning really sucked  Also the pans in the house aren t spectacular Could definitely use a bit of an upgrade 
509443270418682198,Wonderful location right on the square  with plenty of street parking  a well equipped gym  very updated styling and comfortable living space  and hosts that were very accommodating for us  Highly recommend A great location  and y all are very flexible with extending stays and changing dates  which was greatly appreciated   My only recommendation would be to see if it s possible to increase the water pressure on the kitchen sink  as we had a little difficulty clean dishes before we left  but everything else was wonderful  I can t remember if y all emphasized that there s a gym in the building but that is also a very major plus  Easy   stars
532628408456849696,This listing was just as its advertised  Clean and well taken care of  Has all the amenities as well that are great to take advantage of   especially the whole kitchen and washer dryer unit  This listing is placed right next to a KC streetcar which is great so that you can visit most of downtown KC without having to walk or drive  Thanks for having such a unique and convenient location as an Airbnb  We had a great time enjoying all of the amenities you have provided  Especially the kitchen and washer dryer    However I do have some concerns things to keep in mind for the future  When we got there the smoke alarms had their batteries popped out   although we received a response within a decent timely manner  it still was unsettling to have  Also we did not have control of the thermostat which was upsetting as the weather was cold outside and inside was only    degrees  Also there were some kitchen items that the apartment was missing   such as a baking sheet  whisk  etc  Other than those issues  it truly was a great stay and we are very appreciative for the chance to use your services 
509449441067046057,Beautiful place  Poor communication  Wrong building code   different times  while locked out for the  rd time  my car was broken into at the parking garage across the street  Did not get a new code until the next morning once I messaged again  I got locked outside   occasions and did not get a response until I messaged again the next morning  While locked out  my car was broken into  The car issue wasn t on you guys since it was in the garage across the street  but safety was a concern  Beautiful place  great location  Communication is always key to a good stay  Thank you for the place for a few days 
508696006720742779,Perfect for a St  Louis stay  Walking distance to great restaurants  Easy car ride to the attractions   Roomy room with all  amenities included  It was perfect for our needs
536195700155126498,Excellent place with an incredible view   I am for sure going to stick with this place for future trips 
505820153867346216,Great view  Clean residence I enjoyed this spot and had a wonderful view  Only issue was the parking situation  Some nights the garage was locked and i couldn t park anywhere but  on the street with the parking meters that ultimately got me overnight parking fees
425341376605725565,Great apartment in a great  quiet location  Lots of restaurants near by and a   minute walk to the brown line Montrose stop  Check in very easy   you have to speak very clearly for the automated call box to understand you when you give it the code  Had an amazing time here and would definitely stay here again  Thanks for everything  Speaking the code to the call box to get in for the first time was a little difficult  It took me about   tries to get it to work  but other than that I had an amazing time  Thanks for everything 
450697134729325628,I want to give a good review but I can t  The apartment itself is great  In a great location and the building has AWESOME amenities  if only you had access to them  The fob doesn t work to get you into the gym or many of the common areas   On top of that  the internet password was correct but it said no internet connection  I reported the problem immediately upon check in and it was unresolved all   nights we were there with no one trying to make it right  All I got was  are you sure you put in the correct password   And  did you try restarting to router   OBVIOUSLY I did both of those things several times   No internet no tv on top of the disappointment that we couldn t access the amenities  VERY disappointing experience and bad communication from the host  Take care of your guests when they report issues  Not having internet or tv is a major inconvenience 
480403700031761839,great location  parking is kinda tough The parking procedure was confusing  it was unclear how the pass worked  it was also unclear how the fob worked  it was not mentioned that the fob is needed to get into the parking garage as well  Finally  I was having trouble with the parking and messaged the host and they responded once and then never responded gain 
475294773137694339,This place was fine  The instructions for how to use the call box are very complicated  and as the owners are a company based out of CA and not locals  it was not possible to get them on the phone for troubleshooting  The elevator was broke all weekend  The elevator would not go to floor    we had to go to floor   and walk down  The last day it was broken entirely  The apartment was relatively clean but I found a comb filled with hair in the shower and a razor head  but the rest of the apartment felt clean  The building was beautiful and the location is perfect  I just think that if it wasnt quite what I expected for the price  Hi  this was a great apartment in a great part of town  but I suggest reassessing the directions for the call box  as they can be very confusing  Also the elevator was broken and I found a dirty comb in the shower 
511640521723248258,We had difficulty checking in   could t get the key code to work  We were on the phone for quite a bit with tech support before we were able to get our key    At      AM a stranger opened our door and scared me half to death  mom and child alone   Luckily it was a sweet lady who was on the phone with tech support   someone gave her my apartment key  She said she had been locked out of her room since      AM    There is no interior lock for safety   no chain lock   just a regular metal key  deadbolt  with a sketchy door  looked like it was about to break     It was clean and otherwise okay  It was cheap  I went for cheap even after reading reviews  I knew I might have a problem checking in but did not expect a stranger to enter while my child and I were sleeping  Add a chain lock for safety  Someone was given our key and we were scared awake by a stranger opening our door  The key code is a joke and needs fixed 
538408473159235159,Muy buena experiencia  genial ubicaci n y excelente respuesta por parte del anfitri n  Muy buena experiencia  genial ubicaci n y excelente respuesta por parte del anfitri n  Solo asegurarse que ya hayan reparado las cortinas del cuarto principal  cuando fui estaban rotas y entraba mucha luz al cuarto desde la ma ana  Adem s  incluir m s cubiertos por favor  Solo tenia   tenedores y   cuchillos y deb a estar lavando a cada rato 
740124159,Our expectations were blown  We had such a great stay  The apartment is so cute  very cozy and in a great location  We will be staying here again soon  Thanks so much  There wasn t adequate parking  had to park on the street  The streets aren t metered and there s time limits 
476110021261682289,Home was beautiful  Check in was easy  Getting in door after hours sucked  The intercom did not understand what was being said  I was very clear and wasnt sure where the mic was  But it said speak into the mic  Oh well  moving on   They need to hire new housekeepers  They left dirty towels behind the bathroom door  Sewerage smell was coming from bathroom  Wasnt sure from where  Kind of hard taking a refreshing shower and it smells  That was a first  Did inform the owner and was told sorry and my next stay could be discounted  Not sure I would come back here  Check in was easy  The home was beautiful  Got to the room it was dirty towels in the bathroom hanging on the door  It smelled like a sewerage in the bathroom  Had to keep the bathroom door closed the whole time doing my stay  Did inform him by sending pictures  Had to go to the store to get clean supplies to clean and disinfectant everything  So i didnt feel clean here at all 
455741337237485883,Will come again  Awesome
524634133756687751,Thank you so much for was a good host Thank you so much
493526363441444410,This place still has the issue pervious guest have with the propertys door access   The codes given do not work   Thus I  you will  end up having to wait on apartment tenants coming and going to get in   If theyre kind to let you in   Aside from that  my experience was ok for the price   The studio apt had everything you needed and internet access and streaming accessibility was a breeze   As for the parking some commented      parking is free for the     slots right in front of the building  but its rare to come up on one   In the area there is metered parking which stops at  pm   If you go past the WHole Foods in that same block street parking is free and the next block over there is free street parking here and there   I can say this owner did take heed to previous guest comments  I saw the roach traps  it was very very clean and make ready   All in all it was a decent stay  This is for who I think is the owner   Please in the future dont stop by the property while your guest are there posing as maintenance  presumably because you couldnt accurately see my Profile picture    AND have the complex fix the peephole so your guest can see out   I couldnt see through it at all   PLEASE  PLEASE get your guest an accurate entry code       If nothing else  Here are also some following suggestions for the future   take out the bidet  it takes up too much space and messes up the toilet seat   might be good to invest in a good mattress   I felt like I was sleeping on a Walmart rolled up box mattress   I would trade out that chair for a small but more comfy sofa chair  I think you have the space for it   Lastly  I would position the desk somewhere you can have an electrical outlet close by  where the desk was positioned it was nothing long that wall on either side   I like that you took heed to previous guest comments  I saw the roach traps  it was very very clean

766289328,Everything was perfect i enjoyed my time there Thank you   I had a great time staying there peaceful environment good costumer service everything was perfect Thank you  
513021233498695693,This place is always a great stay  I don t like to stay anywhere except for a zencity property   Such an incredible place to stay   
476836844732312566,Tiny issue with getting the key but outside of that the place was simply adorable and very cozy Very lovely place  Drain in tub was clogged but I fixed it   other than that perfect 
454348617978012737,If you re looking for something right in the middle of the Central West End for one or two travelers this is the place for you  It was perfect for me as a solo traveler  It s right across the street from Whole Foods  as well as near Forest Park  the Chess hall of Fame  the metro link as well as many restaurants  The  hosts are very responsive  The only issue I had was when I worked remotely there were some internet connection issues during some of my video calls  But besides that  I would definitely recommend this place  Thank you for a wonderful stay  And thank you for being so responsive 
513832765289047325,Great Everything was great but sometimes the Unit smells bad
470934801878196683,The place is on a nice neighborhood and the house is very clean  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely visit back  We really appreciated the due diligence on our request and love to come back again
542048171553561431,Be careful  They will try to take your money with false clean claims  All drains were clogged and the whole building smells like smoke 
465875010495911755,This is an Awesome location in the Hyde Park community   The location is accessible to so many great places  Walking to find food and entertainment is A   The actual apartment space was another thing   Overall it was okay but not the cleanest  We found dirty pillows and linen in the closet put away  One of the clean wash clothes had a strand of hair attached  These are things that can and hopefully will be taken care of by the host  If so I think this will make for a great Airbnb while visiting Chicago  The location and hospitality of the lobby staff were great  Unfortunately the actual apartment space was not clean as expected   We found dirty linen and pillows put away in the closet and also one of the wash clothes had a hair strand attached  There was not enough wash clothes and towels for the number of days we stayed at the location  I  would also suggest placing a bath rug outside the tub instead of a towel 
474563934099939977,Our room was very dirty  especially for having customers pay a clean fee after each use  There was poop in the toilet when we arrived and the floors were not clean either  We had to sweep and vacuum when we arrived and the shower had hair all over  The clean supplies were empty  there was nothing in them at all and the vacuum cleaner was broken  Parking is a little hard to find at night  but we expected that being in the area we were in   It was a nice room and we had a good time  but were very disappointed with the cleanliness of the place  Our room was very dirty  especially for having customers pay a clean fee after each use  There was poop in the toilet when we arrived and the floors were not clean either  We had to sweep and vacuum when we arrived and the shower had hair all over  The clean supplies were empty  there was nothing in them at all and the vacuum cleaner was broken  It was a nice room and we had a good time  but were very disappointed with the cleanliness of the place 
526845427095626782,Great stay lots of room to hang for a cozy getaway for two Overall a great stay thank you very much  That said I encourage you to review your check in process and improve it  The map explaining where to park the car was somewhat unclear for a first time visitor to the area  The key fob thing and the multiple doors and number to remember to unlock the room door and the locking procedure is overly complex  The faucet closest to the toilet handle comes off easily and needs to be repaired  The non stick pots and pans are all dangerous to use and should be thrown away for fear of getting the non stick coating in the food  The hallways and elevator felt dirty to me and smelled masked with pungent air freshener  Would I come back again    definitely  With these adjustments it will be a great Airbnb worthy of five stars  The entryway from the outside where the mail is smelled bad especially on the last day we left 
473215792572040553,The place was perfect for my husband when he came for his doctoral studies  The only issue was getting in the building  It was a little complicated and he had some issues  but other than that  it was good 
472452032503489395,Check in and checkout process was super easy  The place itself was clean  nice and in a good location to our work  In the morning I walked and there were plenty of  coffee shops and breakfast places around    Location is a bit weird  A large homeless population gathers in front of the building  Im not sure if its because the public library is next door   II may not recommend if youre a single female staying in this area and out walking at night  Hi  The place was great  Just a couple of broken items  which didnt bother us     Shower handle in the bathroom with the tub  Its coming off the tiles walls    Theres a whole in the light switch in one of the bedrooms
471041881543230274,Clean and cozy place conveniently located around several restaurants  bars  and shops  The apartment also has a rooftop bar which hosted some great views of KC  I would recommend this spot to anyone considering  FYI   There is no on site parking which could be an issue to some  We never had a problem finding parking during the busy weekend  We were always able to find a spot within     blocks of the property  Hello  We greatly appreciate you allowing us to stay at your property during our trip  We have one recommendation for future guest stays       Bathroom door wont stay closed  We loved the rolling door aspect  but found we had to keep one hand on the door at all times to get some privacy  This was an inconvenience 
471010785375660476,Excellent location that truly cannot be beat  I walked to the plaza every day for shopping  food  and coffee  The walls are very thin so you can hear whenever anyone comes and goes  but the building was rather quiet so it didnt bother us  Lovely unit with charming art and a very calming vibe  Would highly recommend staying here  Thanks so much for letting us stay  The only things that could have improved our stay would have been coffee and more than   towels 
450683472141154936,Great area and spacious place  Definitely felt like a local at this cute spot in Pilsen  There was a bad smell during the time we stayed so we had to buy candles to cover the scent  Everything else was lovely  What a wonderful neighborhood
470987118056350620,Close in proximity to everything in downtown Kansas City  The Apt  Could definitely use some minor improvements  but overall was fine for a weekend stay  The apartment was fairly dirty  We found hair in the bed  stains on the comforter and hair in the bathroom  Plus the shower drain was clogged and wouldn t drain and spit out nasty drain water  lint and more hair   The apartment smelled toxic with paint fumes due to the painting going on   The first check in instructions were not helpful  They didn t work  Ultimately I had to call zencity and they gave me a new set of check in instructions for the front entrance  the     entrance was no where to be found   Only instructions for the front entrance should be given going forward to guests   I will say zencity s response rate to this problem was fast and very helpful though 
533298619475922011,Great location 
533285364638691086,very clean
513765035991119638,Great space and amazing location
480443927881216574,I canceled my reservations   days in advance  I was billed       The host is refusing to provide me with my refund  I contacted Mark with the Airbnb resolution center for assistance  He was to cancel my reservations since the Airbnb website would not allow me to complete the cancellation process  The host was included in the message thread regarding the cancellation process  Mark with Airbnb Resolution Center did not complete my cancellation  He is a failure at his job and actually blocked the entire thread regarding our conversation  I have an open investigation with Airbnb  I have reported both the host and Mark with Airbnb  I have been dealing with this issue for   days at this point and I have yet to receive a refund from the host  I would never recommend this host or any property associated with Zencity  I would also recommend that anyone dealing with Airbnb take screenshots of everything pertaining to Airbnb communication   Airbnb seems to be as shady as some of the hosts  I never thought Airbnb resolution center would actually DELETE BLOCK conversation threads and leave the customer holding the bag  Theives are everywhere      Since I canceled my reservation and you still owe me my refund I have nothing but bad things to say about you as a host  Pay me my refund  I have an active claim with Airbnb  She is conducting an investigation  My reservation was canceled   days before my check in date  I can t control the Airbnb platform and why I was unable to supply you with a cancellation confirmation  Mark with Airbnb Resolution Center stated that he would complete the cancellation process for me  He failed in providing me with a cancellation number which is again  out of my control  You received the same messages  from him as I did  I have reported his poor performance to Airbnb as well and he is part of the investigation process  You are well aware that you owe me my refund  You billed me          Give me my refund 
470951454484351019,Great place  It was clean  beautifully decorated  a centralized location  and Zencity was super responsive   especially when we had a little code mishap at check in  I loved this place so much I tried to switch another Airbnb I have booked for this one  I come to KC often and will book this location again 
542073838966222509,communication with the host might be spotty Would like a refund  had to cancel this because our key fob wasn t available for us to pick up  so we had to find a new place to stay  what are the next steps for a refund
469589052472105614,Very convenient location if you re going to the Uptown Theatre  Parking was a little difficult  but we made it work  The floor was a little sticky  but the place was nice and secure  We had to be let in by other people staying at the apartments because the intercom thing didn t work   but the rest of check in went smoothly  Comfy bed and couch  TV has Roku with channels like Hulu and Netflix  Very nice little place  Would stay here again if we were going to Uptown Theatre   Loved the place  convenient for where we needed to go  I will note that it was pretty warm in there so maybe keep more fans than just the one  but other than that our stay was good 
740120030,Overall  we really enjoyed our stay here  The only issue was check in and check out instructions were not as outlined as hoped  Code was not given to access the keys
455738469143484755,Excellent location  well appointed  My issue here was that my room had not been clean upon my arrival  and it took about    hours for anyone to come clean 
514484528629487251,perfect 
475384751691610939,Be ready to hike once you park  it will be at least two blocks  Give yourself plenty of time to check in  you will likely run into issues  I was very disappointed with our stay  Checkin was a nightmare where we were able to check into somebody else s room for two hours  I am not sure if that room was clean before the next guests arrived  I had revived an email that said if we  had any questions or concerns to let you know  Once we finally got into our room I expressed the concern of safety  I never got a response  We stayed four days with no response at all until an automated message on the morning we left  The tub did not drain at all  which I couldn t tell anybody because nobody got back to me  Nobody should have to stand in a foot of dirty water from the pipes while they shower 
528309636110844742,Cool spot for myself while in town visiting  Parking not being available on site is a bit of a set back but doable  Once you get a response they are pretty helpful but it s not always immediate  Overall good stay  The check in instructions were directly to the wrong sent of elevators for my unit  Also my door code stopped working and completely changed w o warning in the middle of my stay
524626711986060507,My husband and I spend   nights   days at this Airbnb  Great stay for the price  Location was fine  place looked clean  no issue here  and good communication with the host    Just a few things that are personal preference that we d like everyone to know  low water pressure in the shower  the bed squeaked a lot  the air felt dry  there are pets in the building so take into consideration for those that are allergic to cats dogs  the gate to open the parking lot is slow so be patient  otherwise super grateful for parking on location  The curtains are black out curtains which kept the place nice and dark at night   When we got there on the first day  the washer and dryer wasn t working  we put in a ticket request and it never got fixed during our stay  We ended up going to a laundry mat  but it would have been nice if it was working  Overall  easy to communicate with the host about our issues    Would recommended  and stay again 
514504486097841501,ok
514478251193739513,Excellent price and very helpful staff  Would stay again
476797840680098099,Great location   Dinkels across the street and The Chicago Music exchange a few steps away  Unfortunately  both were closed on Monday suing our stay   Host was prompt with communication with my last minute booking  The place was very clean and comfortable with very thoughtful touches like toiletries  tissue   and a black washcloth for makeup removal  There was not a coffee maker  however  there is an electric tea kettle and a coffee press  need to supply your own coffee  and a Starbucks and Bitter Pops within walking distance for coffee  Will definitely book again in the future  Thanks for the prompt communication with our last minute booking  We had a great time in Chicago  Thanks for a clean and comfortable home away from home 
468819924303584569,Great stay  Awesome views of the lake and park  Super peaceful  Loved it  Highly recommend  Great stay  Awesome views of the lake and park  Super peaceful  Loved it  It s a little smelly and the sink and kitchen needs a deeper clean  Especially the drain  Also  bed pillows probably need refreshing but overall a good stay 
529022727894276258,Do not rent this place unless you dont have much to carry   It is clean and very comfortable but to much of a hassle to deal with the key fob that doesnt work   Couldnt get downstairs to play pool like it is advertised in the app   One lady in the office was a snot to my husband but changed her when Iwalked in the office  There needs to be something done about the poor service with the key fob   I couldntget back into the garage after I parked    I wanted to bring in the rest of my things and couldnt get back to my truck because the key fob wouldnt work   Poor communication for sure 
511590911037853545,The stay was very nice   quiet  nice place  Thanks for the stay we enjoyed it       
514551244369470864,Nice place close to everything you need 
499253180103435448,The apartment is exactly as advertised  It is a no frills place but it is very well located for shops  transportation and UChicago  The apartment and building felt very safe    I would point out that the clawed bathtub is very tall and renters need to step over and out when getting in and  out of the shower so it is something to keep in mind    I would stay again because of convenience to everything Hyde Park  There was no coffee maker which was a bummer  Also no shampoo was provided   Communication was promptly answered but issues were not always resolved  The drip was ok as I had said but you did say you were sending someone  It s ok but maybe don t say you are sending someone  I did appreciate the intercom being fixed quickly 
508697337211573716,Nice sized condo right downtown with quick access to just about everything you would need  Interstate access was really easy and it was nice to have parking available onsite  I will be staying here again 
514452863896288089,The last day we had there they kicked us out at    am and we didn t get to come back in till the day was over  Even tho I paid for it  Other then that it was okay but I will never pay for that again The last day we had there they kicked us out at    am and we didn t get to come back in till the day was over  Even tho I paid for it  Other then that it was okay but I will never pay for that again
501411202264676698,Absolutely loved our stay here  Great apartment  Close to everything  Would highly recommend  We loved staying with you  Great experience   One little thing  there s a screen missing in one of the windows in the living room 
478313626804854500,Great house and location 
465239649452508799,Check in was a bit frustrating  I was sent the same  incorrect  code  x and it took me calling to get it sorted out about       minutes later  Overall nice space  the kitchen is low on utensils  cooking materials  including a simple coffee maker  It was a pretty good stay but I would choose another place next time 
451377712950565767,Beautiful  clean space that s accessible to so many amazing Chicago treasures   Zencity were fast and reliable when it came to communication about anything  Very much recommend this wonderful lil Chicago treasure  Thank you so much for the amazing stay  We all loved your bnb and it treated us very kindly over our short stay in Chicago  Honestly wish it could ve been longer 
514463733125838558,Awesome house  a lot of rooms with beautiful history  We loved our stay  the only thing is we wished there was a window covering in the bathroom on the very top level  Also the coffee maker wasn t working which is no big deal just thought I would let you know 
511546603941138907,Convenient and nice location with lots to do 
537711229133011756,Great location  The only real problem was the code not working upon arrival but it was fixed within the hour 
452137358538701754,Beautiful neighborhood  very comfortable beds  Nice large space  The apartment was not clean  the price on the website was far less than the price charged when we went to book  we ordered an additional night  the price was doubled when I actually booked and zencity said it was airbnb but airbnb said it was zencity pricing  we were locked out when we extended the night and were given noon checkout because of being locked out we had to leave early because cleaners were not notified and showed up while we were there  The beds are very comfortable  Recommend you get another mirror  Thank you 
471669970881852995,Great place to stay if you are having a staycation or visiting from out of town  Good location for visiting all of KC major areas  Thanks for the great stay and loved the location 
473121320899293095,Very disappointing  Amenities listed  such as the gym  pool  coffee bar  games courts  etc were not available to Air BnB guests  Seemed to be the policy of Zencity to block  On site unaffiliated building personnel told us it had been that way for quite some time  Amenities were open  but we couldnt access Location is good  but price we paid was for the amenities  Zencity was not responsive at all during our stay of of   days  During our trip  only communication was that they were unable to accommodate early check in due to another guest  and check out instructions on the final morning  This was despite several attempts via phone and app to reach them starting   hour after we first checked in  very disappointed in the lack of response during our stay to the immediate feedback we offered shortly after check in of amenities that were listed not being accessible  further  feedback we received from the local leasing agent  who could not help is  was that this did not seem to be an error  rather  a policy of Zencitys to not offer access  this was directly contrary to the listing  as well as even the welcome communication we received day of with the check in info  Other feedback   better instruction on need to use the fob to lock the door when leaving would be helpful  and if was initially a little hard to find the lockbox with the fob  describe a bit better where to find it at  add a few more utinsels to the kitchen  like a coffee maker  cutting board  etc 
745442863,Stayed here for   nights with my teenage daughter and her friend  Location was great and it was surprisingly quiet  being right on Clark   Comfy beds and easy access  I guess my only gripe was that it was pretty sparse in regards to decor  Great value for a sizable   br in a convenient location 
542716622089554070,Great place for a quick weekend getaway 
450643221670157032,In town for a few days for Pitchfork Music Fest  The apartment was a great place to stay  Walking distance to the festival grounds and lots of other cool restaurants bars shops  Nice neighborhood  Very clean  modern apartment  Bed was comfy  check in was a breeze  Would definitely stay again  Thanks for a great stay   Loved the apartment 
542716036713290587,Unique building that has been converted from a bakery to apartments  Our unit was on the ground floor and was easy to get to  The pizza restaurant and pinball game spot in the same building were convenient  The building gym has minimal equipment similar to most national   star hotel chain locations  Free street was generally available  but I did have to park in   hr or   hr a few times and move the vehicle   One fairly minor issue was that the wifi was very slow  and trying to use it for a Zoom call was frustrating to the point of stopping and using my phone as a hotspot instead  We were there mostly over a weekend so I did not have a lot of work meetings but if I had  the slow internet would have been aggravating  One of the bathrooms had not been clean completely  there was hair in the tub   the tub drain is broken  the curtain was gross  and there was no shampoo or soap  The hand soap for the sink was mostly water and useless  The instructions to enter the building were wrong  thankfully  the main door was unlocked but if it hadnt been  we would not have been able to get in to access the lockbox    The internet was slow to the point of being almost unusable  including attempting to stream anything on the TV 
510904818918167506,This was literally the best  We ended up with a really bad hotel and had to find something quick  The response time was amazing  The room  location  just everything was more than we could have asked for  We will definitely be back  The best place I ve ever stayed  Thank you so much 
500716794393572110,Wonderful location  excellent stay  Wonderful location  close to BJC and exactly what we needed  Thanks for everything 
746164161,The space was exactly as advertised  Clean  Convenient location  Very cozy  Would stay again Thank you for everything the place was great    
746838167,Wonderful place to stay
514494503338877607,This air bnb was centrally located  clean  and easy to locate  We will definitely be back This was by far one of the best places weve stayed
505116616269082833,Excellent location Apartment was very clean and cozy
746165073,Location in CWE was great as well as the apartment concept   Apartment needs clean and updating   At the time of our visit  the microwave was not functioning  feedback already provided via messages between host and me directly hardwood floors do not appear to have been washed other than being swept or vacuumed in quite some time   some surfaces appear to have been wiped  but others had not
744958205,The place was well worth what we paid  The building was beautiful  The apartment was well maintained  I would recommend this place to a friend  The vents were pretty gross  Also  the key card to the garage didn t work at all  I had to buzz for help every single time when leaving  Some of the vents were covered in loads of black dust  so much that it looked like hair was stuck 
744694301,Great location and beautiful neighborhood with some great places to eat within walking distance   Really cool building that has been modernized into great places to stay   We loved the roof top space as well    However  the place was filthy dirty 
744397534,Amazing space  Definitely worth the money  Clean and modern 
744385717,The pics are a true representation of the space  It s very roomy and is fully stocked with everything you d need  The building is well kept and the gated parking is a great benefit  We would stay here again  Thanks for a great stay  Very nice spot  Lafayette Square is a great neighborhood  just not the most convenient location in St  Louis 
744316524,The location  views  stay is all very nice and beautiful with local stores close by  The only downfall was the bathroom  the bathroom was nice but the shower looked like it wasn t clean and some of the walls in the bedroom were all little dirty as if something was spilled  Overall  we loved the stay and will be back soon  The shower in the bathroom wasn t clean  there was still hair and dirt circulating around the drain  And the Shower head doesn t look like it s been clean 
514475738736437602,cozy the check in was the most difficult
744120649,This apartment was neat and clean  It provide us an affordable place to stay in a convenient downtown location 
743865707,they are flexible and communicate quickly and efficiently thanks for getting me booked and in a room quickly and very accomding
743827064,Great location  nice secure building with secure parking  Didnt have welcome packet at check in and had to request security code  Other than that it was great 
742393731,One of the best locations in CWE  Secure building right on the park and easy walk to everything you might need  Ive stayed many times  great location  This unit   A  wasn t up to your usual standards this visit  There s some dust building up  the main area rug hadn t been vacuumed  I tried to myself  but it seems the vacuum is broken    The front door lever to exit the unit fell off with normal use   Screw lose I think     Needs paint touch ups for some big scratches on the wall near the bathroom  There are gaps in the flooring in a few spots near bathroom as well    Just looks like it needs some attention   Thanks 
510127917797161650,Everything was just as described  All of the instructions for check in were accurate  And of course the place was wonderfully comfortable and conveniently located  Thank you 
743368844,This may have been an insolated incident being that the entire apartment wasnt clean  but it was unacceptable that this company didnt have cleaners available the day of my check in to come and clean  They were scheduling for next morning clean which meant I would have to sleep in a filthy apartment  I cancelled and am awaiting a FULL refund  Ended up spending      extra dollars to book a last minute hotel room  Disappointed from this experience Please refund me  This may be an isolated incident  but it was unacceptable for me to stay there and I must let other positions know truthfully of my experience Apartment looks like what was in it  just a lot of wall scuffs and sagging furniture Hairs in bed  shoe prints and debris in shower  should and water stains on counters and living room end tables  floor not swept or mopped  sink dirty in bathroom  no trash bag in bathroom trashcan  food debris left in fridge Call center type of contact
743137678,Very clean  chic space   Its walking distance from lots of delicious restaurants and beautiful Lafayette Park   Theres rooftop access that is beautiful   However  the bed is a full and not a queen and I dont see how they think   people could stay there   Great place for a single person or a couple  I would add photos of the rooftop   It was so cool and we didnt really notice it until towards the end of our trip   such a nice touch to the stay    It says that you can sleep   here and I dont see how thats accurate   The only bed is a full sized bed and the couch is a loveseat so not appropriate for sleeping   We booked it as a couple which was fine  but not fit for three  We were not allowed to check in until    minutes after we were supposed to because the cleaner was not done  so that was frustrating We got responses from lots of different people
742462021,Wonderful getaway in St Louis   Very spacious  Beds so comfy   Great kitchen    very nice  bathtub slippery   beds awesome   loud neighbors to the north at   am    bathroom needs help  need a coffee maker   easier than french press
741958452,Lovely space  Very clean and open  Bathroom is a little small  but has everything you need and works well  Have an idea of where you are going to park if you cant find a street spot  but the hosts gave suggestions  I very much enjoyed my stay  Great space  thank you 
741930112,It was nice just a small maintenance issue with bathroom floor  Enjoy  It was nice just the bathroom scared me with the steam and sprinkler sound that wouldnt shut off from corner of floor  But it was nice 
480429685001983959,Great location and value but had difficulty with key card  getting into locked building and using elevator   Had many issues with key card  As   women coming back from bars at  am and not being able to get upstairs  it did not feel safe 
510923120708026175,Very nice apartment located just south of downtown close to highways and local attractions  my only complaint is that its winter time but the thermostat is permanently set  it was warmer outside this weekend so the air condition automatically came on  I was unable to trun off so I had to deal with cool air blowing even while taking a shower  I was what to set the temperature at but this wouldnt have help in this situation  I would book this location again  The host was very responsive
741548060,My bf and I were quickly passing through St  Louis and needed to find a place downtown quickly  Zencity had a discounted room available  and responded within   minutes of my request  The apartment was suitable for our needs  We would definitely recommend staying with Zencity  Thank you for promptly responding to our quick request to stay  I sent     to cover the parking pass  thats what it said that it cost to replace on the back of the card   We had a great time  Many thanks 
509443612006948172,As expected  I d stay here again  Neighborhood is clean and safe  Great Caribbean food around the corner at Parrish Cafe and good coffee downstairs at Sip and Savor  Highly recommend walking to   th Street Wines for a great wine selection  Open Produce to make yourself dinner  and Cornell Flowers to make your Airbnb experience with Zencity colorful and lush  Enjoy  Thank you so much for hosting us 
741145555,Very cozy place with good location  Only negative is the room was a bit hot and stuffy at night even with the window unit turned on  Thanks for having us   We had a great time at your place
740047186,This place was great  We went to the sushi place just a few doors down for dinner and it was some of the best sushi Ive had  The apartment was clean and tidy  looked great  and had amenities for both short and long stays  If you re looking for an affordable place downtown  this is a great option  The building smelled a bit like marijuana  but the apartment itself was clean and and did not smell like weed
480404165604541326,Pros  located in the art district and close to train You can walk to many bars and restaurants  Comfortable beds  Cons  wasnt well clean   The floors were pretty dirty and there are so much dust around the window areas  Theres a terrible plumbing smell as soon as you enter the building  The smell gets worse in the downstairs bedroom  The basement bathroom sink is so small  its almost impossible to wash your face   brush your teeth   The stay would have been very pleasant if there were no sewage smells all throughout 
490565293388122430,I gave this condo a three star review due to us getting constant  noise complaints   Come to find out the unit has a decibel machine so if you re too loud let s say get excited during a football game or maybe playing cards with your friends you would get a noise complaint but nobody s complaining just the machine  We even had the front desk coordinator from downstairs come stand out in the hallway for a few minutes and said they heard nothing but you could walk past other units in the building and clearly hear them having a loud party  The location  size  the building all amazing  Host communication was fantastic  I have it a   star rating tho bc we kept getting a  noise  complaint  We weren t being loud  We even grabbed the front desk coordinator from downstairs to come see if we were indeed too loud  She sat in the hallway for some time and said she couldn t hear us at all  Come to find out the host has a decibel machine in the unit  So let s say you got excited during a game  It would send you a noise complaint  If the tv was too loud  Complaint  I m a grown adult  Not some young kid trying to party  There were no more then   of us in the unit  At one point he was going to send the authorities if we  didn t keep it down  I said you re on the phone with me now  I m in the middle of what you say is too loud  does it sound too loud  He agreed that it didn t but the machine kept going off  It was my birthday day weekend to get away from kids and be an adult  Needless to say it kind of put a damper on my stay  Will not rent from zen city again just for this reason   If we were too loud I d completely understand and be apologetic 
542795857155435221,Cute little unit  Thank you Zencity  
455008755950715819,Honestly  this place was pretty awful  First  we arrived to check in and could not get in  The entire screen on the pad to type everything in was froze  We called our  host  which is a call center for the entire Zencity  not a specific person  that had no idea who I was or anything about my airbnb stay  He literally was zero help and the only reason we got in    minutes later was because we caught the door when someone came out  Next  to be brief   the bed in this airbnb is old and worn  We didn t even feel comfortable getting in it because it looked so dingy  The bedroom also reeked of cat urine  We ended up buying an air mattress unfortunately  Pretty much the trip was an overall disaster  Kitchen and bathroom was pretty clean and up to date  Bedroom is awful  Checking in was TERRIBLE  Communication was TERRIBLE 
522498685381320344,Decent place  The location had a lot of construction  Parking is a bit of a walk if you don t get in early  The shower drain was clogged with a giant hair clump  and the under sheet is a mattress sleeve so it s never been washed  Top sheet  bead spread  and pillows were all clean  Cookware is abysmal  Battery missing from ceiling fan remote made it unusable  They offered to replace if I gave them permission to enter for    hours   I declined  Checkin was fast and simple   Overall good price  but lacking some amenities  Clean the shower drain there was so much hair clogging it the shower almost flooded due to a buildup of hair  most likely from emptying the mop  Also better pots and pans would have been nice  Battery missing from the remote made the ceiling fan impossible to use 
533351283147400262,It was a great stay and they responded quickly  It was a great stay and they responded quickly 
527590056979672143,Such a cute place  Location was perfect and in close proximity to other activities in St  Louis  Such a cute place  Location was perfect and in close proximity to other activities in St  Louis 
523941620934515771,This was a fantastic stay  Very detailed and proactive communication   looking forward to the next visit  No notes  this was perfect
468756162310145225,This place is in a great location  It s convenient to downtown and in a safe neighborhood  The unit was in a very secure building which is perfect for someone traveling alone that will feel safe  Everything was wonderful  The place was clean and peaceful

480453089297115351,Great location  but not very clean 
458647512277003215,Nice location  right next to Whole Foods  was a plus  It was nice 
515266147218748820,Zencity hosts were extremely responsive to any messages on Airbnb   Unit was clean and all instructions for check in check out were very clear   Had no problems during my stay
533381870652488677,Great location  clean space  lots of room  great spaces  and comfy beds 
539899901964093254,Wonderfully discreet and convenient location  which is inviting and comfortable  Love it    Place was great  parking situation could be more optimal  only difficult with heavy luggage  I ll likely stay there again on the  st of Feb 
515210872683294661,Dirty dog hair was all over the key fog to get in apartment took    mins Couch was full of dog hair   key fog is not easy to get
430428968673698069,This is such a beautiful house   We really enjoyed our time   And there is so much space to spread out as a family   Not everyone has to be in the same room   A lovely choice  There is a bit of an ant problem in the kitchen   liquid ant killer under the sink but no traps to put it in  And that bathroom door that sticks is terribly annoying especially since it is the one close to all the bedrooms and the most used   Also my mother would not let us use the table with out a tablecloth or placemats  heaven forbid    but the placemats were dirty   We washed them while we were there     But otherwise it is a beautiful house   I think it was a good bargain   I would definitely stay again   My father LOVED that it was across the street from the Truman house and we walked down to the little  downtown  area which was very nice 
501415521422560104,The place was amazing 
536911264780342695,Lovely place to stay nice   quiet   Hard time entering build other than that I loved it
468863130393236430,We generally enjoyed our stay at this property  Pros  Great location  Plenty to explore on foot  Stylish modern furnishings and decor  Beds were comfortable  Kitchen well stocked  Safe neighborhood  Parking lot  and rooftop access  Full size washer and dryer was a plus  Beautiful community garden across the street  Cons  Main entry always smelt like garbage trash   Use the side entrance   Walls of apartment are thin lending to no internal privacy  The couch in the main area sunk down in the middle   We placed a pillow under the cusion for support   When inside the apartment  one can hear hallway chatter as well  There is a Nest in the apartment  however  it asks for a code if you want to change the temperature  Our first night there  when we asked for the code  we were told  Unfortunately  we are unable to give out the code but I can surely go ahead and adjust the temperature from our end  May I know what temperature do you want it adjected to   The thougt of having to ask someone each time to remotely change the temperature for the next five days was unfathomable  We did not bother to respond and just made the adjustments on our end via our clothing and trying to adjust the temperature via Nest anyway  Nevertheless  we had a great time in St  Louis and enjoyed our stay  We generally enjoyed our stay at       The apartment was clean and the kitched was well stocked  Just a few negatives  the walls within the apartment are very thin as well as being able to hear any chatter in the hallways  the main entrance always smelt like garbage trash  not being able to adjust the temperature in the apartment inspite of a Nest in the apartment  and specifically asking about this before arrival  was offsetting and should be disclosed in the listing  We forgot all about the parking pass when we left but was able to bring it back to the property   thanks for that  Location was perfect for exploring on foot and it was close to downtown 
528213850241295663,Great stay
528212200680226031,Expect NO PARKING Pass if your out late passed    pm     housekeeping items other than that it was kool stay
471677937838633201,This AirBNB is great for a trip for   guests  if you are comfortable with sharing a bed  The location is fantastic  you have so much locations within a    minute walking distance  There s plentiful places to eat  relax  and visit  The AirBNB itself is also not very big  but enough for   people  One minor gripe is that the bed is very much squeaky  It makes sense it is squeaky  but any small movement has the sound that ultimately gets very annoying  The AirBNB was great  My guest and I had an overall great experience  My only   qualms would be to one  make it more clear who to talk with if something happens work with communication  The faucet in our AirBNB became leaky  and when I contacted you guys via private message  I received no reply  The second thing  I would advise getting a less squeaky bed for the location  It really did get kind of annoying 
460800608593004019,Check in was very difficult  When we got there  the call box outside was broken  so we couldn t get in until someone came out and opened the door for us  When we located the lock box that was supposed to contain our key fob for our room  the fob wasn t in there  When we tried to call the property to ask what we needed to do  they couldn t give us any direction  We had to wait    minutes for them to call us back and tell us the clean crew had misplaced the fob  The only reason we were able to get into our room was because another couple  who were also having trouble getting into their room  found a master key fob that was supposed to be locked up  but wasn t    The rooftop was a fun little place to hang out  I loved that our room was the only one on the floor  It did get somewhat loud at night just because people were coming and going to get to the rooftop  but this wasn t bothersome to us    There is also an awesome restaurant on the bottom floor with great food and drinks  Overall  we really enjoyed our stay  Just wish the check in process would have been easier 
452814992054170956,There is alot of history in Kansas City   The development is vital for everyone in community  For the economy an convience to live where you can have better job opportunities   Modern   Chic living space   The history of the BUILDING is awesome    Nice to see communities enjoying location very nice environment 
495613918416546360,Great Hospitality I love everything about this property  Excellent directions on what I needed to do  I will most definitely stay with them when ever I come back to STL      
460154527075229488,This is an apartment in an apartment building that is used for air BnB  Nice location  about    minute walk to the plaza  The first steps of checking in can be confusing  but once I got the Key fob there were no issues coming and going  There are resturants bars in the building  Lots of food options within walking distance  Parking can be problematic  watch for what areas are metered  All in all  good value and no complaints 
451368007098946828,Really loved this apt  I lived in Bucktown for   years so it was nice to have a place close to my old home  It was a nice chill place with a lot of space  Easy walk to so many bucktown Logan wicker park destinations  Would highly recommend  Thanks for the stay  It was so convenient and perfect for our needs  I think the check in process was a little difficult with the keypad at the door  Could the code be shorter and easy to remember  Or maybe just a key  Otherwise loved the place 
505771138751493210,Great digs    Great location as well   Everything was true to the pics and communication was great    Very easy checkin    Would stay again    Actually already did    Enjoy Thanks   Was a great stay
458624716409398457,Very tidy and lovely AirBnb apartment equipped with everything you need  A good bed and nice bathroom  will be back
427494305135967899,Slawiks home was perfect for my groups stay  This was a last minute booking as the airbnb I initially booked had a home emergency  Slawik was quick to respond and open his home to us  We were able to check in quickly and easily and get a good nights sleep  The place is just as described and as the photos show  Perfect for the value  The area was quiet and felt very safe  Only wish we had more time to explore  Will definitely stay again if in the area  Thanks again for the great stay 
478314910960882800,The key drop box wasn t working so I had to wait an over hour just to check in then once I got to the room the tv did not work  other than that it s a nice place  
505107087998949594,We loved everything about this little loft  It was perfect and in a perfect location  Being from FL I wasn t sure what kind of area this was in  but I felt so safe staying here  Other residents we met in the halls were very nice and accommodating as well  I ll definitely be back next year loved staying here  I can t wait until next years trip up   we will definitely be planning to stay here again  Thank you for sharing your home   
742452379,I ve stayed in a few of there units and i must say there a constancy in how Zencity keep such a high standard each and every stay     i would recommend them as a place you definitely want to stay    
515194515057077905,Awesome space  Love the views and the layout  Zencity was very responsive which was awesome to have  The place looked amazing and had an amazing amount of amenities  I really appreciated how it looked and the views were incredible  The only feedback I have is there was some hair in the home that was slightly inconvenient  Other than that  it was great  Thank you 
455719441685986215,Great location  We arrived around midnight and couldnt get in at first  got a new code within    minutes and everything was as described  Awesome communication Thanks a lot 
504357829548130110,The location is phenomenal  steps away from the restaurants of the Central West End  There is no dedicated parking  but we never had issues finding a spot near the apartment    The condo itself is this gorgeous  spacious older model  filled with exposed bricks and hardwood floors  The decor is a bit spartan  but the condo has everything you need for your time  I was able to do a load of laundry in the full size washer and dryer  detergent furnished  and do some Thanksgiving cooking in the  kitchen  great place  the only suggestions I have is that one of the bathtubs had clogged drain  the location and set up was phenomenal
515284701616189616,The location is prime everything was as shown  I would definitely highly recommend Stay was great an additional key fob would make things easier for more than one guest and maybe some additional blankets but the stay was wonderful I thank you so much
542796929000252999,Excellent location and good price 
539176334654477008,This was a great stay  Place was clean and well put together  Simple but yet modern and nice   It was nice to have the Netflix already there and was very comfortable  I will definitely stay again  There s isn t free parking but it s not that expensive  The lobby area and guest were very nice also  Will definitely stay again 
537736033679414673,absolutely fantastic place to stay  everything is just like you see in the advertisement  not having control of the thermostat is a huge turnoff to me  I dont want to text or e mail everytime I want or need to adjust the temperature  being told that were doing our part to help with climate etc has nothing to do with me spending my dime 
476095727882831974,Very clean  basic   bedroom apartment  exactly as presented  Please clear the bathtub drain  otherwise  it worked very well for us  Also  I didn t see the cord to the hot water pot and a touch of coffee would have been nice  but we wouldn t have used either on this trip  maybe when we come back 
399209623433115610,N a Sofa bed not very comfortable  water pressure in shower weak and downstairs shower leaked badly  We had a great stay and enjoyed ourselves   More bath towels accessible would have been helpful 
476822049636394842,It s fine  I found dust on the bed coming from the old and barely working AC  and hair on the toilet  The furniture looks good but the lighting is poorly designed  Very unstable Wi Fi  Probably won t stay again for my next visit 
494989691460349007,Good clean place to stay  Be aware  as Zenicity clearly states in advance  there is NO include or available free parking  even on the street  so you will  have to hire a spot someplace quite a distance for permanent parking of your car if you have one  We spent another     to park for the week    Light on places for cloths  no dressers  or shelves  but the place is otherwise very well located  clean and a great stay  Thank you for the blankets and great stay   Our suggestions are  put a coat rack near the door  that would really help  and shelf over the rods in the closets  as there are no drawers or shelf anyplace for cloths   These simple steps would make the place much more enjoyable   Also you NEED more silverwhere     almost NO forks  etc   THank you
453591491114609896,HORRIBLE   PRICE WAS DECENT   NO TRASH BAGS  BED WAS UNCOMFORTABLE     GAVE US THE WRONG DOOR CODE  AND A BAD SMELL TO BOOT   PAY A LITTLE MORE AND FIND A BETTER PLACE     
495684059942167542,Overall it was fine  The sheets on the bed were clean and the towels were clean as well  I couldn t figure out how to lock the door when I left  which was concerning  I messaged the company a few times but didn t get  Response  Not ideal when I have personal items in the apartment  Shower worked fine  overall it was a fine experience but the unlocked door bothered me and the lack of communication was troubling  I wasn t able to lock the door when leaving  We were out all day Saturday and the door was unlocked because the automatic locking mechanism wasn t working  Also it appears there s blood on the rug towards the bathroom  Not sure  Beds   towels were clean 
504323469135112869,The communication is so great and they re always so sweet and accommodating    This is my second time booking with them and I was not disappointed  Thanks for the prompt communication and flexibility     You are always awesome 
500031503221171343,We really liked staying here  it was very convenient as the light rail was right outside the property s door and you can ride it free to river market area  to union station or any stop in between   There was plenty of bath towels for our   night stay and check in was a breeze   Once you get the key bob you have access to everything   We would stay here again  the value  convenience  up to date property is very nice  Close to just about anywhere you may want to go to in KC   It does say garage parking in description but it actually is a large surface parking next to property which was fine 
503664366431358462,Great apartment in convenient downtown location Won t put this in public notes but was surprised that there had been smoking in the apartment  May want to make this clear on the website so that us non smokers know  However great apartment abs experience   thank you 
444918010690849237,Great location  nice amenities
529044394270208954,We really enjoyed staying here  Thank you for the stay  it s a really nice place and we enjoyed it  A couple things we noticed  The overhead light in the bedroom doesn t work  A blanket by the couch would be nice  There were two conditioners but no shampoo   We liked the extra touch of the coffee grinder with coffee beans 
502962649841739207,Easy  Clean  Great location  Nice unit with all the necessities   Would go back again  Thanks again   As I said in the review  I would have felt a bit more secure with additional door security  Even one of those door wedges  stopped can be very effective     Thanks so much  Ps   if you happen to know where the lights on the sides of the bed came from  I d love to know  
539086885569593755,Overall the stay was great   All was as it said on the listing   The building is quiet and safe   The loveseat was not the most comfortable  otherwise it was great  Overall the stay was great   The loveseat could have been better   Otherwise it was all good 
459884019852784526,Ein super Airbnb mitten in der Stadt  Kein Ziel ist mehr als  min entfernt  Eine mega sehenswerte Stadt  Man f hlt sich direkt so  als w rde man schon immer in Stralsund wohnen  D Super Wochenende in einer SUUUUUPEEEERRRR Dachgeschosswohnung mitten in der Stadt  Danke f r das Vertrauen  Vielen Dank 
514539431694685430,great location  I appreciate my stay  Just a note to make sure you clean and change your air filters in the unit  VERY dusty and dirty and had not been clean in a while  I wont give bad reviews  just wanted to communicate that with you for future guests  Great location 
481081543314547135,What a splendid stay  The unit under promised yet OVER delivered  How often can you say that  about anything    The  st floor condo was extremely clean  modern  gorgeous  and easy to access  The bed was so comfortable  a lil  squeaky  but hey    We also appreciated the secured parking as well  It added another layer of comfort and security which was so appreciated   Location as well  If you re headed to St  Louis for a long weekend  as we did   this is most certainly PRIME locale  Lafayette Square is sublime  A wonderful lil  pocket conveniently located to anything and all  Charming as can be  You ll want to spend one afternoon alone just walking the neighborhood   We had a wonderful time experiencing St  Louis but our favorite part was coming back every evening to this place  I highly recommend  Big thumbs up   P S   The rooftop lounge and view  So good  What a wonderful stay  The unit under promised yet over delivered  How often can you say that  The condo was extremely clean  easy to access  and perfectly located  Not to mention safe  The private parking added another layer of security and comfort  I d recommend this AirBnB highly 
540615002138312732,Zencity apartment was great for our out of town guests  Location is great  Close to public transportation and walkable to many stores  Location was the key  as our guests stayed for an entire month and didn t have a car  The host was very informative and communicative  Thank you  
541375283953661277,Unfortunately this was not the experience that we were hoping for  I waited TWO HOURS after check in time waiting for a key to get into the air bnb  I was never able to get a key  and to top it off the building was being evacuated after the fire alarms were activated  We had to rearrange our plans for the night due to the inconvenience of not being able to get into the air bnb  After waiting so long and STILL no promise of even getting a key for the night I cancelled our reservation  I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to staying in this air bnb  Even though customer service was not able to help  I will say they responded in a timely manner  If you decide to stay here  I would be cautious and have them verify a key is there and available before you check in 
495635700586457583,overall impression  would not stay here again     POSITIVES  comfy bed  modern appliances  good location   NEGATIVES      Was not clean   We had to vacuum clean ourselves when we arrived   There is a board that said it was clean   days prior to our arrival  however couldnt get early check in due to someone leaving earlier that day so im pretty sure it actually was not clean       The bathroom toilet does not flush properly near the kitchen    The listing is not accurate   The listing says it fits   people however when we arrived there were only   queen beds and the couch changed from the picture and wouldnt fit an adult to sleep on   When asking the host  they offered   hr late check out as a solution and said they did some remodeling     When we took the late check out  the door locked at   am and not    and wouldnt let us back in building   Luckily we had one member in the room to let us in     The building lock stopped working one day and had to prop it open with a newspaper just to get in out      Very bad pillows bring your own if you are going to stay here      There were a few curtains that were not functional  one was installed backwards and stuck so light comes in the morning   The other bedroom curtain also broken so light comes in       No shampoo or hair dryer  they did have multiple bottles of body wash and conditioner though      Wifi went out while there  re started and did not return  We had to use our hotspot      Coffee maker was there but no filters   Tea water heater available  but no cord for it to actually work       the patio area with seating pictured is not included in stay and should be removed from their advertising   The roof area seating is private and you cannot sit up there    I would have stayed here again if the listing was accurate  the room was clean  and would only bring   people and expect one functional bathroom   Be prepared to bring your own hairdryer  pillow  eye shade  earplugs and hair body products 
502237444279349739,This place is beautiful  Lovely view of the arch at night  The couch is not true to description  my    year old couldn t fit on it to sleep  While the place list the couch and bed as sleeping spaces  the couch is not a full couch  it s a small loveseat not intended to make anyone more than   ft tall comfortable for sleep    Fully stocked kitchen and amazing amenities including an echo and speaker embedded in the wall  The key fob to access the gate was very helpful because without it  depending on parking you may be walking quite a ways to the main front entrance  We loved parking on the far side and coming in the back door to go right up the stairs to our room  The area is perfect  quiet with lots of great restaurants and sites close by  The place is lovely and spotless  I highly recommend changing information regarding parking lot access with the key fob as well as better instructions to find the rooftop deck  I looked all over and never found signage or access to anything of the sort    Also  the couch is DEFINITELY not intended for a person to sleep on for multiple reasons     The couch needs clean  the stains are a bit much     It s a loveseat  m    year old was far too long for that  The place is not adequately furnished to say the couch is meant for another person  I recommend getting an air mattress     Need more blankets for anyone sleeping in the living room  the throw and a spare sheet and pillow from the closet was more adequate    Also  from a Super Host AirBnb to another  have your clean crew pop off the back overflow drain of the sink  lots of mildew forming in there  Small spots like that missed can lead to bigger problems    Lastly  light over the shower doesn t turn on  maybe a new bulb unless it s always been like that  Ceiling fan in bedroom made such a loud noise I was nervous it would lead to something more drastic and turned it off 
509368509329584505,it was a beautiful place really nice price would love to stay there again  just thinking that you need a more experience clean person to do more thorough clean my girlfriends family including her and have a clean business and have did contract clean with St Lukes The plaza marketing companies her grandparents have owned it for over    years so shes very experienced and offered that if there was a name position for clean that she would love to help you guys out and to clean properly mopping and scrubbing walls as we did before we left
455021965112743952,Nice and clean  No complaints here  especially at this price  We enjoyed our stay  The only downside was only having one key  Traveling with another couple for the weekend we felt like we had to coordinate key switching or staying up to let them in when they stayed out too often 
502208475274922887,My stay here was easy and fun  I highly recommend it  I will be staying with Zencity again It was amazing  My only critique was that there was no oil or spices for cooking but that s it 
502188758948242401,Great spot  Parking was definitely tough  but great airbnb 
510841603082574160,Place was really convenient for visiting my family  I would be willing to stay somewhere else nearby though for a better rate  The convenience was not worth the cost  No complaints about cleanliness  Walls and doors are super thin  but neighbors are respectful  Quiet building  but when someone is talking on the phone or watching tv  you can hear it  Didn t bother me as someone used to apartment living  but something to keep in mind if that would bother you  There are blinds on the windows but no curtains  I recommended to the host to consider getting some curtains in the bedroom because it can get bright in there  The bed is amazingly comfortable  It was the best part which is the most important for me  I would stay here again  but will shop around for a better rate close by first  I will mention this in my public review as well  My only suggestion for something that is in your control is to have some curtains in the bedroom to help keep the sun out in the morning or for an afternoon nap  Bed was super comfy but the room would get super bright 
528247425310242022,right by the highways  clean rooms  provided towels  parking spot provided
515902859495798132,Excellent location and very urban vibe  I loved my stay here  Only downside is paid street parking  Rest everything is excellent
502152447212941722,This was a really great place for my family to stay  The location is convenient for walking to shops and restaurants  though parking was somewhat challenging  you just might have to drive around the block a few times to find a spot   Overall the place was pretty clean and quiet  I would stay here again at a future visit to Saint Louis  Thank you for a great place to stay Zencity  This was a good first airbnb experience for me and my family  As an FYI the toilet paper holder in one bathroom is broken  so the toilet paper roll doesn t stay on  and the electrical wiring in one bedroom is a little worrisome   the grounding plug is bent backwards to plug the cord into an outlet   Overall I liked this place and will recommend to anyone I know visiting Saint Louis 
500691383711592969,Overall stay would have been phenomenal if we had hot water for longer than just the first day there  I reached out multiple times  even contacting Airbnb support  getting to the point where I just had to call the office of the complex so someone could finally resolve the problem   Also in regards to the toilet leaking into the below apt the following morning of our arrival  the plumber walked in unannounced  hours later    stated he  didn t know the place had guests    Location was the main good thing considering the elevators reeked of marijuana as well  Overall stay would have been phenomenal if we had hot water for longer than just the first day  I reached out multiple times  even contacting Airbnb support  to where I just had to call the office of the complex so someone could finally resolve the problem   Also in regards to the toilet leaking  the plumber walked in unannounced  hours later  while everyone was still in bed   stated he  didn t know the place had guests  
501468434619630064,The location was amazing  Washer and dryer were easy to access  Apartment was cute and the staff were all nice  The location was great  I was super grateful for the heater especially this past weekend  Thank you for including a fresh change of sheets and towels so we could have clean items everyday  The washer and dryer downstairs made it so nice to pack up fresh clothes and was everything as needed
481158561168022170,great place to stay
515911190046615173,Clean Room  Great Location no complaints
384707362529259286,The house was great for our recent stay  exactly as advertised  We enjoyed hanging out in the Westport neighborhood at Mills Record Company for Record Store Day and eating at several of the nearby restaurants  Slawik was a great host  especially with communication  We definitely recommend this Airbnb for your stay in KCMO  We really enjoyed your house for our stay in KCMO  Perfect location for our time at Mills Record Company in Westport 
540606032068832022,Awesome place to stay and fast communication with Zencity
499326988105027530,I am not a person who generally complains but this was a bad Airbnb experience    There is no heat in the unit  The property management company did nothing to rectify that problem   Furthermore  I was traveling and liked the that the unit had a washer and dryer  After arriving  I washed my clothes only to find out the dyer does not work so all of my clothes were wet  Again  the property management company did nothing to rectify that problem   I was also locked out of the unit several times  I would have to call the property management company to get a new code  That takes time and was not always seem less   The front door to the building also does not work  The property management company has no control over that so it is difficult to access the building    Lastly  very loud as it is right by the front entrance and mail area where packages are dropped and doors are slammed    The one positive  the location  The neighborhood is great and you can walk to nearby businesses 
475325578517641453,Location is fantastic  Feels like a quaint escape from the big city  Right next to the most beautiful church 
499317250545252240,The room was clean   The location was great   The cost was affordable   The check in process was a complete and utter disaster   For the first room       I had  the apartment building key card was not available   This made it impossible to get to my room   I was told that at     pm that the housing     team would contact me to get me the card   They didnt contact me by      pm   Turns out they leave for the day at  pm    After   phone calls and   hours of wasted time late at night  I finally got checked in   I basically had to beg to get transferred to another room  evidently their support staff couldnt come up with that solution on their own     The check in process was completely unacceptable  it is the last thing you want to deal with after a late dinner  Be sure you have the key card for check in   For the first room       I had  it was not there   This makes it impossible to get to my room   I was told that at     pm that the housing     team would contact me   They didnt by      pm   Turns out they leave for the day at  pm    The check in process wasted   hours of my time late at night and was completely unacceptable   I basically had to beg to get transferred to another room 
469510264571020277,Perfect location  and really comfortable  It was the perfect spot  When I visit STL again  I will definitely book with Zencity 
537683671547363361,For   nights  the total was     after all of the fees   The studio was clean and had plenty of toiletries  The kitchen is fully stocked  but it only comes with olive oil  salt  and pepper grocery wise  The washer and dryer worked great    Only   cons  one of which they already warn you about  which is parking  We paid about    dollars Total to park since there is no free parking  Parking is free from   pm     am and on sundays  so We had to wake up at   am every morning to pay during the week   Second con is that the Wi Fi did not work   Other than that  a wonderful stay  The wifi unfortunately would not work for us the entire time we stayed     thats why we rated the accuracy as a    Other than that      
497147104975013166,The apartment was nice  with new finishes  appliances  bathroom  very clean and very well equipped   a plenitude of towels  tp  paper towels  enough toiletries  dish soap  etc    The bed was very comfortable   Location is great  The building is not to the same standard  a little worn  but was fine  The only real negatives were that they did send the wrong code for the front door  and I had to wait for someone to let me in the first time  they wrote back with the right code  explaining that management had just changed it  but really  didnt they know that   and also the wifi info was wrong and I had to text them  which would have been a real pain  but luckily the pw they had given me worked on the first other network I tried  for a room down the hall  so it worked out OK 
495656801762282458,Overall  we had a good stay here  We really appreciated the responsiveness and availability of the host  as well as the great location  Unfortunately  the stay started off with a bit of a hiccup since we were sent the wrong entry code for the building  However  we called and were connected to someone right away who fixed the problem  which was great since it was after   pm and we were unsure if anyone would be available  The beds were really comfy and the decor was nice  but the apartment is a bit more dated than it looks in the photos  Please double check the code you send when sending checkin instructions to other guests  We had to haul a lot of bags from a distance and it was very cold outside and we couldn t get in  What made it more confusing was that you gave us the code for the other door so it worked there  but our place was ultimately not in that building  We really appreciated your availability and responsiveness though  especially since our checkin was so late 
495646468480600577,DO NOT STAY HERE   From the photos this place looks like a steal  but once you arrive you will soon realize how poorly maintained the place is     My wife and I arrived around      and were immediately hit with smells of weed and cigarettes in the hallway   Not pleasant  but we can t expect management to be able to control the neighbors   Once we walked into the apartment we were wishing for the hallway smell as the entire apartment had a stench of rotting garbage   It felt like some didn t take the trash out for months  and showed of right before we arrived to remove it   As we walked around the place we noticed unclean floors and countertops  area rugs that should be trashed  and to top it off sheets that smelled like the previous guests   As we were debating on whether or not to stay or find a hotel  we noticed human nails in rugs next to the bed as well as pieces of glass near the coach    Clearly this was not the place for us to stay the night  and we left for a nearby hotel   I brought this up to the management group and their response was  ohh well   and  we will refund the clean fee    It was so dirty that we couldn t stay there a refund of the clean fee was an insult   I highly recommend that you keep scrolling to the next option 
480390406840375902,This place is extremely well located and is large enough for a group  It is relatively bare bones as far as amenities but it is perfect for a group looking for a home base to explore the city    The host was responsive and helped us out later on a Saturday evening when we locked ourselves out of the unit  which was greatly appreciated  Thanks again for helping when we got locked out 
466608758720286487,Beautiful listing Great properties  great rates  beautiful efficient decor  Kind customer service but I always had issues with check in
465966870055318191,Such a cute and comfortable space  It was very clean and exactly how the host described  We will definitely stay here again if we ever get the chance to do so  The hosts were so sweet and communicated very well  You will not be disappointed in your stay here  Thank you so much for the hospitality and we  absolutely loved the space 
465905851076297497,I loved my stay  it s exactly like the pictures but a little bigger to me  Parking was kind of hard to find but we only had to park a block away at most  Loved the area and great location to go to any part of KC 
465290503584795811,Our experience was not good  We had an issue upon check in with a smoke detector beeping  We were unable to reach the detector and deferred to Zencity for a resolution  We were advised the following day that they couldn t have someone available on the weekend to help  We spent the entire first night trying to sleep through a beeping every    seconds  We were advised through Airbnb to cancel as we went to get a hotel room for the  nd night  The issue still isn t      resolved and the communication has been terrible on Airbnb and Zencity  This trip has verified we are done with Airbnb and will book through hotels moving forward  Our experience was not good  We had an issue upon check in with a smoke detector beeping  We were unable to reach the detector and deferred to Zencity for a resolution  We were advised the following day that they couldn t have someone available on the weekend to help  We spent the entire first night trying to sleep through a beeping every    seconds  We were advised through Airbnb to cancel as we went to get a hotel room for the  nd night  The issue still isn t      resolved and the communication has been terrible on Airbnb and Zencity  This trip has verified we are done with Airbnb and will book through hotels moving forward 
465249977334006352,Great views   it s perfect for a weekend getaway
465230494908816165,First this place is not safe  there was an incident that made us feel extremely uncomfortable and vulnerable  the police were contacted twice and never responded  I messaged the host and they didn t get back to me until the next day and all they had to say was that they d notify their team so they could  keep an eye out   Upon arrival the home was dirty  I sent multiple pictures to the host and got no response  The amenities were very minuscule  no trash bags  a coffee pot and only two plates  It s extremely loud due to the location  traffic  and the neighborhood  The night of the incident we stayed in the car until early morning  I do not refine d this place  for lock of safety  cleanliness and lack of concern from the host 
465216896642263648,This air bnb was awful    The instructions to enter the building did not work  We did not even get a key fob to access the building once we got to the room  Zencity was impossible to contact and when they answered they could not even offer any help  I would not stay here  The instructions to enter the building did not work  We ran into another couple trying to check in to their air BnB who had similar issues not being able to access their room  A resident of the complex was kind enough to let us in  but once we got into our room we were promised a fob that gets us inside the building and up the elevator  After not being able to locate the fob  it was nearly impossible to contact Zencity for help  Once they finally answered they had no way of helping us with our problems so we were scared we would have to sleep in our car if we did not catch a resident entering the building when we were coming back  They did not help us all weekend or offer any sort of refund for the lack of communication and not being able to access our room ourselves 
495684274064133774,Great location  safe location  Hosts were able to accommodate me same day for a surprise visitor 
465189263859359608,The location and room was amazing  It was perfect for our weekend get away  We had some issues getting in the building with our code but the owner got back with us very quickly to help  We will definitely use again for our next trip  Overall we really enjoyed our stay  We couldn t get in the lobby area with our pin  Another guest had to let us in  Then we had a hard time getting in our room as well  It could have been a user error  The room was great and perfect for our stay 
455726465792022628,The apartment was super clean and with all the accommodations needed to have a nice stay with places to eat close by  The brown line has a stop by the apartment which was great if taking the metro  Its a couple of stops away from the city so plan ahead as it may take a lilttle more then    min to get there  Check in was super easy and they respond very quickly when contacted 
542777713583778919,Nice stay   could be clean up a bit around the lobby areas
460876477787406266,Overall this place was great  It has a really cool vibe  the pizza place attached is amazing  My only complaint was that when we arrived the fire alarm was beeping every few minutes  I messaged them on Saturday morning  we returned back nothing was done  I messaged them again on Sunday  returned back  again nothing was done    nights of constant beeping  Please fix the fire alarm beeping  We could barely sleep with it going off every few minutez
465135616008079051,The irony of calling their company  ZenCity  is not lost on me  We were not only highly annoyed but we were also then late for our engagement  also needing to find a new place to stay for both nights where we could guarantee re entry into the building  and also on the phone with ZenCity staff who by no fault of their own  are in no way helpful  Just entering the building is the most stressful thing  I generally enjoy Airbnb experiences  but I have now learned my lesson to only do Airbnb from actual individual owners and not these ill named corporations who run Airbnb properties  What an embrasement for Airbnb   First of all  do not book this  But if you do  do not follow any instructions they send you about getting into the place  Even if you call them and ask them to clarify because you read the reviews about it being hard to get in  it wont matter  They will say its easy to get in  They will say instructions are forthcoming  And you believe them because  what self respecting company gets multiple reviews saying theyve made it difficult to get into the building without remedying the situation  But Im not entirely convinced that anyone at ZenCity visits this apartment to know how to actually enter the building  On the keypad  you need to dial your apartment number in the directory  not the other number they give you  From there  the code they send you MAY work  IF you get in that way  they then recommend you walk around a desk and through a mailroom to find a key fob at a kiosk that does not exist  Meanwhile  the elevator to get you upstairs only stays unlocked for you for about two minutes  So while youre looking for the unicorn key kiosk  you get blocked from getting up the elevator  Fortunately  if you get there before the leasing office closes  the kind worker  who is embarrassed to have ZenCity in their building  offers to let you up the elevator to the apartment but is  of course  unable to provide access to the apartment  So you will stand there with all of your things while you wait for  Zen City to answer the phone and feign shock that you cannot get into their place  saying   We at ZenCity are not known for this   all while providing no real solutions  When they finally found a code to get us in the room  we asked how we would get back into the building  and they suggested we wait outside for someone from the  front desk  to let us in  This is NOT true  The desk  like the kiosk  is fake news  And how is that a solution for trying to re enter a building at midnight in downtown KC anyway  Why would they find this an acceptable solution regardless  Were supposed to just HOPE someone arrives and lets us into the building  No  Fortunately  we found a place to stay  The actual apartment is small with water dripping from the toilet  Its otherwise modest but cute I guess  and absolutely NOT WORTH IT  I dont know who you are reading this much of my review  but I do know that you  lovely human  deserve much much better  I suggest you send someone to the building to actually create instructions on how to get into the building and rooms  NOTHING about your instructions to enter the building are correct 
463040001050591517,There is no Key fob  The system used to get into the building using the access code does not function  Security guards were very helpful by letting me in  but they are only there from  pm  am  There is no Key fob  The system used to get into the building using the access code does not function  Security guards were very helpful by letting me in  but they are only there from  pm  am 
460815438100917922,We enjoyed the location and feel of the apartment  The check in process was easy  Our only discontent was the internet service  which was either slow or non existent  However  it appears the internet service was a building issue and not from the owner  The apartment does a have sound device which monitors noise level  Overall  we would stay here again    The internet was either not working or extremely slow throughout our stay  Also  some of the electrical plugs are not working both in the bedrooms and kitchen  We took our two year old and he tends to cry  this would trigger the sound device in the hallway  Maybe let future guests know of the sound device and how it can be triggered with a kids cry  Otherwise  we enjoyed our stay  thank you 
452823575738852874,Decent space that is very well furnished and thoughtfully stocked with all the essentials and more  Clean space with plenty of towels  soap  kitchenware  a moderate sized TV  and a desk  Building overall has nice decor and feel  Parking can be a challenge on busier nights   The building is undergoing construction on the floor the unit is on which was not mentioned  Check in instructions were clear  but did not work either time I entered the building and had to rely on security to let me in  No problem getting into the unit itself though  A keyfob was mentioned  but was not found in the unit which made it even more difficult to re enter  Pictures shown are not the exact unit  but pretty much the same in most respects  no dining table  but has a desk instead   Lamps near the beside very finicky  For the price  it fits the bill but more can be done to help improve the experience 
516009695408017395,Nice lodging for a night away  Its right down the street from a fire department though  so siren noise is an issue at night 
458704895811733293,Wasn t what we expected but we enjoyed our stay 
476723842072555184,The apartment is very clean and comfortable  A little trouble checking in but made one call and it was fixed  Great location  Phenomenal gym  Love this place  Super nice building  super nice apartment  love the gym and location 
747138160,This is a nice place to stay for a single person or a couple  Its cozy with just about everything you need  with good walkable proximity to P L  Thanks again for hosting me  It was a pleasant stay 
746382085,This spot is walkable to dozens of amazing spots  The parking spot that was included made it easy to zip around town to explore other neighborhoods too  Wonderful location 
500732076051207881,The place was amazing  clean and bigger than expected the location was great we had everything we needed in there the host was amazing as well quick communication we enjoyed our visit and would definitely be back the next time we are in St  Louis  You will not be disappointed   Thank you for allowing me to stay in your beautiful home during my visit

746661594,Great location  very clean  and a good value 
746605350,Highly recommend  Very modern and cozy 
746591910,Very spacious  clean  surprisingly quiet for being close to busy street  kitchen is stocked very well  bed was super comfy and looove the decor  Only complaint is strong smell of neighbors cooking through vents but maybe I am not use to large apartment buildings    Anywah I recommends this stay  Thanks 
746441178,Great location  but missing some standard items to include access FOB  pots or a kettle  etc  Overall good stay  Some inaccuracies  but overall good stay  Missing some standard items  to include access FOB  two wine glasses  pot or kettle  etc  After initial messages  no response when requesting additional details about key FOB location 
458685908028898654,This apartment is spacious  simple and modern  The building is full of professionals and there is a friendly  attentive door person who knows everyone  The neighborhood is safe and walkable  There are restaurants and shops in one direction  the beautiful Forest Park in the other   My only issue was the all night traffic noise on King s Highway  Overall  a very good experience  I really appreciated this apartment for a lot of reasons  I would only say that you should mention the amazing noise level on Kings Highway  or provide ear plugs  Also  you have a French press but no tea kettle  I made it work but thought you d want to know 
528211533529516384,Can t go wrong with this listening  FANTASTIC Thank you so much for a great stay  Will absolutely use Zencity again  Apartment was great and communication was fantastic 
745073728,Nice location  building and very clean  It was also easy to find parking   However  there were a few issues      When booking  the inquiry was weird  I felt like it was invasive  I have NEVER had that with booking an Airbnb and I like my personal business to stay personal  However  there were a lot of questions asked  I don t think it should matter where I live or why I m coming to Kansas City       The apartment had a smell  Not a big deal though      There was only one large towel provided  There were two of us and I put that when I made the reservation  so I m not sure what happened there      Check in was annoying  I wasn t provided instructions until after my check in time  In fact  I requested it at       I was told to wait at       which was my check in time  and not provided the instructions until       I don t care how petty it is but I want my   minutes back that I paid for  Seemed rude and it was not good customer service       This is something I do not blame the host for  but the couple in the apartment next to us fought from literally      am to      am  It woke me up and I couldn t sleep  so I ended up changing my early flight   Overall it was ok  but the customer service sucks  It made me feel uncomfortable  If I wasn t in town for a last minute emergency  I would have booked something else 
460138667349307754,You get what you pay for here and the prior reviews regarding the check in and the call box are correct  I had to tailgate in the building as the call box does not work as given by the instructions  The area is nearby mostly hotels in the area and office building but a shot walk away from the touristy spots 
744328954,The place appeared   smelled unclean  with the hallway having a strong cigarette smoke musty odor  I couldn t even walk barefoot in the place or else my feet would get dirty  Also  responses from host were slow  As for pros  the area was convenient   nestled in a hip cute area near parks  Also  the bed was comfortable  Would I stay here long term  No  A few days was the most I could do  Entire place looked   smelt unclean  Floors were dirty   I couldn t even walk around barefoot without my feet getting dirty 
460807462801271095,Apartment itself was nice and clean  the communication was good in the beginning  We got responses back within an hour or so  However that changed Once we got to the property  Getting in the building was very difficult and someone who lives there actually let us in the building  We had talked to the security in the building for help  He told us that the intercoms do not work and that we ll need a key fob to get in and out of the building as well as the elevator  The security was able to let us up the elevator  When we got to the unit  the key fob was no where to be found  We immediately contacted zencity and they told me that someone will deliver the key fob ASAP  We waited around for   hours for the key until we absolutely had to leave for our dinner reservation  Again  when we got back  we had to explain the whole situation to the security again so he can let us up the elevator  That night  we received a message saying that the property manager did not have an extra key fob so they will not be able to provide one for our entire stay  On Sunday  we got back to the property and asked the security to let us up the elevator  The security told us that they can not do that anymore because of the protocol  We were scared that we will not even be able to get our stuff from the unit much less staying another night  We ended up having to sneak in with someone to get to the unit  We packed up our stuff and got a hotel room for the rest of the night because it was too stressful and scary that we do not know if we will be able to get back in the unit after leaving  So this might be something you might want to consider before renting through them  They also took     hours to respond back to my request or questions after the check in 
744121788,Highly recommend

457882702494229924,A beautiful apartment in one of Chicago s best neighborhoods  This apartment is steps from both Lake Michigan and the Museum of Science and Industry  An easy walk to both UChicago and the great restaurants and shopping that Hyde Park provides  My family of   spent a week here with plenty of room to relax  I will certainly return  Thank you for the opportunity to stay with you  My son is going to UChicago  so I will be back many times  I would have loved to have given the apartment nothing but   stars  but the flies became so bad on the last two days that they were able to get into the refrigerator and the cabinets so we tried to stay away  I know this was a building issue  with something foul being in that corridor closet next to the apartment s front door we messaged about  but I don t think it was ever fixed even though both the zencity team and I communicated with the building folks  Anyway  truly a lovely apartment in a great location  I m sure I ll be back 
509459470718267224,The front door entry pad was malfunctioning and broke   We had to be let in by others in the building   Later the door  was propped open   I had to enter the code to retrieve the key three times before it unlocked   There was no extra blankets in the room   There was so much hair in the bath tub drain you couldn t close the drain   The smoke detector looked to be held together by duct tape   The whole fifth floor stank terribly   It was like dead fish   The only relief was to get in the room close the door and spray the room with freshener   The room temperature was set at    and was not able to be changed without a code   That code was never given to us  The front door entry pad was malfunctioning and broke   We had to be let in by others in the building   Later the door  was propped open   I had to enter the code to retrieve the key three times before it unlocked   There was no extra blankets in the room   There was so much hair in the bath tub drain you couldn t close the drain   The smoke detector looked to be held together by duct tape   The whole fifth floor stank terribly   It was like dead fish   The only relief was to get in the room close the door and spray the room with freshener 
494223223327944650,Great location  clean apartment  well appointed  Street parking only unless you choose to use a nearby pay lot  I never did  and I had no issues  especially on the Euclid side   Minor issue with the entry code when I arrived  but it got handled relatively quickly  I did an issue that  for me  was major  I wasn t to get WiFi until the end of the last evening  and what I got wasn t a good connection  To be clear  the TV always had connectivity  I needed a straight connection for my work computer  and wasn t able to get that until my stay was essentially done  So if you re traveling for work  or need to work while you re traveling  get that issue handled as soon as you arrive  The staff were always very nice and polite  and usually responded quite quickly  Overall  it s a great spot  but the connectivity issue caused me a major headache  The obvious reason why I didn t give the stay five stars was the issues the password issues with the entrance and the WiFi  If the weather would have been worse  the issue with the front door access code could have been a dealbreaker  The WiFi issue burned a ridiculous amount of my time  and also prevented me from working in the apartment  Now I face a backlog of work that I have to clear out this weekend when I should be spending time with my family  So please remember  connectivity in a space carries significant importance for many reasons  not just entertainment  Otherwise  the only issues were minor     The standing lamp next to the television has no functional on off switch  the foot switch on the floor is broken   So the only way to turn that light off is to unplug it from the extension cord bundle  which  when I did  often causes the TV to come unplugged  as did plugging unplugging my computer power supply   Not sure if it s a building code issue or a budget choice  but it seems like there must be a better solution    The electric kettle threw the GFCI safety fault outlet breaker in the kitchen  Could have been anything  and once I reset the button it was fine  but thought you should know    The dryer vent duct tube came apart at the dryer connection  I put it back on two or three times before it finally stayed   You do get major points for always following up  even if the follow ups weren t effective  I do thank you for a clean and secure stay  However  my words don t reflect the level of my frustration the WiFi situation generated  and the real world cost of the lost productivity far exceeds the value of the stay 
743831519,Lovely place in a phenomenal location  Has all the essentials that you need  I enjoyed myself so much and I WILL be returning  Cant wait  Thank you  Place was amazing 
743701866,Full information on how to get in the building Would I be able to get my money back really disappointing that wasn t able to check in had to leave the same night because of money wise was short and didn t have any money left or didn t get my money back to find a place to stay  Waited for a response didn t get nothing it s really upsetting Wasn t able to go in Wasn t able to check in front desk didn t let us in at all saying we wasn t suppose to be there Didn t stay the night and wasn t able to get my money did cancel and everything I m really disappointed wasted my money and didn t have a place to stay the night so left home that same night

505810293586017482,Great location for the CWE  Within walking distance to Whole Foods and restaurants in the neighborhood  Location was great  but the cleanliness of the apartment and apartment complex was a concern 
743614893,The property is beautiful  HOWEVER  the looks are deceiving  Everything is either cheap or not worth the amount of money you pay  For starters  the description states they ll provide toilet paper and I wrote them once we ran out  I looked because I m thinking it was more in stock  no response until LATER the next day questioning me but never sending someone up  SO I WENT TO BUY SOME  The bed is hard and uncomfortable  The couch had a weird smell  In my younger days of college I would not make a review but I paid      to stay and I m not a happy camper  I m a physical therapist and just wanted to relax and get away from Chicago and even though it was beautiful  it wasn t worth the money  The residence weren t friendly  I know  they don t have to be BUT DANG  a wave rather than looking because they don t know who you are   I had many problems throughout my stay and the response time said   hour and I wouldn t get a response until the next day     hours   The property is beautiful  HOWEVER  the looks are deceiving  Everything is either cheap or not worth the amount of money you pay  For starters  the description states they ll provide toilet paper and I wrote them once we ran out  I looked because I m thinking it was more in stock  no response until LATER the next day questioning me but never sending someone up  SO I WENT TO BUY SOME  The bed is hard and uncomfortable  The couch had a weird smell  In my younger days of college I would not make a review but I paid      to stay and I m not a happy camper  I m a physical therapist and just wanted to relax and get away from Chicago and even though it was beautiful  it wasn t worth the money 
743582699,Very nice  clean  spacious  bd apartment  Fully outfitted  Close to lots of stuff  closed  unfortunately  but still convenient   The other tenants I met in the elevator were very friendly 
743307110,Stylish and spacious ground level studio  right across from the plaza  Check in was a breeze  would stay again  Just would note  a coffee maker and any kind of coffee facilities was missing  but listed on the listing  Might want to refresh that  but otherwise an absolutely great stay   
478229991624837333,We have used Zens more than once   Zen communicate very well  and quickly  The studio was clean and always easy for check in   Rent with Zen is always a good place Just a reminder    The keyless lock doesnt  work    maybe just a battery  but we left today with the apartment  unlocked
494149486237693093,Right next to the hospital   Easy to get in and out   Will stay at again if in the area  Thank you for everything  was a perfect stay 
743537893,This was a great place to stay  Exactly as described  No issues and very easy to access  We may be back  We will be using this one again  
743286000,This room has amazing views  Wow  Very secure building that includes a restaurant bar  Location is close to the plaza and other great restaurants  The tv is an Amazon tv without a fire stick  so bring an hdmi cable to connect a laptop if you want to watch tv  The bed is a memory foam mattress  warning for my big people  It flattens to a slice of bread pretty quickly  Thank you so much for letting us stay in your property  It is a beautiful room with amazing views    Please let us know when the canary roof top bar opens up  we would love to book another visit at that time    We could never get the tv to work as there was no fire stick  Next time  would it be possible to receive instructions for the tv    Thank you  Instructions told us to turn left and go up a ramp  leaving us stuck and confused attempting to operate an elevator we didn t have access to for a half hour  Later found out our room was on the other side of the building  had needed to turn right   I was also given an access code that didn t work for check in  and wasn t given a new one that would work with check out  Needed to call customer service to handle both  When I had issues with check in  they responded quickly  After that  I did not receive a response  It may be cheaper to book directly through the Netherlands Hotel 
493477500949152498,Those staff who had contact with me through the chat and phone call were nice and had good communications   But the door stuff at the Parc Frontenac Apartments had so bad communication issue   She just kept ignoring me  and I was not able to get in my room  That was the worst customer service ever I had experienced  After I called the call service  I could have a room at different apartment after about an hour from I got there  Never book with them 
540558878548776749,Perfect location  everything is close from restaurants to shops   Big apartment with a personal touch inside  Great place  thank you
493463037973053599,Awesome place    tons of room  has everything you need  The beds are very comfy  and the Roku TV is a nice touch  You cant beat the location  and it has some awesome views  We ended up checking out both the STL library and the veterans memorial across the street from us  neither of which were originally on our itinerary   Also  coffee options  the unit includes a kettle  coffee grinder  and french press to make coffee  Theres also a coffee shop art gallery less than a block away  Thanks for a great experience    we had a blast exploring St  Louis   I wanted to share a few things that could use some maintenance that may not be obvious on a quick walkthrough     the oven light is stuck on    the water pressure in the master shower is almost nonexistent  water pressure in the other shower was fine though    theres a gap in the laminate flooring outside the master bedroom    burnt out light in the fixture above the master bath sink   Also    the checkout process is a bit obtuse when you have a car parked in the ramp  You need the keycard to get out  so you then have to park your car and run back up to the apartment to put the keys on the counter 
743182855,Excellent location  clean apartment  Be warned  free parking is not actually included and its     per day to park in the closest garage  Free parking was not included Free parking was not included
743136489,Nice stay Couldnt find the fob on check  in
743109061,Although the location was great  finding off street parking was a pain  We could not access the floor unless we had a key fob which was difficult and we wouldn t have been able to access it via elevator if someone else hadn t helped us  The bathroom and towels were not clean  hair on floor  toilet  and towels   On top of all this  the smoke alarm began beeping Friday night in the middle of the night due to low batteries  Out of frustration  I messaged the company and never heard back from them  Overall  we would not recommend this place to others 
742739512,The apartment was clean and well located  but none of the doors locked and the outer doors were propped open when we came in  The host failed to respond to these concerns  The apartment was also incredibly loud  the neighbors were playing music until   am and we did not sleep at all I do not recommend  It is not acceptable to stop responding when a guest tells you they feel unsafe because none of the locks work no locks  unsafe stopped responding when i reported a concern
742673015,As a third party vendor with so many reviews  I would have thought the experience would be a lot smoother  Not having a key fob was extremely inconsiderate and made entering and exiting the building very difficult especially elevators  At first  I acknowledged maybe it was a small mistake and someone will surely drop one off the following morning  yet that never happened  I shouldn t need to remind you of that  Then  I met another couple complaining of the same exact situation with their stay  That someone would  try  to deliver their key fob and never did  The most uncomfortable is the fact that the entire apartment smelled like cigarette smoke  First exposure was strong  and we figured it would go away  For   whole days each time we entered and exited the smell never went away and was consistently strong  That makes no sense for an apartment that says  no smoking allowed   If we are being charged a clean fee  things like that should be triple checked to ensure guests are comfortable in their stay specially since there s no ventilation  All my belongings still smell like smoke and that s gross  Also  many of the light switches did not work  At first I didn t care until I compared the listing photos with the unit we got and realized it was different  hence why the natural lighting wasn t strong  So the combination of the important light switches not working made the apartment very dark and gloomy for no reason  Poor lighting  Horrific smoke smell No key fob Very very poor lighting  only     light switches worked out of the many available  The place smelled like smoke the entire time  and inaccurate descriptions in terms of utilizing a key fob  NO KEY FOB       I messaged them immediately to which they kept asking for photos as if I d lie about that  In the end  they stated someone will try to drop it off tomorrow and they never did  Even saw another tenant in the elevator complaining about the same issue of not having a key fob  This made going in and out of the building such a hassle and wasted lots of time  After inquiring about not having a key fob  they stated someone will drop it off the next day to which no one ever did throughout our whole stay  Never mentioned it even after check out  I had to bring it up at check out since they instead reminded me about the      fee if the key fob was not left in correct place  when we never even got one  which shows they never even kept record of it  For the amount paid  relative to other airbnbs that I had the option to rent out  it didn t seem fair  The inaccurate description in terms of the exact room  wasn t same as photos   very poor lighting  and it being a  no smoking  room but smelled like COMPLETE smoke  Every time we entered the place  the stench would hit you immediately and never went away despite trying to air it out  Now that I m back home  my entire luggage and belongings smell like cigarettes which is ironic as one of the key rules is to not smoke ever  This really really bothered me  There was no ventilation in the bathroom either so the smell would linger constantly 
742420519,The place was perfect  The place had everything i needed and more   I could not have asked for a better place to stay  I will be staying here again  I will be staying again in the near future  I loved the place
764303736,Charming spot in beautiful Hyde park  Close to Nelson Atkins and a quick drive to Q   for delicious BBQ  Great kitchen for cooking  Slawik is very responsive to your needs  Definitely recommend  Thx for a delightful stay  Appreciate the chef recommendation even if it didn t work out  Next time 
402908132050695404,This house and host were great  Very clean house  very comfortable  all the necessities and then some  Very good communication when i had questions  I would highly recommend staying here  Thank you very much for a quality stay for me and my family 
515895323665115023,Super convenient
491347673579030122,This is a great loft style apartment right downtown  There is street parking for a very reasonable rate  use the ParkMobile app so you dont have to run downstairs to change meter   Getting in and out is super easy and STL downtown is actually really vibrant and fun    so theres plenty of food  groceries  etc  nearby  Bed was super comfy  Thanks so much  We had a great stay  A few things that would make it better    Couch is not very comfortable    it tips you forward when you try to sit on it    There were a ton of water marks on the wall to the left of the sink  When you use contractor beige  it shows everything  Might suggest a coat of semi gloss in the bathroom to prevent it from looking dirty 
742379858,Clean  Great location  Very nice apartment  Would definitely recommend 
742377578,Wonderful place to stay  I tried to speak with someone because I mistakingly added dates that I didnt need  No help  as I paid for nights I didnt need
742366499,Right next to the plaza so the perfect place to stay if you re ready for a shopping day  Pretty good restaurants nearby as well  I felt safe here as well  Overall a great stay 
742362678,This place was great  Comfortable bed  Peaceful  Right in the heart of city  The instructions for entry didn t match  Could have been more clear about the parking as well  Also internet login was not accurate
742179728,Overall a great place to stay Very quiet and very clean
515937856228485783,Amazing stay  Never disappointed 
469554306686241309,As advertised
454330797967794481,We enjoyed our stay very much  Location is excellent and the building staff is friendly and helpful  We stayed    days and found on street parking no further than a block and a half away each night  which wasn t bad at all   The building has luggage carts and grocery carts which made things easy  Bring your own spices if you cook  Also only a French press for coffee was available  Not my first choice  We brought Clorox wipes and felt better having done so for a quick freshen up  Overall  pretty satisfied  Hi there  We really enjoyed our stay   A couple of suggestions I think would improve overall  are to have a better clean crew  There was hair on the shower wall and on towel rack  The bathroom inside door had not been clean in a while as there was visible dirt  Also the stove wasn t clean of grease and crumbs  I brought my own Clorox wipes and am glad I did as they were much needed  I would also add an inexpensive Coffee maker other than the French press that requires a specific bean texture   Thankfully I had one at my sons house that we brought over  Also better pots and pans would have been greatly appreciated   The ones in the unit are ready for the trash  A cheese grater would have been nice  I cooked  as we stayed    days   I appreciated having enough toilet tissue and paper towel   I hope this helps 
741186161,This place was really nice and the location was prime    The apartment has everything I needed and was pretty clean throughout    There s a night club across the street if you re looking to get out and a nice restaurant on the bottom of the building   Overall I would stay here again  I had no problems 
490617890300016875,Overall  this was a very clean apartment and nice experience  The could and bed were comfy  which is less and less common for airbnbs  The TV was large and it was also great to have a desk to work on  Also  communication was good  However  a few things to note before staying here  First  hopefully the managers improve replace some blinds that were missing  The apartment has great natural sun  which is ideal during the day  but very aggressive in the morning  Blinds plus curtains are needed   Or at least a full set of blinds    Second  the parking garage is a   minute walk away from the building and very few people walk around this area  so be careful if youre walking alone and dragging a bunch of luggage  as you would in any city    Third  the apartment itself is simple and very clean  but the building has an institutional feel once you get past the main floor  which was renovated and showcased in photos  They tried to paint the cement walls in the hallway yellow to brighten things  but I dont think it matches the modern feel of the the photos  And like many newer airbnbs  there was not any coffee  tea  snacks  etc   Overall  I was a little disappointed by how much I spent on this place given its lack of walkability  few nearby shops or attractions  lack of people walking in the neighborhood  seriously  where are the people    and kinda dingy cold feel in the hallways of the building  but if you just need a place to stay that is comfortable and very clean for a lower price  this could be okay  Thank you for excellent communication and a clean apartment  And especially the comfortable bed  which is less and less common for airbnbs  A few hiccups were that the wifi password on the chalk board didnt work and it took us a while to sort out with management   Additionally  the blinds were not sufficient at all and some were even missing  so there was no way at all to block out the very strong morning sun  Im an early riser  but it would have been nice to sleep past      on the weekend   Also  the showerhead was sticking out of the wall really awkwardly  it didnt bother us  but just FYI that it likely needs repair  Also  it should be clearer that the parking garage was a couple blocks away  I arrived late and did not feel comfortable dragging my luggage alone in the dark in a very  very lightly trafficked area 
490576691776768107,Thank you for the great stay   It was a last minute booking that came in very clutch due to location and us being tourist of the city  I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting the St  Louis area 
741980986,No salt and pepper or oil  Clean place  host never responded to our messages 
741966501,Cute apartment  great location 
490553743803563787,Great location  comfortable accomodations  We loved the unit and its location in the CWE  the beds were super comfy  too  We were disappointed that the furnace situation was not resolved and surprised that your suggestion was simply to use a blanket  Im fairly sure that if the AC wasnt working in July  you would be more attentive to your customers needs  The kitchen sink and the bathroom sink in the bath facing west drain very slowly  and the garbage disposal doesnt work  Im not not sure if this is a non smoking unit  but unit has a lingering smell of smoke 
450668518412713081,Great place easy check in
741923953,Do not spend your money here  Very unclean and disappointing 
741923798,This place was very nice  I would definitely stay again  I really loved the modern vibe throughout  It was lovely  Thanks for a great stay and I look forward to near future stays 
741792018,Great place to stay and relax 
741791448,They need to update their pictures  most people would not stay here if the pictures were updated  Missing pieces to the sliding front door  looks like they tried to patch some holes and it looks terrible  For towels there was a dish hand towel  it was just weird  Sheets balled up in the bedroom closet  they didn t even attempt to make it presentable    I m giving   stars because it was a semi convenient location  The building itself is awful  my boyfriend and I couldn t sleep AT ALL  The walls are like paper and the surrounding neighbors are loud  they re doing construction work next door  so I would advise you stay somewhere else or a hotel  They need to update their pictures  most people would not stay there if the pictures were updated  Missing pieces to the sliding front door  looks like they tried to patch some holes and it looks terrible  For towels there was a dish hand towel  it was just weird  Sheets balled up in the bedroom closet  they didn t even attempt to make it presentable  Okay  so I m giving   stars because it was a semi convenient location  The building itself is awful  my boyfriend and I couldn t sleep AT ALL  The walls are like paper and the surrounding neighbors are loud  they re doing construction work next door  so I would advise you stay somewhere else or a hotel 
543545359706713615,Great place to stay
408606273210231683,We enjoyed our stay at the house  It was clean and well furnished  It was perfect for our family  The location was central for us and worked great  We loved the house  Location was good  Loved the history  The door to the bathroom on the second floor is really hard to close  it scrapes the floor  Not a big deal but thought you might want to know   Our only issue was that there was a mouse that was running around the kitchen  It looked like it was living under the sink  We tried to catch it with mouse traps  but we failed 
490536780738200450,Overall not a bad experience  Location is nice and basic housekeeping was in order   There were some bigger issues though that made it difficult to enjoy the space    The heating system may need to be repaired or replaced  The temp was stuck in the low   s the whole time and it was very uncomfortable with the outside temps dropping   The security was not good  front door call box was broken so we had to find a way into the building  Many of the exterior locks were broken    Communication by phone and messaging was fine but there was no on the ground response  at least no one came to address the issues we were having  even after asking 
489816862459268747,The room was very nice and the view was amazing  Great location  lots of things to do within a walking distance or short drive  Check in was kind of difficult when it came to locating the right building  but we eventually got in  Didn t get an answer first time calling but did eventually and was offered useful assistance   Shower was cold for about    minutes but did warm up soon enough  Check in was really difficult  we couldn t seem to locate the right building  instructions weren t very clear on that part  The shower also took about    minutes to warm up slightly  We loved the room itself  It was very nice and cozy 
741769679,Great value  Chic place  The Check in process was a debacle  and the key box was broken  I stood out side for over an hour trying to resolve and the other tenants were trying to help as well  Sometimes life just happens not zen city s fault   
741598495,In a quiet and peaceful part of town  Wonderful coffee shop close by  Host responded quick and place was clean and decorated nicely  Good place to stay in a safe neighborhood  Thanks to the host for quick responses and having this Airbnb ready for us 
741598288,Lovely place and great location 
465945114331106933,Great location in Central West End  very spacious  clean  and comfortable  Just make sure to bring a mask in case you run into  cloth  mask Nazis  Overall great experience  Was disappointed about delayed checkin and communication lapse  and rooftop was closed 
477556853340460583,Great spot  close to the park and the hospital  The A C unit could use a good clean though Great apartment but the A C was gross  It needs a good clean  I didnt want to turn it on at all because of how gross it looked  I liked the way the key was given to me
468206299067421828,Buyer beware   They couldnt get me into the actual apartment via the intercom  which required me going to the apartment building leasing office upon arrival   Once I gained access to the apartment  there was no key fob to give me the opportunity to come and go   So I was literally stuck in the apartment   Zencity was not very responsive to myself or Airbnb in terms of resolving this  so at   PM I was forced to cancel and go a hotel in another part of town   Never again with anything Zencity 
741504147,Great location  In the middle of everything  Mildreds coffee across the street is marvelous  Indoor basketball court and gym was great  Just a few cleanliness notes for the unit       There was a large skillet that was not clean  Had egg on it  In addition  the pots and pans and other kitchen items were very haphazardly placed throughout the kitchen  Had to search for items rather than having them grouped together in logical spaces  Light fixture glass in kitchen was broken  Cutting board was broken  Replacement French press has a broken lid  Bathroom floor was untidy  living room floor had debris stuck to it  Appeared that the unit was not clean well  Flies were persistent out of the drain in second bath  Not mopped or vacuumed  Pots and pans dirty 
543526166941932405,I enjoyed the simple but modern clean room and kitchen  They did well preparing for a new guest  Thank you Zen City This os an awesome place to stay  I enjoyed the time relaxing at Zen City
477492600045367693,beautiful place    clean    in a great location
741244468,Location is spot on  Check in process is super easy  Place was really clean  but they could use new bed sheets  They didn t provide soap or shampoo  so bring your own  There s a nice bar on the first floor called Canary  so if you don t mind dropping     on a fancy drink  it s the perfect place  I had a really positive experience here  I wish y all would ve provided us with small hotel style shampoo and soap for the bathroom  Also  the sheets should probably be replaced  I wish the sheets cleaner  They appeared freshly laundered  but had a lot of lint and small hairs on them  Nothing too crazy  but slightly off putting 
741240519,The place was fine and it was as advertised  The check in and check out process was a disaster  Each part of the check in process had an issue  Our access codes did not work and we had nowhere to park  The host responded  but it was not very timely  We were told we d have a free parking space and did not get a parking pass until day    We had to find on street parking in the downtown area of a busy city and pay for it  The host reimbursed our parking expenses but it was very stressful and the last thing we wanted to spend our time and effort on  The checkout process was also confusing  We were told to leave our keys and pass with the front desk  however  there was no one there  Our issue did not get resolved until we had already left  There was nothing wrong with the actual apartment  but we will not be utilizing this host again  No part of our check in process worked  We weren t able to park where we needed to  our access codes didn t work  and we weren t presented with a parking pass  which was listed as a part of the package   Although the host responded  it was not very timely  Each issue we ran into took about       min to fix which made our check in process almost   hours  We didn t get a parking pass until the next day and had to find street parking  paid  until we got it  The host did reimburse parking expenses        but it was very stressful and not how we wanted to spend our time on vacation 
741233970,Pros  great view  great location  spacious  full kitchen  good security  modern furnishings and appliances Cons  sheets and towels were stained and we found hairs on them  no extra sheets as stated and host never provided any despite our messages  no k cups at the coffee maker which was downstairs BUT there was a grinder and french press in the room if you brought your own coffee I would recommend bleaching towels and bedding and having cleaners wear a hair net so that guests dont find hairs that arent their own    The couch was dirty  along with the bed sheets and towels 
476798263576535116,It was really clean and quiet  It was really clean and quiet
741102059,We enjoyed our stay with Zencity  great location for everything we wanted to do  I enjoyed my stay with Zencity  We just thought we would have liked more towels and the toilet stopped flashing but we were able to fix it  Thank you again for your hospitality 
740636537,Not a bad place to stay  Had trouble finding the room but company staff was accommodating
740533048,Did not receive full refund  Did not get to stay here  Could not get into building  Bad experience  Did not receive full refund  Did not get to stay here  Could not get into building  Bad experience

459333791297492130,Sparkling clean  Thank you
543459090401381870,It was a great experience and the staff at Zencity were responsive and accommodating 
515925199887256683, 
486924437698556847,The apartment is big and spacious with high ceilings and lots of natural light  Furnishings are new and comfortable  The apartment was clean and equipped with all the basics  The location is great  close to the convention center and other downtown destinations  The place was very comfortable  clean  and spacious   The kitchen was well equipped  Beds were very comfortable and there was a good number of hangers in the closets   The location was great for our weekend attending events at the convention center  My main two suggestions  the place needs a coat of paint to brighten it up  The furnishings were new and the kitchen and bathrooms seemed like relatively recent remodels  But the walls were a bit dingy and scraped and marked up  and in some places it just looked like primer was as far as the painters got years ago  Second main suggestion  a nine digit entry code on the door  Ive never stayed at a place that required more than   or   digits to enter the unit  Can easily memorize   or   digits  but not nine  That was a bit inconvenient   And then a minor suggestion  Would be nice to have a little power hub with USBs next to the beds and at the table or bar in the kitchen  Most of the places Ive stayed in had those  or lamps with USBs at the base 
500023650970845177,You don t have any privacy there isn t any curtains in the house downstairs so everybody going up and down the streets can see right in and the furniture is so outdated The furniture is very outdated and then you need to put some type of blinds or curtains up so people can see inside their isn t any privacy  There wasn t even a blind or curtain in the bathroom on the third floor why can t people have privacy if your so worried about people having a gathering where you have it open for people to watch maybe you need to take it off of Airbnb don t nobody want everybody looking at them what if someone wants to walk around naked then tell your cll lol eating service yo clean right the floor was sticky by the kitchen nook area I was just disappointed with not having any privacy
457225191673489025,This is an awesome room I ve booked with Zencity for all my stays in Kansas City  Although the room I was switched to was nice I wanted the original room I booked  The missing key really frustrated me
471018458743539800,The apartment is a spacious studio and very clean  Provisions like paper towels  dish soap etc  were well stocked and easy to find  The location is convenient to Hyde Park and to Lake Shore drive   We had no trouble finding street parking nearby in the evenings   Enjoyed our stay  I was very pleased with the apartment and everything was seamless  The a c blows on the head of the bed which made it hard to keep on while sleeping but otherwise great 
455059263134177471,Beautiful modern apartment  great view overlooking downtown Kansas City  Pictures shown are correct  Nice building  good security  several steps to get to the apartment upon arrival but clear instructions are provided  We would come back 
469483933745227692,Amazing suite  Great location  Would definitely stay here again Thank you for the stay 
457228231202790221,When I arrived a lot of things were broke the dishes in cabinet were dirty  No parking on site have to walk distances  But other than that everything else was fine
549233543365936024,Clean place   close to all attractions  Highly recommend 
501450546820456138,We loved this Airbnb   The location is everything  and the apartment is very nice  especially for the price    I was nervous about the check in process after reading prior reviews but it was easy breezy once we reached the security guard desk and received additional guidance  which wasn t needed but very helpful    Pro tip  security guard desk is located on level   and you will need to enter the building on level   via a request through the security intercom   If someone lets you into the building without you using the intercom  you must navigate up to level   via the escalator and you ll see the security desk   Stop there and ask for guidance to the key lockers in the garage  just tell them you are checking into your Airbnb    They will tell you exactly where to go and you ll have your keys within   mins   Ok  that s a wrap for the check in process   The apartment was very clean and larger than I anticipated   I had two other guests with me and there was plenty of space for all of us   During our stay  there was a slight issue with the water heater but as soon as I reached out to Zencity  they responded within    mins  sent a tech  and the issue was fixed within   hour     I did not have a car so no feedback on the parking situation   But like I said earlier  the location is everything   You can walk to the Power   Light District in about   mins  which I highly recommend    catch a train right outside the apartment building  or easily grab an Uber Lyft   you are in the middle of downtown and it s fantastic   Last but not least  I ve stayed in several dozens of Airbnb s and this Airbnb s checkout process was the easiest  hands down  Leave the key and fob in the apartment  somewhere visible  and be out by   am   no trash takeouts  starting laundry  nothing like that   it was nice   Thanks again Zencity   I will be back  We loved this Airbnb   the location is everything  and the apartment is very nice  especially for the price    I was nervous about the check in process after reading prior reviews but it was easy breezy once we reached the security guard desk and received additional guidance  which wasn t needed but very helpful    Pro tip  security guard desk is located on level   and you will need to enter the building on level   via a request through the security intercom   If someone lets you into the building without you using the intercom  you must navigate up to level   via the escalator and you ll see the security desk   Stop there and ask for guidance to the key lockers in the garage  just tell them you are checking into your Airbnb    They will tell you exactly where to go and you ll have your keys within   mins   Ok  that s a wrap for the check in process   The apartment was very clean and larger than I anticipated   I had two other guests with me and there was plenty of space for all of us   During our stay  there was a slight issue with the water heater but as soon as I reached out to Zencity  they responded within    mins  sent a tech  and the issue was fixed within   hour     I did not have a car so no feedback on the parking situation   But like I said earlier  the location is everything   You can walk to the Power   Light District in about   mins  which I highly recommend    catch a train right outside the apartment building  or easily grab an Uber Lyft   you are in the middle of downtown and it s fantastic   Last but not least  I ve stayed in several dozens of Airbnb s and this Airbnb s checkout process was the easiest  hands down  Leave the key and fob in the apartment  somewhere visible  and be out by   am   no trash takeouts  starting laundry  nothing like that   it was nice   Thanks again Zencity   I will be back

491318129599295382,I would not stay here alone  Homeless were sleeping on the main floor  lobby area   Entire building smelt of weed  Back door to building not secure  If you have issues checking in  host does not respond  I was having issues with the code to get in  no one responded at all  Very unsafe place  homeless sleeping in the lobby  back door always unlocked  Entire building smelt of weed 
490619350912575534,Great rental  very clean and plenty of room  Easily could fit   couples and or   children     adults  Pretty easy check in process and the building is fantastic  Amazing that parking is included which is probably the biggest pro as I drove in for a wedding that was walkable but wanted to drive to a few places  It was refreshing knowing my car was safe at night   Only negative was lack of response from Zencity Host  Thermostat was set at    degrees and it was locked so you could not manipulate it  Attempted to contact the host but never got a response so we had to address this by sleeping with windows open  while heat was running   Aside from that  absolutely amazing Airbnb to stay at in the heart of downtown St Louis Temperature was stuck on    degrees out entire stay  Attempted to contact host with no reply  Thermostat was locked  We had to keep windows open with heat on to get any relief at night
454990868595040230,Clean and easy to access place  Lots of parking options within a block or so  Close to shops and restaurants  Can be noisy during evening because the unit is on  st floor of a relatively busy street corner 
454366647853378089,Great place   Small  good for   people   Perfect if going to something at power and lights or t mobile center  The stay at the apartment was great  but we had trouble getting into the building following the instructions   The part where you put in the unit number to unlock the door and elevator did not work   If we wouldn t have been let in by someone  we would have never gotten in   Also  we came across   different people having the same issue during our stay 
532678496202213552,Great place to stay  The room was clean and had everything it was supposed to  and ready to go when I arrived  Parking is safe and convenient  available right next to the building  Check in was a bit confusing at first  only because there were a couple access codes I was given after reservation  and I wasn t sure which was to use for entry  However  I was able to quickly figure it out on my own so not a big deal and I didn t have to reach out for help  Communication was great and fast replying from the time I reserved to check out  Would stay here again     The check in was a bit confusing  only because there were many access codes and I wasn t sure exactly one to use even with the detailed instructions the wording for which code to use and when where was a bit complicated  However everything else was perfect    Thank you  Sincerely  Sarah Calufetti
536950344282807050,Wonderful place   you wont do better  Thank you for a lovely stay  Everything and more as advertised 
453633599222469320,First  I d like to say that the on call attendant did a fantastic job trying to help us as much as they could in the given situation  Thank you for being so patient and staying on the phone with us until you knew we were taken care of    Upon arrival  the directions to the call box on the side of the building were clear  But the call box did not work  We had to wait until someone that lived in the building to let us in  Which was great   However  the elevator needed a key fob to be activated  Which would have been solved by the intercom box working  activating the elevator  So we had to wait until someone was able to badge us up for the elevator  Then the rest of the directions worked flawlessly   Then we got to the room and there were no key fobs  I proceeded to call the help number and they answered on my first call  And immediately started to attempt to solve the issue  They weren t able to do anything in the moment but did say they d have someone drop of fobs for us to use in the morning  We never got any fob keys  I called the help number around midnight  They again answered on the first call  And stayed on the phone with me trying every solution we could think of  They made phone calls trying to find some way to help us remotely  We ended up making it to the room after about an hour of trying   The room itself was amazing  Perfect location and absolutely loved the amenities  I had a stove and pot to make my tea in the morning     Just have extra fobs printed off and communicate with the leasing office or maintenance for after hour check ins  Make sure the call box works and this would have been   stars  Please make sure you have extra key fobs printed  I know you can t help when people don t turn in their keys but plan for that  You re a business  You know these things happen 
543533691191871583,a decent place
477520688863638317,Excellent place to stay  great service Excellent place  great service
453624977586905850,Make sure to have a good  CLEAR line of communication  Need better communication  I wasnt able to even make it into the building or talk to someone who couldve helped 
472464627456457602,The place was old and not really comfortable for families 
511596261645203886,This is a great Airbnb  I loved my time there because it allowed me to get away from everything and enjoy my weekend  Hey guys  Thanks for working with me on short notice  Only thing I d note is that the apartment smelled like soy sauce   But it was great otherwise 
455764535495194434,Great place to stay and the pizza place downstairs is amazing
515969189491651541,Ok place the parking pass was missing the first day so struggled with wondering if I would get towed from parking in lot   They told me it was fine but still a nerve wrecking experience as I kept doing downstairs checking to make sure I was ok to park there   It was also cold in the home and the heat would not go past      needed a code for the thermostat to get any warmer   I also requested for late check out   hours early  They did not respond until    checkout saying they could not honor late checkout because other guest requested early check in   But what about your current guest that asked   hours ago   Poor communication and a big inconvenience as my flight was delayed  
478317661461371530,Great apartment in a great location at mid town KC  The design and the view are awesome  it was very comfortable and clean  Loved it  Great apartment in a great location at mid town  I loved the design  the facilities and the cleanliness of the apartment and the building  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is great  Enjoyed my stay very much  and will surely come back  Thank you so much 
515889448151538868,Great location  but faced internet connection issues all throughout the stay and did not get replies to couple of messages to the host  Other than that  the stay was great 
459445599492142388,Clean  easy to access  excellent location  Happy to have stayed there Excellent place  happy to have stayed there
459444196580192932,Not helpful to check in Customer care was not helpful
495699869595765628,Great location  Walking distance to lots of good food and drinks  The hallways are a bit confusing at first and the instructions don t mention going through to a gym area but once you find it it s not bad  My only complaint is that the apartment was NOT clean completely before we arrived  The living room rug had large French fries all over it and a bunch of hair on it  Pretty gross  Couch had some weird stains though they looked old  The walls have also seen better days   scuffs and scrapes   though on the whole this isn t really a problem  Just a  the more you look around  situation  The kitchen bathroom and bedroom seemed clean though  Main issue was the living room  Other than that it was a good spot in a great location I messaged you already about the gross carpet  but please take care of it for the next guest 
458624555060696796,Loved the location and the apartment was clean and tidy  It was a great stay  Overall it was a great location  clean stay and cute place  The only problem I encountered was getting to the building initially but after I had the keys it was super easy 
401411117547193099,We had a wonderful stay  Great location   Quiet neighborhood but close to lots of great things  Elm Cottage had all the amenities we needed  The host was very responsive even while traveling  This was a great place to stay  Loved staying at your place  I enjoy history so I really appreciate the info on your home transformation journey  We had everything we needed  and the location was great   My only suggestion is that the shower head be placed in a more permanent position  It moved around and we had to work to make sure water didn t get on the floor   Thanks 
515926273573994551,Nice price for the room we got  Accurate to the pictures and the room itself was clean and spacious  Only problem we had was we could get into the room fine  but we couldn t get into the building because the call box was broken  Customer service was no help  I messaged them many times and rarely got a response  Then when I finally called They said  well we ll put in a maintenance request for the door  but we can t help if the room key works  they basically said just go in when someone comes out  Which was a burden because that meant we just had to get lucky to get into the building  They said when they hear from their operational manager they d call me back but they never did  The problem never got resolved  Nice room or whatever but communication and the door really stopped us from really going out and enjoying the city bc I didn t know if we d be able to get back into the building  Give your guest a key card to get into the building instead of a code to call someone to open the door because I had no access into the building what so ever my entire stay  The only way I could get in was by luck if another resident was going in or out   Not a good experience at all
465225760890599282,Great location  Thank you very much for your room 
465215296738617848,Great place  great instructions  very clean 
539806984052474265,i loved the apartment and the view   
469482752842492462,Travel friendly  Easy check in  Private parking in a garage with your own spot Great location  loved having my own parking spot and not having to worry about that 
541318988818695379,Great place to stay  Quiet  private  and cozy  Thank you for hosting me  Place was great 
512382269734445889,I totally felt the Zen in Zencity  Cozy  Tidy  and just what   or   people would need for a getaway  As soon as I walked in I knew that the place was for me  Very reasonably priced and in a good location   I am a landlord and I take great pride in the apartments I rent  I appreciate the thought pattern that went into preparing this home away from home    Sign up for a stay snd you too can feel the Zen   I left an old fashion note on the counter to tell you how much I appreciated my stay  The place was so cozy  tidy  and perfect for my needs  I loved the color scheme and the lock system was super once I realized that you should pull the knob towards you when you hear the click of unlocked then turn and push   I also loved the location  I was able to take nice walks  The work chair in the living room was not comfortable past    minutes but I worked it out   My suggestions were    The faucet in the restroom was too far against the back that when I used the sink I wet the countertop  That shouldn t be     I would swing the bathroom door from right to left if it wasn t a code issue so that the towel rack is behind the door  This makes it possible to use the sink easy without having to close the door     Lastly  the place was kinda cold at times and I couldn t not adjust the heat      tv in the room would have been nice    
478936922277289310,You definitely get what you pay for   They did do a good job making it clean  
455727104926931990,My stay at Zencity s place was nice  Calm design feel  helpful front desk  great location and view of the park  Everything I needed was provided  The accommodations were functional and serene  Hi  Love the clean linens and the spare design  Front desk was very helpful  Unlock instructions could ve been clearer   There is no  lock  button on this version of the lock   after entering the code you need to press    The front desk knew  so it wasn t a huge issue  My mom has Airbnb s  so I want you to know I wouldn t make the next suggestion unless I felt strongly  The apartment itself  not linens  did not feel clean  Made the whole experience feel low value  and made me question if anything was clean  Took away from what was great  The carpet  speaks for itself   very different from the photos on Airbnb   kitchen  food spatters on wall  grease on hood   sofa pillows  stained  smell    windowsills  cobwebs stick on dirt   living room walls  scuffed   My suggestions  make sure kitchen counter living room window sills are completely clean  Mr  Clean magic eraser the walls  especially in the kitchen   get clean pillows for the sofa  and clean the carpet     is clean the carpet  Note  the sign by the door that says  x clean on this date to fill our obsessive standards  was not filled out 
439143992392770583,Great location  but the bed is uncomfortable  The gasket on the freezer needs to be replaced  The table in the kitchen needs to be a little smaller so   people can sit comfortably  The chair by the bed is broken and needs to be fixed or replaced  The bed was very uncomfortable  but I am not sure if it was a mattress or bed frame issue  Window blinds would be nice on the window near the bed  However  we did appreciate how quickly you all responded to all my messages  We were just disappointed that the room was not up to the standard that you all expected it to be at 
496440241245098574,Overall it was a great stay  Everything was very nice and clean  It was also close to power and light district 
453562196405186952,The check in process is a bit of a struggle   they didnt give me a code to put in the call box so I messaged them and didnt get a message back   I ended up just going inside and waited a few minutes until someone could help me get to my floor  once I got in my room and got my key card everything was good  the place was really clean and the bed was comfy too   its located in a good spot  overall  I enjoyed my stay The check in process is a bit of a struggle   they didnt give me a code to put in the call box so I messaged them and didnt get a message back   I ended up just going inside and waited a few minutes until someone could help me get to my floor  once I got in my room and got my key card everything was good  the place was really clean and the bed was comfy too   its located in a good spot  overall  I enjoyed my stay
455749560073925931,Loved it    Would definitely stay again  Loved the space very clean everything looked just like the picture would definitely book again  however it was pretty hot in the unit but eventually I got it together loved it 
495603621376929199,The  location of this place is really good   Walking distance to a beautiful park  bars  restaurants  groceries and pharmacy   Everything important in St Louis is at a short driving distance   The building is in a nice neighborhood   We felt safe all the time   Convenient and secure parking   Once inside the building it can be confusing to locate the unit    Now   be advised  this place is run by a corporation  not an actual host    They do have rules and processes that I consider big nuisances   For instance  you cant control the thermostat of the unit   If you want to change the temperature  you need to contact the company that controls it    Additionally  this company has some sort of automatic messaging system and we received multiple txt messages and Airbnb messages about excessive noise when we were not on property     So  in my case these are deal breakers   I will make sure next time I pick a place not run by a corporation but by an actual host with a human touch  This has been the weirdest experience at an Airbnb for me   I am planning on leaving a fair review but I am not going to comment on the cleanness of the place   This place needs a really good clean    The moment I step into this place I started sneezing   I  thought maybe someone near had a cat or something but right before leaving I opened the closet and saw the filter   I took pictures if you need them   The filter of this so called eco friendly place was not only clogged but had mold   The cherry on top   we also found an adult toy under the couch when we were checking to see if we packed everything   We left it there  I was not going to touch it    The thermostat issue and the unnecessary messages about noise were also not appreciated    Next time I will try to get a place not run by a corporation but by someone with a more human touch 
452117307942695422,This property should not be an option for anyone  The central air doesnt work and they expect that a portable air conditioner will cool the entire apartment unit  On top of that the smell of cigarette smoke is over powering  The finishing touches to this ordeal are the sub par maintenance and lack of cleanliness throughout  Please see past messages between myself and Zencity 
455733831262448844,This unit is extremely well located   close to lots of restaurants and bars  in walking distance to many things  Unfortunately  the key fob did not work for us so we were unable to come and go as we pleased as we could not get back into the building unless an actual tenant happened to come out and let us in  It made for a stressful trip and felt unsafe  Also unfortunately  the unit was not very clean     Other than the location  the two best parts were the rooftop hangout space  theres a hammock  grills  seating areas and a TV as well as hot tubs  So bring your suits   and the bed  This is probably the most comfortable bed and pillows Ive ever experienced at an AirBnb  Unfortunately  we did not enjoy our stay with Zencity  Here are a few reasons why   First major reason  The key fob we were given to enter the building DID NOT WORK  We could not get access INTO the building and had to rely on waiting for other people to come and go and hope they would let us in  I contacted this listing   times during our stay to see if someone could fix this emergency issue and I did not get a response  It impacted our ability to enjoy our trip and come and go as we pleased needed  It felt unsafe to not be able to access the premises when we needed to and I did not like having to rely on strangers to let me in   The unit was not very clean  No one marked the  Cleaned By  sign to indicate that it was clean before we arrived  There was toothpaste running down the front of the bathroom vanity and pooled on the floor  The living room rug and bedroom carpet were not vacuumed  The walls are HORRIBLY dinged up  scratched  and they look blotchy and filthy throughout the entire unit  It did not make us feel comfortable  clean  or like we were getting the value for what we paid  Also  the bathroom faucet barely hangs over the sink so water pools all over the counter  The faucet is lined with mold and mildew from the constant mess  And the apartment smelled bad   The light fixtures in the bedroom dont work  One was broken and the other one didnt even have a lightbulb in it   Someone elses clothes were still in the dryer   We could not adjust the temperature   There was no mention of the rooftop hot tub on the listing so we didnt bring our bathing suits  Such a disappointment 
451408141860641682,DO NOT STAY HERE     Impossible to get into the building and I was approached inside the entryway by a street person and had to decide whether I was gonna have to fight with my bags on me  The entry instructions DO NOT WORK  It was  am and after    minutes a security guard let me in and said he has to let ABB people in all of the time  When I got up to the apartment  it smelled horrible  I had no choice but to stay after the fight to get in  I had   nights booked but left the next morning  I doubt I will get a refund  Read the other reviews  I tried to be proactive after reading how it was impossible to get into the building  Only got canned answers with no way to contact Zencity except for the app  which they responded to hours and hours later only to ask   Do you still have a problem   This is not a safe place and whatever you do DO NOT STAY HERE  You need to not be on Air B B as your instructions and customer service are the worst 
538379923854886008,I checked in later in the evening and there was an issue getting my key and miscommunication about a temporary lock box for the keys  So that was frustrating but their communication to fix the issue was quick and they took care of it in a polite and timely manner  The apartment was awesome and clean and the amenities were amazing too  You guys did awesome  A heads up about the broken lock box would have been good beforehand  but everything after that was amazing  Good job guys 
511641468798876373,Amazing spot in St Louis  This is right in the heart of the CWE neighborhood with so many things within walking distance to take part in  The spot is very clean  quiet  and fits anyones needs for a getaway to enjoy St Louis  Great place  Have stayed in the CWE a few times before and this was by far the best spot in the area  Very easy to check in and out  really appreciate the hospitality and great space to stay in 
450706053743221931,Great quiet place to stay Thank you for all the great communication
450738206984084632,Easy contactless check in process and nice basic space  Wifi was slow if you plan on doing work streaming  tv apps struggled a bit and it was hard to have multiple devices online at the same time   Communication regarding check in could have been more prompt and clearer  We received notification we would be able to check in early  unprompted email saying our spot was not occupied and an extra day could be added for       We confirmed to check in early and tweaked our plans a bit  but then got a message saying it wasn t available  Even after being told we could potentially get in early and would receive a text  we didn t hear anything until the normal check in time   Obviously early check in is a bonus perk  but it was frustrating to be told we could  then get the opposite message  and then not even hear that the apartment would just be ready at the normal time and we should plan for that 
481154164728668757,The place was clean and well located  close to restaurants  bakeries   bars etc   We are one couple and It served our needs well  and would have also been fine with young kids  It would have been crowded for two couples  the rooms are all on the small side  The place suited our needs  but our stay could have been improved     The outer building door did not lock when latched     The stairwell was very dirty   probably had not been vacuumed in months    Apt door code was unnecessarily long    Bathroom could use with a couple of wall hooks to hang towels to dry after use    Nest thermostat should be programmed to allow users to turn the temp down at night   Too hot for sleeping 
450702907889113825,Place was nicely renovated and an incredible location   Great value   Unfortunately the check in system was not working  as other guests noted    It was unfortunate as I asked specifically about this and they insisted it was fine  it was not    Thankfully a tenant was coming in and let us in and scanned us up the elevator   But could have been a tough situation if they didn t come by   Hoping mgmt deals with that issue as otherwise the place was really nice  Sent note about check in process being broken 
481173727562305952,location is great 
513013653249401950,Slawik was easy to communicate with and always very helpful  The house was clean and in excellent location  We loved the little extra touches of fresh fruit on the kitchen counter and a little library in the master bedroom  We will stay in one of Slawiks locations when we travel to Kansas City  MO in the future  It was great to meet you as we left  Thank you for guiding us through the check in process and recommending places in the K C  area   I hope your family makes great memories in Branson 
459379444428277571,The place was clean and comfortable
455737256153792762,Super convenient location  Lots of great restaurants and bars within walking distance  The unit itself was clean and spacious 
459407663367640649,This is my second zencity stay and the first one was definitely a lot better than this one  It was okay but the shower wasn t the cleanest  They had a clean lady come out to clean up but i wasn t thrilled about the stay  However the building is really nice and in a nice location
515923092981038719,The place was real cute and good location but it wasn t clean at all  Pet hair was on the bed sheets  cobwebs in several corners and the floors were sticky  Within    minutes of being there one night I was told that I had the tv on too loud  Mind you it was  pm on a Saturday when quiet time began at   pm  Another weird interaction was that the host knocked on the door  waking us up  prior to our checkout time asking if we were leaving on time  I don t understand why that couldn t be a text or email  Beds had dog cat hair on the sheets  cobwebs in several corners  floors were sticky
491279177171364572,Spacious  close to everything  and a good value  Would recommend  Thank you so much for the stay  It was so roomy  One of the soap pumps needs a replacement  the one in the bathroom  but I think that was our biggest concern 
450672520528197862,I enjoyed the viewand easy access to restaurants and shops 
511660295922357505,Nice room  perfect size
450657092141655905,The host posted the wrong address on the website  I messaged them when we took off and they replied two hours after we arrived  I called customer service to tell them we were lost because of the wrong address and she hung up on me  What was suppose to the a    min drive turned into over an hour and cost      on Lyft  The microwave in the apartment was broken and the bathrooms were filthy  I messaged them and no one came out to fix it  Customer service is unacceptable  I will not be booking with them again  The only great thing was the location of the apartment and the views  Power and light district is pretty cool  Everything is in walking distance  The host posted the wrong address on the website  I messaged them when we took off and they replied two hours after we arrived  I called customer service to tell them we were lost because of the wrong address and she hung up on me  What was suppose to the a    min drive turned into over an hour and cost      on Lyft  The microwave in the apartment was broken and the bathrooms were filthy  I messaged them and no one came out to fix it  Customer service is unacceptable  I will not be booking with them again  The only great thing was the location of the apartment and the views  Power and light district is pretty cool  Everything is in walking distance 
511618079141001791,nice thank you it was great
460076244576809147,Great stay and easy check in check out  Great location and great apartment 
395609897458248835,Place is great just communicating with them is horrible  I tried to extend my stay and had until   am to pay for hours I was messaging and no response because they let someone else stay go thru at   am when I extended my stay at   pm the day before  Then they promised me another unit at the same rate but never responded or gave me the unit so I had to stay in my car and it was storming outside  Sucked but the place was nice parking was really bad wish there was parking had to pay for parking  I love the place but communication was really bad and I was not happy with way it was and how everything went when trying to extend my stay 
528230334954521694,Lovely place  so cozy and perfect foe my stay in chicago I love this place and my stay here  thank you for everything
544173182154468326,This place looks nice on paper but beware that I caught a huge rat on the premises  I also saw a second rat on the last night and heard the scratching in the walls throughout our stay  If you think that I m lying  I have pictures and videos to prove my case  Check in was delayed by a hour and I had to start online teaching in my car   Lastly  I was informed this less than an hour prior to checking in and it was a huge inconvenience  The place looks nice but a rat infestation  is more than enough to turn a nice place into a complete dump  I would hope that Zencity has eradicated these issues by now but I cannot recommend anyone staying here until they are fixed  Also  please process my full and complete refund  RATS RATS  Rats  I hope that you have called an exterminator because catching one but seeing   rats is too much for any guest  I don t want to mention the hearing rats scrape inside of the walls of this place  I would like a full refund for my trip due to this inconvenience    Sincerely   Christopher Davis
501432350991893986,It was clean and a good place to stay
450656638896999144,Great space  great location  Everything I wanted for the week   Im not sure if the walls are thin  but they take their noise complaints seriously  One of us staying at the apartment has a loud laugh and just talking and laughing before   pm got us multiple texts from the host 
470265949178001103,Great place to stay  Very clean  good location   Only negative were no amenities of any kind   no soap  no salt pepper  no coffee  etc provided  Told of the issue with the fob and it was not addressed promptly or fixed at all 
469513708991206627,Air conditioning not working  The apartment was    degrees when I got in  the wall thermostat was on set up cool but blowing hot air  Turned it off and turned on the unit  only cooled the living room  Needed a fan to sleep with 
450651763496105312,It was okay  Clean for the most part  Super roomy  You guys wanted to charge me for       Because apparently I smoked in the room  But I didn t it says you discovered it on Sunday  But I was still in the room Sunday so I don t understand where you found it on that day anyways  I don t smoke yet alone smoked in my room  I don t know how it got there  Or if it was even in there in first place due to y all saying you found it on Sunday   I checked out Monday  
450019326357404371,As expected  nice and clean  rather minimal overall   Nice central location 
449925604571215504,This apt looked just liked the pics  Great location gives you a real Chicago feel  Only thing is parking sucks    This place was great would def stay here again    I absolutely loved your place   
515970743135698961,Great location   nice view of the city  Just wish parking was better I had a good time   place was in a good location  Wish parking was better   But good place overall
470214233411732705,Great Aprt 
495656049499827577,Nice location  parking was okay    had to walk across the street  But was a nice stay  Thank you  Parking kinda sucked honestly    and the AC  on the wall  required a  passcode  so it was hot at night because the AC fan hanging out the window never could cool down the bedroom  And also the elevator didnt work the whole weekend except day one  Great stay besides all of that  Thanks again 
435435575782004888,If you want to be in the heart of Independence history  stay here   It is literally across from the Truman House   And don t miss the house of Truman s cousins which is on Delaware and is a nice little museum   This house is big and great for a family   I recommend it  We really appreciate being able to stay at this property   We had many great family moments    It was especially nice to have bedrooms for everyone and room to spread out   And great location     Christopher
449269061291182265,Great location  A very spacious place for multiple people to stay  Highly recommend  Thank you for the stay  One thing I didn t want to point out was a strange smell that would linger in the house after anyone took a shower  We opened window s and that helped but others might not be able to adjust  Besides that we had a great trip 
449909389781283606,This apartment is as pictured but be warned if you require a very clean space   It did not live up to our expectations in terms of cleanliness   It seems to be a heavily used unit and requires a deep clean   Even basic things like vacuuming were done poorly prior to our arrival    The neighborhood location is fantastic and the amenities in the building are nice   The keyless entry is also very convenient  This apartment is very dirty   Even the basic things like vacuuming and sweeping the floors was done poorly prior to our visit   We had to get out the vacuum first thing when we arrived because there were so many crumbs on the carpet    Aside from those basics  this apartment needs a deep clean   There is dirt piled up in every crack and crevice  the windows are filthy  etc   
449284315749931429,It was straight forward  clean  safe  great communication and had everything we needed      recommended  Thanks for everything  lovely stay 
449215571101661147,Such a wonderful stay  Thank you so much for a wonderful stay 
447826217293161776,Nice
447824773722739276,We had a great time staying here  The listing is beautiful and it s nice that there are two bedrooms and bathrooms  however  if there s more than two people staying here  the seating situation in the living room may be an issue  There s only a love seat for actual living room seating  We experienced an issue with one of the bathrooms having a moldy smell and when brought to the host s attention it was quickly addressed  Upon checking in we hadn t received check in instructions but when calling the host we were quickly able to reach someone and have instructions sent to us and get into the flat    The listing is close to downtown and at most a   minute walk to the blue line  very convenient  The street is very quiet while being close to downtown and the train  We felt safe and comfortable walking around and exploring  Free street parking is minimal and the street that the listing is on is permit parking  Definitely read the signs but we parked in a garage almost directly across the street from the apartment  through spot hero and left our car  which was nice knowing it was in a covered garage  That was an extra     charge for   days  which is not bad for parking in Chicago  Our host was responsive to concerns or questions that we had  Overall would definitely recommend for couples  or two travelers  Hi  The apartment is beautiful  However more comfortable seating in the living room would be nice  At the moment the listing would be best for couples or two travelers due to no seating for any additional people  Also  there seems to be a mold issue is the master bedroom bathroom  this would be easily addressed just bringing it to your attention 
447823305641771640,I enjoyed my stay here    I felt safe and it was comfy  Thank you for the stay  It was a very nice place    In the future  just please make sure not to approve people s requests for early check in when it isn t available   
470284601834947854,Great location and very comfortable accommodations  Difficulty with front door code but delivery man let us in
447730317555363465,Great location   very clean Very peaceful   great location
447048533184113433,Zencity lacked communication and sense of urgency when we arrived and couldn t get into our airbnb because the lock box wasn t working  A neighbor in passing had said that the girl the day before was having the same problem and couldn t get in which means that this had already been a problem that wasn t fixed before we got there  Waited outside for an hour messaging and calling and not getting replies  If it wasn t for a neighbor who lived in the building  we would have been outside for a lot longer  Once we got in  we couldn t leave because we didn t know if we could get back in which isn t cool  Had to wait another hour before they finally got someone out to the fix the problem  The place itself was okay  in a decent area with lots of stores and restaurants around  First time using Airbnb and I was disappointed by the customer service skills  There was lack of communication on Zencity s end  No one had reached out to me on how to check in until I messaged and waited a good    minutes before someone got back to me  The lock code was not working and a neighbor passing through had said he saw another girl that was struggling with the same problem the day before which means that Zencity was probably aware that this was a problem and didn t do anything about it before we had arrived  We waited outside for over an hour  We had just gotten off an   hour bus ride and really wanted to get to our Airbnb and relax and sitting outside added a lot of unnecessary stress  All while this was happening   I wasn t getting much in response to the messages between myself and zencity so I had to call several times with no success on getting in  The man that I spoke to every time was nice but also lacked communication  Said he would be in contact with us through zen city messages and I had to message him at least   times before I heard anything back  Didn t seem like anyone knew what was going on and I didn t feel like my boyfriend and I were being treated as a priority  If it wasn t for a neighbor who lived in the building  we would have been outside for a lot longer  Once we got in  we couldn t leave because we weren t sure if we could get back inside again and that was very inconvenient for us  We were upset that we were stuck and didn t feel like anyone wanted to help us  At one point  we had asked if could just get a different airbnb because we were so sick of waiting around and getting no answers  My boyfriend considered calling the people who owned the building to come and fix the problem since Zencity wasn t doing anything  Waited a total of       hours before they finally sent someone out to fix the lock box  The place itself was okay  under the bed that we slept in was super dirty and dusty and I found that out after I dropped one of my shirts down there and pulled it back out  Covered in dust bunnies and dirt  This was my first airbnb experience and it was not a great one  I think a partial refund is fair giving the circumstances we dealt with upon our arrival  It was really inconvenient and unprofessional to have us waiting outside and no one seeming to have any urgency 
445661317856461160,Fun location  checkin was hassle free and facility was nice and clean   Would recommend  This was well done  Thank you for an easy checkin and great time
544217128440602769,Great place to stay    Very nice and clean     
445636157337131517,Great location and price  Would stay here again Wasn t      clean but good price and location
445620006268073429,The apartment was clean and had essential amenities  Perfect for our weekend stay  Zencity was quick and easy to communicate with 
445589232197592949,It is a nice Airbnb   The rooms are very decent size with decent beds  The Airbnb is on the third floor so you do have to hike up quite a bit of steps  Was in a decent location near Humbolt Park   Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would consider coming back and using this Airbnb  Thank you for hosting us will definitely consider this place again in the future 
492757736573100400,Nice comfortable apartment  has everything you need  pictures online look the same in person  Great stay  comfortable cozy apartment  bathroom could improve had a bad smell 
445613273862530516,A clean and cozy condo with all of the amenities of home   The location is beside the train tracks  but the noise from the train did not negatively impact us in anyway   We sleep with a noise machine even at home and it helped mask the sound when the train went by  This condo is located in an ideal spot if you want to have easy access to Wrigley Field  Boystown  and all of the adjacent nightlife   It is also a very short walk east directly to Lake Michigan and the accessible biking and walking running paths   There are numerous food and drink options literally outside the gate to the condo   The host was communicative and professional and we would recommend this condo for any individual or couple who need a convenient and well kept place to call home while visiting Chicago 
445561921264579770,Nice place  no more than a   mins drive to the city main attractions  The apartment accommodates a couple very well and is fairly well furnished   Parking in the area is not hard but you may need to walk a little  but no more than   blocks   Its a good option if you want a nice place to stay while exploring the city 
444905737311993226,Awesome location and really nice stay 
540594842652056903,A nice place to stay  Parking was a little difficult to find and the upstairs neighbors are loud  other than that we enjoyed our time here  Everything is newly updated  clean  and cozy  Thank you for our stay at your place 
444868615153621198,Nice place but without personal touch at all  I had a problem with my baggage as I had late flight and Zencity just responding me that they don t keep baggage for guest  though they could have a solution  Luckily I ve found spot for luggage just next door  They could make a better work with guiding
496400492373573995,As expected and pictured  would stay again  Great spot  Directions were good and accurate for check in but I still needed to ask security guard for help to find the key in the garage  Everything else was perfect 
470254666259719198,Good location  very clean and prompt communication Good communication  Clean  great location
481859329651393175,clean  very nice  great view  quiet  great location  parking isnt the best but no where in the area has good parking  its a little confusing on which elevators to take and finding the key box was a little confusing  there was no security present when i first arrived 
525313112290401254,Location and unit were great  The check in process was a nightmare because the kiosk was broken and no one was at the front desk  Four calls and an hour later  someone was able to come to give us our key  The parking garage and evening street parking was sufficient 
481898268767356452,Amazing space and very well kept  Easy check in 
527556681299177513,Easy access to building and apartment  Clean  Comfortable bed  Quiet  Easy walk to eateries  Great French bakery half block away  Beautiful nighttime skyline view  Basic kitchen amenities Thought the washer and dryer were in the unit based on how it was listed   More than one bath towel per person would have been appreciated since in apartment laundry not available  Some reviews indicated noise was a problem  Our place was very quiet even though close to elevator  The couch seat cushions need to be clean or replaced  Looking pretty grungy  Bed very comfortable  View was great 
481889260409958315,Great location beautiful place  
501427022449556147,Good location to CWE and Barnes Jewish  Area seems safe  Grocery and lots of food within walking distance  Unit seemed clean but still dusty  Had troubles entering main lobby doors few times  host was not helpful in that regard and just had to wait for another resident to help me in  For the price  would expect a little more  But will get the job done 
492085471788276705,Absolutely loved the look of this place  Communication was great until I encountered a problem  The place was spotless except for a few cobwebs on light fixtures  Overall  it was a nice place to stay  however  I did not have access to the parking garage or gym during my stay which was very upsetting as I am a daily gym user  I contacted the host and they claimed they would figure it out  but that never happened 
516617466204912999,  pros and   cons below  Pro      the apt was close to the subway  in a nice and safe area  close to shops  bars and coffee shops      The apt has the heat on high   Better to be too hot than too cold in Chicago winter     The bed is very comfortable   The TV is a nice set up with many apps already sign in  Con     The front door key was missing in the lock box   We waited for an hour before we could check in     There is hair in the bath tub  sink and in the bed sheet   The apartment isnt dirty  but its not clean neither     Someone knocked on the door at     am thinking we had an early check out   Check out time is   am  This apt looks very nice in the pictures   However this unit is in a very old building   Zencity renovated it just enough to be an airbnb  Your team members did the best they could to accommodate us  I do appreciate that   but there isnt one specific person for the property  every email exchange or phone call I have to deal with a new person and explain the situation  
501421478153224747,Walls  are super thin try in not to make to much noise neighbors will complain I had the tv volume on ten in let them tell it it was too loud Hey did someone turn the key in if not I m willing to pay the fee
516616308503768105,Great unit  Included cookware  seasoning and cooking oil  I enjoy cooking in the spacious kitchen  House includes great amenities  Parking is a hassle on the weekend but other that great location  Lots of restaurant options close  The locked thermostat wasn t my favorite  Beautiful unit
498512903217421286,Simple and straightforward place that met our needs  The Zencity team was responsive to our questions in a timely manner  Thank you  Enjoyed the stay    one minor thing  there was a smoke detector low battery beep in the common area outside our unit  which beeped the entirety of the stay and could be heard in both bedrooms  Obviously not a problem with the unit itself  but hopefully someone in the building can address since it was an issue for us 
443666030235721227,NIGHTMARE  This was an entirely fraudulent airbnb  Showed up at    PM with instructions to look for a lockbox with key in it  There was no such lock box  Got Zencity on the phone  talked to someone at length who could not reach anyone in charge  said they were all  remote    and we got  disconnected   Called back and was told there was no way to get me into that place but they were looking for someplace else  Periodically they said they didnt have anything until the next evening  but sometimes they said maybe they could find a place with only one bed for the night  But an hour went by  and there was no solution  I got a hold of the property manager for the actual building  and was told that the lease on the unit I was supposed to be in had ended more than a month earlier  and no one had a right to rent it on airbnb  Had to take a     uber to a hotel  Zencity then asked me to cancel the reservation and take the dispute for refund up with airbnb  I did not do that  instead I contacted Airbnb  Airbnb  to their credit  took care of it  cancelled the reservation  refunded me  gave me a discount for my next rental  and offered me a little gift  Zencity is not to be trusted unless you want to risk arriving in a strange city  in the dark  and having no place to stay 
455810760560710953,Im just going to be straight forward and address pros and cons   the pros are that the neighborhood was homely and nice  the apartment is rather spacious    the cons are the smell  the drain in the bathroom  the loud ac that doesnt work in the bedroom  and the spotty internet and TV   overall  not a great time  but it wasnt the worst address the smell problem  its genuinely disgusting  and theyre probably wouldnt be gnats if it didnt smell so bad everywhere 
540625572034769926,Nice place  Could use a deep clean  Overall  decent value 
516618632151402305,When you arrive at the building  you are presented with what appears to be an old  run down art deco building with what looks to be an incomplete second door with non operable magnet latch   The elevator looks worn and the hallways had a     s feel   All dingy white with worn carpet     But once you open the door to the room  everything jumps forward in time   Still art deco in black and white   But clean  you could smell the bleach as soon as the door opened  and cozy   It had a full kitchen area  single bedroom  living room  and bath   The bed was firm and comfortable   Scattered around the living room were many books one could browse through   In the end  we did enjoy the stay   Wed probably not stay at this one again  though   But that is not because of the apartment but because the parking   We were fortunate that we found a spot big enough for our vehicle that was not too far a walk each time we came to the apartment   But all the street around are full with cars    Pros       Clean  Very clean    We had to open a window when we arrived to get rid of the smell of bleach       The bed was firm and comfortable         The kitchen area was functional with a fridge  microwave  range oven  and dishwasher       Even with every room being white with black furniture  countertops  appliances  tables  etc  it was enjoyable to see and did not over power you       There were a lot of windows   There are    windows in this place  so plenty of natural light       The WiFi was good with the ID and password on a chalkboard as you entered       The TV was a Roku TV      Heater had no problem keeping the place warm    Cons       The trash can lid  refrigerator handle  which was laying on top   and the closet door  which I fixed  were all broken when we got there       As clearly put in the listing  there is NO PARKING reserved   You have to find on street parking and hike a bit   Just be good at parallel parking and willing to walk a bit         The windows were old   The amount of noise that entered the apartment made you think a window was always partially open   All windows contributed to the issue      All the windows just had thin plastic blinds with no curtains   If you are not used to light at night  these blinds let a lot of unnatural night light glow in   No night light needed       No way to directly contact the host   No phone number is given   You have to email message them and wait for them to return it      We did have an issue in receiving our key fob through the networked system Zencity had   When we first arrived  the code they gave us to receive the fob did not work   We had to sit in the lobby with our luggage for    minutes and three attempts to contact them  which is only by email or Airbnb messaging   no phone number given     Once someone got in touch with me  they remotely released the fob and we were able to get into the apartment   This was our experience and I wont say that such is typical 
443428948738464291,The check in was very smooth  the location was quiet and convenient  and the place has great views of Lake Michigan  The apartment had all the very basic necessities  but it needs some repairs  During our stay  there was a loose towel rack and one piece of broken furniture  We also had to clean the floor  The stay overall was pleasant and the location was good  But there were multiple issues with the cleanliness and upkeep of the apartment  We had to wet mop the floor three times before it was clean enough to walk on  There were lots of broken and unusable items in the apartment   the cane back chair is broken  theres a loose towel bar next to the mirror cabinet  and a missing lint filter in the dryer  Weve stayed at much nicer places for close to half the cost 
443498341692343237,Beautiful property  and amazing location  Cleaning job and wifi could have been better  but it didnt take away too much from the experience  Hello  This was a beautiful apartment however the clean job was not acceptable  Their was food  crumbs  hair  make up left around that seemed like the place wasnt clean after the previous guest  I stayed at one of your properties before and had a similar experience  While I absolutely love the aesthetic and location of your properties  the poor clean causes a disservice  We also had issues with wifi both times  but I do appreciate how someone reached out about it without us having to ask 
443457247556556816,Very clean and the floors was awesome The place was great  Thank u for hosting
443415816470873604,The lock pad wasn t set properly so we couldn t get into the apartment when we arrived  had to call and wait outside with our bags for some time to be able to even enter the unit  We were notified by management on day   of a  noise complaint  after a night of the two of us watching the   pm news on the couch  Meanwhile  we could hear every footstep upstairs  and every time the neighbors leave through the shared front door it sounded like someone was coming into our unit  which we did not complain about because we understand that this is city living   The dishwasher door spring was broken so it crashed to the floor when opening  which rolled the shelves open  and ended up in broking glasses   The worst part of the entire stay was when they sent someone to fix the dishwasher  He showed up the next day  walking right into our apartment while we were there  without knocking  through the complex door and through our front door literally into our living room while we were standing there in shock  Next  when attempting to use the oven  it immediately made the smoke alarm go off because the oven was so dirty greasy  They sent someone to clean it  and it was still dirty enough to set the smoke alarm off during preheating which made the oven unusable  and during a   week stay  this was a problem   At one point the outdoor side gate was open when I came home at night and was unable to be closed locked  The Wi Fi was slow most days and was completely out on others  They finally had to provide a hotspot so I could work from home  Most cabinet drawers were broken  The couch is stained and the springs feel like they are about to come through the top of the cushion  The unit was not clean properly   there was hair and debris all over the living room rug and spiders in the corners  Many of the messages I sent about these issues were not responded to  Overall I m shocked that Zencity is allowed to manage Airbnb s  and I could never in good conscience recommend this place for anyone to stay for a significant amount of time 
443419174656447472,Great location  nice place  The Back Door Would Not Lock Or Close  The jetted tub needed to be clean properly  Other than that the stay was perfect
456532460642429071,The apartment was very minimally appointed  There were only   towels  no coffee  no salt and pepper  etc  It was a brief walk to great restaurants in the Central West End but because of the close proximity to the hospital  there were sirens during the night  We didnt think it was a good value  The apartment was very minimally appointed  There were only   towels  no coffee  no salt and pepper  etc  It was a brief walk to great restaurants in the Central West End but because of the close proximity to the hospital  there were sirens during the night  We didnt think it was a good value 
457166968643144334,No complaints  felt like home
505126107951609634,Great location with restaurants and grocery stores right next to the loft  The place is nice and clean  The listing does not come with parking  Lot of street parking options available and paid parking lots right next to the loft  Thanks for letting us use your place 
516001270818239052,The place was very clean and communication was great  Will definitely recommend and stay again Love my stay  Had a great time 
496434466600018119,Very clean loved our stay   Check in was a bit confusing but once we got it figured out everything was great  Would definitely stay again  Loved it thanks so much
486189343264954770,This unit is a little rough around the edges  some broken blinds  beds comfortable  but a little unstable  and one of the bedside tables wouldnt shut  Older building  not much soundproofing  you can hear outside pretty easily   That being said  its a cool neighborhood with adequate street parking on the same block  Very big space for a decent value  If none of the above would bother you  wasnt a problem for me   this is a good option 
485517309763457892,We stayed at the Montclair with zen city for parents weekend for WashU  It was the perfect spot   Clean and furnished with just right amenities   We ll definitely be back  The parking situation could be a lot clearer   We tried to pay to park in the lot but apps did not recognize the location   So unclear if allowed 
475339629454928683,This home was very clean  It was in a great location  The renovation for this older home is fantastic as it was very comfortable and perfect for a group our size  Communication was great with quick response on any question  A great home  Good morning  Thanks so much for providing such a great airbnb property  It was so clean and great for our needs    I didn t see anything for closing needs such as stripping beds and such  We looked and only saw that the kitchen needed to be clean up  Other than that  I didn t see anything  Sorry if I missed something    A great location and home  Nice job on the renovation    Best   Pam
399965351351847326,This is a beautiful home that is wonderful for a large family or even for a few families  The communication with the host was amazing  and we had a great time  We had a wonderful time and hope to book with you again when you come back to Missouri 
467340602725330591,Very clean   in a great  quiet location Overall  it was a great stay   The only issue I would have to say were things like the toilet being loose   little things like that 
455055309979156062,Great stay  Directions were super detailed and very helpful  This stay has great views and is close to food and drinks and in a very nice area  Loved the stay    thing you may want to provide a little more detail on is that only   of the elevators seemed to take us to the   st floor and the whole need to scan the key to go up the elevator was somewhat confusing  We figured it out  but maybe a little direction on that 
539904401583944146,Our short stay was wonderful  The description and photos are all the same with the room that I booked  I was only quite confused when I checked in but glad that I could get my key  I would recommend the room for everyone whod like to stay for a while in St  Louis  Thank you for the facilities  everything is complete  I had a great stay 
538453662490014411,Check in process took   hour because the keys was not in the lock box it should have been in  This things should be checked often for accuracy and good customer service  When speaking to someone for assistance  they did not have the answer and was placed on hold while they tried to get answers  Room was changed three times due to this issue  Check in process took   hour because the keys was not in the lock box it should have been in  This things should be checked often for accuracy and good customer service  When speaking to someone for assistance  they did not have the answer and was placed on hold while they tried to get answers  Room was changed three times due to this issue

455085424779805587,Wonderful historic house  We were there for completely different reasons but the history and the Truman s definitely captured our interest  To be able to look out the windows and see President Truman s house and read all about him in the books that the host provides is like a trip back in time  Highly recommend this place if you re ever in Independence  MO  Slawik is a great host and very responsive  Just talked to Airbnb and my account has been restored  Thanks so much for your help  We really enjoyed our stay at your place  what a quaint and historical place  I now know more about President Truman than I ever thought I would

481179784441823796,The main reason I decided to book this place is because I was told there would be garage parking on Pine St  The key fob for the garage did not open the gate and I was forced to park on the street  I was on a cross country trip with valuables in my car and did not feel comfortable leaving my car outside of the parking garage  As I approached my car the next morning I saw I was given a     parking ticket as well  I am extremely unhappy with everything that has transpired  Who ever runs this spot needs to check in and make sure the key fob actually works because it did not for me  The main reason I decided to book this place is because I was told there would be garage parking on Pine St  The key fob for the garage did not open the gate and I was forced to park on the street  I am on a cross country trip with many valuables in my car and did not feel comfortable leaving my car outside of the parking garage  As I approached my car this morning I saw I was given a     parking ticket as well  I am extremely unhappy with everything that has transpired and am requesting a refund  Who ever runs this spot needs to check in and make sure the key fob actually works because it did not for me  I am lucky no one decided to break into my car as I have been told not to park on the street at night in this area 
478316243042575076,We really enjoyed our stay   It was nice and cozy in a safe building   Great views  I m partial to sunsets and there was a nice one each night    Nice neighborhood with lots of choices of restaurants and grocery stores   Across the street from a nice park   I would highly recommend it  Thanks so much   We had a great stay   It was nice and cozy 
481163132444792456,No heat made the stay VERY uncomfortable  The heat was not turned until we were leaving  The thermostat was locked and could not be adjusted by us  Either give the tenant control or respond to their requests  I called every day and I received promises with no results  This is totally unacceptable  We had to wear our winter coats inside the unit   There were a couple of other items   The toilet seat was very loose  I hand tightened it but someone needs a screwdriver and a wrench   Coffee pods and a Keurig would be a nice touch   A set of measuring coups would be helpful   The lack of heat made the stay VERY unpleasant  
481119350844157433,Very horrible experience at this place I don t recommend this place for anyone There were some many things wrong I don t know were to start the door to enter the apartment building was broke was out there for   mins before a resident walked up and was like it s broken it s a trick to getting  Then once we were about enter the Elevator she informed me that dog had urinated into the elevator which no one clean up  Which almost vomited the smell was so Disgusting  Then the style of the apartment was almost like loft style in which I was assuming I was getting two Separate bedrooms  Then the  st bedroom had a dirty used diaper in the closet and the laundry room had an used tampons in there  The whole experience there was just disgusting and had me sick to my stomach
528310717333830869,I recommend this place so much  Perfect location  super clean  nice tv   overall setup  Really big for a studio  Checkin is easy with the use of safe lock    stars Love this location for the interviews I had downtown  Was wondering if the building itself had openings or if you guys do extended stay rates  Everything was smooth  Idk why when booking it said I needed a reason to stay because i have no reviews when I have stayed at the unit multiple times now  No big deal either way  but tedious  Thanks for everything 
480001887874228616,Let me start off by saying I NEVER write long reviews  However  if I could give this property zero stars  I would  I had high hopes  even though this property had no reviews  because I ve booked with Zencity before  But NEVER AGAIN  The photos listed are of a totally different property  I have proof   The place was FILTHY  There was urine in the toilet  dirt and grime in the shower  and the sofa had stains on it  Not to mention there was a crackhead on the steps in the lobby  The host s communication is terrible  It took hours for them to respond  They only offered to send a housekeeper the next day and did not even acknowledge the fact that the photos on the listing did not match the property in person  I ve never had a problem with AirBnB until now  Even they were hesitant to refund my money  My trip to STL was RUINED because of Zencity and AirBnB  Do yourself a favor and don t book  I am extremely disappointed with my St  Louis stay  The property was inaccurate and not clean  Do better 
455006435713364670,Great location  love the space and accommodations  I wish there would have been a number to contact a person other than a hotline for a business  Checking in was difficult because we didn t know exactly where the lockbox was for our key  Also the fact that speakers are in every room of the apartment and you get a noise complaint message from the business by simply listening to music is irritating when we weren t being loud
479221355011536269,Unit was not clean  Found cockroaches  Left and rebooked elsewhere  Will not book with this company again  I did not think they handled the situation appropriately 
480462070395237005,What a fantastic location and so easy and private  We had a great stay  Hi Zen  We had a great stay and thank you so much  Thought you might want to know the shower curtain liner needs to be replaced due to mold  We will stay with you again 
478933572267571534,Stay two nights for a mini getaway while visiting family  Great location  Didn t spend much time in the place  but good home base to explore  Bed super comfy  Highlight was a resident event we were able to attend   rooftop party with live entertainment and drinks  A nice unexpected treat  Friendly  Concierage service with local recommendations another bonus A full length mirror would be nice And good to fix the clogged drainS
478919048236993925,Okay 
540602975444021592,Very clean and awesome location  Great time and a great stay 
449243917017516286,we loved the space and found it very comfortable and safe  our only issue was trying to get to our room  the initial check in was rough as the intercoms were not working properly and we had to have the leasing office  unrelated to Zencity  let us up to our room initially  then  the code for the door stopped working the day after and we had to get on the phone with Zencity for half an hour to download an app in order to open our door from then on out  overall this day was positive  just a pain to try to get in and out of our room  we loved the space and found it very comfortable and safe  my only suggestion is finding an easier way for initial entry and ensuring that codes will work on the doors 
448533905987842051,I checked into a property that apparently the TVs were missing  but I was able to be moved to another unit they had available   I guess it s best to deal with a company who has several units   it was a little headache but it was fixed  The property was clean and well located  I checked into a property that apparently the TVs were missing  but I was able to be moved to another unit they had available   I guess it s best to deal with a company who has several units   it was a little headache but it was fixed 
447754246085848792,Very impressive attention to detail regarding their anticipation of the needs and desires of their guests  Stunning Market view  Extremely comfortable furnishings designed to be easily sanitized  non poreous surfaces  etc    Overall an experience that wont be easy to top  Very impressive attention to detail regarding their anticipation of the needs and desires of their guests  Stunning Market view  Extremely comfortable furnishings designed to be easily sanitized  non poreous surfaces  etc    Overall an experience that wont be easy to top 
497108351367661437,This place is really nice  Walking out the front door felt safe and walking in felt secure  There s a coffee shop with amazingly delicious cookies and eateries within walking distance  It was very good for me  Thanks for turning up the heat   
543545180070712638,For a short stay in Chicago  this was a great place to stay  It would even be great for longer stays too  Everything was very clean and exactly as described on the listing  Beds were very comfortable and it was nice to have a full kitchen  The Fire Stick was also a nice touch so that we could watch pretty much anything we wanted  Thank you for a great stay  Everything was great for our short stay  Thank you 
496418109090517610,This place is wonderful  Love this place 
467355148823260984,You get what you pay for  the Airbnb was nice but the actual complex was shady  The neighborhood was not too good so didn t really go out at night  Next time I would pay the extra for a better location The Airbnb was ok  a new couch is definitely needed  It was clean but there was an unusual amount of hair everywhere like bed  bathtub  etc  the neighbors were extremely loud from playing loud music all night or screaming people 
473899767851769923,The apartment was cool  location very good  easy check in but cleanliness was very poor  for the same price than a hotel  Id expect a more thorough clean    Very few kitchen appliances and utensils  Cleanliness should be better for     USD a night  which is basically more than the cost of a hotel 
481884954516350109,Wonderful
446366214075443540,Check in was simple with no complications  Communication was overall quick and responsive  I would highly recommend a stay here  Not to mention the building is a great addition to Kansas City  Thank you    I only had a small difficulty which was the wifi not operating on my last day  I didnt get much response or an update on when the wifi was operational again   All other communication was swift   Its great to see the building remodeled after so many years of it being vacant   What a great addition to Kansas City 
460104037467694318,Awesome location  perfect place for two people to get away  Parking is right next to the building  there were dogs walking outside everyday  it was awesome  Definitely recommend staying here  It was an awesome stay  No complaints  other than the code to get into the place did not work  Luckily someone was there to let us in  but the code did not work to get in initially  Other than that  the place was perfect for two people  and the location was awesome  I would stay here again  Thank you so much  
445828741737742806,I was told we would get refunded for   nights because our entryway was blocked because of parties happening throughout the night  We couldn t get in or out of our room without going through people hosting an admissions table  I was told I would be able to cancel my last nights stay with no charge   We were told it could sleep    But it could barely sleep     There was mold on the shower curtain   A hole in the bathroom door  The floors were sticky   No check out instructions  were given    There were no extra blankets and the couch was a loveseat instead of a normal couch as the picture showed    I shared with them that I would go through ZenCity first before contacting airbnb if they could accommodate the issues we were having  They said they would accommodate  They didn t  so here I am  Im so disappointed in this stay and the dishonesty  I was told we would get refunded for   nights because our entryway was blocked because of parties happening throughout the night  We couldn t get in or out of our room without going through people hosting an admissions table  I was told I would be able to cancel my last nights stay with no charge   We were told it could sleep    But it could barely sleep     There was mold on the shower curtain    No check out instructions  were given    There were no extra blankets and the couch was a loveseat instead of a normal couch as the picture showed    I shared with them that I would go through ZenCity first before contacting airbnb if they could accommodate the issues we were having  They didn t so here I am  Im so disappointed in this stay and the dishonesty 
455741199058134333,Location was very convenient for what we needed in Chicago   We d have appreciated an upholstered chair or two  rather than the little kitchen chairs  but that s just us  Very quiet for the train being so close   We did have issues with cleanliness  black hair in the shower and dirty floors  I walked around barefoot for    min after my shower  my feet were black  had to re wash them to put socks on  Only walked in socks after that   then threw our socks away  We had issues with cleanliness  There was long black hair in the shower which was gross  Also  the floors  I walked around barefoot for    minutes after my shower and my feet were BLACK   I had to re wash them before putting socks on  So we decided not to walk barefoot  but then our socks were black   so bad that we threw them away  too gross to even put in dirty clothes in our suitcase  I did take pictures  just didn t see a way to put them here   Otherwise  as far as location and what we wanted to do in Chicago  it was fabulous  Amazingly quiet with the train so close  For me  an upholstered chair or two would have been nice   but that s me  We d probably stay again  either the same place or something close for the location convenience 
445674269189549587,When we arrived the directions to retrieve they key did not work  I messaged Zencity and did not get a response  I called and they gave me a different code that worked  Once I had the key  the security card to get into the building did not work  again  I messaged them and did not get a response  Luckily  I knew someone in the building so I got in  Later I called Zencity  again  they said they didn t know why the security card didn t work and I should contact security  The security guard told me Zencity had lost their license to operate in KC and were being evicted from the building  I guess I am fortunate I had a place to stay  The apartment was  nice but only had   small hotel size shampoo for   bathrooms and a   night stay  There were no tissues or extra blankets  etc  I would have been better off in a hotel
445656854725728932,Our stay at Zencity was amazing  You cannot be in the heart of downtown KC with such great views for this price  We loved every bit of our stay there  It was a great time
445564830318714073,The apartment was nice and the pictures were accurate  One negative for us was the parking situation   Zencity did say that we could get a ticket from the parking garage and have if validated by security  The security guard did validate  but he mentioned that not every guard would validate for Airbnb guests  Then  when we left for the evening  we came back to a closed garage  Apparently it is closed on weekends  So just as others have mentioned  the parking situation at the Airbnb is not great  We ended up parking a the nearby library and paid daily    We also had an issue with check in  We were given the wrong code for the locker to get the keys  and the fob to get into the building wasn t working  Zencity did respond quickly to give us the right code and the security for the building was able to help with the fob  but it was all a bit of a struggle at first   Other than these issues   the Airbnb was fine 
526805539790559911,A disappointing experience for a vibrant city    Lack of Building Access   After following the instruction on the directory  I was not presented with a prompt for building access  I repeatedly made a request to ZenCity to provide a key card as an alternative to dialling a keypad and voice activated responses  I was only able to access the building via building tenants allowing me to tailgate   Loud Air Conditioning  that is intermittent in air and temperature  If you are interested in sleep  I would say you might find you are challenged but the auditory abuse of this appliance    The following were additional items of question             Exposed Duvet without a duvet cover as bedding             Thin walls  can hear the footsteps of neighbours and conversation in the next door and above 
522502411535914067,Zencity was easy to book from and check in  Unit was in a perfect location and accurate to what was described  We would definitely book again  Everything was great except we saw smudge marks and some body hair in bathroom  Also dirty corners in rooms  and pillows were stained under pillow covers  White couch was dirty like brown dirty  and under the couch cushions it was full of crumbs  hair  and all sorts of nasty stuff  By far the couch issue was the major item of concerns  Customer service calls for helping us extend was great  We were very happy with the location  Only thing it needs is that couch to be steam clean and whitened and actually be vacuumed under cushions 
516624624903459903,The place was the perfect location  Walking distance to a lot of bar and restaurants and if you don t want to walk  the street car is right outside  The place was nice and roomy  Very comfortable stay  The communication was great  I would email a question or concern and got a response within    min  Great place to stay  Would definitely stay here again if I m ever in KC again  We had a great stay  Thank you 
470269526188238532,Great location
495669923213027413,Spacious  sparsely decorated apartment in a Good location   Be prepared to live out of your suitcase as there are no clothes dressers to place your garments during your stay   Hopefully Zencity will have replaced the missing blinds in the bedroom so you will have a modicum of privacy   With  luck  the furnace will be working your entire stay  it only operated for the last day of our four day rental   We froze and complained for three days and Zencity did nothing   Oh  and keep your fingers crossed that the sinks in the bathroom drains   We didn t have use of one bathroom for three days because our repeated  respectful requests to have it repaired  and to get the heat turned on  were ignored   I ve heard that Zen is a path towards happiness  but the road Zencity will put you on is a rocky  unpleasant path to frustration  Furnace did not work  sink did not drain and it took you three days to fix those significant problems   You never did repair the missing blinds in the bedroom   Your failure to act showed disdain for your customers 
443401937079402314,The counter was dirty and the floor was dirty   The door was not attached the curtains were falling and no privacy  There was mold on the pillows and bed  The counter and floor was dirty and their was mold on the pillows  
444940366160308192,I booked this place last minute because my scheduled Airbnb was a mess  Because of this  I got a discounted rate  It s fairly pricey otherwise    The place was great but the check in process was a nightmare  The call box doesn t even function  The code to get the key fob to enter the building didn t work  The door to the apartment locks after   seconds and I got locked out the first night because the code to the door is literally   digits long  A shorter code would definitely be helpful  On top of that  there is no phone number online  only on Airbnb  and because I didn t have my phone I couldn t call from a stranger s phone to get the code   Other than the check in  the place is great  Well equipped with nice furniture and textiles  The check in process is riddled with errors  The call box DOES NOT WORK  The code to the lock box to get the key fob DOES NOT WORK 
516618284264224413,It was very clean and smelled nice  they had great communication and were very respectful  Thank you for the stay
468108332172202570,  star rating wish I could give more stars love them would definitely stay again  Loved the space looked just like the pictures  would definitely come back 
516673334531135575,  
481100554286529913,Perfect for just the two of us with close access to forest park truly the gem of the city with close proximity to the Hill and everything in the city  We would do it all again in a heart beat  Thank you for the accommodations  This was a great local to forest park and all it has to offer  It truly gives access to the gem of the city  not to mention eating well on The Hill  and is a short jaunt to anywhere in the city  I liked your set up  the drains run a tad slow  and the  entrance doors can be a little finicky  and we didn t realize there was a modem issue so we just used our data till the next day  but all in all it was a great stay  Would definitely do it all over in a heart beat  It was perfect for my husband and I we did do a lot of shopping and got the time we needed together  our anniversary was a special treat because we were able to accommodate that with the assistance of your property  thank you so much 
442718038979971606,DONT GO TO THIS PLACE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT  The most stupidest place I ve ever been to please go somewhere else even a motel would be a easier stay  Got to the freaking place the code on the lock box didn t work called and the lady was like are you sure you re at the right place yes I was at the right damn place  Are you sure you re at the right lock box there s only one lock box  Are you sure it s number    Yes  She gave us like     codes to try none of them worked  Was asked this for a damn hour  Ended up telling us to walk a couple blocks to the other Airbnb that they also have at like midnight  Would of drove but I already payed for my parking  Ended up there code didn t work for the entrance to the apt  Someone finally let us in get to our room the code for the door doesn t work  Had to call for the  RD TIME  Had to wait for another    mins finally got the right code  The place was on the  th floor not the   st like the place I wanted  The place was awful compared to what I wanted to stay at  Honestly want a reimbursement  But Foreal don t go       Sorry if I don t make since still so pissed on what happen Worst stay I ve ever had  Had better at     motels  Honestly want a reimbursement  I got to the right place couldn t get in because the codes weren t working for the box  I kept being asked the same freaking question when I told the person on the phone what was happening  You sure it s number    Yes told her it was    times was on that phone forever  Ended up having to go to a another Airbnb that you guys had that was not even as nice as the one I payed for  Code didn t work for the door had to call again for the  rd time  Finally got around   am than got woken up at    am could of let us stay longer since you guys messed it all up on your end 
544905916933742703,Gorgeous place   Gorgeous place  cozy  friendly neighborhood   
532651497799585419,Love the place  Because like a picture  Everything perfect 
441964972786345690,Great location  Nice pizza joint attached to it Stay was great 
470316623331210576,Great location and view
490547294045883612,Disappointed in our stay  Unit is a great location  clean  and had towels  dishes    Those are literally the only good things about the trip  Where do I begin  Upon check in  it was    degrees  We attempted to adjust the thermostat  It was only blowing cold air  We notified the host immediately and did not receive a timely response  When they did respond  their advice was to use the extra blanket  which was a sheet   I was freezing so we left to meet up with friends thinking surely the host would be over soon to take a look  Nope   Upon our return  the temperature was    degrees  I called the host  He said he would call back in   minutes  At   AM I received a response  We had an absolutely awful night  No one ever came to look at the place  We found a service slip that said the thermostat was  broken and unable to cycle dated a few months ago  The unit needs repaired    We did not have time to find another place to stay so we made it work  Upon checkout  the clean people came before we had even vacated  Not impressed and we will never use Zencity again    The complete lack of communication and lack of basic temperature control was completely unacceptable  Terrible communication  We needed assistance for a comfortable stay and got literally no help 
455731347874426643,Fantastic rental  It s about a mile walk to Wrigley field and in a fun neighborhood  Also felt safe  Within a few blocks to target and Whole Foods  Starbucks is literally a few steps away  Also we loved the Dinkles bakery for donuts across the street  We would stay here again  The AC also worked really well on a hot day   The other reviews about the WiFi are true as it is a little slow  This is a fantastic rental thank you  Also letting your know that the shower current rod collapsed the second I tried to open the curtain to shower  My husband had walked to target and was there when it happened to me  so I told him to just pick up a rod  I didn t want to wait for a repair because I needed to shower now before a meeting  Just wanted to let you know In case you are wondering why it was just sitting against the wall in the bathroom
441324936860342071,If you re looking for   stars of  excellence  cleanliness  packed with amenities  and accessibility  of down town Kansas City restaurants  and shopping   I highly recommend     McGee Zencity      McGee Zencity   Thank you for the excellence  cleanliness  packed with amenities  and accessibility  of down town Kansas City restaurants  and shopping   I give   stars 
456695657214884495,I was really looking forward to staying here for a few days  Check in was at    they didn t send check in instructions until    pm  To which i found out address on the listing was wrong  I could not get in the building because the code box was broken  they had no alternative except have someone let you in  Their keyfob did not work either  I was left on hold for over    mins and then the rep hung up  Defeated i decided to stay at a hotel instead  They never called or messaged me back  If you re able avoid this company at all cost  This isn t my first mishap with Zencity Terrible communication 
501459009680260652,Great location  nice place to stay  Better than hotel in space and value  Thanks for the hospitality  Very nice 
439858600183877451,Good stay with nice management   The room is well decorated and very clean and modern   We could not get into the building upon arrival  but they have a backup in the management office of the building   It was a minor issue   The hair dryer also didnt work and was replaced the next day   The property is walking distance to many attractions   coffee  restaurants  light rail  jewelry store  city market  and other  Thanks for replacing the hair dryer and having a backup to get into the building   We could not get in upon arrival   The phone system in the lobby was not working 
501484862164894536,Great spot view and service
470202618098305000,Everything was great except the check in  Check in was a little difficult
491334472656638850,This unit was perfectly located close to Forest Park in a quiet neighborhood  Perfect for my friend and I  since it had two bedrooms and two bathrooms  Would definitely consider booking here again for a future stay in St  Louis  Thanks for hosting us  The unit was lovely  and suited our needs perfectly  I wanted to mention the water temperature in the shower in the bathroom located off of the living room  The water was either very cold or very  very hot  and seemingly no in between  I dont want someone to burn themselves on the hot water if theyre not careful 
455775607833222160,Beautiful apartment in an amazing location   Check in was simple and the place was extremely clean  The apartment pool and rooftop were lovely and never busy  Would definitely recommend 
516694517148854121,It was ok  not the best or friendliest hosts ever but beggars can t be choosers I got a charger delivered cause I lost mine and it was stolen before I could use it
481898267453529285,Would recommend to others for its location especially loved the location  building staff was top notch friendly  apartment was cozy 
439765109863313450,Bring your own coffee  apartment did not have any  Big bummer when all of the family needs coffee and your an early riser  Also the check in was a mess  Many instructions to follow and we still failed  Coffee and a coffee maker would have made our stay more enjoyable  The instructions for check in were very detailed but we still struggled  We are from a small town and dont have to use parking garages often  The frustration levels were high and missed the key card to get into the building  Instruction to enter off the street were wrong since if we could have found the key card we enter in the parking garage  The bed sheets were also smelly  We had to wash them just so we could sleep
443398768219348810,Amazeballs That s place was so beautiful  The laundry room was a bit sketch but   the rest of it for the price I paid was awesome    It s a very chill and millennial type vibe  Just far enough from the bars and night life and surrounded by a recently renovated neighborhood
460149009487685471,Overall the place is great   Very close to Forest Park and the Zoo and lots of places within walking distance or a shirt Uber   Beds were good and overall the space was nice     The only downside was the main living furniture was in rough shape and not real comfortable   Disappointing for the price we paid but that was really the biggest challenge   You should also note this location is right next to Barnes Jewish hospital  with an active ER department   all night sirens   I would still recommend this place   Overall the place is great   Very close to Forest Park and the Zoo and lots of places within walking distance or a shirt Uber   Beds were good and overall the space was nice     The only downside was the main living furniture was in rough shape and not real comfortable   Disappointing for the price we paid but that was really the biggest challenge   You should also note this location is right next to Barnes Jewish hospital  with an active ER department   all night sirens   I would still recommend this place  
544918606641121601,Lil tricky to enter the unit  but once I figured it out I had a very nice stay 
441998885523023785,For the price and location this was a great place  Lots of restaurants in the area  being above a coffee shop is a plus as well  The actual apartment was accurate as far as the pictures go  The sliding blinds that cover the balcony door were missing some individual blinds which meant that when the neighbors were on their balcony they could see into the apartment  It left me feeling exposed  The apartment could have been clean better  the area rug was dirty and I tried vacuuming it with the vacuum in the apartment but it didn t work well  There was also what appeared to be crumbs or dirt  loose particles on the floor  Getting into the apartment the first time without the fob is a bit of a challenge as you don t get enough time after you punch in a code to make it to the second gate  Overall the apt had all the amenities I needed  and the bed was very comfortable  As for the train being right outside  the apartment is very well insulated and I could barely hear the train  Please fix the blinds on the patio door  when the neighbors are on their balcony they can see into the apartment  It left me feeling exposed  Also  the carpet under the bed can use a good clean 
441304096860591227,These apartments are perfect for checking out roscoe village or Andersonville  really cute local Chicago neighborhoods   It s also a pleasant little walk to wriggly park and a quick Uber train ride down to the loop  Please stay with zenacity if you want the extra apartment space  We loved our stay there  It was the perfect spot to enjoy the quaint Chicago neighborhoods  I think our only complaint we had was the water pressure in the shower was really weak and the temperature in the shower barely got hot  how we enjoy our showers   But that wasn t enough for us to complain about it because it did it s job overall  Thank you for offering such a cute space for us to stay

482562598513451130,Fantastic deal in a great location  but they were completely unresponsive during my stay 
455732851142193867,Overall good stay Thank you for the stay and resolving the check in issue
441291902607174597,The place was spotless and easy to check in  and the staff was very responsive   It is in a great location  and I did not have any issues with parking  I would definitely stay here again  Thank you for having us this weekend  Everything was perfect 
482540423806642919,Great Location  Access to the building did not work and the apartment code had to be reset  Location was very good but a feeling of being unsafe at night
441259307934999787,Excellent department to stay your days in Chicago  I do recommend it  Thanks to share your space with us  Just to comment that the toilet bowl is leaking water and it is wasting water a lot  I suggest you to repair asap  Also the front door presents difficulty to close and you from inside can not close the department safely  from outside is ok  We also missing sugar  salt and oil and amenities to cook  as we see in others Airbnb worldwide  The neighbors upstairs is noisy  children walking and jumping early morning  Could be able to turn of the AC 
465046244966541372,I was excited to stay at this unit for my trip to see a Bears game   I had a later flight  so was glad they had self check in   I assumed because this was a company as the host and not just an individual person  they would have someone on call      for any questions    I arrived at the unit and used the instructions to check in that were given to me earlier in the day   I didn t have an issue getting into the building  but when I tried to enter the code into the smart lock on the unit door it did not work    We tried several times then received an obnoxious alarm from the lock  likely meaning too many attempts   I messaged the host and called them   times   Only to sit on hold with elevator music once for   minutes   When the host responded via message about    minutes later they gave me a new code to try on the lock that I tried twice and it also did not work     I ended up leaving and going to search for a hotel to stay instead    I did contact Airbnb and I did end up getting a full refund 
479003428906980323,This place was amazing comfortable and location was everything  I booked last minute due to leaving a terrible Air bnb where the fridge was broke and the place was dirty  Very upscale and chic awesome shower and comfortable bed  I definitely would stay here again  This place was amazing comfortable and location was everything  I booked last minute due to leaving a terrible Air bnb where the fridge was broke and the place was dirty  Very upscale and chic awesome shower and comfortable bed  I definitely would stay here again 
440565599787211556,Good    Nice location  Hyde Park  Chicago     it s walking distance to restaurants   retail stores   Bad   both beds are broken   sinks in   very uncomfortable    couch was broken   replaced during my stay Both beds are broke  The couch was broke   replaced during my stay  Could not sleep in the bed
441212533093961818,The area was great and plenty to do  It is centrally located to a lot of other locations in Chicago if you aren t opposed to driving  The wifi did go out during my stay and it was an inconvenience for work for a few days   The host is very responsive  Hi   The wifi was a huge inconvenience  but overall it was a decent stay  Thank you 
440569830431939670,Zencity is a corporate owner that seems to operate a bunch of apartments in Chicago  Each time we contacted them  a different person responded by email  Sometimes they were prompt  other times they never replied  For example  I emailed the day before arrival to ask whether another person in our group could check in if they arrived first   Zencity never responded  Also  I emailed to ask about a late checkout and was told that the apartment had been booked so they could not accommodate my request  An hour later  I received an official email from Zencity  through the Airbnb message system  indicating that I could pay     for another night or late check out  I followed up and asked why they previously indicated that late checkout wasnt available but never got a response  So either they lied to me about having the unit booked or their automated system for offering late checkout  at a price  wasnt accurate  Overall I felt like I was dealing with an automated system rather than an actual conscious entity  You really need to make sure there are two sets of keys for an apartment that hosts four people  We had to spend an hour or so calling Zencity and working with the building management to get a second set of keys  Also  the toilet off the  master  bedroom needs to be fixed   it was running constantly during our stay 
515274986842269011,We had a great stay  Great location and value  We had a great stay  One suggestion  it would be great if the downstairs tub had a shower curtain frame  like in the upstairs tub  Also  a larger shower curtain frame for the upstairs tub would be awesome  The one thats up there was a bit claustrophobic  Overall though  really great  rustic place 
544958197806297078,Wonderful stay host was very warning and punctual as well as prompt  Great location Amazing amenities Wonderful stay great location beautiful amenities
456469962239681937,Great location and good value for the area  The bathroom and living room were not as clean as most AirBnBs Ive stayed in and check in directions were not provided ahead of time  Thank you for accommodating my day of room request   The shower drain seems to need attention   the tub started backing up before I even stepped in 
440544356723897219,The apartment was clean  bright and as advertised  Thank you   The apartment was advertised 
440543558707332377,This property is lovely    The staff helped me so much through The issue I had with my check in and were prompt in their response to my messages  I d highly recommend this space to anyone who is looking to stay in Chicago  Thank you so much for the stay  The property was lovely and the staff were friendly and helpful 
542794959064941254,Overall a great place for two to stay  to clearify on the parking  it does not have a dedicated parking spot  so guests have to find free street parking spots nearby  which was not too much of an issue during our short stay  getting into the building was a bit confusing at first  You have to navigate an electronic screen outside of the entrance  find the directory for Zen City  call them  and it should automatically unlock the door  This took us a few minutes to figure it out  It is a bit of a walk  as far as the location of the actual apartment in regards to the building entrance  so it may take a few long trips between the apartment and car if guests have a lot to carry in  However  once you walk into the apartment  it is incredibly clean  modern  and cozy  It has great big windows with amazing city views  The bed and pillows are incredibly comfortable  The water pressure in the shower is on the low side  The location itself is amazing  We could have walked almost everywhere we wanted to go to if it wasnt so cold  so we never drive more than a few minutes to our Soulard destinations and not much longer for other destinations around the area  Could not have asked for a better location 
439857440229691350,Disregard other reviews of this property  The place was very clean when I arrived  there was no mess  dirt  bugs or anything  I was very pleased with the check in check out process  Would definitely recommend this place  Thank you for the stay it was very clean compared to the most recent reviews from other guest at this property  The only thing we noticed that was out of the ordinary was the blow dryer located in the downstairs bathroom had a European plug instead of a USA plug  Not sure if a previous guest had left it behind or swapped their blow dryer with one that was there before but just a heads up  Other than that overall great stay  thanks again 
505250288263386428,Photos are fantastic  They manipulated them really well  The unit was incredibly underwhelming  Also  I was assaulted outside of the unit and the property manager did not care  I was assaulted outside of the unit and management did not help rectify the issue  They did not care 
439799344071986753,Since me and my friends read the previous comments we had a clear picture what to expect from this apartment  Thus  our stay was really nice  If cleanliness is your most important part this place is not the best  Otherwise  the size and location of the apartment is amazing   Further points   The air condition is working very well but condense water can drip down on the floor sometimes   The kitchen is well equipt with most of the stuff you need for cooking  However  proper cooking knives are not available

524692345149072624,Great location  Close to some nice restaurants  wonderful to walk around and admire the houses  If you like to walk  easy access to downtown  it took   weeks to fix the toilet    Fan was not fixed  a problem with wiring that meant making a hole in there ceiling     Towels could be a little newer    Shower head need to be replaced  A  rain  head has no pressure    It would be really nice if there was a  welcome  package  bottled water  some local chocolate  etc   This was done at every Airbnb we stayed at in Hawaii 
532607404622391921,This place is as advertised in a location near shops and food  also close to Wrigley field  The area is nice and the train stop is a block away  We chose it because it was within walking distance of our daughter  It is an older apartment but was clean  as some complained the floors are noisy  In winter it was nice to have good heat as we are from the south  The only issues i have are the windows in the bedrooms need better blackout curtains as the street lights outside the bedrooms are very bright at night  also if you are a light sleeper there is street noise at night  but not too bad  One other issue we told the host about the door lock was somewhat loose and not completely secure  but did stay shut  The apartment was in fair shape  but the entrance door needs some repair  The electronic lock is the only security and does not hold the door shut completely  The hole for the dead bolt is wallowed out and the inner frame is the only thing stopping it from opening  Also the curtains in the bedrooms need to do a better job of blocking out the street lights at night  The only other issue was the eviction notice left on the door in the middle of our stay  that was a little unnerving  Also it would be good for snow situations to have mats to put shoes on when entering  Over all the play was comfortable and was close to our daughters place 
437700841552869044,A great little place to stay in Chicago  the apartment was clean and comfortable  The detailed instructions for check in were perfect and made it easy  Would stay again  Thank you so much  The place was clean and comfortable and the check in process was a breeze

437684811671411532,The place was filthy   It was not clean  only tidied  before our arrival  My daughters socks were black on the soles within ten minutes  The toilet brush hadnt been used to clean the toilet in some time as it had a build up of dust on it as well  There was substantial build up of cooking residue on the stove  both the burners and the control console  likely cooking oil that was splattered on the console  There was build up on the microwave  both inside the door and the control console  There was food stuck to the inside of the sink on the sides and bottom of the basin  There was significant hair and debris on the bathroom floor  and streaks of some substances on the door and wall of the bathroom  I used a white cloth to wipe a few inches of the floor and it came up a mix of hair  brown and black debris  There were bits of dirt  hair  and other debris all over the wood floor especially at the edges  The remedy for this was to offer to come into the unit at    at night to clean it   and our stay was only for    hours    A sizeable clean fee was charged  but it is clear that no real clean takes place in this unit    The location is wonderful  but it is not worth the disgust and likely health risk  The place was filthy  It was not clean  only tidied  before our arrival  My daughters socks were black on the soles within ten minutes  The toilet brush hadnt been used to clean the toilet in some time  There was build up of cooking residue on the stove  both the burners and the control console  There was build up on the microwave  both inside the door and the control console  There was food stuck to the inside of the sink  There was significant hair and debris on the bathroom floor  and streaks of some substances on the door and wall of the bathroom  I used a white cloth to wipe a few inches of the floor and it came up a mix of hair  brown and black debris  There were bits of dirt  hair  and other debris all over the wood floor especially at the edges  The remedy for this was to offer to come into the unit at    at night to clean it   and our stay was only for    hours    A sizeable clean fee was charged  but it is clear that no real clean takes place in this unit

504347887388598970,A very adequate space in a fantastic location  Wicker park is vibrant and interesting neighborhood  Beds are comfortable and all the utilities are modern and work fine  Beyond that  no frills and very limited amenities Many stains on an old and very uncomfortable couch  Throw it out immediately
404340459506319511,Zens place is exactly as advertised  Simple  but it met all our needs  and the location cant be beat  The bed was comfortable  closet space and kitchen more than adequate for a short stay  Theres a desk for working  though we didnt have occasion to use it   Check in was all remote and easy  and the hosts were very responsive via messaging  Wed stay again  Hi Zen  Thanks for the stay  A couple things would make this rental better  reading lights or lamp by the bed  the lighting throughout the studio is very harsh   a drain plug for the bathtub 
437605417281872214,Great location close to restaurants and bars     Pilsen is a nice place to explore   Easy check in and check out   Close to the city   Would stay again  Great location   Place was cute and close to nice restaurants and bars   It could have been cleaner however for the     clean fee   The floor looked like it hadn t been mopped and the towels were stained   Also the toilet had not been flushed when we arrived   No garbage bags were in the trash cans   And also leftover hair in the bathtub and on the sink   Bathtub upstairs does not drain   Other than that  nice stay 
391200920895083883,The place was absolutely filthy when I stayed there  The chair and loveseat were broken  the floor was sticky  and there was old take out food in the fridge that reeked  There were also tons of  bed bugs     I use airbnb all the time and this was my worst experience    Check in and location were great  I think you may need to hire a new clean service  The place was absolutely filthy when I stayed there  The chair and loveseat were broken  the floor was sticky  and there was old take out food in the fridge that reeked  I also got devoured by bed bugs  I use airbnb all the time and this was my worst experience  I tried to resolve it with your customer service but they stopped responding 
437597069595632588,Gracias  Zencity por darnos un espacio esperamos volver pronto Excelente lugar una zona totalmente tranquila  un apartamento muy c modo para descansar      recomendable
455021855673978572,Cute little apartment  really friendly building  met some lovely residents in the hallways and elevators  the apartment was clean and had thoughtful essential items available for use  Only downside was difficulty figuring out parking  instructions not particularly helpful   couldnt get onto our floor initially  we followed the instructions to a tee but were told to repeat them if they didnt work  managed to get in with help from residents  we also couldnt find an iron for the ironing board just before date night  Good value for money  although a tad out of the way from bars and restaurants it was still a walkable distance  plenty of scooters nearby and ubers available   we had a lovely stay 
460852197734735535,This place is an amazing value for the location   The space is clean  functional  and has great views   The check in process was clearly communicated and we felt very safe   Plenty of restaurants within walking distance and scooters for rent all over the city   Easy access to the freeway makes everything else in the area just a short drive away   If you are a light sleeper bring some kind of noise machine though because you can hear a lot through the walls and hear the slamming of doors from people coming and going  Thank you for a great stay   We enjoyed our time here 
501409260234103363,Everything was as expected  Parking on the weekend was easy and free  The place was comfortable  Great location to visit several places  I know you are probably in progress on renovating it  so the only thing I can think of is to finish it  Everything else was great 
437592564040616675,A dope dope spot  Really enjoyed everything about this place   I understand a few things could take this down from a   star to a   star review for some folks  like    Not being able to control the thermostat is really dumb     Walk up the   flights is not easy    Shower could use a little fixing up    Other than that   an incredible and enjoyable stay  High recommend  Wow the spot was amazing  thank you so much  Would have no suggestions but if I had to pick one  shower could be a bit cleaner and drain better 
436247342926849788,This apartment is on the fourth floor   The steps are a bit steep even for my adult children that live on the fourth floor in a NYC apartment  Not for the out of shape    Great apartment with lots of space  great size for four people  We had trouble with the keypad getting into the actual apartment   I reached out and got an immediate response     For it  just being clean  I think it was more dusty with crumbs on the floor and some other things   Nothing to major  but thought you might want to know     Perfect for what we needed 
496328015000445587,Looks just like the pictures and the location was ideal  This was our first time in St  Louis  and I don t think we could have had a better introduction with a home base like this Airbnb We had a wonderful time and enjoyed having a great place to stay this weekend
436887148951110546,Great location  Lovely place to unwind after exploring the great city of Chicago  Check in check out was a breeze  Highly recommend  Cheers  Thank you for accommodating us in short notice  Will definitely stay again if I find myself back in town 
544939694404764214,Great place to stay near Barnes and Jewish  Did not have any issues with my stay 
436145407790091292,Nice  clean unit  easy to access and perfect for what we needed  The bed was super comfy  too  Thanks for having the space available for us to work thing out 
436142652260328795,The place was very clean and got lots of natural light  The bed is very comfortable and lots of extra bedding was provided  as well as extra toiletries  toilet paper  etc  We really enjoyed staying here  Thank you for everything  It did take a while to resolve the towel situation but we really enjoyed our stay otherwise 
435514014787425153,Apartment was in a great location with a lot of restaurants around  Walking distance     minutes  to Wrigleyville and blocks away from an L stop  Apartment is in an older building with some rundown walls and ceilings  but a perfect place for a long weekend of exploring the city with friends 
476083142931472275,Great location 
435492871995224576,The Good    the apartment has a nice view with good lighting and it is close to the train making travel into the city very easy  The Bad     The apartment was downright dirty  The floors were sticky  my boyfriend and I actually went out and bought slippers to keep from having to put our feet on the ground  The rug in the bedroom was so full of grime it was matted  The Couch was dirty and stained  The walls were a mess    the entire place needs a fresh coat of paint  Then after leaving  Zencity tried to charge us      for a broken leg on the couch    a couch that was so dirty we covered it with a sheet to sit on it  We did however  stay at another Zencity apt following this one near Wicker Park  which was much nicer  The apartment was down right dirty  The floors were sticky  The rug in the bedroom was actually matted it was so filthy  The Couch was dirty and stained  The walls were a mess    the entire place needs a coat of fresh paint  Following this stay we stayed at your other place which was much nicer 
435481202218800533,dirty It was so dirty when we checked in  The bottoms of our feet were literally black from walking around the apartment  there were stains on the counters and hairs in the beds and shower
470263802185534462,Great host  Perfect for our weekend trip  Thanks for hosting  Everything was perfect 
435460152168920856,The apartment is very nice  Minimal  but well equipped  bright and airy  We had a wonderful stay here  The rooftop is beautiful  very relaxing  places to sit  a grill and lovely pool  It wasn t too crowded when we were there  It does close a little early    pm  FYI   The gym was very well equipped  The only issues in the apartment was some extra clean was needed in a high touch area that was obviously missed  There are clean supplies in the apartment though so that was very helpful  No hangers in either closet so bring your own as there isn t any drawer space either  There is a parking garage across the street connected to the Sofitel where you can park   Check online for fees or pre pay   The  building and area itself is nice and I would recommend  The apartment is very nice and we had a lovely stay there  The coffee maker is a French press BTW  that was the one question I asked prior to coming and whoever responded did not know the answer  The only issues in the apartment were the closet doors were filthy  VERY obvious dirty finger handprints on both  sides of the door but I found clean supplies and clean them  The closet doors are a very high touch areas and they were clearly completely missed by the clean crew prior to our arrival which is not good especially with COVID  Hangers in the closet would be nice also as most folks don t travel with a bunch of hangers in regular suitcases 
477477700310504264,loved everything about my stay here loved everything about my stay  super cozy and relaxing  felt so safe and welcome
467355232863559051,We came to St Louis for our young daughter to have SDR surgery with Dr  Park  We met two other families going through the same thing while we were staying  We were all happy to be so close to the hospital and in a home that suited our needs  It was clean and had laundry dish detergent  The lobby staff was wonderful  Our medical stroller had flat tires and the whole staff rallied to find an air compressor  Those folks saved our day  We loved exploring Forest Park  too 
468114454085169469,Cool spot Accurate in description  Central Good value Time to do a bit of maintenance  Carpet is dirty and walls need touching up
465872225980341377,Cozy apartment on the ground floor  Right in the heart of the city  but when youre inside you would almost not know that  Easy access to great food and very kind neighbors  The apartment was clean  tidy and comfortable  I would highly recommend and will definitely book again  Thank you for the help with everything and providing a clean quiet place to stay the weekend 
481076417161442455,Great location  walk to CWE   We were able to park on the street  The door to the building was broken from Thursday to Monday   The comforter in one bedroom was dirty and I washed it and found the washer and pan under were dirty  One  suggestion would be to have a way to lock the unit when inside as the lock is connected to the code box  The location was great  but it was frustrating to not be able to use the door   to get in or out  in our building   We had to go to the building next door go down to the garage and walk over to the building and take the elevator up   Also people in the building were propping the door open which  also lessens  the security 
479669004695189338,It was ok but really missing the extras  the hospitality I have come to expect with AirBNB  Clean but kind of shabby  The building and location are great  Please fix the edge of the step into the bathroom  it is very sharp and dangerous  You really should make   keys available  it is nearly impossible for   people to use the building with one set  I also felt very uncomfortable leaving the keys in the unlocked apartment 
476762922810453669,Nicely furnished convenient apartment   Check in process went smoothly    I liked the memory foam mattress   Living room looks out over a park  Most restaurants in immediate neighborhood are closed  Cleanliness was just OK Maintenance needed  Microwave blew a fuse  towel rack in master bath fell out of wall  most heating vents are filthy  cook stove top has caked on food residue     Overall  not as clean as I expected
502184902691922604,Good last minute spot but it s a dungeon with window  Good last minute spot but it s a dungeon with window 
460113784971470522,In a great location  especially if you are in town for a Cubs game as it s less than a    minute walk to the field  Very quiet and an ideal location with a Whole Foods  Target and Starbucks close  Plus plenty of places close to eat   However  the place is in need of a deep clean  There were dust balls everywhere and trash and dirt under the bed and couch  Plus some other areas that may need some love   We did have some issues with check in  Check in was suppose to be at   and we got a message at      that said it wouldn t be ready until      because the clean lady was running behind  ironic because it wasn t the cleanest    The picture they sent with check in instructions didn t match what the place actually looked like  which lead to a lot of confusion  Then the code to the apartment door didn t work  causing us to be on hold for a while before we could talk to someone to get in  Once we talked to someone it was an easy process though   Free parking was hard to find the weekend we stayed  While it was a great location  I probably wouldn t spend the amount of money I did to stay there again  In need of a deep clean 
502151646107590746,awesome place  perfect location
476111931198329406,Clean Bnb   stocked too   in a nice neighborhood  It was a good space   the neighborhood was nice   it was stocked with everything and clean   and the host communication is good 
536272875252039408,Everything was ok but we wouldn t stay there again because of a few things that we encountered but I let Zencity know about it and hopefully they take care of it  Everything was okay other than the bug bites I endured while staying there and the things that was broken 
531854643748457531,Awesome place although checking in is a hassle 
538412055243425246,Great location  great value My stay was great overall  but someone should do something about the amount of dog poop that s around the sidewalks grass etc   
504407784353704941,The stay was great  cozy  and quiet  Everything about this apartment says relaxation  Check in was a bit of struggle  but once I figured it all out it was smooth sailing  The bed was comfortable  the rooms were clean  I can see my car from where I was  not that I was worried  Front desk was friendly and polite  and had no issues assisting  Overall  I had a great experience and would return for sure  Thanks for a great stay   I enjoyed my time alone  My father passed   year ago during Thanksgiving week  I needed some space and this apartment gave me the relaxation I needed  I would definitely return  Thanks again   I did want to mention  The tub drain kept clogging and filling up with water as I was showering  just a heads up 
536997305275825932,My group and I chose this AirBnB for the location and value  and while it is in a nice part of town  we could not have been more disappointed with the apartment and our experience with ZenCity   On the day that we arrived  we found folded towels with lipsticks stains  a folded comforter with a stain  and dirt between the sheets and comforter on one bed  Between that and the dirt visible on the rug  it was clear that this location was not clean hardly at all before our arrival  We ended up having to do laundry for all of the beds before we felt truly comfortable sleeping in them  There were also a couple of cracked glasses and countless scratches on the walls  but there was nothing we could do about that   The biggest issue we had was how dang COLD the apartment was  The window in the front window didnt seal properly  and so it was     degrees colder than the rest of the unit  The Nest Thermostat could be adjusted in a reasonable range  but after only about an hour or two  the heat would turn off  I assume to save money   This was at all times  not just at night  and so when we woke up or came back from a day of sightseeing  wed find a    degree apartment  I have pictures   with    hours until it reached our selected    degrees  This meant that our space was never comfortable enough to enjoy in the morning and evenings when we would WANT to use it   All of these issues went partially or fully unresolved  as ZenCity was absolutely impossible to reach out to  Every time a message came in or out  it was sent received by a new person after some time at ZenCity  which dragged   message conversations into hours long communications that would still leave the issue unresolved  It took   days for them to answer a question regarding where to dispose of garbage bags  and that was only after bringing up an additional issue on the  th  Regarding the temperature  they said that they adjusted settings on their end  only for the apartment to get slightly colder while we were asleep away   This stay and experience was honestly the only thing keeping us from having the perfect Chicago vacation  I would recommend staying as far away as possible from any unit managed by ZenCity 
517395224098468488,Hosts were very responsive to all my questions  Amazing place   perfect location 
545631114072673437,Really like a small home for me  It was a nice trip Very convenience  Thank you so much

475374207082816073,Great   bedroom apt in an excellent location  close to shopping  great restaurants  Forest Park  Wash U  Barnes Jewish Hospital and night life  The Central West End has a great energetic urban vibe  The apt was clean  modernly updated and well stocked  The on site gym was clean with cardio   weights  The club house room was a nice surprise  pool table and other games  The rooftop patio offers a great hangout place with awesome views of Forest Park  The only downsides are the lack of designated parking and the air conditioning is via window units that are a bit noisy rather than central air  Thanks for a great stay  Any chance that you can secure a parking space  Street parking can be difficult in the Central West End 
494895573697837179,The apartment looks exactly like it does in the pictures and has an amazing view of Kansas City  Very clean  The apartment looks exactly like it does in the pictures and has an amazing view of Kansas City  The door of the air bnb was very difficult to unlock  Had to get help from two people  Also  I think that the check in instructions could be more clear 
483339108652292203,They tried to charge me      for damaged and extra clean  but the pictures of the damage and mess were for a different unit and they wouldnt respond to messages to resolve  The location and unit were nice otherwise  They had Xfinity WiFi credentials  which required a bit of setup  but worked 
470262646138701648,This place is exactly as expected based on the pictures and description  It was comfortable and in a great location for our visit  Check in was easy  My only complaint was that there was no coffee  There was a french press and a coffee grinder  but a little coffee to get us started would have been appreciated  The apartment was nice  The people at the front desk were friendly  We were disappointed not to have found any coffee in the kitchen 
457156028112166557,Great place Ive enjoyed the night

475309804413815205,great apartment  we really enjoyed our stay  Thanks so much for having us   When we arrived the Airbnb smelled like cigarette smoke  which was a bit off putting  Also  the toilet in the en suite bathroom would not flush    Additionally  while we completely understand the need for monitoring noise and social gatherings especially with COVID  we were very mindful of our volume and yet received   noise alerts  despite hearing tons of noise from neighboring apartments    Lovely apartment and we overall had an amazing stay  just wanted to bring your attention to these things  Thanks 
475359696424487077,The toilet pressure and orwater mechanism is not good   I had to use a bucket to flush the toilet  so beware   Overall  the unit is in a great location and depicts the picture used to advertise it   Nice unit  The toilet mechanism or pressure needs to be addressed   I saw the toilet mentioned in one review and I figured it had been addressed   I had to use a bucket to flush the toilet  so please address this issue immediately   The kitchen cabinet handles need some attention as well      Thank you   Deborah

526858189980859127,Excellent communication throughout out booking and stay  The home is a cool historical home and very clean 
480465821858680462,A lovely renovated house with beautiful  thoughtful touches  great amenities and within a quiet neighborhood   Highly recommend staying here   Very responsive host who was able to accommodate us after our original  different airbnb fell through   Thank you again  Thank you so much for serendipitously saving the anniversary weekend for my partner  Randy  and I by accommodating us on such short notice   Your house was lovely and we admired the stained glass accents  decorative fireplace and beautiful woodwork   Thank you again  Amy   Randy
473823491907693779,First of all   great location  Forest Park  the zoo and art gallery  are across the street and a short walk away  The many restaurants of the Central West End are also close by and you are literally right next to the hospital complex   Check in  I arrived after   p m   was easy and the apartment itself was clean and comfortable     I really only have one complaint and this has been true of other AirBnB units I have stayed in  I like to cook for myself  especially during this pandemic  and the kitchen area is lacking A LOT of essential tools  I dont expect a gourmet kitchen but a dish drying mat  some spatulas and other cooking utensils would be a nice addition   Also  the coffee maker in the apartment is a french press  I get that its trendy to make coffee this way  but not everyone likes it or knows how to use it   A small drip coffee maker with some filters included would be a nice amenity   The biggest compliment I can give is to be a repeat user  Ive already reserved for a week in November  This is the second time I have stayed in a Zencity apartment in the Montclair and have booked again for dates in November  I appreciate the location as it is very close to my family I am visiting when I am in St  Louis  The apartment was clean and comfortable  I appreciate that   I do have a couple of suggestions     As someone who likes to cook at home  especially during this pandemic  it would be helpful if you stocked the kitchen with a few more tools like spatulas and cooking utensils       A dish drying mat would also be nice       I dont care to make coffee in a french press so I brought my own   cup drip coffee maker which I leave with my kids for the next time I stay in a Zencity apartment  The french press is very trendy  but unless you know what you are doing the coffee comes out tasting horrible      A few basic condiments would help  like salt and pepper  I have stayed in a few other AirBnBs in St  Louis and really appreciated the small selection of teas that were provided        Last but not least  you should fix the GFCI outlet in the bathroom which is not working  It was flashing red and would not reset  The value added by providing these few additional amenities far outweighs the cost  I realize that most of your tenants are probably only staying for a long weekend  will eat out much of the time and just want a place to crash  But for the few who stay a week or more  like me  these few things would really be appreciated  Thanks 
473169250503397227,Enjoyed my stay  everyone was very accommodating  Loved the view from the rooftop  Awesome place to stay in St  Louis 
528276650213585667,An amazing apartment 
479647480890668708,Great space  great location  Great space  great location  Check in picture of the door and lockbox wasn t accurate  Curtains could be better at covering the blinking signs at night in room by the kitchen  There s an exposed nail in the floor that caused injury in the bedroom near the living room 
479642521320958078,Good  The aparment is clean and has all you need Bad  If you are a light sleeper  do not rent this apartment or bring sleeping pills  You can hear the trains stations announcements all night long 
473895300050529450,Worst stay ever bathroom was not done walked in and the toilet was in the bathtub and they still have yet to fix the problem during my stay never told me that the bathroom wasn t completed i wouldn t have book the room then they had somebody come fix the bathroom during my stay early in the morning so i couldn t sleep they have not try to make any better far as refunding any money for the Inconvenience Worst stay ever bathroom was not done walked in and the toilet was in the bathtub and they still have yet to fix the problem during my stay never told me that the bathroom wasn t completed i wouldn t have book the room then they had somebody come fix the bathroom during my stay early in the morning so i couldn t sleep they have not try to make any better far as refunding any money for the Inconvenience
480386124283560342,Great location  area is nice  there is a gym  contactless check in and out  gated parking lot  nice space  beautiful kitchen and bathroom  Large walk in shower 
496345916840784802,This is a very nice and spacious property near everything as advertised  The rooms are very large and comfortable  We enjoyed a nice stay here and would recommend to anyone who is visiting UChicago or thereabouts  Parking can be a bit tricky but with some patience we were able to park every night during our stay  we were out most of the day   All in all a great stay  Greetings   I noticed that the shelves in the large kitchen cabinet  refrigerator side  are sagging in the middle  There is an easy fix for this  If you have your maintenance person cut a piece of  x  to the exact length needed  from floor of cabinet to height of plastic supports  and place it behind the center face board  it will support the shelf and will be invisible  You then cut a second piece measuring from the top of the now supported first shelf to the next level of plastic supports that hold the upper shelf and place it the same way directly behind the front face panel again  Its very effective and will prevent the shelf from eventually breaking  You can also place supports against the back wall in the same manner  Note  since the shelves have already sagged  you may have to turn them upside down and weight them   they should eventually flatten out  Anyway I thought I should let you know  All the best 
480373447886029292,The place was clean and spacious  Zencity was very accommodating and communicated effectively to make our stay easy  Thank you so much  The place was perfect
517458858071401524,Great location 
472406618089525634,Beautiful loft in a convenient location  Super comfy couch and bed  Thanks  Place looks great and comfortable  The mirror light in the bathroom doesn t work  Very clean and nice place 
457257514952751197,Location in wicker park is great  so great in fact that we sought out the same place for a second trip  No lie about being close to shops and entertainment  there s plenty to be had  From larger chains and gentrified stuff  to the local flair with a true character of its own    Place is roomy for Chicago  will stay again  Again a great trip made easy thanks to you hosting us in this property  Looking forward to staying again next year 
480375060402435514,Amazing location and view  This is such a nice Airbnb I really enjoyed my stay  Had a little trouble getting in  but customer service was helpful Thank you so much  I really enjoyed my stay
471717891084500864,Great location with access to walkable restaurants is the only positive of this place  My check in time was pushed back for someone to clean but it was not thoroughly clean  I had to clean the floors because there was still visible dirt and dust  I also found hair and dirt on tub  The wifi was terrible and did not work on my Macbook or iPad  I wanted to like it but I was only disappointed in the end  My check in time was pushed back for someone to clean but it was not thoroughly clean  I had to clean the floors because there was still visible dirt and dust  The bottom of my feet were black from the dirt  The mop was very dirty and I bet whoever used it did not check to see if it was clean before use   I washed it then clean the floors myself  I also found hair and dirt on tub  I clean that too  Im sure you found the leaning supplies I left to prove that  I wanted to like it but I was only disappointed in the end 
465196707776830090,Reservation was cancelled by host   minutes after the check in time   Because no notice was given  they stranded us without housing  forcing us to find a new place to stay after arriving in KC last minute    Ruined our trip   Wish I never booked with this host     
473165642897039652,Clean and secure building next to hospital  Forest Park  and within walking distance of lots of restaurants and two nice grocery stores  Parking can be tricky  but completely manageable and to be expected for the area 
537027360496316936,Where this loft is located   there really isnt much to do within walking distance but a very short      mins inexpensive Lyft ride   you are in the heart of the city    restaurants  movie theater  lounges  bars  The Arch  Busch Stadium   The Enterprise Center  So damn cool This loft is gorgeous  clean   easy to get too 
483272545699829028,Awesome place  clean  and close to everything   I appreciate being next door to Starbucks  Awesome place and location was great   Please consider changing the shower curtain liner 
456542374504129023,This was a good last minute spot to book  I appreciated that they were able to accommodate day of booking  It has the basics  nothing fancy  and could use a deep clean and some bath towels  An okay place to stay in a pinch  I appreciate the quick turnaround with check in as I made the reservation the day of 
544903737978064049,Very nice and clean  both free gated parking for one vehicle and then also free parking on the street  The dimly downfall  was finding the apt was a bit confusing  but I was able to find someone whom worked there to help me  I strongly suggest adding another sign to the door where the other G     rooms are located  I had to search for    mins for the apt  Luckily I finally found a lady who worked there to help me and she even had trouble finding it  When you look through the glass window on the door it looks like there s just a gym on the other side  no other hallways or apts etc  So this is very confusing to many others I ve spoke with in the building as well as other Airbnb people renting there also   Other then that maybe explain that the black smart lock on the doors light up if u tap on them  and that s how u enter the access code to the door  Even someone young like me didn t know about it until I had to call and get help to get n the room   Everything else was perfect though  thank you 
526100821060361949,The apartment is very nice and comfortable  Location is very convenient  near shops and public transport  Would definitely stay here again  We loved the place except for the strong smell Im not sure if it was weed  that was on the hallway and bath vent 
476072917420623131,Place is nicely located with good views of surrounding University neighborhood  Everything worked well  No complaints  Good idea to leave door open a crack on first entry  Avoids headaches
476070802728927799,Best spot downtown
545723283883382737,Nice comfortable place great location
435426769481837305,Beautiful place communication does need some work never found the key fob therefore I wasn t able to utilize the pool or any amenities and had to call every time I wanted to enter the premises at which one point I stood outside for    mins trying to enter  Wrote the host   times no reply about the key fob  Other than this the place was amazing and great for the price  Thanks for the beautiful place communication does need some work never found the key fob therefore I wasn t able to utilize the pool or any amenities and had to call every time I wanted to enter the premises at which one point I stood outside for    mins trying to enter  Wrote the host   times no reply about the key fob  Other than this the place was amazing and great for the price 
435415599641308220,The only issue we had was getting the keys to the apartment as many other reviews have stated  The code to get the keys does not work  I called the number to get help  the call took    minutes and they had to open the the box the key fob is in from their end  The apartment itself is nice but it s a small studio  literally only enough room for the bed and the chair you see in the picture  That was fine for what we needed as we weren t there much  The kitchen  bath and closet are nice size  The microwave is tricky  we thought it was broken but we googled it and you have to open the door  put the time you want in  close the door then push start  The location is perfect in my opinion  I know KC very well  All in all it was a good stay but if you keep having the same problem with getting keys you d think they d fix it at some point  The check in process seems to be an ongoing issue as far as getting the keys to the actual apartment  The code did not work  so I had to call the number to get help  I was on the phone call for    mins to get the keys 
435410405814948646,The building was great  clean and quiet for such a big building  The studio apt was located on a upper floor and was on the side so you didn t the front traffic  A great plus s is bill C no have to park on street no   Fib keep   I m   M   M  Thanks for a wonderful stay    the only thing that was a minor problem was getting the key from the key box    the code that was sent to me did not work I had to call and have the key box remotely opened 
434782617314006258,Beware   this company is extremely difficult to work with    I came here to stay the weekend with a friend of mine  We wanted two separate sleeping spaces  this listing says it sleeps   people  Sounds great  When the trip got closer  I looked through the pictures and saw there s a double bed and a small couch  I messaged the AirBnB owners to make sure the couch is a pull out  confirming we ll have enough space    They said NO  this isn t a pull out  The couch looks like a loveseat  so I ask them if it s a big enough couch for an adult to sleep on  They refuse to answer my question and instead ask why I need to know if only   people are staying  Valid question  I respond that we aren t planning to share the bed  that s why we chose a place that fits   people  so we can spread out    I ask how they accommodate   people  They refuse to answer  I remind them that this is false advertising  and ask them to explain how they accommodate   people again  Eventually  they ignore me because I m asking for a refund    Is that allowed  To just ignore your client   Here s where it gets weirder when we show up  the couch IS a couch bed  This whole thing could ve been alleviated  It was so strange    The place is fine  the company is super difficult and does not treat its customers with respect  I d stay elsewhere to avoid a scam  I asked repeatedly how you could claim   people slept here  You ignored all my questions  Extremely inappropriate behavior for a business  That s a very valid question 
457244514841814580,Great on site front desk staff  Great on site front desk people  Zen city was also very helpful
476082656988728165,Great location  The beds were really comfortable 
410058235371822122,We had a lovely and unique stay in this beautiful historical home  Centrally located so youre never more than    minutes away from the River Market  Crossroads  Country Club Plaza and Brookside  The beds were comfortable and the neighborhood nice and quiet  Hello  Thank you for opening your lovely home to us  It was a very unique stay in a historical home  Overall we had a nice time  though there are a few maintenance things I would recommend fixing  the fridge was set to    degrees but our items kept freezing over  the downstairs bathtub shower head sprays water everywhere when used  and the positioning of the upstairs shower head made it difficult to take a shower without getting tangled up in the shower curtains 
434767822059801189,The location is right in the middle of downtown KC  We had an absolute blast  We had a great time  Our only complaint was that the cookware was lacking 
470313642853974603,Lovely place  Convenient to shops  restaurants and park   Yet no dedicated parking the Doormen were very knowledgeable and happy to share free parking locations for our stay  I would suggest having a few extra towels  maybe a air purifier and details about trash take out and expectations of cleanup for linen   Overall really enjoyed the place 
460873836129354793,I had a great stay at this Zencity location  I was in town for my sisters wedding  which was at the Thompson hotel around the corner  The apartment was spotless  check in was easy  and the location cant be beat  Would definitely stay here again  Thank you for an awesome stay 
495709173802898686,Clean  Great view  Check in was tricky Need easier check in
511619891618204746,Very nice location  Walking distance to the Plaza and just a few miles to downtown  Description was accurate and the apartment was nice size  I want to say thank you for allowing us to use this apartment  It is in a very nice location close to the plaza and downtown  We had a lot of fun and look forward to visiting again in the future  Just so you know most things were perfect with the apartment  Two items we noticed that need repairs was the furnace let the room get very cool before it would kick on  The other was a little mold in the corner of the shower tub  Thankyou again and Happy Holidays   Jeff and Cheryl
495628664870929758,This was a much nicer apartment than expected right in downtown with everything we wanted to do close by  Great safety measures in the building and parking garage  All the information for checking in   out was very detailed   clear  We really enjoyed our stay here 
434754006810953819,Great value  nice neighborhood  super classy and fun place  I had a difficult time at check in because the intercom at the door didn t come on  I had to wait for a tenant to let me in  Other than that it was great  really nice place 
541362706897516039,This was a great place to stay  Clean and matched all descriptions perfectly  Definitely recommend  Thanks for the stay  No complaints at all 
534125347613306400,The apartment was great and exactly as specified Add some sort of emergency contact number for the building
470317030599107854,We had a great stay here  The apartment and building were just what we needed and Zencity was a responsive host  Would definitely recommend  Thanks  We had a great stay    One add that would be nice to have is cooking spray  Other than that it all worked for us 
484007973088366063,Great place    even better location   Would stay here again Couldn t turn on light on in bedroom and only one in the bathroom
475298840042413574,Great location
517375676053034146,Great location  clean apartment  and safe area   The view is amazing   Id highly recommend this place for personal or business trips  Thanks 
512283369452850577,Convenient location with easy check in  The free on site parking is easy to access and a nice bonus  We would definitely stay here again for a future trip 
434733510334227080,Great location   clean   very spacious   BR apartment   Soft towels and a comfortable bed   Felt very safe here  I would stay again   Beautiful property overall   Parking on the street was not an issue and there is a great coffee shop on the north corner  The apartment and location were perfect for me   I did have trouble with the intercom and Im sure you know this has been an issue in the past  The smoke detector beeped all night for   nights and I sent you a message but received no reply   Needless to say It was very disturbing   I would welcome a free night when I return in Oct to see my    year old mother      You might consider purchasing a better wine bottle opener and the TV remote needs new batteries   Thank you again   Jackie from Florida 
434713797263734507,Excellent location   Very clean apartment   Check in can be a little difficult  need the key card to use the elevator  but cant get the key card without going into the room    I just explained the situation to other tenants in the building  who were friendly and helpful  or I just used the stairs   I would definitely stay here again  Check in procedure could be improved   Need the key card to use the elevator and cant get the key card until you get in the room   Recommend stating to use the stairs for check in and check out    th floor is not too bad for the stairs    I ended up getting into the room to get the card  then going back to my car to get my luggage  and then doing the reverse when I checked out     Also got a noise complaint when I wasnt even in the room   Not sure what happened there   No details on the text message I received    Thank you for letting me stay   I enjoyed the apartment and the location was great 
544901918749185802,Great stay   Good location  reasonable pricing   Liked the use of the gym   Would def come back here  Huge pot smell in hallway   Seems like facility should be non smoking   No worries  it didnt bother me   Zencity Netflix was maxed out with other users 
434712312815766952,WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN   When I arrived to the building I looked at the entrance directions that were sent by Zencity  They appeared to be very clear and I assumed I would have no problem   I WAS WRONG  First off you have enter THREE codes to get to your room  First  to get to the lobby you have to  enter the unit number on the intercom   sure no problem  First I enter      THE UNIT NUMBER   the buttons stick and enter           Great  after a few tries i get it enter     properly  Then the speaker box rings where then im supposed to say another passcode into the speaker box  The speaker rings once then I get an error message  unable to complete call    So after    minutes of trying to figure out what is happening someone happened to be leaving the lobby and asked  Air BNB  This happened to me too  Someone let me and activated the elevator for me  They told me it happened to them too  But its fine when you get up there youll have a key waiting and you can use it to get in from now on  Okay so annoying but no big deal  He lets me up  I get upstairs and enter my room with a THIRD CODE  I get in the room and there is no key  NO KEY  So now I cant leave the building without having repeat this entire process  I send a message to Zencity   no answer  I call the phone number and get a hold of someone named Asheen  Hes the lone guy managing the phones for the all the Zencity Airbnbs  He tells me it can take       hours to get me a key      Im here for    hours how is this going work when I have to leave for business  Then he says he has a new code for me to try so I go back downstairs and try it  it doesnt work    So now im STUCK in the lobby with no ability to get upstairs  Asheen tried a few more codes and even he couldnt decipher what the instructions meant  So then he got off the phone to try to get a hold of someone else in the company  I sat in the lobby for    minutes to an hour with NO IDEA when id get back upstairs  And even if I did i still wouldnt be able to leave to conduct the business I traveled to do  I eventually get a call back with a code to a lockbox that has an extra keycard   If not for Asheen continually calling to other Zencity employees I would have been stuck there for who knows how long  I then requested a call back from management about the issue which I NEVER GOT   If I was an older person or a foreign traveler it would have been so much harder to figure this out and could have been much worse   What kind of person thinks THREE DIFFERENT security codes is a good plan to enter a building  elevator and room is a good idea  If your phone dies or you lose it your screwed  if you dont write the code down on paper and lose it your screwed  if you arrive and you dont have  key card and you cant get a hold of someone youre screwed   I was the third person this happened to THAT DAY   Just stay somewhere else that has a normal entrance process instead of something thats more of a pain that entering the Pentagon  Have someone who can actually explain something properly rewrite the  how to get into the building  section  Also no one wants to enter   different codes to get into a building  Its obnoxious
433992936450250661,Amazing place to stay  Not over the top  Has everything you need  especially if traveling alone     out of    Perfect stay  I will look to book with you next time I m in town
469513436222381812,GREAT STAY  Quality is great but the location draws in shitty people  I m glad that the place is set up to be secure 
433352306250061183,Great place and conveniently located Great place 
433310318337849955,Pretty decent place to stay for a couple nights  The location is fine and only a block from the tram line  which is free   there is also a good daily rate parking lot nearby  Our issue was the check in process    They leave the fob to enter the building in the room and apparently have a code system to let you in the building without it  This did not work at all  you also need a fob to use the elevator  which wouldn t work with their system regardless  I tried to call them and received no answer for a few minutes  eventually a security guard came and led us to the unit    As a side note  which isn t a huge issue  the couch and bed are quite uncomfortable  That s a matter of opinion though so take that as you will  the couch in this unit is really bad  the cushions slide off very easily and it is hard to actually sit on for more than a few minutes 
432616989184937333,Great place  just little damages around the apartment  Other than that everything was great 
431800456477724722,Great place to stay  Very quiet and in the heart of everything  Quick communication Great place to stay  Very quiet and in the heart of everything
484065855965760777,Easy stress free stay  Thankful for another reliable stay
477484940926449362,Enjoyed our stay
511561185670312134,Cleanliness was spot on  We ran into some issues with checking in since they didn t send us a code for the door  along with pluming issues with the shower that never got resolved  Otherwise the location was absolutely amazing  I appreciate the cleanliness of the property and room  I partially blame myself for not addressing the shower situation sooner however  we here hardly in the room due to hanging out and enjoying the city  I still wish that was something that could ve been fixed due to the fact that we both took one shower and wasn t able to take any more since which upsets me  Other than that and the check in issue with not receiving the door code and being locked out for       mins in the beginning I felt generous enough to still leave a decent review for you all due to attempting to address each situation to the best of your abilities  Thank you 
545700121296681802,It s was a nice place for a few days n love the view  Everything was clean and where things can be find 
431140403065995325,Easy check in  really clean and the comforters and towels were like clouds  The location is great with general access to the city  The washer and dryer in the unit also came in clutch  I would stay again and recommend  Hello   The stay was really great  Easy to check in and the place was clean  The only thing that stood out was one of the beside wall lamps was hanging out of the wall upon arrival  so I put it back in the wall  It s the left side wall lamp of the bedroom nearest the entrance  Other than that  I enjoyed my stay    Regards  Tim
456519562877784679,Cool little spot  Roof top is legit  Would stay again Great stay  Only thing is outside keypad doesn t work so if you try and check in late you can t get in
430412734168858243,This was one of the best Air BnB s I ve stayed in  Everything was super clean and the check in was super easy  The information sent to me by Zencity was easy to follow for check in and I had no problems  The hardest part was parking but I found it easiest to park on Walnut behind the building by the residential entrance that you re supposed to go through anyway    There s actually a restaurant and bar called the Canary down below in the lobby area which was super cool and a fun addition  My only warning for anyone else staying here is that the unit isn t super sound proof so you may hear some neighbors  That didn t bother me personally but if you re a light sleeper it may    Other than that it was a great spot close to LOTS of other places  You re only half a mile away from the Westport area and all the restaurants and bars there so we never had a lack of places to go  Highly recommend  Loved the space  Thank you so much 
431076934855152186,Great location   Clean beautiful little mini condo in a cool old historical building   Would definitely stay again   Great value for the buck too and a great timely responsive host  Thanks for the stay   Loved the location and the cool spot   Couldn t figure out how to turn on the ceiling light in the kitchen   And the elevators were wonky   But loved the stay otherwise 
479694632191434366,This unit is on the  rd floor accessible by circular stairs only  Beware if bringing luggage  Stairwell is dirty   Unit accessed off an alley and if motion sensor light on building across isn t working you can t see well to enter the door code to enter stairwell  Unit could use a good clean and old items replaced  The wall vent needs to be clean and the hot water kettle is gross and needs to be replaced  The trash cans are beat up and the soap dispenser in the bathroom doesn t work and looks gross as well   Overall the worst Airbnb I ve ever stayed in
534026373808271458,Clean place and a decent view of downtown  Location isn t the best and the parking spot is like a block away  Also you can hear other people in the building easily
429638959810406290,This place was in the perfect location for my family to enjoy all the things that Kansas City had to offer 
430386998430499897,Great location and friendly staff     Perfect for what I was in town for and for an area of town I absolutely enjoy  The room was clean and access to building parking was amazing  I was a little thrown off by not being able to get into the room by  pm which pushed back my appointment but I understood the clean conditions when I arrived  I spoke with customer service a few times upon arrival and they were amazing  I even was able to speak with maybe had been a clean personal that was in charge of the keys and kudos to her because she was very nice and seemed like she was working hard  All in all amazing stay and pleasure to book through 
429673995462031964,This was the perfect place to stay near Country Club Plaza  The space was very nice and new  Perfect for families looking for a great value 
572530731196279466,We booked last minute and was excited to find a place a block away from the magnificent mile  This was the perfect location for an impromptu Chicago trip  The place appeared clean and stocked  But we had some issues with the apartment    The first morning when making French press coffee  it was discovered that the provided French press was cracked and leaked everywhere  I messaged Zencity and the response I got was  did you take a picture  Ummmmm no  I clean it up and messaged the owner  No concern was given  I had to go to Starbucks to get our coffee   The place was also not as clean as it appeared  The bathroom mat had hair all over it  The vent in the kitchen was so black from dirt dust  There were some coffee cups that were immediately placed in the dishwasher because the were not clean   The towel bar and toilet paper holder kept falling off   The shower s water pressure was a joke and the tub drained sooooo slowly that our feet took a bath while we showered   It was very annoying having to put in a code to get in the building and a different one to get into the apartment  Every other high rise apartment we ve stayed in had a key fob to use during the stay  Not a dealbreaker but very annoying    We didn t let this ruin our short trip  The location was perfect but the place needs some attention  We were extremely disappointed with the apartment  Some things really upset us with the apartment      The place was most definitely not clean   Most of the coffee cups in the cabinet were dirty or stained beyond clean and placed in the dishwasher   The bathroom rug had hair all over it   The vent in the kitchen had so much dirt on it  I have a picture   I couldn t possibly see how any air moved though it      The French press that was in the cabinet was cracked  When I poured water in it  water started leaking everywhere  I messaged our first morning and no remedy was offered      The towel and toilet paper holder fell off repeatedly  I have a picture   All the fittings were loose and every time we dried our hands or tried to use the towel bar  it just fell off  We had to take off the toilet paper roll off the holder in order for it to be useful      It was very very annoying to have to put in the codes every time we wanted to get back in  This is the only place if this type that required putting in a code more than once  Every other had a key fob for ease of access      The shower pressure was a joke but that didn t stop the tub from not draining  So we had to shower while our feet got a dirty bath   It s apparent that every expense was spared when renting this place  We have stayed in dozens of airbnbs and can tell when little effort was put forth in renting this 
545611601510146450,Great safe on site   The front desk staff is amazing    The location can t be beat   I had a horrible sewage stench in my unit   It was unlivable   Maintenance agreed  but zencity did nothing about it and management would not return my repeated calls and emails  I do not recommend   While it is a great value and location  zencity is I responsible and unreliable should something go wrong with one of their units  I wanted to love this place   It would have been a great value while I stayed in St  Louis to be with my hospitalized mother   However  the unit smell horribly   I begged to be moved and while everyone acknowledged the smell of sewage that permeated throughout the unit and even agreed that no one else could stay until the problem was fixed  no one helped me   My repeated requests were ignored 
535463985518214423,A wonderful and CLEAN place to stay especially if you are immunocompromised and getting treatment at Barnes  It s only a few minutes walk and the Barnes parking garage is very near   The accommodations are very sanitary  decorated tastefully and in a safe neighborhood with so many food options that you can easily get delivered as well  The host is very friendly and you can easily reach them by message  Overall had a lovely stay and will definitely choose Zencity when I m in St Louis  Also the highway is super nearby  Thank you so much for this amazing place  It s made my stay in St Louis a lot more enjoyable  I came for a transplant at Barnes and as you can imagine it can be very anxiety provoking  Having a place that is so clean and near to the hospital really made my mind at ease  Truly thank you 
545723142154470020,I ve stayed with zen city before and had no issue this time was not the best there was no remote in the unit so I was unable to watch tv I was told multiple times a remote was dropped off to my unit and was sent photos but the u to I was getting photos of was not mine I also had several oil stain  hand prints over the walls in the bedroom and the communication turn around seemed to take forever
455749214333240557,Could have been great   Wonderful location   Historic building    But    I had consistent trouble over several days getting through a security door   Contact person seemed surprised to be contacted   No follow up after several contacts to note the issues   It was a basement apartment with little light  stained and broken chair and a noisy and uncomfortable bed   Great claw foot tub  should be noted for those with accessability issues   Disappointing and if it were not for the love I have for the neighborhood and being there  I would have subtracted a star   Bad and inconsistent communication and service  I wanted to say positive things about my experience  really   I love Hyde Park and the Blackstone Villa has such historic meaning   I went to school at U of C and always look forward to being back  Your information about the room was misleading   And there was never any follow up when I had problem after problem getting into the building   I am just grateful for the amount of people who were residents that assisted me in getting through the security door and into the building   The room had little light because of the basement  the hallway smelled of sewage several times  the smoke alarm in the hall went off the entire time I was there  even after I alerted the maintenance people   There was never a check in to see if things were ok after I noted a problem to you   I called the contact number who was surprised by my call   This was the worst communication problem I have had on AirBnB  by far   In fact  I have NEVER had problems with communication with any other location over many years   And the worst bed I have ever slept on too 
514556051351860516,Great unit  pay attention to the check in instructions so that locating the unit is a breeze  I like the gated parking for safety  Friendly neighborhood and close to the highway  Very nice unit  the instructions made it easy to find  The WiFi didn t work  none of the options were available even after contacting customer support  I didn t like that the thermostat locks at    degrees 
460153545135730197,This spot is the perfect location if you plan to be out and about most of the weekend    and home late after a few drinks  Like the other reviews mention  the bars downstairs are loud till       AM on weekends  so if you dont sleep well  this is not the place to stay  Its also not the nicest cleanest place  so if you cant stand a weird bathroom fan smell or odor coming from the dishwasher  then again  I would probably steer clear of this place  The Wi Fi was a bit spotty at times    I recommend going to Philz Coffee up the street if you need to WFH  Halligan  right downstairs  is an awesome pub to catch a football game or to kill time  King of Cups  half block down Lincoln Ave  is this medieval themed speakeasy that is pretty awesome if youre looking for tasty cocktails  Dash of Salt is a solid brunch spot on that same block  I had probably the best gyro of my life at Athenian Room  which is around Oz park  SW of the apartment  If youre visiting with intentions to party and have a convenient home base to hang at in Lincoln Park  then this is a pretty affordable option in my opinion  I would not  however  choose this airbnb if I was in town for work or needed a comfy place to get a good nights sleep  We enjoyed our time in Chicago    the location of the apartment was perfect  However        something must be done about the bathroom  The toilet can barely flush  and the fan reeks of sewage      Same with the dishwasher  We ran it once and the entire apartment smelled awful  Again  of sewage      There were hairs all over the mattress when we showed up  so wasnt sure if they were clean      Wi Fi was very slow and spotty at times      We knew going into staying there that it would be loud  but you should really put a disclaimer on the listing that lets customers know just how loud it really gets  It was   AM on Saturday and the music was still pumping downstairs at Hook   Ladder  For people that arent going out  thats gotta be really annoying 
475293677803588725,Clean and orderly  Clean and orderly 
542011914968577801,Great spot  Easy check in  Convenient location  only minutes from dowtown  Beautiful apartment  decorated   well taken care of  Bed   couch were comfy  Appreciated the enclosed parking  Will stay again  Thank for having us  Loved your spot  No complaints

455789212744246107,This place is the worst Airbnb I ve ever experienced  The place is very super dirty  We walked barefoot in the room and our feet were dark  Dust is everywhere in the room especially on the carpet in the living room  My one year old niece sat there and she got rashes all over her legs  We also found glasses and foods on the floor too   I smelled like someone head on the pillow in my bedroom which was very disgusting  I knew right away they didnt change the bed sheet for us   When I first used the microwave  I found a piece of chicken left in there   I told the host what we faced  and the cleaner came to clean again after   days The communication was very bad because you would get reply in a few days or never  The ONLY good thing about this place is location    Place looks exactly like in the photos  If the host care more about cleanliness  this place would be great
505112374058346604,Very clean accommodation with all the basic kitchen equipment one would need   oil  salt and pepper  dishes and pans  etc  The stove and oven could use a deep clean though  And the mattress feels a bit  cheap  and a stiff  Everything was great  more environmentally friendly house products would be appreciated  Also  there werent any equipment for the oven   oven mitts  cookie sheets  etc 
470972155772311831,Great stay  nice apartment with a view North towards Union Station  crown plaza etc  Check in and out was easy  no issues during the stay Great place  wonderful view  If you allow more than   guests in the apartment  I booked saying    have   sets of towels in the bathroom  You had extra sheets for the couch but not towels    For the kitchen  measuring cups spoons would be a good addition for people cooking  Otherwise  good place
457954397327215005,The unit itself was spacious and comfortable  very clean   After reading other reviews I was prepared for the check in process   What I didnt plan for was the check out process as I somehow locked myself out of the garage   Recommend moving car out of garage prior to leaving keys in unit   Additionally there is a  th floor cut through from garage to apartments that took me a couple days to find  I would stay here again   We had a wonderful trip and did all the fun things 
528267737240891082,Great location  seamless check out  and close to everything with nice restaurants and bars near by  Great experience  only negative was the hot water didn t work the first night I stayed there 
501512298076058833,Super cool spot   Easy to park   Pizza place connected to it   Can t go wrong  Great place  Clean and easy to access        would recommend
461516735568692923,Excellent location  comfortable flat  No hot water in the shower during the first   days  later solved  Pictures dont match the actual flat    thanks
461435094479266389,Horrible  Would not recommend  Set us up for check in on Sunday   Office was not open on Sundays to retrieve key fob   No correspondence  would not answer phone       would NOT recommend 
460157285547973176,   The check in process did not go as planned  The code sent to me  for the lockbox downstairs was incorrect  The box kept responding that the code wasn t recognized  I had to call the emergency number and an individual remotely opened the box to give me access to the key       The tub doesn t drain  There was hair and other things that came up from the drain when I turned the shower on  The tub also had hair and other matter in the tub  The shower curtain also needs to be replaced   clear and very sticky      The clean sign posted near the front door of the apartment had no new dates  so I m not sure the apartment was clean prior to my arrival      The WiFi network posted by the door did not exist  I had to use another WiFi network and just so happens the password worked      I had difficulty returning the key  I had to ask my Uber driver to wait for my while I called the emergency number and then ultimately had to restart the machine for it to work properly   My flight was at  am and I almost missed it 
480434908574163595,Very clean and such a convenient check in and check out process  A great weekend getaway with fun places right within walking distance  We greatly enjoyed our stay  thanks again 
571062129203891993,This is a great location in Hyde Park  Bad for parking  Close to local stores and near lake shore drive  Had no problems at all  Place was great  perfect for what I needed  beside finding parking it was good
470285073965407441,This is    minutes from everything you ll want to do if you re visiting Chicago  Yes the room was nice and you re in a safe spot and also a decent price since you are so far from everything  The only thing I can complain about is having to drive anytime we wanted to do anything 
528327150442913549,The Good  Clean  convenient location  quiet  decent price for what you get  bedrooms spacious and comfortable  The Bad  Hokey gaps in the LVP flooring and bad drywall repairs  could use more towels and washcloths considering we got   towels and   washcloths for a   person   day stay  the pictures make the living room look big but in reality the furniture is very small and uncomfortable to sit in  Is like the whole area was designed for someone who is      The post says no parking  but we were given parking by the building and then had it taken away the last day  Theres a parking garage about a block away for     a night  but street parking is very limited    Note  If these things dont matter to you and youre just looking for somewhere to crash while you explore St  Louis  then its not too bad considering the price and location     mins from downtown   We really didnt mind  but I figure people should know the reality of what they are paying for 
534114050809257908,Great spot  I did not like the photo of the nude woman on the wall in the bedroom 
461544912960850242,love it  close to everything
546129913694105624,Good
532669795556775173,Lovely apartment and perfect location   Cant wait to return  Lovely apartment and fantastic location   Hope to be back  
502227778027506793,Great value  nice space  Thank you  Your place was great for my purposes 
518146822082310814,The apt was very nice and affordale and right in the heart of the central west end  highly recommended our stay was great and the apartment was very nice and affordable right near whole foods in the CWE  would highly recommend this place to stay at
461574485307038941,Comfy accommodations  right across the street from Whole Foods  and nearby to a host of walkable neighborhood dining options  Good to be back with you guys  Looking forward to more regular travel to from St  Louis again 
545648281120723613,Very nice place  right across the street from Forest Park  Would come back 
568843792070219155,Good location if Hyde Park is where you need to be  I stayed in this property for an entire month  For the first       weeks I could not actually take a proper hot shower  Magically the temperature of the hot water was adjusted building wise toward the end of my stay  The bed was extremely comfortable  The two stools at the counter are so broken down they are nearly impossible to sit in and there is really no other seating provided 
534049136711572387,Would stay again
480387287017014610,Great location in the CWE with easy access to WashU School of Medicine  BJC  and Forest Park  Clear directions were provided for entry into the space  which was clean and spacious for our group of    Would recommend if you are visiting this part of St  Louis 
484525436386907262,Check in was extremely difficult and overall process was not smooth   After entering the code given into the intercom outside  there was no response to be let into the building   Luckily someone was walking out so we were able to get inside   Once inside  the lockbox to access the key was unplugged and it took over an hour to reboot to obtain the room key  Check in was extremely difficult   Could not get in the front door with the instructions given and key lockbox inside was unplug so we were unable to get our key  Process took more than   hours
455781421626628247,Good location  Description of the unit is accurate  Would stay again  It would be nice to have a Keurig type coffee maker in the unit  We enjoyed our stay 
484718837195875833,The place was great  Clean room  nice building with huge gym and pool  Street parking was not so hard to find  However the card key didn t work at all so I had to use pass code every time I enter the bldg  I saw ppl using fob to get in  but overall it was good 
515238866410775370,Had a great stay here  Great location in walking distance to all the bars restaurants  and park  Very clean and comfortable spot  Thank you  Thank you 
545813732958241298,The property I originally tried to rent became unavailable  so we were offered another property in a different location  When I went on to accept the request change  i realized this property was a studio when we had originally rented a   bedroom with city views  This listing was  also somewhere around        less a night  so I asked if we could refunded the difference and was told they would be  checking with management   I didn t hear anything back for over   hrs  despite checking back in to see if our request had been accepted  After    hours of no response  we got a message that our property was no longer available and that we needed to cancel  We received this message after just having landed on KC from California  Needless to say our experience was less than pleasant  I would not recommend renting from this management company as they are unreliable and not accommodating  The property I originally tried to rent became unavailable  so we were offered another property in a different location  When you were sending me the link to ask if the replacement property was acceptable  the link wouldn t work after   different attempts to resend it to me  When I went on to accept the request change  i realized this property was a studio and was listed somewhere around        less a night  I asked if we could refunded the difference and was told you would be  checking with management   I didn t hear anything back for over   hrs  despite checking back in to see if our request had been accepted  After   th a of no response  we got a message that our property was no longer available and that we needed to cancel  We received this message after just having landed on KC from California  Needless to say our experience was less than pleasant 
470210859164592423, 
484078686599277467,Very flexible and understanding  Took some time on occasion to answer the phone but was very prompt on responses once answered  Awesome job Very flexible and understanding  Took some time on occasion to answer the phone but was very prompt on responses once answered  Awesome job
466668142900040820,The room has roaches   mice running around  Bring bug  killers   mice traps with you if you book this place They was roaches  and mice in the apartment  it was very nasty 
491298306946712232,A great spot in a very cool little town east of Kansas City   The location was perfect for taking in a Chiefs game as well 
484777154714507139,Clean and quite  The best place we have stayed and we have stayed at many in St  Louis 
542043714500311190,Very nice stay  Wonderful place  Excellent service  I didn t like that noise alarm goes off with the sound of the tv on a regular volume but other than that  LOVED IT  Thanks for the amazing stay  Just wish the noise wasn t a bother especially being that no neighbors even complained or heard us after we asked them
461604509628325436,Amazing views Thanks  Second time staying in one of your places  Always a great experience
516702962631615502,Very clean  Great location   Bed was comfortable especially after a long night out  Very clean and great location 
457258856892946245,Airy  bright apartment with nice views of the lake   although the windows are high so you can only see out when you are standing up   Easy check in  and the Zencity communications staff were very responsive to text and email   They only had   forks  we were   people   but quickly offered to  bring another when we asked about it   Also quickly offered to fix a slow drain   Other guests have complained about cleanliness  but we found it very clean when we arrived   Restaurants and shops not right next door  but not too far  either         minute walk to shops coffee        mins to U Chicago  Thank you for your responsiveness   It was great to have quick responses to my questions   I do hope you are able to fix the plumbing and add to the forks  spoons and knives for the next guests   THanks again 
512998666244113538,Very clean and comfortable stay with easy check in 
523198350435302889,Perfect location within walking distance of the plaza  very clean with lots of available silverware  cups  and dishes for stay at home diners Perfect location and surprisingly quiet at night given the downtown location  thanks again for having us 
567367615564405797,Comfortable  cozy two bedroom  We enjoyed the apartment and the great location  There were a number of spots on the wall that had been patched  but not yet painted   We enjoyed being able to make french press coffee in the unit   One of the down filled blankets had been folded and put away while still damp  glad we were able to put it in the dryer 
461545720029650744,Honestly I thought this apartment and building were totally gorgeous  Great deal  Cute neighborhood and bed was the most comfortable I ve ever slept on in an air bnb or hotel  Loved it  Hey guys thanks so much I did love the place  Took a minute to find the apartment because that one door looks at first like it s just the door to the gym only hahaha my bad on that should have known but I walked around a lot  Also had to call the door code didn t work but I will say super easy fix the guy I spoke with was very helpful and your apartment building and apartment all of that was so amazing I loved it  Super comfy bed
539866866282870625,Great place  Great price  Great hosts  What else is there to say other than HIGHLY RECOMMENDED    
518182787137883393,great place 
566717920764145319,Terrific stay in the magnificent Del Prado building  Stone s throw away from Lake Michigan  Easy walking access to   rd Street shops  coffee shops  restaurants  and churches  including St  Paul and the Redeemer   Lovely accommodations  Helpful service  We ll be back  A great experience in a beautiful location  One note  there was an odor of cigarette smoke in the apartment  even though the space was marked smoke free 
496387169487097655,Great location  Nice apt  Well appointed  No complaints at all    The front door of the apt wouldn t lock  And also the access via the phone box downstairs doesn t work 
528225999392262353,The home was just as advertised  VERY clean and well kept  SO much space   It was perfect for our quick Christmas family gathering  The kiddos has their own floor to play in  leaving the adults to visit undisturbed  for the most part  downstairs  If you need a place with LOTS of space  responsive hosts  and a great location   this is the spot for you   Highly recommend  Thank you so much  Our stay was great and it was the perfect setup for our Christmas gathering  A couple of just small suggestions   A luggage rack in the bedrooms would be nice  No place for suitcases except the floor  And a spot to hang towels would be great as well  Even if its just a hook in the bedroom   We always try and reuse towels and not dirty a new one each day but its hard to do when you dont have anyplace to hang them to dry  Minor things   just suggestions  It was a great house and a great stay  Thank you very much  
546333153971527101,Unit        the place it s self is fine    However   it is a two bedroom that has only one key for the apartment and only one key fob to enter the apartment complex   The unit is on the   th floor that requires key fob the enter building and key fob to access the elevator    Entry to the unit requires another key   We had two business travelers and Zencity  refused to help us secure another key and fob for our four day stay   We had to hide a key in the hallway  on an emergency exit sign so we both had access to the unit    Anytime one left or one of us went to bed we had to hide the key on the exit sign  Luckily building security was kind to us and let us in the building when needed and got us on elevator that you needed key fob for   There was no where to hide the  Fob so one of us always had to have it  This was business travel and my coworker and I were on different schedules   Total inconvenience   After a long day of travel and checkin issues  followed by calls to Zencity customer service about the key issue  decided to take a shower the first night   There was zero hot water in the unit   Called Zencity again their response was there is low water pressure in the building run the water for a longer period of time    Ran all faucets for    minutes no hot water   Zencity informed after a    hour travel day they may be able to have someone come look the next day   Eventually located the hot water heater on my own   Was in a trap door in kitchen area about   feet above ground   Also located fuse box  on my own and ended up fixing the issue on my own   Had to trip the breaker for hot water heater   times during stay   On check out day we were    minutes late when clean services miraculously showed up on time    miraculous  because we had zero customer service for our issues the entire stay but the turnover service was ready to roll   Check out was at       a m  By        a m   we were out the door and I began receiving phone calls threatening late check out fees    We were late because we had no hot water the morning of check out and had to restart again   By this time  I had lost patience with Zencity and was not too calm with those calling me about late check out   When I arrived home   hours later I had an email from Zencity stating there was a stolen item and they wanted       The device  supposedly stolen is call a Minut device   that apparently reads the decibel level in the unit to ensure there are no parties   I Was sent a picture of the device that we never touched  still intact    However  I think someone must have stolen their coffee maker at one point because there was not on in the unit   First time I ve ever had an Airbnb with no coffee maker   Despite those issues the unit itself was fine   Needs some paint   However   the management group Zencity  is more like ZENSH  TY   Will never stay in a unit managed by them     Building security tho A    those guys saved us  
565938026468490543,Very nice place  once we got in  The lock box was frozen and wouldn t open since it was    degrees out but we eventually got it open  Wear gloves if it s cold out in case this happens to you  There appears to be something wrong with the furnace as it was only    inside the Airbnb when we got there  even though the thermostat was set at     We turned up the thermostat and it warmed up some but the furnace did not run at all during the night so it gradually got cold again  Luckily the blankets were warm  This morning the thermostat said it was    in there again  The showers were nice and hot and the mattresses were comfortable  The kitchen looked nice but we didn t end up using it since we were there so short  I didn t find a washer and dryer  which I believe is advertised for this Airbnb  Luckily  we didn t need one  but just an FYI if you are wanting one  It s also   levels with a bedroom bath sitting area down some stairs  The main floor has a bedroom bathroom kitchen eating area living room  Very nice  The lock box was frozen and wouldn t open  Eventually we must have warmed it up enough with our hands that it finally opened  We were so cold   It felt like    degrees F out  The key inside literally had ice around it  The code to get into the door from the hallway was not correct   but at least it was warmer inside  They reset the code and we got in  I would recommend adding a rug inside the door because we tracked our snowy shoes on the main floor since there was nothing to wipe them on  It was COLD inside the Airbnb  The thermostat said    even though it was set at     We turned it up and it warmed up some but the furnace did not run at all during the night so it gradually got cold again  Luckily the blankets were warm  This morning the thermostat said it was    in there again  Brrr  I don t know if there is a setting to only keep it warm for   hours or what  the thermostat had a   and then some other language on it but I m not sure what that meant or how to change it   Please look at remedying that before other guests stay there in the cold winter  The showers were nice and hot and the mattresses were comfortable  We weren t there more than one night due to a snow storm the first day we were supposed to arrive  so we forfeited that night s money  Bummer  but what can you do  The kitchen looked nice but we didn t end up using it since we were there so short 
459345928803451440,The apartment looks even better than the pictures in the website  It was very clean  and Taylor at check in was very friendly and helpful  The apartment location is excellent  one block from a Whole Foods and an easy walk to BJC  It was extremely quiet in the apartment and the management is very serious about enforcing face masks in public areas  The washer and dryer are not in the apartment but rather for pay in the basement  The first day was hot and the air conditioner was struggling  I would highly recommend this place  when it is not hot out  The water in the sink in the bathroom drips a bit   The airconditioner in main room is really noisy  and not very effective
458630309493751596,Nice location  pretty clean  had a few things broken unable to use and poor communication on host end  I was very dissatisfied with my stay  Mostly because of the poor communication  Thing were broken and and I felt as if you all didn t care enough to communicate with me about concerns   I am still waiting on response from you all 
492038332944537759,Clean easy and comfortable  Couldn t have asked for more  Great place  Was comfy and spotless  Maybe some instructions on how to get to the gym since it s in the pictures 
460065027708129513,Great spot   Easy and super convenient   Recommend  The kitchen stuff was a bit shaky   Both french presses had something the matter with them   Didnt find a cutting board   And a larger pot would have been nice   Just fyi    Otherwise all good  gave you   stars 
458699238771175475,We were excited to spend some time in Chicago  A while after checking in  we noticed that the apartment had not been thoroughly clean  There was a piece of plastic on the counter  crumbs all over the couch and hair everywhere that did not belong to us weaved into the towels  The lack of communication and understanding was a major set back as the host wanted to do the very minimum about it all  even with pics for proof   I would only recommend staying here if youre okay with doing your own clean before doing anything else 
481118535592155187,Great place location  Easy to travel in and out of the busier parts of the city from the apartment  The apartment was clean and comfortable as well  The place was great  I enjoyed my stay  I was prompted for a      charge to cover a parking pass that wasn t left behind  The checkout instructions said  simply leave the key fob on the counter and the door will lock on the way out   I would have left the parking pass as well  I just recommend adding that in the checkout instructions 
502230727531012923,Great view  comfortable bed  and good location  Thank you  but we really needed somewhere to put our clothes as we were staying for a week  A chest of drawers on the left of the bed  would have enabled you to put the little bedside table on the other side of the bed  This would ve meant we had somewhere to put our clothes and each person had a bedside table  Everything else was great 
480442291715863052,It s a great location  but you re probably going to have issues with checkin  Zencity failed to provide me with ANY accurate information regarding checkin  I needed three main things  the code to the main door  the code to the airbnb unit  and a key fob  Zencity gave me NONE of these accurately  All the info in the checkin instructions seemed to be outdated    Since they gave me the wrong code to the main doors  l I tried to get in touch with them  and the number they gave me sent to an out of state  national corporate number  After a series of holds and waiting for an hour  outside the airbnb building  with all my luggage   the woman on the phone was obviously in a loud public setting  and proceeded to give me not one  but TWO wrong codes for the airbnb apartment unit  I was able to get in the building by the grace of another resident of the building  who also used their keycard to help me get to the floor I needed    They also failed to provide me with a keycard   which you need to use the elevators  doors  stairs  and to enter the building  Without it  you re quite literally trapped in the room  or you have to depend on other residents to give you access to your floor  the elevator  and the main building    That being said  the place itself is very nice  No microwave or laundry in unit  It s an apartment building  Pickwick Plaza Apartments   and they had delightful people in their leasing office who talked to me about Zencity and their pattern behaviors towards clients     Overall  kind of a nightmare  Skip it unless you re cool with waiting outside on the streets of KC while on a call with someone in Palm Springs  CA  trying to get into this building 
485466970467106117,Extremely nice Airbnb  Amazing area and close to everything 
461555449941773754,Bachelor pad Ty
546379402860018518,Very pretty studio  Great location 
484026566205412253,The apartment and location were wonderful and a very reasonable price  However  initially finding the apartment in the building took about    minutes with the instructions given   Hint  go through the doors that look like the gym  When we finally got into the apartment  we noticed there was no parking pass  Zen city makes it very clear that you may get towed for street parking or for parking on their lot with no parking pass  I left several messages with Zencity about our parking pass being missing and after being sent around with several automated messages signed by different people  someone finally brought us a pass on our third day  This was somewhat stressful because we had a rental car and we were very worried about having a rental towed    On our first night  we decided to extend our stay because the apartment is very decently priced for the space and location   It has a washer and dryer which was very helpful because we had been traveling over a month and needed to do laundry  Half way through our stay  Zen city changed the code to the front door and we were locked out at   PM and had to spend nearly    minutes on the phone and wait about    minutes to have the code activate so we could finally get inside    All in all  I d say the apartment it s self is great if you re not worried about a few dirty dishes or scuffs on the walls  I d likely stay here again if it was under different management  We really did enjoy the location and the apartment it s self  However  finding the apartment was very difficult with the instructions given  We also were not left with a parking pass on arrival and communication with your team and receiving the parking pass took several days and several attempts  Dishes in the cabinet were dirty and the code to get into the front door was changed in the middle of our stay which was frustrating to deal with at   PM 
563727319050231027,Great place to stay Great place to stay 
518069187015067317,The apartment wasnt clean properly  The floors were dusty and there were roaches  There were roaches even in the dishwasher  I dealt with the roach issue since I didnt have time to pack my stuff and move to a new location since I was there for work  I also had already paid for a months stay and they were not giving me a refund  When I addressed the issue the company offered a  courtesy tidy up  mid month  I emphasized that clean the apartment wasnt going to solve the issue and that they needed pest control  I requested to be moved to another building but they could not accommodate me  On my last day at the apartment  someone tried to break in  The only reason they could not enter is that I had an anti burglary lock on the door  After the attempted break into the apartment  I decided to leave  I wasnt issued a refund not even for the remaining weeks I already paid for  This was my first experience using an airb b and it was a terrible experience 
459423769776526577,It was a great place  We loved the location  as it was a   minute walk from the Chicago Blue Line station  The neighborhood felt very safe and mostly quiet  The accommodations are quite comfortable  just know that the kitchen only has the basics  which was not a problem for us  Hello  Thanks for the place  it was mostly great  I hope the images I sent earlier are taking into consideration for future guest  The cleanliness could be bumped up a nudge for one s comfort  We noticed stains that almost seem like blood  The upstairs neighbors tend to run up and down the apartment starting at  am causing doors in our unit to shake  and waking us up 
473868658824041622,Great Stay   
458649701641734208,This apartment is beautiful and really made me feel like I was home during my stay  It is located near some amazing restaurants that are walking distance and is easily accessible for ride shares  Thank you for an amazing stay  The space was everything that I needed  I would definitely love to stay here in the future   Suggestion  it would be cool if the temperature could be controlled and not have to be changed only by communicating through contacting the host 
539866351615780176,I had this spot   times  When I visit in town this is the spot   Always on time  Thanks
461521130876897008,This place was in the neighborhood I needed wanted to stay   There were no fans or AC and the screen on the window was ripped so I didnt want to open the window  so it got fairly warm even at the end of September   The walls seem to be very thin  I could hear smell neighbors and I received a noise complaint when   grown adults were sitting on the couch talking   Overall  not a bad place but the best part was the location 
529023071574577410,My stay was okay  however there were a few issues that I wish I was aware of when I booked    Cons    Check in   parking instructions were lengthy  Parking instructions indicated to enter the garage on Pine Street  The entrance here was blocked off by cones and the gate would not open  After circling the streets surrounding the garage a few times  we were finally able to enter on another street     The instructions indicated that there would be a parking pass to hang from our windshield  we saw these passes on all other cars parked in this garage  However  no pass was provided for us so we were concerned throughout our whole stay that we may be towed  I made Zencity aware of this and they said  sorry   and provided no further assistance  Luckily we were not towed  but boy was I anxious       The photos on this listing do not represent the actual apartment  We were expecting a studio with a large couch  Instead we got a one bedroom with a tiny tiny couch  May not seem like a big deal but we like to watch TV laying down so it was disappointing that we either had to lay in the bedroom with no TV or sit on the tiny stiff couch  Zencity messaged me at the end of my stay and asked for a positive review and requested that I inform them of any problems via message  So I told them about this and all they had to say again was  ok  Sorry   Really makes it seem like they just want attractive public reviews and dont care for their guests     Speaking of TV  this listing has a Netflix account available for guests to use  Bad news is that this same Netflix account is shared with their other listings so we were not able to use the Netflix as too many other users were on it     Pros    This listing is SUPER close to the enterprise center so we were able to walk to the blues game  Its also close to Union Station and Wash Ave so lots of walkable dining options are available     the view of the arch is great     apartment is clean and has all of the basics that youll need  Hot water took no time for me
515930562460183755,Great Response time  Free Parking all over  Had a pleasant stay 
529006386265069974,This is a sweet  cozy efficiency with everything you need  The corner situation of the room in this lovely old building lends to its charm with its long windows encircling the living space   On a busier night  outside noise level might be more of an issue in the busy CWE  We were visiting family nearby and parked about     mile away  near them  as open spots were not available near the apartment  Cleaning fee was a bit high  Loved the corner room   the efficiency of the spot and the feel of the building 
518166292478033699,would recommend this place if you want some peace of mind and something  simply comfortable the time I spent here was nice peaceful and relaxing
475330790106519418,The host had good communication and instruction skills  The place was clean and tidy  A great little Coffee shop on the corner  Had a good stay  thank you 
470966527217747222,Great apartment  Thank you for the amazing stay  We loved the apartment 
528950286352744373,Such a great location  So convenient  Love the character of the old architecture  Thanks for letting us stay  So great 
451466196885365584,I got locked out and had a door code that worked earlier  I had to sit in the hall for and hour with my work equipment because check in was delayed  The instructions were  the most vague information I have ever read 
490642873476622250,The location is great and the door staffs are very friendly  The room is smaller comparing to another one which we have stayed in this area  but it s still enough for two people 
529012446781360043,A great host that had our needs before his own 
460067611077284107,The apartment is in a really nice building with great amenities and has a super comfortable bed  but I agree with the people who said it wasnt clean  Hi  the location and amenities in the building and the layout of the space are great  but the furniture and walls   dishes were all pretty dirty  I had to wash the bedside tables and dishes myself before using anything  The couch is stained  there was random tape on the wall in the bedroom  and brown stains on the ceiling and walls  It feels like someone moved out recently and you put in a really  really comfortable bed but kept all their old furniture and didnt paint or anything  The photos hide all this which feels like false advertising for the cost 
457965811783003901,Great full appartement  well equipped and functioning  We enjoyed our stay  Beware the parking is in the street  Hi  We enjoyed the fact that it was a full appartement and well equipped   The side note is there is no designated parking for the appartement when the appartement building has its own parking  and we were cold in the appartement and reached out to increase the thermostat but we were only half answered  The person on Airbnb I was talking to never came back with the thermostat code for us to increase the temperature   Marion
571512367033458897,BOOK WITH CAUTION   I never write reviews but this time I had to  I ve used Airbnb for many years and this has to be the worse experience ever    We arrived at  pm to the building   Check in time   The doorman for the building was helpful but they do not work for Zencity  Other tenants live there  not Airbnb related units   Anyways  we arrive and we go up to the unit  This unit only opens with a digital keycode  There is no physical key  We spent     hours on call with customer support at Zencity trying to get in  All the codes they gave us did not work  We tried over     times probably  The building doorman  not associated with Zencity  offered to help but they also could not get in  Zencity customer support was so unhelpful and they were acting with no urgency  They kept asking us if we were entering the code right  it s not rocket science to enter a code   They never sent an actual person to help physically  Never  No one    After this  it s been   week and they still have not refunded me  I keep messaging them but they regurgitate the same message    we are waiting for manager approval    Huh   Why would this require   week   There s clear evidence between messages and phone calls that we were never able to get in     In short  terrible experience  Horrible customer support  I would never want to book with Zencity again  You ve been warned  Please focus on making sure the customer is first 
454286154152871289,Cute place  but keep in mind it s not around a LOT of shops or places to eat really  Also the bed was not comfortable at all    Host was great and the building was nice   Cute place but please buy your guests a new bed   it was so uncomfortable and we did not sleep well  Otherwise great place  thanks for having us 
545682674433588458,My husband and I stayed in this unit for a week  While visibly clean  the unit reeked of cigarette smoke  we could smell it through our N    masks when we walked in the door   It was obvious someone had smoked  and smoked A LOT  in the unit very recently  The smell of cigarette smoke was so strong that it gave us both headaches    We asked to be moved  and were told there were no other rooms available  We asked for an air purifier  and they said they could bring an ozone machine but wed have to vacate the property for several hours    and that they couldnt give us a specific time when they would should up  Zencity was extremely slow in responding to our messages about the room    We had to leave all the windows open for three days and nights    in January  in St  Louis  it was freezing cold outside     to clear most of the smoke smell out   It was a very frustrating experience 
570351054990252428,Perfect location for being close to the hospital  Forest Park  etc  Clean and quiet  I never heard any neighbors unless I was in the hall  Highly recommend for an affordable stay in CWE  Great stay  loved the place  Might want to repair the planks in the floor that shift  I almost fell a couple times in the kitchen and in the entry way of the bathroom  Otherwise very clean  quiet building  great value
570286892234423915,The place was very neat and clean  I liked the location  I had a great experience and I recommend it 
523877395286143996,Reasonable price in a great location  They are a very trustworthy owner with detailed explanations  Thank you for letting us stay in a very well located place at a very reasonable price 
419499473089617419,Stayed here for lolla  was able to find off street parking pretty easily and in a good area with good food near by 
502187698105017001,I enjoyed my stay with ZenCity very much  The apartment was clean and in such a good location  Highly recommend
518168969844162315,Solid location  It s about      minute walk from blue line metro station and a bus that can take you to Gold Coast  Decently safe area  the specific street the apartment is on felt safe   The apartment was clean but had a weird smell in it  Not bad just an old kind of smell  There were air fresheners but they were empty    I extended my stay an extra day and was locked out of the apartment the night before the last day  which was very frustrating  It took me    minutes to get ahold of someone to provide a working code  After I checked out  I received a claim that I broke one of the ceiling fans and should pay      This unit didn t have a fan and the screenshots were definitely not from this place   Overall decent stay and the price was very reasonable but working with the host company was not great 
546354205683652488,Awesome place  Right on streetcar line  Grocery store   min walk away     min walk to convention center    min walk to fantastic food drink music people at the Phoenix  Building has excellent gym in the basement  and even a small turf field  Washer dryer in unit was very convenient  Bedrooms have no windows  so prepare for best night sleep of your life  Between the Phoenix and the dark rooms  prepare to miss your morning flight  Thanks for everything  I didnt put it in the review  but the kitchen needs a      infusion of pots and pans and basics like plasticware  its the kitchen that made us stay here rather than a hotel  but it was really insufficient on that front  No pan  just a skillet   No lids that fit  No tubs for leftovers  If an air b b has a kitchen  you gotta provide those basics  Other than that  fantastic  Thanks for everything 
496393623461181943,From my experience this place is good to go  Nice neighborhood  accurate to listing and place was clean   idk if they have new cleaners but I didnt find this place to be dirty at all
546372381731351954,Great spot in Hyde Park Record player in unit didn t work  Y all had my favorite Kanye West album on vinyl but it wouldn t play nor the other record 
523904583349845304,Really cozy place  checking in and out was really easy  I felt really comfortable staying there  The bathroom had music so that was fun  The are was really peaceful and only    minutes away from downtown 
462254233429788757,Location is great  clean and easy to check in  Toilet pretty loud  continues to run  and additional information on parking would be great 
462273609039134980,I was in my apartment and someone who doesn t even stay there walked into my place  It was scary  The host wouldn t even respond  I got it recorded also  It was very weird Hey I been trying to reach out to you all for the longest  I have a recorded conversation on the phone with you all while someone walked into my location that wasn t staying there  They already had the key pad entrance  I was scared of my life especially with everything going on in this city  The girl didn t even belong in the building
471031507924404643,Great spot  easy access to things around KC  We had a great time in KC and enjoyed your place 
462084480977511571,Sehr zentrale Wohnung  mit Fahrstuhl erreichbar  Rate dringend zum dazu buchen des Parkplatzes  da die Parksituation sehr schwierig ist  Ausstattung sehr gut  Die Kinderbetten ohne Lattenrost aber bequem  Gem tlicher Esstisch  Vielen dank  es war alles Bestens und Deine Wohnung ist super  Ich h tte mir genauere Angabe zum dazubuchbaren Parkplatz gew nscht  der h tte uns viel Lauferei und Umst nde erspart  Trotzdem toll 
528990605026279332,Wonderful stay  Love the view and the interior had an amazing esthetic  Wonderful stay  Love the view and the interior had an amazing esthetic 
459368466954335917,Great location and great layout of an apartment   Theres a grocery store on the bottom level of the complex which was really helpful  Hello    The apartment was in a great location and designed well   but it wasnt very clean   The dishes that were put away on the shelves were very dirty   The sponges for clean the dishes were actually moldy  I bought a new one to use during my stay   The outside porch area had lots of cobwebs or spiderwebs  which led me to realize that the housekeeper never actually clean that area   Also  there were several hairballs in the living room   I wouldnt really want to write a bad public review  but I would suggest getting a different housekeeper    Best    K A
507105934490869512,This property is not as expected   Though they advertise exceptional clean there was still hair in the shower drain   There were holes in the walls where the blinds had been pulled out of the wall  There were tiles missing off the bathroom walls  The worst part is the room is right next to the elevator  an elevator that  squeaks    So every time the right elevator goes up or down  day or night  you hear it   The room is so hot you have to turn on the room unit which goes on and off constantly and is in the living space so you will need to constantly adjust the TV volume  the air unit also has a terrible oder for the first day   I contacted Them within the first   hours of checking in with concerns   they did offer many other options in the near area  Now they want me to pay      fee for a missing key fob  that opened the main door and elevators  
546424733000893131,Zen City is the place to be if you are going to be needing a place that is safe and near BJC  I highly recommend this place  I recently had multiple surgeries and found the place to be very accessible thanks to the elevators  walkways and kind staffing  Also the ZC staff are always available a message away Zen City  thank you so much for creating such a beautiful accommodation   It really made my stay so stress free being closer to the hospital and having a such a clean and safe place
572515349885286380,Tl dr  would not recommend    First problem was that the code to the apartment door given was incorrect  After sending a message and receiving no response  I called  The property management company gave me several different codes to try and finally one of them worked  When i got in  the place smelled like cigarettes  It was tidy but not clean  Stain on blanket and a previous guest s items  stripper heels   left in the chest of drawers  There was a car parked in my designated spot  which i reported and parked on the street for the night  hoping that it would be gone in the morning  It wasn t and was still there that evening  I let them know  again  and they advised that it was my responsibility to call and have it towed   I did not   The steps from the parking area were icy for days and never salted  very dangerous  as there is no railing  Don t plan on cooking here  as there are only two tiny saucepans and one tiny skillet  No dishwashing soap  The walls are incredibly thin  and i could hear every movement and sound of the neighboring apartments  A huge panel of the wooden fence had fallen down into the pool area  and appeared to have been forgotten there for some time  The gym had only two  lb weighs  a   lb and   lb weight  and a few ancient pieces of exercise equipment  This is one of the cheaper airbnbs in the area  but i would suggest paying     more and getting somewhere decent to stay  The best thing about this place is that they did have good coffee in the cupboard  but overall not a good stay  Completely unacceptable to suggest that it was my responsibility to have someone s car towed 
518142148630032514,The door was open when checking in and the door lock didn t work at the beginning  Never answered chat through the Airbnb app so don t try it there but rather call them  The CS agent on the phone was very kind and fixed the lock problem right away  Probly not coming bck 
480453736984813328,I m sure they re fine   but they need to be more understanding of things that are out of someone s control like having to check out early  I checked out a day early due to a family emergency and was able to recoup    of that due to their lack of understanding 
497882290967559030,Great stay  Amazing location 
471004850519622845,We loved this apartment while in Kc for a Chiefs game  Location was great  close to P L  Westport restaurants and bars  Apartment was clean and check in was very convenient  Would absolutely stay again  Thank you so much for the great apartment while we were in KC 
485529519333838096,Great place in a great location 
513831425398103067,This place was awesome and exactly as pictured  It s conveniently located  right off the expressway  and there were little shops and cafes near by if I wanted to explored  I enjoyed my stay and I d definitely book here again  The shower had lots of  little black flying bugs in it  Other than that the place was awesome and I really appreciate you letting us stay
485441275420194813,Slawik was super helpful and the space was beautiful  We stayed during Halloween weekend so it was a lil spooky but in a good way  And we had a fire detector going off when we arrived and Slawik was able to get a neighbor to come and take care of it quickly 
460858263736779923,Spacious and close to Hyde Park   Parking can be tricky  so while there is free street parking and somewhere off site paid parking  be aware it is not necessarily near the unit  Fine if you are using uber lyft   Plenty of space and a great option to a hotel   Piccolo Mondo is nearby and we had a delightful meal there  Thank you for making the apartment available on Air BnB Overall a good stay   The unit had several bath towels that were unchanged  Obviously dirty used  These things happen but made us question the cleanliness level   Of course I will not highlight this in the personal review but something to look for  Security was good as they wouldnt let my husband check in because we had different last names  parking was tough  When I booked I swore it said plenty of street parking available  but when I checked back after we had to park   blocks away it did say no parking    We appreciate the use of the place and the offer to extend for         I thought that was a good idea   We get to this area often  and I appreciate the options near the University 
518796643389748977,Very affordable  and well maintained  Check out procedures and guidelines could have been more clear 
460078474829051289,The apartment itself was fine it s a basement apartment so it has a damp smell and daddy long legs   we killed four a while we were there  Everything was clean and the location was great  The problem came in with the owner upon arrival we immediately received a noise complaint notification one of the mini that we received while we were there we weren t even able to talk   laugh without getting a complaint  We spoke to the neighbors who said they never filed any complaint and could barely hear us so that was very perplexing upon check out we received a notification that we would be charged      for a missing charger base that one of my friends had accidentally taken we offered to drop it back off and never received a response  You never responded about how I can return the base
461609192321072518,Nice bars and restaurants around the area Very nice room walls were a little but dirty but no biggie  Nice comfortable place 
470941937552682435,Perfect little hideaway with easy access to great food and drinks  a nice gym and fun little arcade  The ladies in the combine restaurant were fantastic  great service and fantastic food  The suite was clean and modern  everything you needed was in there  Loved having access to ice right in the room  and that it was simple to get into 
481110417940892273,This place was awesome  Centrally located in downtown KC walking distance from a lot of great venues to eat  drink  and visit  Super easy to access via Ava s instructions and I will definitely book this place again the next time I find myself in KC  I highly recommend this spot  Thank you zen city    until we meet again  Ava  was awesome  This place was great  I would most definitely book with your company again  Thank you 
459419602046299011,The space was lovely and clean  They area was really nice  Loved that there was food and coffee within walking distance  Oh and the park  It s was beautiful  We had a great stay 
518822758658200067,Great place to stay  Just lacking free parking  But there were meter parkings  Great place to stay  Just lacking free parking 
480432744226088695,Fantastic location  Very walkable  great food and shopping on the same block  Please make sure you provide the correct door code upon check in  After a long day of travel  entering the provided code only to have the alarm go off is not ideal  That said  one phone call got us squared away with a new and correct code  and the person helping us was efficient and pleasant  Thank you for that 
480413420847547131,DO NOT STAY WITH ZENCITY   We were never able to actually access the apartment  the key was missing   After we messaged them about the problem  Zencity apparently knew that it had been missing since October  th and didnt do anything about it   They didnt have anywhere for us to stay so we ended up sleeping in our car   Thanks for nothing  assholes
520300330315103801,Very versatile space with easy walking access to the main areas of Hyde Park  Kitchen was well stocked and there were plenty of extra towels and linens  Overall a comfortable stay 
534076659944536020,Not bad for the price but the view and appearance cover up a lot   Mold in the AC units  shower head sprayed the ceiling causing mold  no tenants wore masks in elevators  parking is a bit of an unsafe walk away  and bullet casings on the sidewalks 
460063551160922648,Beautiful home  Thank you 
461602142539336460,It s dirty and stinky not worth even a dolor I was going to stay here when I got to the place first had problems just to be able to get in then once in the building the smell was horrible and then got to the apt it was so dirty I decided to cancel and they didn t refund my money because of they re canceling policy but if I m sopposed to get a clean apt and get the opposite I should have gotten my money back oh and the place looks nothing like the pictures It s dirty and stinky not worth even a dolor I was going to stay here when I got to the place first had problems just to be able to get in then once in the building the smell was horrible and then got to the apt it was so dirty I decided to cancel and they didn t refund my money because of they re canceling policy but if I m sopposed to get a clean apt and get the opposite I should have gotten my money back oh and the place looks nothing like the pictures
463033185283992907,Truth be told this is ALL location location location  Other then that not much more to say about the apartment  we could not get an early check in due to the apartment being clean and so we were expecting just that     far from it  unfortunate because with just basic and care and basic items the unit could be a true GEM    NO COFFEE maker  we were in town mostly for work and do rely on basic necessities and a coffee maker is one of them   no blender like I said if it wasnt for the location and rooftop not much more to say about the unit or the customer service Truth be told this is ALL location location location  Other then that not much more to say about the apartment  we could not get an early check in due to the apartment being clean and so we were expecting just that     far from it  The floors were far from being clean there were fingerprints on the stove and microwave the fridge was not clean at all there were crumbs everywhere  the bathroom tub had hair in the tub and on the wall   the tub did not drain and when brought to someones attention not much concern was given  NO COFFEE maker  we were in town mostly for work and do rely on basic necessities and a coffee maker is one of them   no blender like I said if it wasnt for the location and rooftop not much more to say about the unit or the customer service

505081726428628943,This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with Airbnb  Just Checking in is was horrible because I received a different room then what I paid for  Once I got to the new room  there were a few instructions someone forgot to mention in the email  and I was unable to get to the key fob that would give me access to the building door  Once I finally received the key fob  there was issue with the door code for the room and it took over  hrs to get into the room  The room only had one sink  located in the kitchen ONLY  and it suffered water damage in the bathroom  Finally a day before my checkout  I had no access to my room because the door code no longer worked  and it took over  hrs before Zencity decided to give me a new room for the night  This was an inconvenience for me because all of my belongings were in my room and once I got to the new for the night  there was no available WiFi and I couldn t charge my phone  Zencity was able to get me into the room early the next morning but due to the time it took I lost some wages for the day  as I was working remotely  I asked them about compensation for the trip and they still are giving me the run around  The only thing that ran smoothly   was the checkout process  That was the only good thing about this disaster of a Airbnb booking  I would not recommend Zencity to anyone  You re not missing out on anything here  there are hundreds of Airbnb I m sure are much better  and at this price point  This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with Airbnb  Just Checking in is was horrible because I received a different room then what I paid for  Once I got to the new room  there were a few instructions someone forgot to mention in the email  and I was unable to get to the key fob that would give me access to the building door  Once I finally received the key fob  there was issue with the door code for the room and it took over  hrs to get into the room  The room only had one sink  located in the kitchen ONLY  and it suffered water damage in the bathroom  Finally a day before my checkout  I had no access to my room because the door code no longer worked  and it took over  hrs before Zencity decided to give me a new room for the night  This was an inconvenience for me because all of my belongings were in my room and once I got to the new for the night  there was no available WiFi and I couldn t charge my phone  Zencity was able to get me into the room early the next morning but due to the time it took I lost some wages for the day  as I was working remotely  I asked them about compensation for the trip and they still are giving me the run around  The only thing that ran smoothly   was the checkout process  That was the only good thing about this disaster of a Airbnb booking  I would not recommend Zencity to anyone  You re not missing out on anything here  there are hundreds of Airbnb I m sure are much better  and at this price point 
455735120245110968,Great location  Only real problem I had with the room was the foul odor on the carpet  Smelled like cat pee  Otherwise  everything else was great and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay  Thank you again for having us 
542068078082406212,I wouldn t come back here  My experience was bad  But you could try your luck  You need to work on your units  How could I pay all that money just to not have a wifi for my whole trip and don t have control of my own unit temperature 
470949238071954974,Smells like sewage water  The closet in the downstairs living room needs to be checked out  Not sure what s in there but it smelt like moldy sewage water  Also the vents should be clean as well  We experienced burning nostrils and sore throats after the first night due to inhalation

463049322270734251,Our stay at Zencity was great  We were in a pinch once our first Airbnb ended up being a flop and  found this property to be better than we could have expected     The unit itself was clean  stocked  and very airy for a studio  There s a full kitchen which made heating up leftovers like pizza in the oven a slam as well as a microwave  full size fridge  and dishwasher for your convenience  No coffee maker but just downstairs is Pedestrian Coffee whose coffee is really satisfying  Also in the unit is a washer dryer and an ac cooler that s adjustable  If you rather enjoy the fresh air and don t mind the sound of the city you can always open the patio door   Speaking of city let s talk about location  This unit is right next to the L s red and purple line  Belmont stop   If you are iffy about renting a car because of traffic and parking no need to if you are willing to ride the L  Riding the L is really easy and if you are unfamiliar where you are going plug your destination into Google maps and put the option on the public transportation logo  looks like a bus   The navigation system will tell you exactly where you need to walk and what line  or line options  you can take to get to where you are trying to go    Major must sees and dos are all about       minutes away and we had a rental car the first two nights we were there  There is a parking garage around the corner from the apartment building and is calculated based on hours  Up to    hours was under        Right around the apartment building are a number of restaurants  unique shops  theaters  and late night bars to hang at  The apartment is also close to Boystown as well as Wrigley field    The host was very responsive and offered to help us with any questions we had about the property  We ended up staying an extra night    Would stay here again  Thank you for hosting us
463067781723774817,Nice and clean place not to far from the Arch Would highly recommend staying at the place Host was great at communicating and making our stay easy and comfortable  Thanks for your accommodation I enjoyed the stay Would definitely recommend your service to friends Thanks again
529036759896446454,The water for bathing is not hot and small  Other than that everything else was perfect
529010809281050919,OK  but not the cleanest and parking is not included  It would be good to have the  no parking  available information more noticeable in the ad and not after youve made the reservation  There was a strong smell of curry from the previous tenant and bugs in the bathroom 
513725558206754117,This is a nice place to stay if you are in KC  Or if you just wanna get away  Good atmosphere  great city view  I just don t like the parking  Everything else is perfect  Nice place  Good atmosphere 
460104623965273317,place was hard to get into  We had to wait outside hoping someone from the inside would let us in  Contacted the host and they were super nice and told us they would fix the issue told us that if others could let us in to feel free to go inside and they would message us when the issue was fixed  Never got a message so the whole time there we had to wait for someone to open the building door for us  Place was okay  Neighbors were loud 
539848184352805552,I highly recommend NOT staying here  The owners are corporate  the walls are thin as paper thin and efficient  communication is challenging to say the least  ZERO stars  Look up the definition of empathy 
546379075958683766,Be nice if parking was included  The space was nice and cozy for two people  Great location and W  D is on premises not in unit but had everything you need to do laundry and wash dishes etc  It would be nice to provide a parking pass as street parking can be expensive and the parking times and rates need to be updated for customers to know exact parking times now because we were told parking was free on weekends  There were delays in response time for same day booking which caused me to cancel and get hotel then rebook for the following day 
460071488007779461,It wasn t the best but it wasn t the worst  The apartment itself was okay  It wasn t fancy but it wasn t run down  Everything appeared to be clean  The air conditioning didn t work well during the night in the room I slept in  so I woke up sweating both nights  The apartment building had a STRONG smell of marijuana  You smelt it as soon as you walked into the building and didn t stop smelling it until you got into the apartment and shut the door  The building was run down and kinda gross and I didn t feel safe  but I didn t spend much time there  The instructions on how to get in the building at check in were confusing  They also said there would be keys and a parking pass  but there was no parking pass upon arrival and the door has a keypad so there were no keys either  There was a key fob to get into the building and parking garage which kept me from having to punch the code in every single time so that was nice  At check out  they tried to charge me      for the missing parking pass  but there was never a parking pass there to begin with when I checked in  I haven t heard from them since I tried to talk to them about the situation  Overall  it s not the worst place I could have stayed at this weekend  but if I could go back  I DEFINITELY would have just gotten a hotel room 
542094722739784568,Avoid at all costs   The company is shady as hell and looking to milk you for every dime  Beyond that  the unit has no end of problems  I signed for an extended   month stay and regretted every second of it     Leaky upstairs neighbor pipe caused damage to the ceiling that now constantly drops powdered drywall an the counters   A heating system that you cant controle  Runs full blast while its in the   s  but turns off for days when its    outside   Barely stocked kitchen makes cooking nearly impossible   No parking at all  Youll have to try your luck with street parking   Internet down roughly half the time    Wall a c units that can barely keep you cool when its in the high   s  and cant outpace the radiator that is always running   If you need somewhere to stay then do yourself a favor  Sleep outside  Itll be nicer 
539860258808426260,I had a great experience  The check was simple and easy  The place was clean and enjoyed my stay Enjoy my stay it was only for one night but it was great
567467665589447772,Check in was difficult because the access code wasn t working  but I called the number on the kiosk and they released a back up key for me  Not to mention it was almost midnight so I was very thankful that it ended up working out  Thank you for helping with check in 
515894619908293397,This was the perfect place for me  It felt like home  Quiet building  nice apartment  it has Wi Fi and TV for enjoyment  I would definitely return to this place when I book again  Thanks for this place  It was perfect 
460117308213120441,I d probably avoid booking here    We were really excited for this place  But sadly reality didn t match the pictures    Cons  When we arrived we realized we had not received the check in information that we were told  I will be in contact closer to your arrive for a smooth check in   The check in was anything but smooth  We were unable to enter the building using the provided code and had to call for a second time within    minutes of arriving to be let in  The first phone call was to receive the check in information and codes and the second call was when the codes failed to work  Then the door to the unit had issues opening for the first time  we had to use tricks such as pulling the door so that the lock would properly work  We were told we would be able to use a key fob found within the unit to enter the building on our own  The fob did not work and this was where communication started to decline  The first three calls were resolved quickly  however  the fourth phone call did not result in the same  This communication took from   pm  Thursday night      pm  Friday afternoon  to hear any sort of update  despite asking for an update  we were trying to determine if we were able to leave and come back on our own or if we had to call every time we wanted back in the building  Thankfully other residents in the building understood how horrible the Airbnb is with their guests and were nice enough to let us in  The residents  three different residents mind you  also noted that other Airbnb guests were having similar issues and that this is an incredibly annoying issue to continue to have    The unit itself isn t bad  I m just a bit confused about what our clean fees covered  There were visible dirt burn marks on the carpet  dust on surfaces  and what looked to be pieces of food left in the sink  which may have been due to the kitchen sink draining terribly slow or the food disposal being broken   The floors also looked as if drinks had been spilled and not clean because it was still sticky and black  The ice tray in the freezer looks like it has melted and refrozen as a large block that was unusable  There were dents and scratches throughout the entire apartment that were not shown in the pictures prior to booking    The air conditioning was awful and did not work  Luckily we had beautiful weather so it wasn t unbearable but it would never adjust below     The air filter was also a disgusting brown color   Pros  It was a decent part of town that wasn t far from anything we wanted to do  The bed was comfortable  it does squeak some  but not too bad  The gated parking lot is also a great feature    Overall the unit has a lot of potential to be an incredible stay  but sadly the technical issues of allowing us to freely enter drastically dampened our impression of the host and their ability to meet explicit expectations laid out in the booking summary we used to make our decision to stay here  I would not stay here again 
485534395298158376,great value location  comfortable  easy to use  we did not open the living room window  so not an issue  just looked crappy the screen was ripped 
566000342788582141,Overall  my stay was pleasant  The room was updated  clean  and it provided all the amenities needed for a small apartment  The reason I gave it a good and not great review was because the check in was a nightmare  It took me an hour along with numerous messages and phone calls to Zencity to actually get into my room  If their check in process was smoother and communication was quicker  it would have been a great stay  Thats my only complaint 
460786431857703690,This is the perfect location to access the street car  power and light district and close to city market  It does cost to park but you really won t need to drive unless you want to explore more outside of the city  There is a lot to do just in this area within walking distance or by using the street car which is free  There was an odor as you walked into the apartment that was not pleasant  This apartment was clean and perfect for our girls trip    Thank you for the stay  we had a great time and the location was perfect  There is an odor as you walk in the door of the apartment that was not pleasant 
460103766094715343,Great location  quiet street  close to the some good bars and restaurants  The place itself is perfect for a bigger group and having two bathrooms is a blessing  There place was great  thank you again for welcoming us onto your beautiful property  There was one issue  the room closest to the bathroom has a rancid smell  like if there s a dead animal in the walls  And also  the rolls of toilet paper were left with a small amount on the dispenser   Not an issue since there was more underneath the sink 
519629430482373855,Not so Zen w  Zencity  I stayed here one     night  maybe      hours  Upon arrival the hallway on the way to the unit was very smoky  no problem no complaint  I enter the unit and while doing my usual walkthrough I notice the clean job is not so clean  again no problem no complaint  I search Airbnb to see if maybe I could find another place but nothing was available with such short notice  I run to the store and buy clean supplies etc then return to scrub down the kitchen  bathroom and whatever those stains were on the couch  Again no problem no complaint  I put a sheet over the couch so I could watch some tv and order dinner  After all that I was finally able to relax and go to sleep  I never once messaged or called the host and I certainly had no intention of doing a negative review  I woke up  wiped the bathroom back down after showering and placed all of my towels in the hamper they provided  After check out I then receive a request for      from Zencity saying I busted a hole in the closet door  With   picture showing a hole in the interior of a closet  I decline the charge because I did not nor have I ever caused any damage to any Airbnb  and I ve stayed in plenty   Furthermore  I didn t even use it at all being that my visit was so short  I have never had a host try to blame or charge me for any damages  Especially after I clean etc just to be able to stay the night there  This host has presented themselves as very dishonest in practice and is trying to pull one over on me 
519613259964058632,Terrible check in process Terrible check in process
485515412757910686,Stayed here while on a business trip  clean  cozy  well stocked   quickly responded about a light issue  sent someone out right away  Will definitely stay here again 
460063820977871652,Great location and great for a weekend stay Hey  We really enjoyed the stay  The view was great  and the location was good  Just a heads up about a few issues  they werent a big deal  The TV remote had dead batteries or was broken  The flapper on the toilet wouldnt lower enough  It was constantly draining water and wouldnt flush  We fixed that one  but it might not last  It also kinda smelled like smoke  Its not a huge deal  just wanted to bring it up so you were aware 
519582102134768360,I loved it   The decoration and the building so clean and nice  The location is near St  Louis station and the aquarium  I will definitely choose this place in the future if I had the chance   I highly recommend it   Thank you for this great place  We loved it  Do you have any other properties in the U S  
462965050117669970,Perfect space Its was perfect for me  I will be booking this space again  Hope you offer discounts with lengthy stays 
459367597725299060,The original confirmation code did not work and had to call for a new one  The room was subpar clean and most importantly  did not include a fob key  This is a major issue because you need the fob key to access the elevator  After addressing the information and asking for a full refund  Zencity has yet to respond to me    Would NOT recommend 
495714905389925398,Let s start off with THE PICTURES ARE NOT THE APARTMENT YOU STAY IN  The place wasn t dirty but the walls were dirty  It does not have a fire place  it smelt like kitty litter but that could be do to the water damage in the kitchen  the water in the shower was Luke warm  you have to pay to park on the block Mon   Saturday between  am    pm after that it s free  The building is out dated  The windows are drafty so we had to cut the heat up to    while sitting in the living room   THE PICTURES ARE NOT ACCURATE  Let s start off with THE PICTURES ARE NOT THE APARTMENT YOU STAY IN  The place wasn t dirty but the walls were dirty  It does not have a fire place  it smelt like kitty litter but that could be do to the water damage in the kitchen  the water in the shower was Luke warm  you have to pay to park on the block Mon   Saturday between  am    pm after that it s free  The building is out dated  The windows are drafty so we had to cut the heat up to    while sitting in the living room   THE PICTURES ARE NOT ACCURATE 
529055460575340265,Nice cozy place
463757982795234753,The place was nice  well kept  clean  and as advertised  Communication wasn t great  don t expect any flexibility  it s a large company  Expect it to be impersonal  Pretty nice place  service is basically what s expected from a large company
565222297029296462,great spot close to downtown with bare bones supplies  Still great value  best for crashing and being out downtown most of your time  nice basic place 
463710517929808594,Great place for the time convenience 
492807582330386977,Little trouble getting in  but wonderful stay  Gorgeous apartment and views  Thank you for a wonderful place to stay 
513834683561658827,I left my hat at the location which I understand is totally my fault  I reached out in hopes they would be able to return it to me and provide me with a way to retrieve it  It was a very expensive hat  They told me they would send me a shipping label when they find it  They ignored all messages after that and I never got a shipping label  You all are terrible at responding to messages 
523978554297102084,I had a great time at MI Ave Shops   View  Beach  Gym   Zencity  Its a very clean and quiet place with all the items you need  The bed is very comfortable and the location is great 
518805760688161282,Great host
470198486267188970,A very nice place to stay either short or long term   Small but well appointed with an effective window unit   Unit was clean   Hot water is plentiful  Bed was very comfortable  Overall it s a nice  safe spot with friendly doormen women   Parking is a bit difficult so be patient as it is on the street to the north or in one of two garages about   minute walks away  two blocks to one one block to the other   The circular drive up front is usable for loading and unloading   Would stay there again   Recommended  Thank you for a very nice stay   You might want to check the wiring in the kitchen   Using the dishwasher would cause the lights and microwave to shut off and reset   When you turned on the stove or oven  everything came back on and worked   Might be a short somewhere or a faulty dishwasher   I don t exactly know but it would probably be good to investigate 
519558689744867852,This indeed is a spacious apartment in a quiet neighborhood  I was very pleased to have the privacy  washer   dryer  kitchen and living room all to myself   My phone did not detect the wifi  but that didnt matter much   The loudest part of my stay was each time the heating unit kicked on   Overall it was well worth the money and I would stay there again  Thanks for hosting a secure  spacious place with the amenities I needed most   The bed was very comfortable and neighborhood nice and quiet 
463727868521671394,Good location
519550719746332997,Zencity management does NOT keep up with clean and property upkeep their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   It is disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my first encounter with a Zencity apartment  The property at the Shoreline is a lovely building  and the customer service at the front desk is great  but the upkeep in the Zencity unit is where things fall apart     Problems in the apartment   Cleaning Supplies  I had to spend my money  and purchase Lysol spray and Clorox wipes to clean the apartment to ensure that I would not come into contact with bacteria or the Covid    virus     Kitchen   dirty floor  I swept   there was a layer of dust on the stove  I clean   handprints on the drawer pulls and stove handle  I clean   the garbage can has caked on grime at the bottom and on the lid  There were dishes in the cabinet that were not properly clean  The door handle to the microwave is badly damaged and looks like its melting away    Carpet   The entire carpet from the entryway to the main room is dirty and stained  I had to sweep the entire carpet to get up the surface dirt  There are stains around the barstool area    Bedding  The pillows on the bed and in the storage closet were STAINED     Bathroom  There was hair on the floor  on the shower walls  and the floor had not been mopped  I sprayed the bathroom down in Clorox and mopped the floor  The water from mopping the floor was dark gray   just disgusting     Linens  I washed the pillowcases and towels before using them based on the condition of the bathroom and the stained pillowcases     How did Zencity help  After numerous messages sent on the Airbnb app  someone  without a mask  brought new pillows  and I received a measly     credit  Does my time and effort clean your rental property equate to     dollars      As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together   I  am very disappointed that the Zencity management does NOT maintain their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   Its deceptive selling  and its personally disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my first encounter with a Zencity apartment  The property at the Shoreline is a lovely building  and the customer service at the front desk is great  but the upkeep in the Zencity unit is where things fall apart     Problems in the apartment   Cleaning Supplies  I had to spend my money  and purchase Lysol spray and Clorox wipes to clean the apartment to ensure that I would not come into contact with bacteria or the Covid    virus     Kitchen   dirty floor  I swept   there was a layer of dust on the stove  I clean   handprints on the drawer pulls and stove handle  I clean   the garbage can has caked on grime at the bottom and on the lid  There were dishes in the cabinet that were not properly clean  The door handle to the microwave is badly damaged and looks like its melting away    Carpet   The entire carpet from the entryway to the main room is dirty and stained  I had to sweep the entire carpet to get up the surface dirt  There are stains around the barstool area    Bedding  The pillows on the bed and in the storage closet were STAINED     Bathroom  There was hair on the floor  on the shower walls  and the floor had not been mopped  I sprayed the bathroom down in Clorox and mopped the floor  The water from mopping the floor was dark gray   just disgusting     Linens  I washed the pillowcases and towels before using them based on the condition of the bathroom and the stained pillowcases     How did Zencity help  After numerous messages sent on the Airbnb app  someone  without a mask  brought new pillows  and I received a measly     credit  Does my time and effort clean your rental property equate to     dollars      As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together  
467386045316426961,Great experience all around 
481806439858992746,Everything was great  Zencity has the stage and best company my opinion  I had a great stay beside getting in and out of the garage but other then everything was prefect Only thing i had a problem with was getting in and out of the garage  Other then that everything was great
460084984971548499,Great location  Nice apt   However it smelled of cigarettes and pot   So much so we could not close the windows   The code to enter was wrong and it took over an hour for zen city to get us a new one   Overall disappointed in the management  Good location however we had a difficult time entering the apt as the code was wrong   No one would return our communication through Airbnb  We finally called and received a new code    Once inside we smelled cigarettes and pot    The apt was fine as was the location   Zen city did a poor job managing our stay 
510896136481122923,There were so many issues with this unit and building   To start we got to the building to retrieve the key   fob  The code didn t work to get the key   After calling they had to see if there was any other way to get a key  Finally got one out    We got to the unit  it was clean  The bed only had a sheet on it  KC in December you need a comforter    After going to dinner and coming back  the fob didn t grant access to the building  I called the host  Their solutions were calling other units in the building to let in  that didn t work so we were told they many need to put us up in another place  Finally after an hour we got in  Again cold outside December KC    The next day  went to lunch and came back  Again the fob didn t work  I called again and they reached to maintenance   I was told I would get a call back  After   hours of no call back  I called them back so we could leave the building  Their solutions   they would be able to get a replacement fob the next day  they day I check out  Then to get in find someone s else entering the building and sneak in behind them    I told them that I have medication I need access to  All I got was sorry that s the only solution we can offer    Finally I asked if there was any spare fobs at all that I could have access to after an hour on the phone  They had to call maintenance again  Finally worked  I ve still not received a call back on the poor experience  Not having access to the unit I rented is such a big disappointment  It s something you pay for  On top of it  they told me the comforter was missing when it was never there    I expected much better from ZenCity  I really need a call back from someone  This has been the worst experience I ve had  I didn t have access to the unit multiple times in the cold  The solution you gave was for me to sneak in when someone else buzzes in  Then you were going to give me a new fob the day we checked out  Someone needs to contact me
460168166250568964,Loved the location  close to P and L and the River market  and great security  Bed is a bit smaller then we thought for the   of us but overall great experience staying here  I do believe a few lights have burned out  one in kitchen and other in the bathroom 
473920932405840635,Would definitely recommend staying here  Zencity never missed a beat  Place beautiful and clean will definitely stay again  My first time at Airbnb  It was perfect 
519614488844356422,This place was a very good deal  very spacious for two people and was clean  We found free on street parking on the same street and its a great location 
463735233886919946,Nice place to stay  but the lack of parking is a problem  I loved my stay  It was quiet and nice and clean  The desk personnel were SO nice  friendly  and helpful to me  Parking was a problem though  But I would love to stay at the DelPrado Building again sometime 
460819938335600158,Great property with easy access to so many great Chicago features  It was very frustrating to have been assigned an inaccurate code to unlock the door  We were unable to make an appointment on time    Also the TV when turned on  was at an absurdly loud  painful level   There was no second control to adjust the volume so it was not usable  
564466829817891239,      I hope to stay here next time Im in Kansas City   One of my best AirBnB experiences all around   Very prompt communication  clean place  great location  wonderful experience  It was a little confusing how to get into the building afterhours  I arrived around   pm  and how to use the elevators  Believe it or not  I had trouble with that  but the security guard helped me out    Apart from the initial confusion and many locked doors on the premises   it was probably one of the best airbnbs Ive ever stayed at      Thank you again 
524678434770586356,   out of      I recommend 
463782901469764772,Great location  comfortable apt      of electricity was out  st night  No WiFi for   days  Otherwise  location was great 
485488719247117427,Great location  clean  and close to activities  We enjoyed our stay  It was a great location for us and within walking distance of multiple things  The key fob seemed a little faulty as it wouldn t let us in the building nor the room  it was only working for the elevator  not sure if that s the only thing it s programmed for  
498606907356366461,This place was not clean at all upon arrival  I wouldnt suggest staying here  There were at least   flies in the room and outside the bathroom there was a splatter on the wall with hair stuck to it  The carpets were clearly not even vacuumed and there were pieces of trash still left around  Great location but not very happy about our stay here  This place wasnt clean at all     
471003478223117766,This rental is amazing   Location is perfect and the place was extremely clean   Will be staying again 
546389872414993232,Great place and great location 
520273752497793300,Love this place Thanks for having always great when staying with you guys
520249895212362996,Great stay  zencity is always a go to  Wifi was not working  I didn t reach out wasn t worth trouble would have been nice though   They were great with responding and adjusting the thermostat  Great stay  zencity is always a go to  Wifi was not working  I didn t reach out wasn t worth trouble would have been nice though   They were great with responding and adjusting the thermostat 
532623325220201563,Loved the apartment  looks just like the pictures and modernized at a great nightly price  Thank you for allowing us to stay at your property 
545671364598523401,always has best units and best customer service  shout out to Clifford  always helping to the best of his ability    stars and some was disappointed with having plans denied for staying with you till Monday  still dont understand but I still will continue to book with Zencity 
546349262488271362,Zen needs to have a better logistic when it comes to paying attention to clients  I waited   hour and    minutes unable to access the building  Tried contacting the host several times and the only response that I got   several hour later  was to remember my check out  disregarding my inconvenience 
470997180431934662,Awesome location  awesome rooftop  Very good value  All was great for what we needed but the couch was wet and unusable 
463679444651766483,Well the location was good  I always found free parking on the street that was nearby  The interior of the apt       was good and clean   The bed was comfy but the pillows are horrible and seem to be made from polyester and hard foam   The hallway areas of the building  were dirty and had food  dirt  tiny papers trash all about  And this was on every floor  the walls of the hallways were also a bit dirty and unkept  I stayed here  five days and nobody clean the floors   The building needs maintenance workers or new residents that care about cleanliness   Furthermore the elevator was broken for nearly   days  The instructions to enter the building from street level were still incorrect  It was a total pain to wait on a resident to let me in the building that I paid for  It was so inconvenient  Sometimes I just stayed in the apt all day due to being afraid of not being able to get back into building  you really need to fix this issue
544215301487889022,great place to stay if you re looking for something cheap and easy in a good location 
463744718813950204,Nice   great value
463785107016271255,Thanks
500765823175764405,Sent a private message to this owner about our experience  After   days  They finally reached out with a saved message sent to all their disappointed customers   Thanks but no thanks    Move on to the next    when searching Already sent and it took you   days to respond
510912680907634910,This was the perfect spot for a gals weekend  Cozy  chic  comfy beds  clean unit   We packed our own toiletries so didn t have an issue with the hotel style shampoo and conditioner that s provided   It was lovely to have coffee available to make in unit or to walk to any of the wonderful shops that this place is centrally located in   Highly recommend booking
505099046479182241,My family and I came home for Thanksgiving and had the pleasure of staying in this beautifully updated historic home directly across the street from the Truman Home Historic Site  The property has been masterfully updated with modern features  appliances and fixtures while still highlighting the ambiance of the home s historic origins  The owner  Slawik is incredibly communicative and friendly   truly a pleasure to work with him on the reservation and be in touch during our weeklong stay  Thank you again  Slawik for opening your lovely home to us while we were home for Thanksgiving  It was a pleasure to be in touch with you over the past few months regarding our stay and we will be sure to pass along the info about your beautiful Truman Airbnb property to any of our out of town friends visiting KC in the future as well   
526144434166168192,Nice place clean and cozy  Be prepared if intercom system is down  Communication became a blur after that  Nice area and decent parking  You need an alternative for when the intercom is down 
481147914697596667,This was an amazingly fresh place for me to recharge from   days of driving  I felt very safe  comfortable and clean during my stay  The coffee shops are just steps away for fresh morning brew and pastries  The parking was conveniently located in front of the building and the security officer was professional and kind  once I was able to get into the apartment it was awesome but the instructions for entering the building were confusing and the person I spoke with from zencity was snippy and rude whenever I called for help to access the the building  I loved the pad tho  Very clean  modern  comfortable   had everything I needed and some  thank you
460810369845708470,Good location and nice building  However  it claimed to be  obsessively clean  and that was not the case  Walls were covered with markings and the furniture and carpets were visibly dirty  Overall  we enjoyed our stay  I just wish it had been as clean as they advertised it to be  Really enjoyed the location and overall it was a nice place  I did wish it was a little cleaner through  Especially with how much it claims to have high cleanliness standards
464512642589056783,great stay
486145320183468538,Very clean  spacious  and easy check in  Great neighborhood too with restaurants only a short distance away  Thanks again 
516730795427461021,Had a wonderful stay it s a nice quiet studio to enjoy for a quick getaway room is very cozy as well  Will book again in future 
520875919630513180,Still waiting for refund  Zencity  the host company  provided several options for check in time when I made my reservation  I chose  am  The night before my reservation  Zencity wrote to me with the check in instructions and told me I could not check in until  pm  When I explained that my reservation was for a  am check in  they just said  Airbnb made an error  and would not let me check in 
464518728843259603,Beautiful Apt suite

460843601309027396,perfect for a short stay   check in process was so easy    there s lots of things to do in walking distance   our stay was amazing   the only issue i had was the main light in the bedroom didn t work and we couldn t get some of the apps on the tv to work and on other apps the volume didn t work  other than that  it was amazing   you guys made the whole process so easy
496387526035889103,Great check in instructions  but you re on your own after that  Host ignored multiple messages about the heat being out  to the point where I had to contact the building myself to fix it  Other than that it s exactly as advertised  I m still a little shocked that you never replied to messages about the heat not working  I shouldn t have had to contact the building myself 
531221047168928205,The owners give great instructions  Follow all the instructions and everything should go great  Beautiful place  they took the time to ensure safety was a priority  We felt safe  The location was perfect  right in the middle of everywhere we needed to be 
546392540424467831,I really enjoyed my stay here  Hosts were responsive and very polite with any and all requests  The location and space was great  and I d absolutely stay here again  Thank you for the great stay   I really appreciated your responsiveness  and the space itself was wonderful    Only suggestion to look into  the handle on one of the pans was pretty flimsy and could use either some glue or just a new pan overall  That s it though 
486222920010741289,Utilitarian
460693093614231101,This is ran by a company  not an individual  They could provide a working key fob for me to get into the apartment  After speaking with a rep on the phone  and being locked out of the apartment  they couldn t call me back to let me know about a replacement key fob  They still tried to charge me to stay in this apartment after they couldn t provide a working key fob  and after they couldn t return a phone call to let me know whether or not they had a replacement fob  I would not recommend renting from them  Not trust worthy 
460858070091318296,Was a nice spot  easy check in  close to everything   Parking was a bit challenging but wasn t too bad     Only down side would be the smell of the unit   Luckily we were there much but it s an issue that would need to be addressed The stay would have been much better if the unit didn t stink so bad   Something is very wrong with the toxic smell that is coming from the downstairs spare room closet   It s way overbearing   I had to get air fresheners and a candle to try and mask the smell   But that didn t really do much
546414351341072251,Nice room  exactly as stated in description  All of the amenities you need away from home  Even provided laundry detergent  Just a little feedback for you  The room was clean and well stocked everything was as you said it would be  The issue I had was the check in  I followed the instructions to a t but I still could not get in the temperature was in the single digits and I stood outside for over    minutes with your employee helping me get in  Then when we got upstairs with the key the key would not also work  I traveled up and down the elevator with all of my luggage twice to retrieve the other key and it still did not work only to find out that I only needed to press the lock button for it to display the numbers to put in the code  Your employee was under the impression that the key fob would open the door  My entire stay the key fob Ive never worked and I had to use the code to get in and out  The other issue was that the temperature got down to single digits a couple of the nights and I could not turn the heat up  It read that it was being controlled remotely  A couple nights I was extremely cold  The last straw was that I needed to use the extension link that was sent to me and it did not work  So I called or text and requested to extend but the rate I was charged was not the rate that was stated on the extension  Im not sure if additional service fees or clean fees were added but I only requested three nights at     each and my new bill was an additional       I decided to leave and just go to a different Airbnb  You have a nice facility but the administration portion needs tweaking
470296728664246409,Big house  lots of room  Centrally located  For an old house it is in very good condition  Owner is very nice and accommodating  Thank for being available to us  Just a few suggestions  Bathroom door on  nd floor would not close due to floor vent  Floors were not clean very good  Need curtains on windows in living and dining room  especially being on Main Street  Other than that great house 
502959112736267511,Location was great but when we checked in  the place was not clean  There were not enough towels for three days so I asked for more  but host did not respond  Do not recommend 
526722183716743234,I booked this place and requested a early check in on the form in two locations  I explained I was a  rd shift worker and travelled four hours straight from work  I needed to check in early to sleep  They accepted my reservation request and never gave me check in instructions   They also never informed me until I arrived that my request wasn t approved  Had they told me  I would have gone somewhere else that could accommodate me  They refused to refund all my money  They ad also says free parking but if you look harder within the ad  it also says no parking on site  This place is also in a very dangerous park of down and looks nothing like the pictures  There is no one on site to help you  I booked this place and requested a early check in on the form in two locations  I explained I was a  rd shift worker and travelled four hours straight from work  I needed to check in early to sleep  They accepted my reservation request and never gave me check in instructions   They also never informed me until I arrived that my request wasn t approved  Had they told me  I would have gone somewhere else that could accommodate me  They refused to refund all my money  The ad also says free parking but if you look harder within the ad  it also says no parking on site  This place is also in a very dangerous park of down and looks nothing like the pictures  There is no one on site to help you 
486883434268638895,Great location and building security 
466611074693368301,This place was worth soooo much more than it s daily value clean and comfy  Spacious and easy for me to get around with my disability  I would want to stay here every time I come to Chicago  This place was worth soooo much more than it s daily value clean and comfy  Spacious and easy for me to get around with my disability  I would want to stay here every time I come to Chicago 
460821171157697903,This space was really cute at first glance but it was not clean once you looked around  Dirty dishes in the cabinets  dirty floors  and it made me wonder how clean the linens  blankets  and pillows actually were  The place was really cute at first glance  but there was dust everywhere  it hadn t been vacuumed  the dishes we used had to be clean before we used them really unhappy with what I paid and how unclean the place actually was
547082881822873813,Close to restaurants and Belmont station where three lines converge  Super convenient and secure  Highly recommend  Thank you again  Your place is always a comfortable to stay 
529013685993591880,Loved my stay  Available parking   quiet neighborhood  and beautiful home 
545630595033028185,The place was nice and was what I needed  TV has programs and apps  Bed was comfortable enough for me and there was enough towels for my stay  Other than the check in problem  I was provided the wrong entrance code and the wrong unit number  which was resolved after contacting the host  the rest of the stay was smooth with no issue  Next door neighbour had some kids which I don t mind to hear them playing but they used to go to bed early  Building was fine in general and there was a very good local restaurant nearby called Luigi Restaurant  Their burger was one of the best  Thanks  It was a good stay 
482614569169276745,Clean and modern apartment in the middle of downtown  Easy check in and out  Nice view at night 
521000075993112223,The location of this airbnb was perfect    right in wicker park  close to the blue line and the    bus  The place was gorgeous and clean  with a beautiful bathroom  I believe we were the first guests to stay in the house and there were a few kinks  issues with the doors lock   but once those issues are resolved  and I imagine theyll be easy to resolve   itll be the perfect place to stay  Hi   thank you for the stay  The location was EXACTLY what we wanted for our trip  However  there were a few things that I hope you can fix for future guests   I believe we may have been the first guests to stay there  so hopefully these are quick fixes       The lock to get in    obviously  we had to call because the first night we couldnt get back into the house even though the code worked fine earlier in the day  Then the following day  we had to enter the new code   times before the door actually opened  Im curious if the lock has issues with the cold       The doors to the balcony as well as the window doors in the master bedroom were very  very difficult to close properly  We couldnt get it closed initially and the wind would swing the door open  which is very unsafe  Eventually we realized that you need to lift the handle way up in order for it to close properly  but I still did not feel super safe with those doors       This one is super minor  but the tv was a bit difficult to navigate  May just be helpful to include instructions like you need to hit  tv  on the remote before adjusting the volume 
500709371018365451,great location really Recommend  Will be here again 
491996742494362867,Beautiful unit  Beautiful view  You definitely get your money s worth  I will admit the couch was a little small for the three of us but the chairs sufficed  The beds were comfortable and the extra linens came in handy  The kitchen is amazing and had pretty much everything i needed to cook my usual sunday dinner  The fridge has ice filtered water which was a huge plus  The shower in the master bed is to die for  The windows are beautiful and brings in so much great natural light however be weary that ur neighbors can see in unless u close the blinds  The only issue we had is that we kept receiving a prompt that we were being too loud even when we had left for the evening  So i will just say keep in mind the walls are thin  Other than that i would definitely book again  Beautiful unit with a beautiful view  When i arrived however i can tell the unit hadnt been through a deep clean as dishes in the cabinet were a little dirty  there was hair in the master bathroom s shower  and water bottles behind the couch  It wasnt a huge deal as i can see how these things could get overlooked  I also had a hard time closing the blinds and Im sure at one point the neighbors may have seen me getting out the shower  Other than that this unit was perfect and so beautiful  The city view was very beautiful  The unit s furnishing and finishes were gorgeous  I feel that i got more than my moneys worth  I was especially appreciative of the well stocked kitchen  as i dont like to miss a good Sunday dinner  I do apologize that i wasnt able to discard trash bags leftover groceries as i was not able to locate the trash chute  I will definitely be booking again if not this unit then a similar one offered by zen city  Thank you so very much for having me 
572524541322086239,nope I have pictures of clusters of pubic hair in the hallway and in the elevator waiting area on the  th floor  The night before I left  there were shards of glass on the elevator left by the clean crew  You need to watch the clean crew  because those people are making   person do the majorityof the work while the restof those lazy fucks sit against the wall relaxing  Saw it twice   and yes  they were all black  I was in the same situation    years ago   Youre saving money on clean  but in the end its going to cost you  Eat shit all the way until your noy is Turdville  not leaving a bad review   but you need to have a rover to check the situation in your common areas 
572497854750114901,What a beautiful place   We very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others  While we loved our stay  but we did find hairs in the bed as well as in the shower  Not sure if the cleaner was on a hurry or not  Just something to note incase it becomes a common comment   We added a can opener to your drawer  A bowl to mix salad in could have been helpful as well as a cookie sheet or pizza pan   All in all  we didn t lack for much  It was a great stay 
572523881950984659,The building was secure where you needed a key card to enter and leave  The beds were very comfortable and the space was big for a two bedroom two bathroom unit  The location includes covered parking and most things are within walking distance  The room was clean but did not seem to be vacuumed beforehand  the shower water pressure was minimal  and it was hard to reach someone for help on the weekends  Not the best  not the worst 
521053481434699874,Great location  clean apartment  and easy communication with host   The apartment had everything I needed for my   week visit  Highly recommend  Thanks 
520965133200114605,What a great spot  Host is super communicative and responsive  Place is fantastic  and such a great location  Thanks so much  This was much appreciated and yall were terrific 
534065177403737548,Be aware that there is no parking available and we had to park quite far at a meter which needed to be paid at   am  Other than that  cute place 
568163600457010302,Bed was extremely uncomfortable  spring mattress  woke up sore  Heat also wasn t on and it was cold all night   The Stay was nice  apartment is the perfect size and clean  Good location  and communication 
486164507190825519,Great place  Thanks so much  
465134631277840912,Nice spot and walkable to many bars and restaurants 
521014451593703556,The most trouble I ve had with an Airbnb  Both of the checkin codes they gave me were broken  i wouldn t have been able to get inside if it weren t for another couple  also  having trouble checking in    Eventually got into my room  The bathroom door  slides over  has a huge gap  and won t stay closed anyway    The room got very warm even though it was December and I had the heat turned off  the thermostat was locked to prevent using the A C  It took several hours to cool down with the windows open as far as the window guards would allow    Also the water in the only sink was always at least warm  cold water would not come out of the tap    The icing on the cake was getting a knock on the door the day before the end of my stay   Another  group had been given the same room as me through Airbnb  I confirmed my stay was not yet over  but I can t imagine the other group had a fun time finding a last minute place to stay 
485477804645074954,Pay attention to the check in procedure and you will have a great stay    great place to stay  I slept great   
481886831106497235,Very clean nice place  but Main Street is very loud so beware if you don t want to hear cop cars nightly  I had so much trouble getting the keys  and getting into my unit  needing help from some strangers who had also been having trouble getting keys to their own unit  Parking is definitely tricky  not a ton of spaces available close by  Overall  not my favorite especially not for the price  but very nice interior aesthetic 
473887879528816877,Awesome clean location just not good communication as am still awaiting replies for things left behind  Left my camera there have contacted the host and no reply as of yet  Have filed police report and will be reviewing footage  Please contact             Jordan  Thank you
515925111268273555,There were stains on the carpet and none of the remotes worked  The first thing we weren t able to get in for almost an hour  The key fob didn t work  and I had to get a code    Second  the tv remote barely worked  I couldn t turn on the tv with it or change the volume   Third  the fan light remote didn t work at all    Fourth  there were stains on the Carpet   Fifth  the window was left open  and the clock had the wrong time   Sixth  there were stains in front of the window by the bathroom   Lastly  there was food or something on the picture frame that talked about the place   I have pictures videos of most of these  I usually love Airbnb and have stayed in a Zencity before  This definitely was my worse experience  I complained to Airbnb  but they told me to first talk to you 
391979486571454280,Great place if in the area  great communication from host  Thank you for everything  look forward to hearing from you in the future 
465191586075790174,This space was lovely and in a really great part of St  Louis  Definitely a nice and cozy place to be for a wedding weekend    
572521099459745595,Overall  I would say my stay here was okay  The location was good and the interior was very nice  I did have an issue upon check in with my access code and had to actually set off the alarm on the door multiple times before anyone responded to me  The elevator also broke in the building and you have to access the stairs in the back of the building  I would have never known this if was not for someone that worked at the restaurant next door  You also have to have a separate code to enter the back door and had to wait outside in the cold to get ahold of someone  I would probably not stay at this location again 
516694222293637250,Super spacious  easy checkin  perfect for a few days visiting the city 
465198983337733567,Great location  Parking was difficult to find at times 
505097591620204319,The only good part about this property was it s location  There was no parking except paid parking on the street  Apartment had roaches in the kitchen  only   blinds worked properly  so place was dark  only one of three light bulbs in bathroom worked  shower and tubs paint was peeling badly  apartment was cold and drafty especially at the window AC units radiators wake you up every morning  about   am sounding like someone hammering the pipes in your room  Management sounds like they re calling you from China with an oatmeal box and a string  This place was AWFUL 
547156702139260154,A    A   
458635314376874265,Fantastic place  great locale and comfy and I would stay here again   The staff downstairs was friendly and helpful   I dropped my kid off a UChicago  so I walking to the university or driving back and forth   The flat is really nicely located within less than     mile walk to Promontory Point and then within a mile or so walk from really good dining   Parking   look  there are people who live in the building so the parking area in front of the building tends to empty and fill around working hours   I didnt have any issues with parking but that is because everything I needed was within walking distance and if you want to go into town  use the Metra     for a one way ticket  cash on the train   The Metra stations are close and within walking distance  Couple of suggestions   Quite frankly  the place was awesome  great locale and clean and comfy  I would definitely stay again     Consider replacing the shower nozzle   The water pressure is really strong but the shower nozzle is very weak  I think it is just old     Either the vacuum is not working well or the carpet is just not being clean by the clean crew because the carpet had quite a few particles on it   Otherwise  the place is clean     Something is blocking the drain in the sink in the bathroom  the water takes a long time to drain 
572518196813461595,I was working at BJH so it was only a short distance from work  The room was nice  bed was comfortable  bedding was super soft and clean  The communication was top notch  They responded within seconds of me sending inquiries  I even extended my stay a few more days  I will be staying with them again  couldnt have asked for a better stay  This was a great stay  The communication was amazing   will be booking further stays with you  only issue was my room had just been clean and they clean products used were VERY strong upon entering the room  few areas on the walls that need touched up but everything else was great  Thanks
481877768961884916,Clean and lovely  Great location  Recommended  Things were great  Thank you 
572486490351822780,I gave this     because my check in was ridiculous long this time  this is my second time using Zencity     however everything else was okay except for there not being a sink in the bathroom   I gave this     because my check in was ridiculous long this time  this is my second time using Zencity     however everything else was okay except for there not being a sink in the bathroom  
461578127434512063,DO NOT STAY HERE    They were supposed to leave me a fob keycard to be able to get in and out of the building  in and out of the parking and to be able to use the elevator and stairwell  I rented this Airbnb as I was driving    hours for a concert  I ended up missing the concert because it took   hours to sign in due to having to have the front desk escort me around the building that way I could get into the apartment  When I called the phone number I was rudely hung up by a customer service agent of this company  It s not a apartment owner renting out there property it s a business that has multiple units and after speaking with the front desk all the other people who rented there units also had the same issue  So I ended up wasting      plus    hours and   days due to me not being able to leave the apartment  I called numerous times but they would not respond to me and when they would answer the phone I would have to explain my whole issue again for them to say we will call you back shortly and them never calling me back  Worst Airbnb experience ever  I will never be staying with you again this was a horrible experience  I still can t believe the fact that I lost my concert that I drove    hours to go just because your company forgot to leave me the keycards for the building  elevator  stairwell and parking 
549314101529327820,This beautiful spot is just great and cozy  Will definitely consider staying there in the future  Thank you Zen  What a lovely space 
543466511256363162,DO NOT STAY HERE  The unit was DISGUSTING upon my arrival  It was so GROSS  The city sidewalk is probably cleaner or an alley  I didnt even stay there  I had to stay at a friends house during my entire trip all while trying to conduct business meetings  via zoom  Im currently working with my bank and LAWYER to get my money back for services not rendered  Zen you have the pictures Ive sent regarding the matter    I  also have video evidence of the unit that backs up my claim  Do yourself a favor and do the right thing  REFUND my money  You need to make sure your clean staff is clean the unit after every guest  Shame on you for charging a clean fee when no clean is done  This is why I didnt stay at your bnb  It was disgusting  With covid cases on the rise  you should be on top of keeping things in and around the bnb sanitary  Instead of letting germs and filth fester 
508647433597672170,Great apartment with amazing natural light  a full kitchen  and great work space  Thanks for having me 
465144009723857472,Nice place in the perfect location but  it was not clean and I had problems entering the building  keep the place clean please
516655596932253043,Although the apartment was huge and very clean  we had some major issues  Principally  when we arrived to check into our apartment  we were alerted that someone else was staying in our apartment  Although the concierge was very nice and helpful  it was a bit alarming that Zencity didn t know at first who could be staying in our apartment  We ended up finding another Airbnb in the same building  but it definitely added an element of spookiness and discomfort to our stay  Secondly  the wifi was pretty terrible  We resorted to waving around our laptops in the air in order to catch a connection  If these issues were resolved  I would happily stay here  but alas as is  I would be hesitant to book again 
465151043691739037,The space is adequate  the appliances function  the streaming TV works  and the beds are comfy  The building access instructions did not work and we got no assistance with that problem  We had more than half of our showers cold  apparently at random 
521050409940372854,Great location  Good amenities  Has a gym and basketball court in basement that my friends really enjoyed after a day out in the city  If you re looking for a warm and hospitable airbnb experience you wont find it here  Its all very corporate  No snacks nothing to make one feel welcome as one walks into the space at    pm  They also need to improve their check in process   We were stuck in the main vestibule waiting for someone to go in late at night with bags as the machine wasn t unlocking the door on saying the password  We all tried multiple times  I was really disappointed when i texted them about needing a late check out  Hy which i meant max    minuted but their immediate response was give us    more bucks and you can have a late check out  No question about how late or anything  So disappointing  It really left a bad taste and was very off putting  Definitely not what im used to from airbnbs with a personal Touch
547127311655412837,After our   week stay  I would recommend that you please do NOT stay here or in any Zen City owned property  Especially if considering this unit for a long term stay  I preface this by saying I travel year round for work and rent often from AirBnb  I have never left a poor review before this    During our   week stay  we encountered issues that have been mentioned in previous reviews  which shows they have never been successfully resolved  as well as new issues not mentioned in previous reviews    When we arrived  the unit smelled very strongly of sewage and or a dead animal  We notified the hosts  who sent maintenance out  Maintenance was only ever able to give trouble shooting ideas  none of which resolved the issue  and then the hosts never had maintenance come assess or try to resolve the issue again    There is also a clear issue with water in this apartment  The water would only run hot sometimes  and when it did  it only lasted between      minutes total per day depending on the day  The hosts sent someone out to address the issue  and when that repair did not resolve the issue  they never sent maintenance back to address it and it went unresolved    The city maintenance also had to shut down the water for an hour  which caused one of the toilets to stop working  We had an unusable  broken  clogged toilet for an entire week before it was fixed  as maintenance had to order and wait for a part to arrive  and we were paying for a two bed two bath the entire time  Thankfully  AirBnb support was able to process a     refund of affected nights    On top of all these individual issues  communication with Zen City the entire time was extremely vague and lacking  When I mentioned issues  I was often told they were passing it along to the corresponding team  and rarely or never received information with solid details on when or even if maintenance was going to show up  When I would check back in  not having heard anything  I was often speaking with someone entirely different than before and had to re explain issues as if they were brand new  I even communicated that no one was to knock or enter the apartment before   am  and that boundary was either not communicated from Zen City to corresponding teams or completely disregarded    as maintenance showed up at     am  We spent our entire stay waiting for issues to be addressed or resolved  and it was clear by the end of our stay Zen City was not addressing issues  but it felt they were rather waiting for us to leave  After the initial troubleshooting attempts for both the terrible sewage smell and hot water issues  no one ever came to address the issues before we left    I will never stay with Zen City again  and strongly advise anyone considering staying here not to  It s unfortunate  because the unit is gorgeous from its appearance  but entirely unlivable due to unresolved issues and horrendous communication and customer service  Our stay here was an absolute nightmare  Ive never left a poor review before this  and it makes me sad this was the case  as    solely from appearances    this unit if beautiful  However with the extreme inconvenience caused from unresolved maintenance issues including the horrid sewage smell  the hot water issues  and the broken toilet which wasnt fixed for a week  as well as with the clear gaps in communication  I am left with no choice  I highly recommend establishing better communication between your Zen City staff and your maintenance teams 
465140441645604969,We didn t appreciate the rude behavior of your clean lady after she cussed us out for arriving for our approved early check in  She told us to leave and return in    mins which we did and she did a half fast job  Floors were dirty  room smelt like weed    bed sheets had a blood stain  red stain  The key sensor was also an inconvenience because it did not work and it took about an hour and    mins before we were able to get a new one  We didn t appreciate the rude behavior of your clean lady after she cussed us out for arriving for our approved early check in  She told us to leave and return in    mins which we did and she did a half fast job  Floors were dirty  room smelt like weed    bed sheets had a blood stain  red stain  The key sensor was also an inconvenience because it did not work and it took about an hour and    mins before we were able to get a new one 
521047618735144083,This place is always amazing      
572523993545291374,The apartment not ready at the check in still have previous gust with their staff   I spend one night in hotel form my own money and don t Reimburse the money back to me for the hotel   The house not ready to check in at that time
572522062064138759,This was a great location for our stay and even though the train runs alongside the apartment building  it was surprisingly quiet in the apartment  Zencity was quick to provide all of the info that was needed and checking in was a breeze  Hi  Thanks for hosting us in Chicago  Two quick suggestions   we had to do quite a bit of sweeping in the apartment to get the crumbs off the floor when we arrived  the vacuum barely worked so the broom was our best bet  I didn t want to fuss about it when we were there but wanted to give you a heads up  The other thing is that more hooks in the apartment would be a great addition so that people can keep their stuff organized and off the floor 
572519033882706055,A very nice place to stay Iwould definitely rebook its a perfect location for me when I visit Chicago Im used to staying in hotels because I travel alot and have had many levels of experience  Something I learned to do when I check into my hotel room as to turn off all the lights and use a black light to examine the place and so I did the same at your apartment and I noticed its in need of another level of cleanmost of all in the kitchen and bathroom  under the light It appears that someone threw up on the Walls and door of the bathroom and it didnt get clean properly  The microwave  dish strainer  stove and table were all very filth under the light I noticed the clean materials under the sink from eco lab and Im familiar with the company they make decent products but I would advise   getting a black light to do an exam of the place and using bleach to clean the troubled areas and maybe repeat that process once a month to affect a higher level of cleanliness    I also realized that the placegas been repainted many many times Its very obvious and gives the place sort of an old tacky feeling  I would advise that the next time its painted that the doors and frames and base boards be stripped or sanded down before putting on a fresh coat the walls should be fine   most will not notice or care about the things I pointed out because they will likely not recognize them so i just offered this feedback in the spirit of giving an honest opinionabout what I think can be done to improve the space   and I would replace both the kitchen and living room tables with something new and adding a small desk to the bedroom 
516628313480077845,You get what you pay for  Coffee maker was disgusting  Along bathtub  Cracks in the walls  I know it wasn t a   star hotel but it s easy to make sure it s clean before you rent it out  Place was cleaner when we left 
486161831185256574,Place wasn t bad for a quick stay  nothing super to boast about and although it was only     to stay  the clean fee cost more which seems a bit extreme  Also had issues getting into apartment and messaged host about the issue only to finally get a reply hours later 
465189054219417041,Great  clean place  Nice views of the city and very helpful building staff  Thanks for letting my team stay 
571769656668809648,My stay here was absolutely amazing  The apartment was beautiful  clean  and in a great location  Communication was spot on and they were very accommodating  I definitely plan on staying here again in the near future 
571758074533249810,Check in was kind of a mess  The address stated had paddle locked doors  to get in from the street you had to go around the corner from the actual address  The address given for the parking garage was wrong too  we only had to drive around the block  but it would have been nice to have the right directions the first time  Beware they do not validate Airbnb parking in this building it was     day  they did not say how much  Once we finally got into the building the man at the front desk was very helpful as I struggled a bit to find the box with the key in it  I was soooooo excited to use the bathtub since it was super deep  However  as soon as I looked there was a bunch of hair in the tub  so I know it was not clean and I definitely didnt want to bathe in someone elses filth  They offered to have someone come clean it the next day  but I did not feel comfortable having a stranger in the place with mine and three other peoples stuff in there  So pretty disappointed we paid a clean fee to see that they do not clean very well  Also makes me wonder what else wasnt clean that I just couldnt see  It was fine for the weekend  but probably would not rent again from this place  Check in was kind of a mess  The address stated had paddle locked doors  to get in from the street you had to go around the corner from the actual address  Once we finally got into the building the man at the front desk was very helpful as I struggled a bit to find the box with the key in it  I was soooooo excited to use the bathtub since it was super deep  However  as soon as I looked there was a bunch of hair in the tub  so I know it was not clean and I definitely didnt want to bathe in someone elses filth  You offered to have someone come clean it the next day  but I did not feel comfortable having a stranger in the place with mine and three other peoples stuff in there  So pretty disappointed we paid a clean fee to see that they did not clean  Also makes me wonder what else wasnt clean that I just couldnt see  It was fine for the weekend  but I definitely would not recommend this place 
497133714005631764,Good travels Great experience
571763498262960139,Wonderful location and a gorgeous little apartment  Lots of nearby dining and bars  Loved the apartment and the location was awesome  My girlfriend and I had a great time exploring KC and enjoyed our first Airbnb experience
461540276898669796,Very nice place  parking wasn t bad  Nice quiet and clean  Would book again   Thanks  Very nice place parking wasn t bad  Nice quiet and clean 
460156541969526758,This was the perfect place for our stay  My only complaint would be the delay of check in information  which was partly our fault because we didn t realize it until we arrived  Otherwise  location was great and felt very safe  Parking was easily accessible  Just to send the check in information a little bit sooner  Also mention the stairs in the description because we thought we were on the first floor  We had a lot of stuff to carry because we had a baby with us  Otherwise perfect 
482537479244051210,The location is perfect  Great restaurants and bars close to the stay  Would definitely recommend if you re wanting to enjoy downtown KC  Will definitely be back  I had a fantastic stay  Your company  was helpful and courteous when I had questions  Will definitely be stay with zen city again 
547152983538968003,Great place  Excellent location  really comfortable Perfect place  Great attention  Thank you
492050340569156008,Great apartment in an absolutely fabulous location  near pubs  restaurants  shops and Paulina train station   Accommodations were comfortable   I didnt mind the creaking floors that others complained about   its called  ambiance    My one wish is that there were more furniture   Especially need a dining table that fits the number of possible guests   Other things like dressers  side tables  etc  would give the place more utility   But  overall a great base camp for exploring the local neighborhood and Chicago as a whole  Great place   Just a few issues I wanted to share privately   You should ask your cleaners to pay better attention to the bathroom sink  There was a bunch of mold under the rim that rained down as soon as I splashed some water   There was no body wash or shampoo  as advertised   Theres a nail head sticking out in the wood floor of larger bedroom that might catch someones toe 
465286178909503039,I d like to preface this review by saying that I never actually write reviews  Only in cases where the experience is very good or very bad do I think it s worth the effort  My wife and I have stayed at a number of Airbnb s  and  our experiences have generally been great  Our stay with Zencity was anything but   We were staying for a week in Chicago for my work  with my wife planning to work full time from the Airbnb for the week  My wife is also pregnant  By the second day of our stay with Zencity  the unit began to reek of cigarette smoke  and was at its worst during the day for the hours that my wife was working from the unit  Secondhand smoke is a terrible risk to a developing fetus  The next morning I reached out to the host to resolve the issue  We requested either to be moved to a comparable unit or be refunded the remainder of our stay  It took multiple messages for them to respond  and even once we were in the middle of the conversation  the average response time to a message took hours  The resolution that they offered was either to move us halfway across the city to a much cheaper unit or to request that my wife find somewhere else to work for a day while they used an ozone unit to temporarily reduce the smell  even getting to this point in the conversation took over    hours   Not wanting to endanger my wife our baby  we moved to a hotel and alerted the host so that we could be refunded the remainder of our stay  The host claimed to be considering the refund repeatedly over multiple days  but on the last night of our stay  requested that we cancel the reservation  After cancelling  they alerted us that they were denying our refund request because they couldn t confirm that we weren t in the unit because we hadn t hit the  cancel  button in the Airbnb app despite informing them that we had vacated partway through the stay  Taken together  it seems as though they were just delaying responding so that they wouldn t even have to offer the     refund in their cancellation policy  Also  the TV does not work and unsurprisingly  Zencity never responded to our message at the beginning of the week asking them to fix it   This experience was all around terrible  We will never be staying with Zencity again and we recommend that you do not either 
449984003682228480,Great unit looks just like the pics  The place was clean  easy to access and in the perfect location  I had an amazing experience until the last day  On the morning of the day we checked out the code to enter the until changed before our check out time  We were locked out of the unit for over an hour  Also be sure to call them if you extend your stay because the lock code will change and they will not send it to you  Thank you for hosting me  I enjoyed my extended stay  We had a issue with getting back into the unit at   am the morning we were supposed to check out that caused us to be very late checking out  You should not deactivate the locks until exactly check out time or people will be locked out  Thank you for letting me stay  I really enjoyed everything else 
516007764263449944,This place is awesome  Well located and you ll be more than entertained  Would highly recommend 
502865310401440451,Gorgeous views 
521040755527032522,The apartment was very clean and well outfitted  and its in an excellent location  If you have a car  though  be aware that parking nearby can get pretty expensive  The apartment  I was in  E  was great  but I think the radiator thermostat wasnt working properly   I had it turned all the way off  but it was emitting heat the entire time I was there  I opened the window and got the apartment to a comfortable temperature  but I thought you would like to know so that you can fix it for future guests 
496370555269065758,Really nice place for the value Nice place with everything one would need for a short visit 
515981039473738003,It was my  nd stay at this location  and it s a really nice location in the Lafayette Square area   See my other review for more details  It was my  nd stay in the building and if I am in town again I will come back 
572496292410553989,Overall location was good nice and clean great access service I had no complaints except that maybe change shower curtains bottom of it was a little dirty and maybe a parking pass for guest but overall I enjoyed my stay and I would recommend ppl to visit
572463225927727022,Place was clean and location was great  Seemed quite different from pictures though  It was a strange layout  dark and dreary  very little lighting and a second door that was unexpected  Place was super hot at first  contacted landlord who was very responsive  Little or no internet  Just an ok place to stay 
571774521648997447,Great location to stay  The parking isn t so bad  especially in the late evening  You will find a spot  The bathroom is in a really small space  but a reminder that it is a studio  If you re okay with that then it s a great spot for you  Lots of options around you for food and it was a plus that Whole Foods was across the street 
521003554697891979,Great location
534016705340049933,Very nice clean and safe environment Very nice clean and safe environment
515976006906164761,Just as described   Comes with a parking spot in garage   In downtown area    Thanks   Had a great stay    I would suggest a Keurig and a shelf or rack in shower for personal stuff 
525347827386515253,Great place for solace  Very quiet   nicely kept  fully stocked kitchen which is hard to come by  Timely communication   responses  Definitely recommend  Awesome stay  Only ask is to change sheets more often  I found different hair textures on pillows 
460859248064456001,Just like it said  Very easy check in  Clean  easy to access  Perfect for what we needed This stay was perfect  
507217746857274231,Great find  Highly recommended  Thanks again  The place was amazing  I look forward to booking with you again 
534012612773560313,Great cozy getaway in a convenient location  Perfect for some quick peace and serenity 
461531374036365818,The good  Apartment was exactly as described and the location is perfect   The not so good  The check in process doesn t work  I parked a block away and arrived at     pm  I was able to get into the building but was unable to use the elevator as it requires a badge  The check in instructions say that it ll be unlocked for    seconds from the time you get in from the front door  I did it multiple times all under    seconds  I was unable to reach anyone to let me in  Building security told me this is a common issue with this property and that the stairs are secured too and that I would need to contacted the host  I was unable to reach the host so called AirB B who was also unable to reach the host  I was getting the information to go stay at a hotel when another tenant took pity on me standing on a dark Kansas City street with two bags for an hour and badged me into the elevator  Arrived in the room at       If they fix the check in process this would be a   star review  You should strongly reevaluate your check in process as it s broken 
571772492049476493,Great place  the location was perfect  and made it very easy to get around Thank you  The place was very clean and comfortable  We had fun  found it very easy to get around 
571764804212918703,Excellent location for the hospital and park Perhaps tell guests that if the door code is not working then pull the door to make sure it is fully closed  and then it will work properly
474608848814954425,Very clean  looks just like photos  I loved the parking  area is so busy we expected parking to be impossible to find 
460871575790800809,Clean and easy check in   check out     Location can be a challenge because of construction and lack of dedicated parking  but is expected in this part of the city 
465217841322327777,The unit is exactly as shown  The unit was NOT clean properly  Slimy sticky residue in the bottom of shower tub  The carpets were very dirty and looked as if they hadn t been vacuumed in QUITE sometime  While packing to leave  my fianc  and I seen black mold that was on the wall surrounding the window and inside the window seal near the ceiling  that was attempted to be covered by tape and paint  There is an awful smell of trash mildew that permeates throughout the unit  source unknown   Be sure to bring your own toiletries and amenities if staying longer than one night  Only two towels  two hand clothes  and two wash clothes provided for a   day   night stay for two individuals  As well as one roll of toilet paper and one roll of paper towels  There is no public parking on the premises  but several parking meters down the block and     parking garages within     blocks of the unit  The unit does have a great location and is conveniently located near Barnes Jewish hospital  Whole Foods  several restaurants bars  and shops  Unfortunately  the apartment was not clean  There is black mold growing in the windows seals  Which was covered by tape and painted so that it wouldn t be noticed  Maybe look into a different  more thorough  clean service  and have a routine check done of the apartment unit from a representative of Zencity 
476029100009350919,Parking will be hard  the best advice is to use nearby parking garages  but will still be a little bit of a walk  other than that  the experience was seamless and lovely The only thing I would recommend is to have a better recommendation on parking  as it was very difficult to find and the apps we were told to use gave very poor options very far way from our Airbnb
476100044980838251,Great stay
516650006079050713,Very cool apartment  Location was great  pizza place was delicious  and overall very comfortable  A coffee machine inside the apartment would ve been nice  but there was a keurig in the lobby and we bought some k cups  Would definitely stay here again 
491354672285012829,Excellent value  location  vibe  anything you can think of     We were thoroughly impressed with this place and would totally stay here again  Highly recommend  They did a great job explaining the access and anything else you needed  Thank you   This Air BnB exceeded our expectations   The ONLY thing that we saw an issue was the shower pressure in both bathrooms was not good at all  It was very hard to shower with the water pressure  I didn t want to post that on the public review since in the grand scheme of things it wasn t that big of an issue   But we seriously thoroughly enjoyed this place  It was so fun and perfect for what we needed for a couple of days   
458644427129456422,an absolutely perfect stay and beautiful home  great host too everything was perfect except the fridge   it freezes everything
521076419271416003,Really nice and spacious place  Located in a walkable area with many amenities nearby  easy to find parking  Lovely place  thank you for having us 
502858256202666382,This is an excellent apartment   Great location   CTA bus stop and UChicago shuttle just out side   A coffee shop on the street of apartment building   About       min walk to U of C campus      min walk to Trader Joe s and Walgreens  Five minute walk to a small convenience store   So superb location   Apartment is very well furnished and kitchen has all the basic cooking utilities  utensils  pots  pens  cooking spoons   hot water kettle  pop up toaster   French press for coffee   cooking stove   microwave  fridge  dishwasher     A television with Netflix and other apps   It is well heated    Though it says that apartment is for three persons   it s a one bedroom apartment and the living room sofa is not a sofa bed   I felt the upholstery could have been cleaner   Bathroom has bathtub cum shower   The pressure in the shower could have been better    It does not have in apartment washer  dryer    I loved staying in this apartment   It was the most convenient place for me to spend time with my son at U of C   There is round the clock staff at the  reception   It s very safe as you need a code or a key to get into the building    I had a wonderful stay   Thank you   The apartment was great   Thank you    Few suggestions       The apartment is for three people   However   the sofa in the living room is not sofa bed so it s not possible for a third person to sleep on it         The upholstery on sofa could have been cleaner and neater   That s why I have not given all five stars         The drainage in the bathtub is very slow so it takes long for the water to drain out even during the shower         The water pressure in the shower is too less     I had an excellent experience over all   Would definitely consider this apartment for my future stays 
465202168729986690,It was a nice small space for a quick weekend trip  Super clean and comfortable 
572451857330439521,Terrible
470955135238899785,This studio apartment was great  While it was a little smaller than expected  it was great for two people who don t mind sharing a bed  especially considering we were out and about all weekend so it really was just a place to sleep  The instructions for everything were very clear and concise  We were able to find the free parking easily though there was a lot of street construction near by that took away street parking   It was super clean  staff was responsive  the area very modern  and it was very centrally located  Thanks  With all the construction going on the Main Street  a little more info about that before would have been nice  We were able to park in the green space lot but had been expecting street parking available too and were  Little overwhelmed  The pictures also made the room seem a little small  It was just me and my mom so not a big deal but felt a little misleading   The only real thing we d like to provide feedback for is the bed frame  The metal posts going down to the floor we kicked at least ten times each  They hurt very bad and we would just suggest maybe finding a way to cover them or pad them at least   Otherwise  we truly loved KC and this place was in such a great location for proximity to other things  Your staff was super responsive and helpful and the apartment was clean and neighbors were friendly 
461542236183154013,I have been to Chicago before but it was my partners first time so this location was perfect and walkable to a lot of the main tourist sites   Check in was easy and the elevators convenient and pretty fast  We didnt see a note about where the amenities were but ventured to the top floor and found them  We didnt get a chance to use it but it looked nice  The cleanliness was mixed  The floor felt like it needed to be swept or mopped but the counter tops were clean  There was laundry in the washer dryer and we couldnt discern if it was clean or not so we re ran it   We appreciated having a W D in unit as well as the availability of extra towels tp clean supplies if needed  As for the kitchen  I wouldnt expect to cook a full meal there  but why would you unless youre there for a longer term stay   but adequate to reheat leftovers over the stove or microwave    The bed was comfortable and the apt was spacious for two  The shower pressure was good but the temperature fluctuated a lot probably because it is a high rise   If you have issues with City noise while sleeping then this wouldnt be the spot for you as it can get pretty loud at certain hours  garbage pick up  night life  etc     Overall we were satisfied with our stay and thought it was worth it  but the space lacks the attention from somewho who actually owns the unit as some things seemed broken or slightly less operable  Check in was nice and easy   A few things  When we arrived there was laundry in the washer and we didnt know if it was clean or dirty so we re ran it and folded it so that the cleaners would know  Noticed there was a board to write the name of the clean person but it wasnt filled out  The kitchen could use a baking sheet for reheating purposes  The bathroom fan didnt seem to work  The windows dont close well since theres tape all around it 
571064804383798156,Very clean apartment in a great location pretty much everything is in walking distance  Thank you for hosting me and I plan to rent from you again if you could please leave me a review
524692838587386779,awesome host great time thanks for everything
476040269661953575,Very Nice And Quite Love The Apartments
521013411671580874,Overall a great value given the location  Parking wasn t a big deal  The space is cute and was clean  The bed was very comfortable  Check in was super easy  Hosts communicated quickly when I contacted them with a small issue  It s at the end of the hall so I didn t experience any hallway noise  Outside traffic noise was to be expected because city  The fan on the window unit provided white noise to cover it although it rained the first night and the rain on the metal of the unit was incredibly loud so I didn t sleep well  Hopefully it won t rain when you are there  Or maybe you re not a light sleeper and won t mind    A few tips  bring an eye pillow because it s bright in the morning  The only coffee maker is a French press which is fine if you have patience  The coffee provided was very good  The dryer is VERY LOUD  Bathroom is super tiny    All that said I d definitely stay there again  I live in St Louis and do a lot of staycations  This was a lovely little getaway  Thanks for a great stay  I couldn t find a battery for the smoke alarm but i left it on the counter  There are several other alarms with low battery chirps all over the building  I don t know how the residents deal with that     It wasn t a big deal in this case to take it down  I stood on a chair    FYI you re out of laundry detergent   It didn t affect me  but i used the last pod   Also I was mildly frustrated by not having an outlet on the side of the bed to charge my phone 
570990787774555487,I loved its building is very nice   Would definitely stay again   Check in was a bit difficult the fob is kinda inconvenient but the over all stay was great love the scenery and area
470972664654204932,Very clean    great communication  Thank you for the lovely stay   continuing to check on me while the music and tv was loud  Would love to stay again
572444200821566855,Great space  great location  great services   We loved it  and we plan to come back  The place was a dream come true   The MOST convenient location for the Chicago we visit   I did form the impression that there was free parking  but heck  maybe I needed the aerobic workout   We need to change the area rug in the common space  but all in all a very good  experience 
462332697967687673,we absolutely love staying at this location every room has a cool ambiance and they are always clean  Customer service is always kind and professional  Cant wait to come again  only problems we had was getting in we were not sent instructions to get in the building nor apt and sat outside for over an hour til it was addressed  However customer service helped
495610523866159095,Good location  Apartment was ok  Unfortunately the wifi did not work which caused me a lot of troubles as I was traveling from Europe  As you know  I was very disappointed by my stay since the wifi did not work 
537739326571516374,A nice room in downtown STL 
460852065044441184,  There are a few things that need to be addressed in the apartment   There is peeled paint laying on the floor in the front closet  and a section of the wall by the desk is peeling away  The front door screws are about to fall out and we were concerned for its integrity  The bathroom light over the sink has half the bulb out  On the positive  your customer service was excellent and the bed very comfortable    Just a bit lacking in the details  but priced appropriately for that 
462293454402892691,UNPROFESSIONAL UNORGANIZED AND DISRESPECTFUL  I DON T UNDERSTAND HOW A COMPANY CAN OPERATE LIKE THIS  SAT ON HOLD FOR OVER TWO HOURS AND THEY STILL HAVEN T MESSAGED BACK WHEN I REACHED OUT about the problems The floors  counter tops  and tables were ALL crumby  The company has   communication skills AT ALL  The check in process was   out of   stars because i didn t get correct check in info until   hours past the time i arrived  I was paying to extend the reservation after all these inconveniences and sat on hold AT     AM FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS  UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE TO EXTEND BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAD ENDED MY RESERVATION  BUT IM IN TOWN ON BUSINESS AND IT WAS TOO LATE NOTICe ti find anywhere else to go
539085815403598344,Nice place  Had all the basic needs  Free street parking  Safe  Good location  Will likely be back  thank you for the stay
505859534340392442,I really liked the place  it was clean and within walking distance to a few of the more popular St  Louis attraction  I really loved the place minus the weed smell coming out of the hallway
486957136437392772,Great space  It would be nice to have full access to the AC and more towels available 
507216290662420578,Clean but slow customer service
469579331168674174,This place was great exactly as advertised  We loved the character and it was clean  Beds are comfy  too  We would stay there again  Thank you so much  We love the character of the place  We had a great visit to Chicago 
534735195202176246,Zencity is a very impressive business  They provide a broad range of places to stay with lots of class while remaining personal and hospitable  I can t give them enough accolades  If you get a chance to stay in one of their properties  it s just smart to do  It ll be fun  clean  well organized  and very safe  I can t imagine they d allow anything else 
475301180459408045,Wifi didn t work at first  We couldn t control the thermostat ourselves which isn t great   the main bathroom needs a serious bathroom remodel  The shower curtains were too long and we were standing on them while we took a shower 
515969472187741157,Pay close attention to entry and check out instructions   If you do this and communicate using the airbnb platform  your stay will be trouble free and well worth it  The location was as good as I could hope for  I was able to walk to and from BJH  no problem  Bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of room and privacy   The only downside was street noise   All was clean  secure and a good value   Thanks  Zencity  for making this stay easy and affordable 
521009695217189812,Absolutely loved how well the hosts work with you  I got this place last second and they made sure everything was ready for checkin even though we arrived super late  Amazing communication   Thanks for a great stay  
570988676267824432,Incredible location and extremely nice  modern apartment space  Really appreciated the french press and coffee provided having showed up with none in supply  Short walk to pretty much everything you could want to see or do in the city  Great dedicated wifi connection  Only stayed for   days  but would have felt at home staying much longer and would gladly stay again 
528989766549855607,Decent stay The bed  towels   bathroom all could have been clean a lot more  There was long black hair everywhere  The towels had stains in them   the bathroom walls were dirty  The wifi also kept going out every   mins or so 
571880004990288241,Comfortable stay 
546387287789542831,Appartment was dirty   Other peoples hair all over the bed  floor  and linen   To top it all off  someone cut the catalytic converter off my truck   All around horrible stay   I will not stay with zencity again  what can I say     stays with your business     times I wish I would have gone elsewhere 
571736378954528061,With a bar restaurant located below the apartment  lots of noise and music during our Friday and Saturday night stay  Lots of noise from the bar restaurant at      pm just below the apartment  That is when we go to bed  Other than that a great place 
509420967064403251,I loved them as always   
570271906342910156,Poor communication  Poor communication 
521007199278492071,Great place to stay  Good location  Thank you  Space was great and in a great location 
570984470838269884,Great place  A bit loud in the morning  but a great value 
477552013302850278,Great 
509431402166460403,Great place   very clean Great place
570275205245139350,Overall  I give the building unit   stars  However  parking was a pain  Having just had surgery on my foot  this presented itself to be a bit of a problem  I always had to park several blocks away  the freezing cold weather made those really long blocks  Other than that  I enjoyed my stay  Overall  I give the building unit   stars  However  parking was a pain  Having just had surgery on my foot  this presented itself to be a bit of a problem  I always had to park several blocks away  the freezing cold weather made those really long blocks 
571749317329676225,Great place with easy check in process  Beautiful view and great security and safety in building  Only issue was with check out  You have to leave key fob in rental but can not access the elevator or parking without fob  After speaking with   people finally someone allowed me to leave fob at front desk  Otherwise stay was amazing and rental exceeded expectations 
461589226350311535,GREAT LOCATION  Easy check in  beautiful city  its downtown  you can walk if you want or take their trolley bus that is free and runs most of the day  Great food places too   Great spot and location  We really liked being able to walk and or take the trolley thing around  The only thing I wanted to mention was the bathroom floors are very slippery without a towel being down   my husband was getting out of the shower and slipped the first night   he is okay but couldve been worst  so maybe just a warning for others  Especially someone older  Otherwise great stay  
571762507829415147,Very nice place to stay  great location
571759723887364292,Very responsive host  Apartment is in a great location in Forest Park  walking distance to a lot of things to do  I appreciate the responsiveness when the initial door code wasn t working
534093891090946398,      would recommend 
508016107553133209,Great location  Nice place 
571755914971332816,Would highly recommend this place  Netflix was a nice addition  Finding parking was the only small hassle  Thanks for such an amazing stay
460863262729784837,It s an older building so it does not look super clean  The tv and WiFi didn t work  The neighborhood is really nice  It worked fine for a quick weekend trip if that s what you re looking for  The place wasn t super clean and the tv and WiFi didn t work well 
473145046544804396,Nice and cozy spot 
571067219676950426,The apartment is very nice and clean  It s in a very convenient location  There are many stores available to shop around  restaurants to eat and a little grocery store right around the corner   I thought it was a nice feature of the location as I was staying for more than a week  My experience was overall great  The hosts are great a communication  The only thing I would say that wasn t great was there is not really flexibility for check in and check out  Both my arrival and departure times were very far from check in and check out  so it was very hard to carry around for hours my luggages  But other than that   i would highly recommend  Thank you for the stay  It was an absolute pleasure 
483267344094615048,Good place  Great location  Huge apartment  A C is a little loud but all in all it s a great place  The only thing that went wrong was when the elevator went down  but that was only for about half a day  Also the air conditioning is very loud but I guess that isn t your fault  All in all great stay 
547126325921980470,Room was not accurate and very very dirty  Would not recommend  Wouldn t even respond after I sent pictures of dirty room upon checking in Horrible dirty room nothing was done about it
520987680297194731,Slawick was great  Top tier instructions and support  Thank you  Hope the sale goes smoothly tomorrow   
521068101649938333,This place was amazing and just as pictured  The private gated parking was a plus as well  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here 
543447809669834394,We loved the place we will be staying with them again for sure I loved the place will stay with you again if you ll have me thanks
460167037030997012,Not good communication    I accidentally left my Apple Watch at location and only reply I got back is go to a location with no other information  I tried to contact to get times and phone number to the address to verify my watch was there and no response 
481097140123777106,Amazing location   Our only issue was the stairs  my mother in law is older and has issues getting up and down   THe steps area VERY SMALL   Also I mentioned the water leaking into the apartment   Luckily did not affect our stay 
547153059807616703,Very clean and neat  had trouble finding parking spot certain days but overall nice place to stay with a lot of things to do in the area Beautiful hone very clean and neat  The only problem I had was the thermostat being locked but it was resolved soon after I reached out about the problem
521706263800926042,this place is ridiculous this company is ridiculous I will never choose one of their properties ever again they have horrible customer service they leave you on hold just to disconnect you their key fobs dont work so we have to wait for hours to get into your apartment even after I extend my stay because I had no other choice I had to wait outside the apartment   hours to get a new code  after spending three hours the first night trying to get a code because their key fob didnt work  all they wanted to do is give me an hour late check out which which they ended up locking me out of the building half an hour before that time was up so I couldnt even get my phone this place is ridiculous this company is ridiculous I will never choose one of their properties ever again they have horrible customer service they leave you on hold just to disconnect you their key fobs dont work so we have to wait for hours to get into your apartment even after I extend my stay because I had no other choice I had to wait outside the apartment   hours to get a new code  after spending three hours the first night trying to get a code because their key fob didnt work  all they wanted to do is give me an hour late check out which which they ended up locking me out of the building half an hour before that time was up so I couldnt even get my phone
460862221012751902,Amazing remodelled space with high ceilings  Super comfy beds  A pizza and beer spot downstairs made it really convenient  I d just double check you have all check in info a few hours before planning to check in  We didn t have ours until    minutes after check in and struggled to get through to anyone  The check in was so frustrating  Would ensure check in details are shared well in advance to avoid this situation for future guests 
547071512009528082,Filthy disgusting place wasn t clean at all   I found dirty used underwear on the bed   The place was cold it had air coming through the windows  When I say everything in the place was dirty down to bathroom to walls everything about the place was horrible The place was filthy disgusting it s was not clean at all   I found used underwear  When I say nothing was clean in the unit Down to covers on the bed
521759171800923153,Fantastic location  with the unit just as described  Made for a lovely stay 
497091580114902207,Nice  pretty location  You can hear the upstairs neighbors walking but it wasnt too bad  Downstairs is a loud restaurant open till     and across the street is a loud bar that doesnt close until    The kitchen had not really been clean  there were crumbs  chocolate chips  and leaves on the floor  Kitchen wasnt super clean either  The pictures do show the house in its entirety but the photographer made it look a bit more attractive in pictures  One room has no windows and another looks at a duct and wall  Still  this was the best value when we booked and overall I would recommend it if none of this is a deal breaker for you  the kitchen should be cleaner in the future  there was hair in the shower also  the towels were musty  otherwise thank you for having us  it was a nice place overall 
465879509426468687,Great place if you are looking to hang out in Boystown and enjoy the scene 
486940955971834301,I do not recommend  the place smelled rotten flesh and they gave me the runaround about getting it taken care of  when a guest tells you the place smells really badly you should definitely get it taken care of 
569634594376673839,Nice  clean and roomy place   On street parking found when we needed it   Restaurants  close by   Music from bar below heard at night   take a sound machine if outside noise is bothersome  Many positives to this apt   Biggest problem was no coffee pot after I specifically inquired about this prior to arrival   Very comfortable beds  nice towels and essentials in kitchen   Being able to see the fireplace instead of having the tv on the floor in front of it would have made the room  perfect    
502878955775319814,We loved staying here  We were in town for a tournament at the T Mobile Center   Its two blocks away  We parked the car in the garage and didnt need to use it the rest of the weekend  We walked or jumped on the street car to get around  Id stay in this apartment again  It is exactly as advertised                                        One thing to note  We asked them to update their parking instructions  We had a hard time figuring out the parking  which is included in the stay   Here are our instructions  in case they dont update the listing   Use the Apartment Key Fab to get into and out of the garage  The Blue Key Fab will open the garage door automatically  Park in any open numbered parking space  The reserved spaces have a  reserved  sign on them  Leave the UPASS Parking Card in a visible place on your dashboard  The Blue Key Fab also unlocks the stairwell for the garage  You can come and go as you please  Also    you should also note that the clearance in this garage is   FT Max   so no trucks or larger SUVs can fit  Hello   we loved staying here  It was super convenient and the apartment was exactly as advertised  One quick thing  Your PARKING instructions are not correct  We followed your instructions and would have ended up paying for parking without sheer luck  Here are the correct parking instructions    Use the Apartment Key Fab to get into and out of the garage  The Blue Key Fab will open the garage door  Park in any open numbered parking space  The reserved spaces have a  reserved  sign on them  Leave the UPASS Parking Card in a visible place on your dashboard  The Blue Key Fab also unlocks the stairwell for the garage  You can come and go as you please    If you had the instructions written like this  it would have been a lot clearer on what we needed to do 
570306335964091127,If you want to do Chicago without the hassle of staying downtown  and want an abundance of options right nearby for food drink transport this is a great choice  The place was exactly as shown in the photos  so it was pretty spartan  but comfy enough    I had no issues with lights or noise since the place has two sets of blinds in the bedrooms  Beds were plenty comfortable and it was a cool bonus they had a French press   The Brown Line is  right  there so youre seconds away from being on your way to pretty much anywhere in the city  The Belmont bus is also close and is a great option for getting to the lake hassle free  Thanks for a great stay  I used to live in the neighborhood and it was so much nicer to stay there than to have to deal with downtown   I think there might be a nailhead thats worked its way up in the bedroom off the living room  or maybe in the living room by that bedroom 
539892382772320055,it was a great place  finding the apartment was confusing though  and it seemed as though the place had been clean in a rush  still residues in places and seemed very halfway clean   granted i booked for the same day that i needed to check in so that could be why 
571738894394025777,The unit itself was fine  especially for the price  The thing my group didn t like was how the common area and hallways were dirty   reeked of smoke  At one point some people were openly smoking cigarettes in the lobby  Again the unit itself was okay   livable 
530943927827563907,Super gem tliche Ferienwohnung in Bestlage mit schnellem Internet  Wir haben unsere Zeit hier sehr genossen und lange Spazierg nge am Bodden und durch die Wiesen gemacht  erg nzt durch Ausfl ge auf den Dar   Unser Superhost Christian war jederzeit erreichbar und f r alle Fragen und W nsche offen  Bestimmt kommen wir wieder hierher  dieser Ort ist f r uns eine echte Entdeckung  Lieber Christian  danke noch einmal  dass wir Weihnachten und den Jahreswechsel in Eurem Haus verbringen durften  Wir haben uns sehr wohl gef hlt  Besonders toll war  dass es inzwischen Highspeed Internet gibt und wir damit auch Spotify Musik h ren konnten  Der Mobilfunkempfang h tte daf r wahrscheinlich nicht immer gereicht  Vielleicht w re es gut  wenn Ihr diese Information in das Profil aufnehmen w rdet  Gerne kommen wir wieder  Alls Gute f r      w nschen Euch Ulli  Klaus und Dalbo
483363627233999800,Seems hit or miss on cleanliness  my stay was definitely not clean   clumps of hair on the bathroom floor  old sandwich in the fridge  and no soap in the bathroom soap dispenser  Ive reported this in several different ways but no one has responded to my request to refund my clean fee   The unit is very nice  however  and the front desk staff was very kind  Please refund my clean fee   I paid more than the price to stay in clean but there was hair on the bathroom floor  an old sandwich in the fridge  and no soap in the bathroom soap dispenser 
520987573980430159,This place was the perfect size for my friends and I  We also loved the bars that are super close by 
465906013915290059,A solid place to stay on the south side  Parking and location left lots to be desired  but the value and overall experience were good  Thank you for having us 
570259499000773176,The place was as described  The view was amazing and host had great communication 
497066331355367918,This airbnb is worth the value  I loved the minimal modern design  and the view of the city was my favorite part  Overall my stay felt very comfortable and was a perfect location since I was looking to be near Barnes Jewish Hospital  Parking was probably the most inconvenient part   as free parking is not included   but the host communicated the surrounding options very clearly  I would recommend this stay for anyone looking to be in the area  Thank you so much for hosting me  I really enjoyed your beautiful place and its incredible view 
465880929129813598,I enjoyed my stay  Very nice air bnb Place was great
529724588528692594,As advertised and with prompt  courteous service and assistance  Thanks for everything  Dave
569551535653915072,Nice
465124225853245363,I originally booked a room                 in The Netherlands      Main Street Kansas City Mo       through ZenCity  I was forced to check out early on            Upon check in ZenCity failed to send my access code to the key retrieval box so they had to open the box remotely  Once receiving my key and attempting several times to enter my room I discovered the key did not work  I contacted ZenCity again and they assigned me       When I enter the room the room had not been clean since the last guests stay  I contacted ZenCity again and was relocated to       The room did not have the amenities promised  The washer and dryer was not hooked up and operational as well as the refrigerator and the wifi was non existent  After waiting for the key and each room assignment I was forced to wait   hours in between call backs  I did not enter the  rd room until     pm on my check in date due to ZenCity s lapse  I woke up the next morning           with a call from ZenCity stating that I had to leave the unit and they would find me another  I was forced to cut my trip short and cancel due to the unit and area that ZenCity chose to relocate me to  It was not in the area that I had time to research and read reviews about and I was a woman traveling alone   My staycation was a nightmare 
510895941714422368,The room was great  Didn t have no issue finding the apartment  It was cozy and most definitely in a great area 
503663226272408653,The apartment is nice  if a little dirty  but the listing is misleading  There is no washer dryer  smoke alarm  carbon monoxide detector  iron  or hair dryer in the unit  Additionally  the oven was non functional and the coffee maker was broken  I replaced it at personal cost  Zen did not respond to my suggestion of compensation    I would likely not have chosen to pay this amount to stay here had I known these things in advance   Zen addressed an issue with disruptive noise coming from the radiators in the unit and had the oven fixed  but in general communications were very slow  expect a canned auto response within    hr  but actual action being taken generally at the      h mark  This included when the access code to the front door of the building stopped working  Luckily I was able to sneak in behind other residents  as the issue was not addressed until late the following day 
496650623550623781,I was never able to check into the unit  The call box number to use to gain entry was not working it seems based on other online reviews of Zen City  that this is a common issue with their short term rentals    They are pretty good in communicating their pre check in instructions  but post check in they are very spotty with communication and don t seem to be able to resolve anything  they only message to ask if anyone was able to help  isn t the person I m messaging supposed to  know this    Furthermore  when you try to contact them by phone it goes straight to voicemail with a voicemail box that is full    Not sure how often this happens  but I know I m not the only one  Your instructions for entry do not work  because the call box number     Zen City  does not work and just returns a busy signal  This was an ongoing issue  Also  your pre check in communication and instructions is great  but your ability to resolve and communicate after the check in time is very spotty 
498551969637682558,If youre ok with a clean  sort of unfinished corporate feeling hotel suite youll like this place Good  Very clean  lots of space  good amenities  Not as good  bare walls  no decor  wires sticking out here and there  lots of broken blinds Im sure theyll fix soon
465877911319805709,Great place   Beautiful neighborhood   Would definitely stay here again House was great   Perfect locatiom for us 
465870410964729486,Great location  Within walking distance of tons of bars and restaurants  Pricing is pretty good for location  There is no dedicated parking so be aware of when and where you park to avoid fines and fees  I would recommend having curtains put in the kitchen to block out more light  Stay was nice  Pretty good value and a great location 
539179065489668061,We really enjoyed our stay here  Great location  we stayed in the winter so didnt take advantage as much but would be so nice for spring summer as it seemed very walkable   The place itself seemed clean and perfect for a couple taking a few days trip  The only thing that I wish we knew ahead of time  I didnt see it written in the original listing  is that the parking garage included with the stay is a short walk away  This was not a huge deal for us because it really is a short walk and nice that we did not have to worry about paying for parking  but since we stayed during the winter its something that would have been nice to know ahead of time and for others to plan accordingly  Overall  the space was great for us and the host was very helpful in quickly sending over all of the info we needed after booking  We enjoyed our stay and thank you for having us  Overall  everything was great  The only problem we had was with the bathroom sink  The water would barely come out at all anytime we used it  We just used the kitchen sink instead which wasnt a huge deal for us but might be good to get looked at for the next guests  Also  it might have been nice to mention in the listing that the parking garage is a short walk from the apartment  Again  this isnt something that was a huge deal for us but it was very cold during our stay and just would have been nice to know up front 
479675113927741509,Great place  Had to book last minute but worked out well in the end Great place  Comfortable stay  
460149608672120421,Rented one location   Got there  keypad didnt work and no property manager on site to let us in   Moved us to a  comparable  location across town   Gave us the wrong keycode to get in   Finally was able to access location which in no way  shape  or form was comparable to what we booked originally and included a backed up tub   Communication was very slow   took    hours for them to address the tub issue by text   In fairness  they were kind enough to return the difference in price between the two facilities  but I will not use this company again  When you cant get your customer in the place they booked  it would be nice if you  put them in a comparable location   Additionally  it may be wise to have a property manager in the city you are booking rooms in 
542007425924179444,This was a great rental   Everything matched the AirBnb description   Although at a major intersection  this room was quiet for my five day visit   The check in process was a little convoluted especially since you have to park across from the rear of the building on   th street   If you have multiple bags  take the lightest one when you first check in as you will need your hands to keep reading the instructions sent to the AirBnb app  Hi   This was a great place   However  I suggest having a sign or markings on the parking lot to indicate where to safely park for your rentals   And an extra blanket in the room would be nice   And on the check in instructions  it said to go LEFT after entering the building   I actually had to go RIGHT to find room       But this was a great rental 
568193062231383508,Place is super fancy with great views and walking distance between lots of shops and restaurants  Free parking along the street was never a problem  There were a few things that could be improved  The check in was a little confusing on the instructions for the getting into the place  My boyfriend and I arrived about  PM and were able to figure it out pretty quickly but still messaged the host and didnt get a response until the next day  Also  before booking I inquired about the wifi connection due to seeing other reviews that is wasnt working well and received a response wifi was good  I tried to attempt to do schoolwork during my stay and couldnt due to the wifi being spotty at best but rarely working  If you dont care about the wifi and dont mind some wonky locks Id stay here  Everything else was very beautiful and clean  Thanks for letting my boyfriend and I stay at the place  It was beautiful  Only thing I would say is to look into the wifi connection  It was barely spotty and barely worked  As someone who I inquired about the wifi before booking because I had to do schoolwork I was disappointed in the lack of connection 
568811427041154957,The condo needs a lot of repairs and clean  The pictures seem to have a filter  everything is much older and not as nice The condo needs a lot of repairs and clean The entrance was so dirty with dirty cloths and old plastic bottles on the stairs  The windows needs to be sealed   really cold wind coming through  The bath as tapes on the tiles and the ceiling needs repair The living room window is ripped  One of rooms has a terrible mattress on an assemble bed  The furnace noise is too too loud  The pictures seem to have a filter over  Everything is much older and not as nice  I can send you the pictures if you like
462323475553706230,Great location  Easy check in and check out  The location is close to restaurants and public transportation  Will stay again  Thank you so much 
518082168238434070,Nice home   great communication   everything was comfortable 
510907630476306495,This place is great and very modern   The view out the window at night is very calming   The kitchen is also nice and convenient
528999031941998991,The place was very clean   nice 
571007877545873592,Also  No coffee pot Wi Fi was not listed   when a message was sent  the same instructions were sent  Then requested pictures  Didn t seem to be a person paying attention   Leaving instructions are WRONG  We got trapped because of that 
516713037760795641,Location was perfect  We made it to and from the Chiefs game with ease  We were within    minutes of anywhere we needed to go in KC  Awesome weekend get away  Everything was awesome  thank you for the stay

534792007603115364,Lots of inconveniences out of owners control but unfortunately made our experience pretty rough  Thankful for the good communication though 
570355082176403911,The best place to live  There is nothing live this  I throughly enjoyed staying with Zencity and wanted to stay more  Best place to live but your people don t respond timely to guests  And don t cooperate at all 
570305909924971135,its worth the money hard to find a place to park hard carrying stuff upstairs it was clean
480446668827655590,The toilet is not in great working order and the shower had a plastic bag over the faucet   water smelled bad until it ran for a little bit  All surrounding street parking is permit only which would have been helpful to know ahead of time  The toilet is not in great working order and the shower had a plastic bag over the faucet   water smelled bad until it ran for a little bit  All surrounding street parking is permit only which would have been helpful to know ahead of time 
504309945137503253,I stayed in this unit for a few months during the Fall of       Had an awesome stay  View of the lake in particular was a highlight  I stayed in this unit for a few months during the Fall of       Had an awesome stay  View of the lake in particular was a highlight 
567412730606448986,I am never staying with Zencity again they promote    hr check in so when I arrive after a snowstorm at  am they tell me I can t check in so I m forced to get a hotel but while on my way their I had a representative tell me I d be okay to check in even gave me the door code but the code didn t work on arrival the TV didn t work either so for the     days no TV and its also been broken into before back door is all busted up and you can see damage as if forcible entry was used I did not like the people running this I think companies taking over this app is the worst thing that has happened on here I am not staying with y all again don t promote    hr check in and then have one employee tell me I can check in then can t and need a hotel y all are so whack
547172480756954489,For the price that we paid  this Airbnb was probably what we shouldve expected  For each good thing  theres something bad to go along with it    The reserved parking in a covered garage was fantastic  but its a    minute walk away and you have to take the stairs since the elevator is broken  One of the exit gates also broke on the second day of our stay    The unit looked clean  but we also found a cockroach on the first night  Luckily we didnt see anymore after that though    The water is hot  but only during the day  Past   pm  there simply is no hot water  Plan your showers accordingly   They have everything you need to make a decent cup of coffee  but theres no hair dryer or shaving razors    The unit is convenient and you can easily access all the major attractions within    minutes drive  on top of the    minutes walk to the car  or so  but you also get to be constantly sketched out by your immediate surroundings    Theres supposedly a gym with this listing  but we never found it      Heaters work well  especially for dead of winter  as long as you can deal with the loud rattling and lack of actual temperature control    TV has Netflix but the couch is visibly covered in questionable stains    If something comes up  the host picks up phone calls quickly  but you still need to call multiple times because for the first two calls youll hear someone clicking away on a computer but not actually say a word to you  Thank you guys for the stay  There were definitely a number of hiccups but I hope you guys are able to improve the experience    Consider having disposable shaving razors and a hair dryer available    The parking was nice but itd be also nice to know that its a little bit of a walk away before booking and receiving the instructions day of    While I wasnt able to get a picture of the cockroach and we luckily didnt see more after the first day  its still concerning seeing one at all 
567405018528788234,Cute little place  though wish it had some darker nightshades   This is right by the train and didn t bother me nearly as much as the light did  Great little spot to stay that had everything I needed   The only cons and demotion to   stars was due to some broken things in the apartment     closet door was broken which made the closet hard to operate   Additionally the blinds were a nightmare to deal with as they were also broken   Cute little deck  but the patio door needs an outdoor latch to keep it shut whilst out on the deck
568184390046866442,I would not recommend this place  The place was in disrepair and dirty  Maintenance was required so the shower would work  They stopped by while I was out of the unit  the host did not communicate well and proceeded to injure themselves while doing the repair  They tracked their blood all over unit including on the towels  They gave me the false impression that they would award my requested refund amount  equivalent to      and instead then changed the offer to a paltry amount equivalent to a night s clean fee    Do yourself a favor  stay somewhere else  If I could award zero stars I would   I arrived to a dirty  run down apartment with broken cabinets  dirty counters  and dirty towels  However I wanted to give the host the benefit of the doubt  so I told them they didn t need to come clean  just be aware   Then I noticed the shower wouldn t drain  I communicated to them that this had to be addressed ASAP  They told me that as it was the weekend  it would take two days to repair the shower  I replied that this was unacceptable and that they would need to resolve the issue that day  They then stopped replying to me    I left the unit for several hours  When I returned I noticed they had fixed the shower and injured themselves in the process  I knew because their blood was tracked all over the floor and the towels set out for my use    I then contacted the host again and demanded a discount based on my experience  They gave me the false impression that the refund amount I requested  approx      had been approved  For this reason I did not bother to follow up w AirBnB   Once I returned home from the trip I followed up with the host to inquire when my refund would be awarded  Only then was I told the host was considering IF my experience warranted a refund  Angry  I contacted AirBnB to be told because I had not contacted them sooner  it was outside their control  Even though I refrained from contacting AirBnB as the host had lied to me  implying initially the refund would be issued   The host now claims I am due a paltry refund of less than one night s clean fee  I highly doubt I will ever see even that pitiful sum  When I called AirBnB today  an agent informed me that someone else will have to call me back regarding processing the refund 
521741697318276809,Booked because I was visiting a friend that lives in the apartment building within in this complex  It was very convenient  Close proximity to everything downtown  Hi   I am trying to reach out via DM and it looks like it went to review    Can you please check the space for a small white jewelry box  I can t believe I left it behind    I appreciate you looking 
568192198103002074,This is a very nice apartment with ample space and a great view  A few blocks from everything downtown  easily walkable to a supermarket  the convention center  and lots of restaurants  I would stay here again  Thanks for a nice stay  I enjoyed the property and would stay again  The kitchen could use a few more essentials like Tupperware and maybe a few seasonings to cook with   I left some ziploc bags and dryer sheets  Water pressure was not great in one of the bathrooms  but I didn t use it often 
568117672261668508,Geweldige locatie  De studio heeft alle voorzieningen  Aanrader  De instructies voor waar de studio was klopte niet helemaal  De liften en gang rook elke dag naar rook of wiet  De studio zelf daarin tegen was heerlijk  Genoten van het appartement
567674227363724397,Access codes did not work and ended up canceling while trying to get inside the building around Midnight on the day of my stay  Codes didnt work and I had to cancel 
567442174885634138,Clean and quiet  Will stay again I loved staying 
567456657036541123,Yes location can t be beat  Beds are comfortable  Check in was a nightmare as the keys to the unit were not in the box   Fortunately for me  another Zencity renter was experiencing the same problem  and already had Zencity on the phone   Their first response was to argue with her  and me  about the empty boxes   Told us he had a picture from the clean team that the keys were in the box  and wanted a picture from us to prove that the box was empty   Long story  but after    minutes of standing in the cold     degrees outstanding  and open  garage  I found the master keys to all Zencity units in another lock box   The unit keys were hanging in the unit   First thing we noticed upon opening the door was the   smell   it reeked of cigarettes   I reported the smell  they offered to do an ozone clean  but never did     night stay     I emailed before I came asking what type of coffee maker there was   exact quote    All Zencity units have a coffee pot and a french press in the unit   There was only a French press  which for   people is time consuming  and to top it off  the microwave did not work   Could not even heat up your cold French press coffee   Kind of a major problem   The microwave issue was noted in a review last November and still not fixed   Our last day  they brought a second French press   Not helpful   One bathroom had a shower issue and the sink was permanently plugged  didn t drain   Also seemed to be noted in past reviews    As noted by another reviewer  Zencity answers their emails promptly  but they do not solve problems   I would be very careful renting from them  You are very quick with your responses  but you I fine the questions were never answered completely  let alone problems in the unit actually fixed 
567402672400543398,Great location  comfy furniture and plenty of amenities  Excellent stay 
547067825347737312,If I was still in the  single and childless  stage of my life  I would want to live in an apartment like this  The building was not great  but it is just what you would expect in an old city  It reminded me of a New York apartment  Its right across the street from Whole Foods  so that was convenient  The apartment has been renovated nicely  My only complaint is the bed  The frame is creaky and the mattress is like that of a pull out couch  Hello  The apartment was great  except for the bed  That KILLED my back  I lost about   hours of productivity the after sleeping on it  The tub would benefit from some anti slip stickers or a mat  Also  since its an old building and theres no water filter  a gallon of water in the fridge would be a nice addition 
567370198496976938,More than I was expecting  Two bedrooms  couch  TV  kitchen  bathroom  Close to METRA  Whole Foods  and a lot of restaurants  Walking distance to UChicago  Multiple layers of security to get into the apartment  Gym and laundry room in the lobby  I enjoyed staying here very much  The only problem I had was using the security system  One time we were trying to enter the building and the phone told us the system was being updated  We ended up having to wait for someone to walk out in order to get in the building  Not a big deal because it was in the morning  but if it were late at night that would not have been good 
468814476178970626,Place was really nice and comfortable  Very clean  Parking is street parking  unfortunately  Was very worrisome  Thank you for the stay  It might be good to invest in parking places  If you have a lot of people staying downtown  there will be a lot of issues with parking  We were worried about being towed or ticketed a lot 
531924022203362227,Cleanliness of the room itself was okay  Ran into issues with zencity not communicating and beating around the bush when I told them the room was missing blinds making it hard to sleep  Kept saying theyd bring it to the attention of their team and schedule a time to come out  Never did  and only on the last night did they say it wasnt gonna happen  leaky shower head shot water on electronics the first night  Towels they layed out for us were also damp and smelled old  good thing they had spares  Decent parking around holidays  decent location  Gun shots from the neighbors  as expected   its St  louis  security was nice  but disappointing still Cleanliness of the room itself was okay  Ran into issues with zencity not communicating and beating around the bush when I told them the room was missing blinds making it hard to sleep  Kept saying theyd bring it to the attention of their team and schedule a time to come out  Never did  and only on the last night did they say it wasnt gonna happen  leaky shower head shot water on electronics the first night  Towels they layed out for us were also damp and smelled old  good thing they had spares 
516691756761956674,My stay at Zencitys apartment was very homey and relaxing  The view over Forest Park was also a plus as well  I will definitely be staying here again the next time I come back to my home town  I appreciate you guys making my stay a good one 
488429821167871010,Great location  Communication was great and they were very accommodating  Spacious and clean  Taking an Uber to the bars was cheap and easy as well  I would stay here again    It was difficult to find a parking spot on the street  A lot of the street parking was permit only  I recommend spending the    dollars on the nearby parking ramp attached to the hospital 
488371149176648505,I appreciated this clean  and inviting apartment  I found the check in and out process easy and well described  The high speed internet was very helpful Thanks  This was a nice place  I generally really enjoyed my stay  I was particularly impressed with the check in and check out process and how easy that was  I also appreciated the reliable and high speed internet  Definitely a high quality for the value of the location 
570291849778526904,Un lugar muy c lido respecto a sus recepcionistas  muy buenas amenidades dentro del condominio y muy linda la vista al forest park Muy c modo el lugar  buenas amenidades dentro del condominio y sobre todo muy amables los recepcionistas 
494978320857923964,Easy to use space  would recommend Thanks for hosting me 
460093297241147653,Great location for lake front access and visiting the University of Chicago  The bed was comfy and the kitchen had all the things we needed   Would stay again  Thanks  Thank you  The place served our purpose well and we felt comfortable and safe  My only suggestion is that I think the place could use a coat of paint and the curtains washed   The walls and  Curtains in the hall and living area felt a little dingy  Again
521051888282976524,This place was amazing  Great location  clean  modern  comfortable and quiet  We will use this place again  The place was perfect for us  We walked to most of our events  even Wrigley  The only issue we would point out is an annoying constant drip noise but we didnt know origin  I did take a video if youd like to see hear it  Otherwise  we loved it 
547147261167205547,Great place to stay  The building security phone number would be a great addition to the check in information  When we arrived the doors to the lobby were all locked and the security officer could see us but wouldn t come to the door to talk  We eventually found a phone number for the building on Google and called  Once we did that everything was easy and smooth and the security person was very helpful 
472436706948559776,I couldnt even get into the building of the place I was supposed to be staying and for over   hours I tried to get in finally having to leave because I was cold and tired  zencity was no help at all  at one point they actually told me just to try to find security or wait for someone to come out of the building to let me in which I did and was not let in by security or whoever was in the building that I asked so I finally left and had to go and pay for another place for my two day stay and now its in City wont even let me know anything about giving me a refund I would not recommend staying here  I dont understand how its been   days and nobody has even contacted me to let me know if or when Im  even getting my refund 
497806763278352689,The view is amazing and the building has great amenities including a cafe and dry clean  Thanks for the accommodations  Had a great time and loved the view  I will be back soon and hope to stay at your place again  I can be reached at              or btucker kronyakspirits com
480408318092439330,Great location and I loved the pretty view above the trees  Easy to follow directions and just as pictures  The first night was fabulous and quiet  Though  it is next to a hospital and the second night there was a lot of ambulance sirens  Hard to say if this kinda busy night is super common or not since I didn t hear any the first night  Wish there was a fan in the apartment but other than that  absolutely everything was great and comfortable  Great place  I would stay here again but it would have been extra nice if there were a stand up fan or something extra to plug in for airflow during the night instead of just turning the AC down low  Temp was fine but moving air would have made the bedroom more comfortable at night 
497858141443056590,Clean and as it appears to be  Great location  Thanks again 
521051695065650445,My friends and I really enjoyed the Airbnb and it s location  Really close to just about everything you need  bars  quick bites  sit down restaurants  etc    The beds were super cozy and even though on the weekend you can hear some people outside since it s on a busy street  it s not terrible and we were all able to get a good nights rest  We would definitely come back again and recommend this place  Also  host was great at communicating quickly  Super easy check in and free street parking around the corner  Thanks again for hosting us  Really enjoyed our stay and the Airbnb 
463706196318280840,Great value Great appartmwnt with a good view  The pillows were bad and the couch was nasty  Also the one table was very small  Overall amazing experience

518147754546821724,Had a great stay    Very clean great location
569637954643398549,Great place  very clean  Stayed one night on a short notice and had great communication  I can t wait to stay again  A great stay  A beautiful view from our room  The area was a little worrisome since we had fire trucks and cops outside our door for a short time  Other than that it was a great clean area so close to where we planned to visit  Thanks again to a great stay  We hope to come back again 
526767658732430742,Dont pass this place up  They are by far the best Airbnb in the city   Ive never been disappointed with Zencity   This is the only place I would recommend in the city 
521764888779808682,Great place to stay if you re working at BJC  Super close to the hospital  great places to eat  amazing view of Forest Park and more 
497782578697756544,Thanks Great spot
470255006035883197,FIRST OFF  UNIT IS REALLY NICE    Pros  Beautiful Views  Great Building  and Amenities    Cons  Lack of communication from ZenCity  money was stolen from unit  company accused me of smoking in unit and trying charge a      fee    We enjoyed the stay overall for our honeymoon  but with the poor communication it makes me rate this airbnb lower  After a week  still no communication from Zencity about the smoking charge and stolen money  Someone access the unit and stated they were maintenance and money was stolen  Just ruined the amazing experience  Thank you  I am still frustrated about the lack of communication regarding the unit being accessed with out any communication  and money stolen  Lack of communication and timely response to my concerns and a trump up allegations regarding smoking in the unit  Really unprofessional at the end of the day  Over all great unit and building 
488366080254543378,Excellent location
566705567546221076,GREAT LOCATION  We booked here to tour DePaul which was just a five minute walk  Its close to everything and very walkable  The apartment was just as advertised  Very cozy and comfortable  We did have an issue operating the lock box during check in so be sure to get detailed instructions before arriving  The very cozy bed in the front bedroom is large for the room and my daughter needed to scooch it to be able to close the bedroom door  We were there on the weekend and it did get very loud at night with the music from the nearby bars  Im not an architecture expert but I found the details in the apartment to be really intriguing  After poking around google a bit I think the building is done in an Italian style which you can see in the really nice trim in the apartment  The lock box on the door was VERY difficult to operate especially at night with cold fingers  A picture of the box and some instructions on how to operate it would be great 
465873118853613150,This was the worst experience I have ever had while traveling  The Zencity canceled my reservation right at check in time   They did not have the curtesy to call me and let me know the reservation was canceled  They did it via that app  When I call the owner  I was give no other option   I will never stay at a Zencity apartment and I would be very worried if you select them the next time you travel 
463756356067131717,Everything was wonderful  the unit was clean and comfortable  Location was great and the host was very helpful and easy to reach  Would love to stay there again  Cant beat the price  Thank you so much for your hospitality 
567349553513941627,Loved this place  Great location  close to the plaza  I stayed here with my sister   we felt very safe  There is a really neat rooftop and game area as well  Very clean  We had some issues finding parking but we managed on side roads  I will definitely be back to this Airbnb  Loved this place  Great location  close to the plaza  I stayed here with my sister   we felt very safe  There is a really neat rooftop and game area as well  Very clean  We had some issues finding parking but we managed on side roads  I will definitely be back to this Airbnb 
477505526471455305,Great place very clean
464410885535114138,Beautiful a place but check in was a little tricky Thanks for letting us stay  It was very nice but very difficult to get into the building the first time  the instructions you gave did not open the door or let us up the elevator
746889404,Everything was awesome  we really enjoyed our sray  Thank you   Being that this was a last minute trip  everything was amazing  I really enjoyed my stay 
746825350,View was great  Space was nice  The code phase to get into the lobby didnt work  Fees were higher than i had expected 
746092731,Place was same price as the nice surrounding hotels  Walls and floor were dirty  Code to get in did not work  Area didn t feel the safest  There were wrappers on the floor  cigarette buds on the balcony  The floor was sticky the walls were dirty  Location is central but not in the greatest part of the city
748533852,This host is a total scam  After paying for the room  no check in information was given and we were unable to access the property  After our flight landed at      pm we had to take another Uber from the property and pay for a hotel 
521745943374132588,Great location  Clean   easy communication with the host 
746851246,Shower floor had brown stains in the floor and there were streaks of some liquid running down the walls   Whoever Picked out the sink did a poor job because the water barely pours out over the edge and gets all over the countertop when you wash your hands  Photos make the bedroom appear much larger than it is   The bed was super wobbly and just basically a cheap bed frame   We had issues locating the keypad   You have to tap on it to get the numbers to light up   Also  the smoke detectors were beeping for about an hour after we got there   Took forever to get someone to respond and get maintenance down there to replace batteries   You also have to contact them if you want the thermostat changed as well   Things that should be in the directions just aren t communicated well  Photos make the bedroom appear much larger than it is   The bed was super wobbly and just basically a cheap bed frame  We had issues locating the keypad   You have to tap on it to get the numbers to light up   Also  the smoke detectors were beeping for about an hour after we got there   Took forever to get someone to respond and get maintenance down there to replace batteries  Shower floor had brown stains in the floor and there were streaks of some liquid running down the walls   Whoever Picked out the sink did a poor job because the water barely pours out over the edge and gets all over the countertop when you wash your hands  Needs to be a quicker way to get ahold of someone when issues arise 
746664019,Great place to stay
748672856,Great location  nice building  however had minor cleanliness issues in the actual unit The freezer in our unit was broken  and therefore dripping water on the floor  and making lots of noise until we turned the ice machine off  We found multiple hairs that werent ours as well as a dirty mug in the bathroom  making us question if the unit had been properly clean 
747988517,Great place to stay 
747920612,Great location and nice rustic apartment in a great neighborhood  Perfect for   or   people  I had two issues  wifi didn t work  and apartment was missing a french press  When I texted a host  my issues were never resolved and they didn t get back to me about wifi  Not a big deal   but might want to be mindful of this 
747898897,Efficient with great communication  Thank you got the stay and for efficient booking  Cleaning crew missed a few things ie  hair  and the last persons  pleasure items  
748250584,My family and I enjoyed staying at this unit  Spacious  clean  and friendly  We will be back  My family and I enjoyed staying at this unit  Spacious  clean  and friendly  We will be back  The only minor issue was that theres no iron  well be bringing ours next time   the apartment could get pretty cold regardless if we crank up the heat  and theres really no one we can communicate with if we have a minor concern 
480352280424923702,We were unable to access the Airbnb upon arrival as the passcode to the room was not working  We messaged the host but received no response  and when we called the number provided on their page it went straight to a voicemail  which was full   We waited at the building for a while and then left and tried to figure out alternate arrangements  About an hour and a half later  around      pm  the host finally responded and suggested that we try the passcode again  We trekked back to the Airbnb and the code again didn t work  We talked over the phone and they gave us a new passcode  and were finally able to access the room    Mistakes happen  but it was very frustrating that we were unable to reach the host for so long when we encountered issues  and a stressful experience  We nearly ended up purchasing a hotel room because we were concerned we wouldn t be able to reach the host    The Airbnb was decent fairly bare  no hair dryer or iron  for example  but with a bed  bathroom  and minimalist kitchen  Clean  Pretty good location  However  our checkin experience was very poor and we were disappointed  Proceed with caution We were unable to access the Airbnb upon arrival as the passcode to the room was not working  We messaged the host but received no response  and when we called the number provided on their page it went straight to a voicemail  which was full   We waited at the building for a while and then left and tried to figure out alternate arrangements  About an hour and a half later  around      pm  the host finally responded and suggested that we try the passcode again  We trekked back to the Airbnb and the code again didn t work  We talked over the phone and they gave us a new passcode  and were finally able to access the room    Mistakes happen  but it was very frustrating that we were unable to reach the host for so long when we encountered issues  and a stressful experience  We nearly ended up purchasing a hotel room because we were concerned we wouldn t be able to reach the host    The Airbnb was decent fairly bare  no hair dryer or iron  for example  but with a bed  bathroom  and minimalist kitchen  Clean  Pretty good location  However  our checkin experience was very poor and we were disappointed 
748240976,Clean  great location  quick response and great space  Super stylish and modern  This place was spot on big space great service great location  Super clean and comfortable
752690939,Cozy spot in a great location if you want to enjoy the city  Pictures are accurate  The dark paint gets a little heavy in the space and the windows only have to modes  to be completely exposed or to be shut in using the curtain  I wish there was an in between so i could enjoy the views more  Also this particular building in strict on no smoking  Wasnt told this until we received information on checking in  I would have chosen a more relaxed place if that was the case  so if you indulge  this may not work for you   But otherwise it was a nice stay Please put on the actual listing that its a strictly no smoking building  It was very misleading being provided that information in the same welcome check in instructions  As well as it was past the point for me to cancel  had that been a big issue for my trip The door code we were given wasnt the right code  Had to message host to get correct code  but they answered in a timely manner
747940619,This is a wonderful location and excellent value  Everything was as it was described  Thanks for a great stay 
517343756079839463,be aware of your seroudings it was nice place to stay I would do it again
746653766,This is my all time favorite air b b experience  Seriously I have so many good things to rave about  The host was very good at responding to any questions I had  the check in staff was so incredibly friendly and helpful too  and the place itself was AMAZING  The location was wonderful  My boyfriend and I were able to walk to the store and back to the room   cook dinner  in a clean and stocked kitchen  enjoy some Netflix  and enjoy the beautiful view from the rooftop before climbing into the world s most comfortable bed  Everything was so clean and comfortable  I d recommend this stay time and time again  just know you ll never want to leave    This was by far my best airb b experience  I cannot thank you enough for letting us add your lovely place into our roadtrip 
746814359,The place was absolutely wonderful  I stayed here for almost a week until my new apartment was ready  I loved everything about it  The only reason I gave it one less star is because I needed to stay one extra day and they had someone booked in my room so in order for me to stay one more night I would either have had to purchase two nights or pay     for a different apartment    minutes away  So i just left and found a hotel  Which isn t entirely their fault but it was just a grievance on my end  But other than that everything about this place is wonderful  clean  great view of the city  I would stay here again  Just next time I will be sure of how many days I need 
746866114,Fair   Had trouble getting in It was difficult to first get into the building the code provided didn t work  I had to stay on heard forever and get code that did work  Then got in the elevator it still wouldn t take us to our floor so we had to walk two flights of stairs  Get up to the room and discover the ppl before us lost the key for the doors and elevator so each time we had to take the stairs and wait for others to let us in  Then on top of tht the kitchen lights didn t work   Some one was supposed to come look at it but never did  And the desk on the side of the bed had a cigarette burn on it  Then the second day the toilet stopped flushing  
477491832495424452,It was a great stay  Communication was great  Great location 
748699207,Great location
747380623,Wonderful location  Helpful   front desk  Parking is EXPENSIVE   Kitchen area smelled of sewer  Came from dishwasher 
747143374,Great value  Studio suit was on the top floor by itself  Also had roof top access where there was patio furniture games and a lot of space to hang out  No lockbox number
746100341,Great location  easy to access  quiet environment Took    min for me to get in my room because the key was wrong
746821283,Check in experience was horrific    Was stuck outside and could not get a hold of someone for almost an hour     Code to get in building was incorrect    Took several attempts to finally get a hold of a customer service agent     Will not use in the future 
748325098,The place is nice but the door doesnt lock  Feels very unsafe 
744634895,Cute little apartment  If you dont want to hear noise throughout the night and sirens though  then do not stay here  The place is cute though and its nice bc there is a restaurant on the first floor  Parking is minimal
465907123141025850,Exactly as advertised  great place
521805790064813806,The parking was nice and the staff was kind  Unfortunately  there was a mix up as we were told on our arrival that someone else already checked in using my name  Once we proved my identity with kind cooperation from the front desk and Zencity staff  we still were concerned that there was another set of keys that was not accounted for  keys absent prior to us reaching this destination  Our initial checkin experience made for an uncomfortable stay  Other than that and the lack of shampoo which was listed as an amenity  the stay was fine  Staff was kind  location convenient  place was clean  Thank you for the stay and for having    hour support  We needed the support because when my son and his girlfriend arrived in Chicago at   am after his girlfriend worked a full day before their drive in from Arkansas  he was told that a  Debora Robertson  had steady checked in at  pm  had the key and was occupying the room  I m Debora and was in Little Rock AR as I had been explaining in the messages in the Airbnb app for weeks  This trip was a Christmas gift for my son  Francis at Zencity helped get the room  but my som was treated as suspect until we cleared that up and then he and his girlfriend wondered if someone else might enter the room the entire time they stayed since the front desk staff said they had given the extra key to  Debora Robertson  already  It made for an uncomfortable stay  There also was no shampoo tot conditioner  I was worried for them until they checked out since there was an extra key handed to someone else  We still don t know how someone else could have checked in as me  This initial checkin experience made the stay uncomfortable and we will probably use a hotel at our next stay in Chicago    They did say the front deal rep was kind and searched the room with them when they entered to make sure no strangers were lurking    The parking was convenient and free and close  They view of downtown was nice  And the place was clean    Thank you 
748485761,   
465940851718260093,Nice place 
748285524,Nice place to stay  Loved the area 
747914510,Great space   stylish and modern yet still uber comfortable   The location was awesome   within walking distance of a bunch of really cool stuff    Parking could be a bit tricky if we got back later at night  Overall loved it and will book again when in the area 
746394515,Cozy place to stay  
746391190,The room itself is cute  but check in was a nightmare  We had no instructions for getting in and had to wait   hours to check in because the host wouldn t respond to messages or calls  Then when they did  the instructions to get through the door didn t work and they still wouldn t respond  We only got in because someone was leaving and held the door  Also weren t told about the confusing way to lock the apartment so we left the room unlocked on accident and had to figure it out ourselves  The space was nice  but the customer service was non existent 
746599356,Y all can expect confusion disappointed and shitty service Y all was the worst host I every had stuff didn t work Y all Should focus on taking care of y all Custmer and stop False Advertisement I book Some thing Else and this what I get a place that didn t look like the pic They didn t have the key  nor  the fobs and they make me go To A different room That I didn t want  and it was hard to Find  the room The host was bad at communicating didn t never communicate took them For every to respond and had a shitty attitude The parking was horrible and expensive
494223561367802310,A wonderful stay in the comfort of Madison Park    Perfect time of year to see the chlorophyll break down on the leaves  The yellow to orange colors become more visible and give the leaves part of their fall splendor    The apartment was a perfect match for the environment    Jordan Thank you 
748683323,Nice clean place right in the middle of downtown KC  Would def recommend and stay again 
748016727,Great space for two  it was clean and stylish  Highly recommended  Had a good time in your space  Thank you for the hospitality again 
746660300,I always enjoy my stay here  Any issues I have ever had they fix immediately  For the money you cant find a better place  The TV internet connection was not working so we ended up having to use my laptop to watch shows  If that was fixed the stay would have been   stars  I will be staying with you again though
748734118,Great spot Great spot
746395741,The place was dirty and reeked like cigarettes  It s carpeted and it was as if someone had been smoking in there for years  I complained to zen city and they told me to crack a window and spray febreze  I don t think I ve ever written a bad review in my life  
748728165,Great place
748940121,Room wasn t ready   hours after check in  Constant smell of cigarette smoke  No key set  very difficult checking in 
748671199,Very clean and nice downtown view  Check in was quick and easy when you follow instructions  Had a great time  Thank you very much  We enjoyed your place  Very clean and nice downtown view 
569636472581587551,Customer service is the worst  Once I pay an extra night they did not generate a new code for me  so once I went to eat  they kicked me out from the Aparment and then I had to be outside for   hours while it was snowing waiting for a new access code   There is not a phone number and if you chat they take   hour to answer back  It is not a good idea to stay here  Customer service is the worst  Once I pay an extra night they did not generate a new code for me  so once I went to eat  they kicked me out from the Aparment and then I had to be outside for   hours while it was snowing waiting for a new access code 
465943766196941137,Place was not clean AT ALL    an inch of dirt on the floor  pizza sauce over the coffee table  lip stick over pillow cases in one room    even found a bag of weed in the tv stand drawer  Would not recommend Zencity Airbnb to anyone  Place was obviously not clean from pervious tenants    an inch of dirt on floors  pizza sauce all over coffee table  lipstick all over pillows cases in one room  even found a bag of weed in the tv stand drawer 
569594768547260681,It is a great location and a very cozy apartment  I know that there was a couple of issues the first night but I enjoyed my stay 
747469992,Great location to explore Forest Park and had a great view of the city  However  we did have some of the amenities listed such as soap and key fob to access roof top lounge area 
748727103,great
748346701,I highly recommend this clean  inviting and cute apartment for a quick getaway   Easily accessible and  if you like to walk  a short distance to great restaurants  cafes and some great night life  The entire building was clean  the apartment was really cute  clean and inviting   Having this nice little spot to relax in  made my trip to be just the perfect relaxing getaway I needed 
747163817,it was okay except for the check in part  i appreciate yall  I was waiting for    min downstairs for the lock codes to get into the building  The code they gave me didnt work thank God somebody let me in otherwise it would have been a bit longer wait time  other than that its great Id book wth them again
497821837868639771,I would def stay here again  Looks better in person  spacious  I would def stay here again  Only thing was the WiFi didn t work  and the door wouldn t lock when I would leave 
748944821,Very nice place  great location in Downtown St  Louis  Parking not included Was a great location  wish parking was included at      night
749150539,This is a nice and affordable Airbnb in a central location  The check process is superb 
748532308,Would definitely stay again 
748485201,We used as an alternative to local hotels  and really only used for sleeping   Dont expect a home type site where theres a fridge full of things folks have left behind  and a drawer of spices  Have to say  the two beds were fantastic   Not too soft   Just right   Expect some sound on Saturday night on the plaza   The other nights pretty quiet   Clean for sure   Great spacious bathrooms and showers  etc   The easy check out was a huge plus  as we had to scram early the last day   Glad we stayed there  Worked perfectly for our needs   We werent there much   The beds were awesome   Not too soft  not too hard   Thanks for the easy check out  as we needed to leave early 
748895933,it was the best very spacious and we loved staying here 
748700369,Beautiful design  with a lot of light  I loved my time spent in this loft  The host was extremely welcoming and responsive  Thanks for looking out for the sunglasses  I found them eventually 
748505461,Awesome and great home  Perfect location quiet and super clean  So much space just loved it there 
464495800686948908,The accommodations were quite nice   The location is in a neighborhood undergoing a rejuvenation and Ruby Jeans Kitchen and Juicery across the street was very tasty spot for breakfast  The unit is in a former Wonder Bread factory that is now a combination of apartments and businesses   Overall  the unit was clean  bed was comfortable  and kitchen was adequately stocked to prep a meal if you choose   A french press is there for coffee  Everything was quite nice   I was fortunate that a resident was entering the building as I first arrived as the directions regarding entry were not working   Once in  the accommodations were quite nice   Oh  the shower in the middle bathroom was pretty awful   No pressure whatsoever     I ended up using the front shower 
547112211660061483,I really wanted to like this place  It s a cute small efficiency style room  Good for a single person or couple  It could have been cleaner  The bed was very uncomfortable  The room was temperature controlled so I was cold every night    night stay   Parking can be challenging as well  But the location was not far from downtown so that s a plus 
565915394624470929,I have never stayed at Ukaranian village before so it was a nice new experience  Loved the location of this place  Lots of Great places to dine  Loved that it also had   bedrooms and washer   dryer Thank you for letting us stay at your home  Thanks for fixing smoke detector from sharp beeping noise  Wish I had notified you sooner regarding it
564562046291584875,I have been using Airbnb for a few years but this place was just amazing  Great location beautiful studio and amazing view   stars period  This is my new place that I m going to stay from now on when I m in Chicago  Thank you Zencity for amazing experience 
748482978,Very cute and nice apartment  So clean and spacious  It s so close to everything too just a    min drive to wherever we wanted to go  Definitely recommend  Very cute and clean apartment  It s also so close to everything which is a plus
748273103,Incredible airbnb  It s in a perfect location and is absolutely stunning        would recommend  Loved the airbnb and would definitely stay again 
748002413,Good value
564528121772075454,Great stay on all fronts Outstanding apartment near U Chicago  Perfect 
565175490909060973,They have very clean rooms and furnished with nice modern trends  I would recommend a thorough check on missing kitchen supplies  This last unit or apartment reservation had so many missing  supplies   I requested maintenance to repair or replace smart lock batteries  door remained untouched but unlocked and open  I would like to make a nice suggestion for future guests    if guest could become a loyal rewards customer and give an incentive or reward for each stay and redeem towards free or discounted rates if they get their reviews completed to help in future feedback so Zen City can make necessary changes or improvement 
747890075,its a really great spot if you want to be within  walking distance of   different  tourist spots  just beware it can be harder to find lyft and ubers in that area for a that reason it seemed bigger but still really good sent the wrong code to me so I had to call the hotline its harder to find a lyft from that location just because it is so close to the lights district
749446079,Great spacious place   TV and sofa could use an upgrade   but it is still a good area and place to stay  love the big space  TV and furniture could be upgraded but other than that loved the stay 
747472994,Cool place  great location  Clean and tidy  What you see is what you get  in a good way   Would stay again for sure 
485419576535328497,The place is great  Small but just enough room for   people  They provide Netflix as well which is nice  Parking isn t provided but I got parking on walnut the street behind the apartment very easy everyday  The only negative thing that happened was my key code would not work so it was a       minutes process to get help  Beside that time  they got back to me in a good amount of time  The restaurant downstairs was delicious and super convenient  Overall it s a great place in a great area  would definitely stay again  
565947941812436448,Great amazing place     Love the location  Loved the view it was more then what I was expecting   I thought the checking in process was going to be a bit difficult but if u follow the directions step by step it will be a breeze   I most definitely will be back at
748719410,Very clean  Good location  Sometimes host did not answer messages  Poor communication
747916835,Perfect location to have garage parking and take the town by foot  eating and shopping plus more are all within walking distance  Well worth the booking  Perfect Airbnb  only thing is that there was an ironing board but no iron  Other than that I have no complaints 
747118990,great place thank you
748912038,Beautiful place 
746836892,Great space  Check in was great and location is close to lots of things  I highly recommend  Thank you for a wonderful stay  The Nest Thermostat had an error code  But other than that  was great  Would def stay again 
746803467,Great place to stay Thank you so much   Everything was amazing
746605563,My stay here was great  The location is walking distance to the lake  grocery stores  take out locations  Divy bikes are located right outside the building   Its an easy   min uber to the city   There is street parking but can be difficult to find and you may walk a few blocks  I would suggest dropping off any luggage inside if possible and then looking for parking so youre not hauling any luggage around  Watch out for street clean days  I had to move my car before  am on one of the days  The actual apartment is clean and had all the essentials I needed  Perfect for     people  I appreciate your hospitality  Thank you for the stay 
569569795872041553,Huge place  comfy beds  incredible value  Really a lot of bang for the buck  Huge place  comfy beds  incredible value  Really a lot of bang for the buck 
476107450956616750,Great location   Parking was a challenge  The bathroom drain was plugged when we arrived   We pulled out a long  orange plastic strip and then it did drain   There was a cooking odor that persisted until we aired the place out for a day  We would have liked a mattress pad on the bed under the sheet   Was the mattress actually a box spring   Perhaps wash the bathroom rug   We found one German cockroach  FYI 
748889803,Neighbors were not quiet and could not sleep  There was feces in the hallway  There was no TV remote  I was briefly locked out one night when my code stopped working  Perfect location however  Neighbors were not quiet and could not sleep  There was feces in the hallway  There was no TV remote 
748883416,Close to everything  In the middle of the city it still offers peace and quiet  The rooftop was amazing 
747172463,Hostdidnt provide check in instructions prior to arrival and was extremely difficult to get any response from  Location was excelent but the room was not worth the price  Cleaner and less expensive Air B B acomodations are available nearby  Hotels are available with better ammenities for the same price nearby as well  This is the first Air B B I wont stay at again and wouldnt recommend to others  Host messaged they would have more details about check in before I arrived   They did not Never recieved check in instructions arriving  upon arrival I messaged the host multiple times with no response   I then called several times and was disconnected several times and placed on hold endlessly twice   At that point messaged the host I would report the charge as a scam if i didnt receive a reply  I then recieved an immediate reply which told me theyd been ignoring me  During all this a storm was moving in and i was stuck out in it  Hair and remnants of soap bars in the tub  Crud on the shower curtain rod   Peking paint in the bathroom  Host was nearly impossible to contact  I had to go to extremes to get check in information from the host Service and quality of the room were substandard  for the price
470935224822003475,Great location  very spacious apartment  Complex had an extremely nice gym and easy checkin  Host was very responsive to messages to ensure our stay was smooth  Only major issue was the microwave didn t seem to work  which I let the host know about and they offered to take care of it  Great location  nice apartment  Largest issues were damages to the apt and the non functioning microwave 
569538091304304774,Perfect location  Comfortable bed with good heating  Was a good value  The clean fee a little high  Would definitely use again for other trips to downtown  Was perfect for location   Bed was comfortable  Didn t use the shower or kitchen  Price would have been perfect but the clean fee was twice the cost of the room  We were there for one night 
748291741,Very clean and nice  Great location too Thank you very much for having us it was a amazing get away
747134867,Good location right off the park  Hi Ava   When we stay at Parc Frontenac we are able to use the bike storage room    At Montclair we weren t allowed to use the bike room  and were told repeatedly about the bike rack outside by the parking lot   We chained the bike to that bike rack  but our bike was stolen  along with the lock and bike light off the helmet  They left behind the helmet     Please notify the staff to encourage people to store bikes in their apartment  or enable them to use the bike storage room    Also  sadly the coffee press broke       Thanks  Carole Flegel             
747127350,Very amazing set up
747066354,Not much to offer  but it works  Definitely smells like smoke  The fees were more than the stay  A shelf in the shower would be nice  Cooking was difficult as there wasn t even oil  Easy to follow directions but there was a lot of steps The clean board said it hasn t been clean since        Someone knocked on our door to repair something at   am  without warning  and was entering the apartment on their own  Tons of fees so it wasn t as inexpensive as it seems  Not as nice as it seems in photos  definitely 
750035515,Very cool spot  comfy bed  and clean
516721315729788394,Place was cute and very clean  Our code didn t work to get out room key but the team was very responsive and got us situated quickly  The stay was nice though the apartments are not at all sound proof  You can easily hear people in the hall and their music  Overall nice stay  Thanks for quick responses
749963733,It was a nice space  Just make sure you bring your body wash as that s not available  We receive a noise alert and we were sleep 
749489666,Nice place  Great location  Thank you so much for your help 
749173319,The tv didn t work  the bathroom door doesn t latch closed     sliding barn door style  so it just rolled open and stayed open    parking for Airbnb is off property    across the street    Check in wasn t fluid  had issues with the code provided for the Key Fob    added a few minutes for having to call in and get someone to override a key box    no one on property to help with anything     If there is a problem  you re going to get a message in an email that says basically  sorry for the inconvenience   It is a clean little place and the location is pretty much near everything  TV didn t work  Bathroom door design is bad for anything other than a single person staying   Check in wasn t fluid  key cafe didn t accept code provided  had to call in    Location was good and it was a clean little place 
488358570406594920,Good stay at this beautiful Airbnb  Only dislike was the uncomfortable couch and unavailable parking  The key is jagged and tough to unlock door  Very responsive
749921041,Was exactly as advertised
749488097,Great location  Apartment is old and was slightly dusty upon arrival  however it was quiet and was close to Barnes and great restaurants in CWE 
748261370,I highly recommend staying in this apartment with Zencity   It s location is fantastic and the place is just as described in the listing   Would stay here again in a heartbeat 
748264116,Amazing space and introduction to Kansas City as a first time visitor  The host company is super diligent and the building has awesome amenities  The space was impeccably clean and thoughtfully  stylishly decorated        experience and would recommend to anyone visiting  The WiFi was a bit slow and the password that is written on the chalkboard was incorrect  but luckily the host had included the password in the welcome email  Check in process had many steps but the instructions from the host were super clear so as long as you re careful to look over things beforehand you ll be set  Might be difficult for people who don t have immediate access to the app or older folks to navigate but all in all had no trouble personally  Amazing space and introduction to Kansas City as a first time visitor  The host company is super diligent and the building has awesome amenities  The space was impeccably clean and thoughtfully  stylishly decorated        experience and would recommend to anyone visiting  The WiFi was a bit slow and the password that is written on the chalkboard was incorrect  but luckily the host had included the password in the welcome email  Check in process had many steps but the instructions from the host were super clear so as long as you re careful to look over things beforehand you ll be set  Might be difficult for people who don t have immediate access to the app or older folks to navigate but all in all had no trouble personally  Some details I think might have been left out like not being able to drive into the garage  The door almost closed on our car but all in all very clear instructions 
569534759973030099,Very Nice place   
568815809203607472,Great location  A bit noisy at night 
750120324,great place for the price 
747814309,Loved staying here  Look forward to staying again and definitely will recommend  Loved the colors and the shower The passcode to get into the building      was incorrect  I tried it numerous of times  I even tried contacting someone for assistance and couldn t get anybody to answer  One of the people who stayed there let me in and said that I m not the first person who has had this issue with getting into the building  The code to get into The apartment took a long time  And also was hard had to try it numerous of times before the door was unlocked  Other than that I enjoyed how nice the building was set up I love the colors in the bathroom  We appreciate the opportunity to say  Look forward to another time and one of the rentals
750357280,Overpriced  But  good location 
749213035,Renter none responsive  Extremely annoying access requirements  Does not have the basic kitchen or bathroom appliances for an Airbnb extended stay rental  To get inside the building there was one way to input the entrance code of   digits then to access the elevator there was another way you had to enter the  digit code and finally to enter the actual apartment there was yet another code with   digits  Not user friendly at all  Refrigerator was not clean well and had dirty areas with crumbs  I sent a message the day I arrived advising there was no hairdryer in the bathroom and never received a response   Come to find out they did not have the basic necessities for an extended stay such as a toaster  a blender  very limited cooking utensils and pans   Headboard in the bed is not secured therefore every time you made any movement the headboard would hit against the wall and make a lot of noise  Not impressed whatsoever 
750112844,Good place
564535354649453360,i had a great experience  this place was very cozy and easy to access  honestly  the place was equipped with everything i needed  thank you 
748119216,I m five months pregnant and this place was advertised as smoke free  Definitely not true and the entire complex filled with smoke  People down the hall were smoking weed as well  My husband and my eyes were bloodshot and we had to leave not even twenty minutes after we checked in  DO NOT stay here if you prefer a smoke free environment  ALSO they have cameras IN the apartment  Make sure you read the fine print  You know what happened
747975519,Nice place  and clean  Hello the stay was nice however there was the occasional smell of smoke from other tenants 
746878807,Muy buena estadia  Recomendado al mil Muchas gracias  Volveremo pronto
750823664,Great location  nice and cozy  Check in process was seamless  The apartment supers were very kind  Kitchen and bathroom had everything you d need for a work from home accommodation  Thank you  Location and check in process were perfect 
748490252,very nice apartment and clean  the living room area and front bedroom are a bit loud at night   you can hear the cars driving and people outside very well  a few repairs needed but otherwise its a nice stay  I always enjoy all stays with zencity thermostat not working  broken soap bottle in bathroom broken loose windows
749216663,Great location to the plaza  The place was great and the location was easy and very close     My only complaint is it did not seem clean   The shower floor was not clean and the toilet was not clean under the lid   Shower floor had hair on it   The kitchen cabinets had finger prints around the handles   Doesn t mean it wasn t clean just indicates that it might not have    Other than this we have no complaints with the place 
750589136,Very convenient make sure you get your parking validated Cool place
750584200,Good enough for what it is   nice to have a gym on site 
748899372,Great stay   I booked this apartment for    days for my husband and I while I was spending most of my time in the hospital for surgery at Barnes   The first few days I had several appointments at Childrens and Barnes so the location couldnt be better   We never even rented a car   There were some wonderful restaurants just a short way down the road and a grocery store   My husband was able to utilize the very nice gym and laundry services   The apartment itself looks exactly as pictured   The bed was very comfortable   I did return in a wheelchair and was able to fit into the elevator but a little tight in the bathroom   Check in was probably the only negative as we arrived late at night and there was a problem with getting our keys  which was resolved with some help from the front desk   I may have to return for follow up appointments and will gladly book with Zencity again   Thank you for everything  Thank you so much   Your booking was perfect for what we needed while undergoing a very stressful surgery at Barnes   Appreciate everything 
748672171,The place itself was nice  a great value    But  some issues   I couldn t get my keys from their box  so check in took about    minutes longer than it should have  late night after a long day of travel     I couldn t control the mode on the thermostat  Mode is controlled by the building  and for some reason it was set to cool throughout my trip  even though the outside temperature was in the    s   There was almost no silverware  and dishes were a little dirty   Nice restaurant in the building advertised in the listing was closed throughout my visit   Host was responsive   courteous enough  but ultimately not that empathetic to or effective at solving my issues 
564516040467653665,Great place slept good bed was comfortable apartment was clean the only thing is a small used bar of soap was left in the shower other than that everything else was perfect Very comfortable and clean the only thing was there was a small used bar soap left in the shower
750999974,Place is great I loved it
750356185,Well located and extremely responsive to questions 
749883864,Overall a good place to stay  Next to a lot of restaurants and parks and easy access to the highway  A little noisy in the evenings  and though it had been clean just fine  the apartment could use a little tlc  just a bit scuffed up  could have new shower liner drip pans  things like that   I did have to call the host to get the code to check in  but they responded quickly  A couple little issues but for the price I still think its a good value 
750327728,This place is beautiful  in a treat location  has amazing views  and is super chic  We had a great time and communication was super easy and straightforward  Definitely would highly recommend to anyone looking stay in downtown KC 
463723394498244888,This unit is located within walking distance of several restaurants  parks and the train station  The neighborhood is pet friendly and the apartment looked just like the pictures posted  We booked this stay last minute due to a family medical emergency  The host responded promptly and even reset the door code when we deactivated it in error  The proximity to Barnes Jewish Hospital  places to eat and the train station were was a plus  Unit was clean and comfortable 
750966765,Good communication I was told I d get a discount due to me walking into a unit and it being completely trashed and nobody had been in there to clean  I was moved which was even more of a inconvenience after the key not being in the designated area and being put on hold for about a hour 
748328277,We really enjoyed our stay here  The apartment was really clean and there were really nice amenities  Thank you so much for hosting us  we really enjoyed our stay  The apartment was really clean and there were really nice amenities 
748046610,So for starters  the location is perfect in downtown Chicago  Close to everything  You can walk everywhere  There s even a grocery store within the building  Building is clean and in a beautiful  safe area  The unit is decorated nicely  the view is absolutely top notch  The beds were very comfortable  And as mentioned in other reviews  use SpotHero app to get parking right in the building    The downside however with our experience was the toilet stopped working the very next morning when we woke up  The AC didn t work to begin with  With the ac  not even keeping the large window open cooled the place down  It seemed impervious to any cool weather  They said someone would come to look at it but no one ever came during our stay    For the toilet  someone from maintenance finally came and after about twenty minutes they said they fixed it  The next time we went to use the restroom it just stopped working all over again  After reporting again  they said someone would come look at it again  No one did  So for the last two days of our stay  the toilet did not work at all  It was really disappointing  And this was just normal use  nothing besides tissue has been disposed of in the toilet  So that made things hard    I don t know how directly connected ZenCity is with the maintenance team at this address  so I m hesitant to put all blame on ZenCity  For all I know  they did their part in reporting the issues to the building maintenance and it was the building maintenance team that dropped the ball  I don t know  I m not sure  So I don t want to take away too much from my rating  However  it really inconvenienced us during our stay    Overall  beautiful place  even more beautiful view  But the toilet and ac issue made things difficult  So  if you stay with them  I hope you won t have the luck we had  Your location and place was absolutely stunning  I just wish someone would have come to look at the ac when we were told they would  It got super hot in the unit  And the toilet was never fixed and we could not use the toilet the last two days we were there  It made things difficult    The toilet worked the first night we were there and the ac did not work at all  Reported both  They came out to try to fix the toilet once and after saying they fixed it  it went back to clogging immediately after  And no one came to look at the ac at all 
747879844,This is a wonderful location   The apartment is clean with a nice kitchen   If you like to watch television or need good wifi there are issues that were never resolved while I was staying   I was there two weeks  But it is a super location and very clean apartment   Deb Crawford This is a lovely location   I already sent a list of suggestions which would help the next guest   I would stay again if they can deal with the internet and television issues  The internet service is unacceptable   And the TV internet provider didnt work   It was impossible to watch TV Had problems when I locked myself out of the building   There was no extra key  The lack of television service and especially wifi   People use internet wifi      of the time anymore   The connectivity was awful   And they were supplying me with all kinds of ip addresses   I tried but could not connect   Also  thats a little unethical in my opinion and unsafe 
750109084,Overall it was a good stay at a good price in a good location   Not a  wow  experience but clean and very comfortable     Beds were great  but low to the ground  which may not suit some   Several great restaurants  like the Rooster   Bacon  Lettuce   Taco close by   The downstairs restaurant was good too   Walking distance to City Museum  Union Station  the Arch  Citygarden and other points of interest   Drug store and grocery nearby   The apartment  while clean and comfortable does need some sprucing up  fresh paint  a few pieces of furniture replacement  clean in the  corners        This property is overseen by a property management  company  so does not have the personal touch and attention that some others have    Communication with property management was hit and miss   We were not sent info about checkin until after check in time   We had to contact them to receive it and it took about    minutes to get hold of someone   We were still on the road  so this wasn t as big a hassle as it might have been   What was a hassle was getting into the apartment upon arrival  The keypad code did not work   Fortunately the property management rep picked up right away when I called and was very attentive with problem solving the issue   It did take about    minutes to get into the apartment though   Pro Tip  Ask for the igloohome connection in advance because the keypad is a BIG hassle   Make sure everyone in your party has the igloohome app and apartment connection because entry was not consistent on any one device  The apartment is due for a little sprucing up  Figure out a better solution for getting into the apartment   Waiting so long to get a work around for the key panel that did not work was a terrible way to start our stay    I do appreciate the representative s attention though   Patching   painting walls  Painting molding Patch and paint front door  The apartment was relatively clean  but the corners were not clean  Cleaning deck  Replacing deck chairs  Replace record player needle  Several light bulbs need to be replaced  The outer hallway that leads to the apartment door needs to be clean 
750333471,First things first  the location is amazing   However  we had a pretty rough time checking in and it ended up making us late to our dinner reservation  Then  we realized that the entry fob  that you need to get into the building and use the elevator  was missing  so we had to do some sort of modified way to get in every time we returned from somewhere  and we never received a replacement during our stay  Overall the place was nice  but there were a few things missing that we asked for that were not addressed  no spoons    no hot plate to go along with the kettle  hand soap in the bathroom was essentially water  etc    Like I said  the place was nice  but I wished the customer service was a little better when things werent exactly desirable  Hi  thank you for letting us stay  I reached out previously to try to address some of the reasons for the negative review  but heard back from no one after multiple days  Overall we were mildly satisfied with our trip  but there were quite a few issues that we had that werent exactly taken care of 
749939137,Absolutely prime location and beautiful space that really emphasizes the Chicago feel   Highly recommend  So many positives about this space  Some coffee and tea bags would have been a nice added touch  I think the space could have used a little vacuuming 
484043746317194221,Great communication and customer service  Great location and building  Great communication and customer service  I love the location 
516640817798806646,  Check in was terrible everything else was good
488399731968070329,small but clean and accurate description  furnace is loud  i never touched the fire alarm smoke detector  if it was tampered with it was like that upon my arrival  i never even seen it or i would have fixed it or at least try to fix it 
750108539,Super clean and a great location   Also the view from both the room and the rooftop is       Thank you so much   We had a lovely stay 
747364406,The shower was broken and they never came to fix it  I had to make a hotel reservation to shower and getting in touch with the host was difficult  The shower was never fixed and I still had to book a hotel to take a shower 
748678984,You can expect many delays with their customer service and the intercom system not working  If you dont want a headache I would chose a different building of theirs  I am sharing with you the message I sent to AIRBNB  I tried to resolve with you the issues that i expierenced during my stay on multiple conversations with your customer service and I am incredibly disappointed in your response  We have stayed with you many times and I would of hoped that you would do more to keep our business  But since you did not I had no choice but to reach out to AIRBNB and  the message I sent is below                                                                     I am contacting you about the above stay with Zencity from April  th to the   th  When I arrived they said there would be a fob to easily gain access into the building  There was no said fob and i had to use the code provided to enter the building every single time  using an intercom system  On saturday  one day after our stay  i messaged zencity twice about the fob and did not recieve a response  There were zero issues with the intercom system so i just went about my stay  On Monday the   th I tried to gain access into the building around      pm that night and I could not  I immediatly called Zencity and was on hold for a total of    minutes between two phone calls  All while im waiting in the foyer of this apartment building because i had to have a fob or key to even get into the lobby  For the next     HOURS i was stuck in the foyer speaking with zencity     mins into being in the foyer a woman came that was also staying with zencity and she was stuck with me  at the end of     HOURS there was a total of   of us that were staying with zencity that could not gain access into the apartments that they rented  While i was on the phone with the woman from customer service we tried everything  different codes  she tried calling management and they would not come  they said that they do not have a master fob in one of the lock boxes of this foyer bc they were getting new ones  I had no water  food  and no charger  my phone ended up on     so the customer service lady took down Kats  one of the other people stuck in the foyer with me  phone number so that she could call us back and she never called us back  At this time two more people joined us and they called zencity and basically the only solution was to BEG a resident to let us in and use there fob in the elevator  When i got back in my room zencity said that they could not fix the problem until at least   am in the morning     i got into my room a few minutes after   pm      so they said i had two choices        I could not leave the apartment until   am bc i would have zero access into the apartment due to the intercom system or    I could go get a hotel or a different AIRBNB  The guy on the phone said he could give me a refund of          and i basically told him that wasnt good enough because it was not going to make me whole  I had to take a     uber to my hotel that cost      for the remaining two nights of my stay  When we tried to get the refund the next morning through the message they sent it said it was expired and i could not collect  I called zencity and basically they pulled back the refund and she said that her manager would call me the following day  We are now at Thursday and no call from the manager and no partial refund  I called them again on friday and nothing  This morning i called them and he said he had to get managers approval but would be sending a refund today  We recieved a refund of      this afternoon  It wasnt even the      they first sent us   We paid zencity      for the stay and only recieved       I asked today to speak with a supervisor  i have never spoke with one as of yet even though the supervisor was suppose to call me the other day   I understand that things happen but i expected them to make us whole since it was their issue that the intercom system didnt work and it was the apartment buildings issue  I am also highly disappointed in their customer service  I would like you to please review our stay and let me know if there is anything you can do with zencity to get a more comparable refund  They did not provide us with a fob as stated and we could not get into the building for half of our stay and had to relocate and had to relocate to a hotel Customer service did not find a solution to there problem about their system not working with the intercom system  Also I was told a supervisore would call me back and never did and I was told a specific amount of a refund and i only got the partial amount that they said they would give 
750825332,Great place to stay  Couch is filthy
750815685,It was a very warm n welcoming
750772006,greT place great place
750596616,Beautiful apartment in the Central West End of St  Louis near everything  There was a convenient parking garage around the corner as well  I m now considering moving to STL after the stay  It was a beautiful place in a really nice location in the Central West End of St  Louis  There was a convenient parking garage right around the corner and you are a quick drive or uber from everything in St  Louis 
748677390,Great place  Clean  convenient location and check in  Would definitely stay again 
465935661694181824,Pros   Location  in the heart of CWE  close to Whole Foods  restaurants  bars  and metro    Comfy bed   Good shower pressure with hot water  Cons   Incorrect check in information  never received the correct code to get into the building and had to sneak in with other residents    Terrible communication  when asking for the correct door code  Zencity requested a video to be sent to an email outside of AirBnB    Unclean  cockroaches in the bathroom  food residue in the kitchen  dank mildew smell throughout the apartment coming from the washer   We made it work  but I would not stay here again  The information provided for check in was incorrect and the communication to resolve the issue was unhelpful  To have to send a video to an email outside of AirBnB in order to get the code to get into the building is inefficient and inappropriate  I NEVER RECEIVED THE PROPER CODE  I had to sneak in with other residents of the building every time   Thankfully the apartment door code worked  The wifi network was incorrect as well  There was not network listed as just  Zencity  Lastly the condition of cleanliness was not good  There was food residue in the kitchen and we discovered cockroaches in the bathroom  A big one was on the sink  Additionally the entire apartment smelled like mildew because of the washer  Something in there needs to be clean out or replaced  I get that you own many properties but management of individual units should be better 
750791250,The whole place is fine  Hosts are slow to respond for the most part  what do you expect from a big company running air bnb housing though   The space was nice  but our keypad instructions were inaccurate and you can expect up to    minutes for a response  Thanks Host very slow to respond Steep drop in price just after I booked
750372794,Great place to stay in STLs Central West End  Check in check out was seamless and the apartment was very nice 
749494329,Such a great location  Within walking distance to public transportation and easy Uber Lyft pick up spot  Highly recommend  Thank you for everything  Definitely will be back soon   
750347486,Great place to stay Thank you    I really enjoyed my stay  I love the location and how everything is in walking distance 
465969887169699503,To start off with the pros the location is close to lakeshore restaurants and stores  Getting in the rental was easy             The cons we finally made it through the two front doors and once we got to the Airbnb the room was completely dirty  Bed wasn t made garbage in the kitchen  tub had a bunch of dirty towels sitting in it  Ants were on the floor and I had to sweep to keep them away and it is a basement studio  Called zen and they said someone would come and clean the room and for us to come back in an hour after we had to wait until  pm and our flight got in at   am and was told no early check in and to have to wait another hour was a complete inconvenience on top of the room being dirty  Other than the location I would not recommend staying here  you would be better off paying for a hotel room  You told me I would be given a refund of   night and a clean fee and I haven t received neither yet  I called and messaged you and there was no answer  I just called and the phone just keep ringing  I will be taking this further if a refund is not given back as we discussed 
749906835,The place has nice modern furnishings and is in a great location   so close to forest park and the cwe area   It has plenty of space and the TV is already set up for streaming   You must go check out the view at the rooftop if staying here   We had a delayed response when inquiring how to check in that scared us since no one was answering the phone number on the reservation   I would make sure you inquire about the check in process well before you arrive   The front desk staff was incredibly kind   The bathroom does have a backflow issue and it does make the whole place smell of sewage   it is not pleasant   The bathroom or towels were not very clean  either   The bed is extremely hard  which we dont prefer  but know that different people have different preferences   Parking was easy to find around the corner  The plumbing issue really needs to be solved so that there isnt a strong sewage odor in the space when arriving   I know this is likely an old building issue  but it is unacceptable for a place we are paying good money to stay in to smell like poo throughout the entire stay   Cleanliness is especially important during these covid times and we felt like a company like zencity would have good protocols in place    but the bathroom  towels  and shower were not clean and it was not a pleasant experience   The bed is also incredibly hard and not comfortable   Overall  the location is great  parking wasnt as difficult as others said  and the rooftop view is nice   We were generally unhappy with our stay and wouldnt stay here again   It was not a pleasant or comfortable experience  The instructions to check in werent sent out prior to us asking for them   It took an hour for them to respond via messaging  which is time we spent worrying that we had gotten scammed   We were waiting  nervous we would have to scramble to find another place to stay   I tried calling the host phone number supplied multiple times and it went to an automatic system that said it would connect me to someone  but automatically hung up on me when I pressed     It was followed up by an automatically sent text that said they were eager to help us with our stay but provided no help or way to contact anyone   The only saving grace was when we finally received the message with the check in instructions  the young man at the front desk was incredibly nice and helpful and awesome  The sink had crumbs or white pieces of residue in it that was pretty gross to walk into   The shower also had pink mildew along the bottom of the shower curtain  which isnt reassuring for how clean the place was overall   The towels smelled like pipe tobacco  which doesnt resonate as clean to me   Overall  the bathroom has some type of backflow preventer issue which causes the whole space to smell like sewage and waste  The time delay in response is nerve wrecking for a traveler   The message was clear in instruction once sent   These instructions should be included in the check in information so there is no scaring anyone when they are worried they cant get into the place they had reserved   Someone should always be available by phone and not hung up on if called   This is something that is often found with scammers and isnt good customer service for such a large company  It was overpriced for the accommodations 
749232666,Apartment was a great location  clean  modern  and great view  I did however have to wait   hours before anyone responded to me for a code to access building and unit  After waiting at location to check inwhen I got to front doors the outside monitor to get in building was completely shutdown so luckily a tenant walking in let me in or I would ve stood outside for quite awhile  Also parking is only available on street and very hard to find and long walk to building  Overall great stay but just suggest better and prompt check in
749463462,The apartment is great to stay  nice location and great environment  However  it is difficult to get hold off the host  it takes hours for them to reply in Airbnb message  when there is emergency need to reach the host over the phone  it always needs to wait    min and more  Poor communication  ALWAYS takes over    min when calling to reach customer service  And sometimes miss replying in Airbnb 
751022429,Very clean and spacious with nice surroundings Everything was good when we left  do not understand what damage was done
748748757,Ended up canceling my stay the day of after the trouble I had and after seeing the room  Check in information was late  Bed had stains on the comforter and some blinds were broken  We also were told last minute the parking pass and parking fob were missing  thus we couldn t park there for the first night  This was a huge issue because we were from out of town and we didn t know any overnight parking areas  I understand things happen but we chose this Airbnb for its parking  We were supposed to be able to check in at  pm  I had to reach out and contact multiple people to at least get in by  pm There was a stain on the comforter right in the middle of the bed  The furniture was also a little beat up  Some breakage in the blinds Slow to respond  I had to call the help line a few times for immediate help 
749426698,Great place and an enjoyable stay 
747807409,perfect getaway for the weekend and amazing location  would most definitely book again someday  weve noticed a few things such as tables  comforter  and rug wasnt properly clean  overall it was an amazing stay 
567449996164929511,Easy check in  very clean  awesome place to stay  Easy check in  very clean  awesome place to stay  Thank you for hosting me 
751017275,Definitely worth the stay with beautiful scenery with special surprises with you stay  Definitely booking this place again  I appreciate you again for the stay  Thank you for hosting me 
750989248,Beautiful bright apartment  just not the cleanest  The building altogether is a bit loud as well 
750013103,Great location and very spacious  We very much enjoyed our stay  Blackout curtains in the   bedrooms would have made the stay even better  The light pollution was a little bright at night  Used open Cheese wrapper on kitchen counter  Floors had a bit of debris in bedroom 
749980492,Great location  beautiful apartment  Gorgeous apartment steps away from Lafayette Square  Polite Society and Bellwater are amazing restaurants in walking distance  The Lafayette Square park is down the street  Amazing location  
749917431,Great place to stay with the family  It was close to everything we wanted to do  and check in and out was easy  There is just a bit of noise as it is right next to a hospital but nothing extraordinary to disrupt you re sleeping  Overall glad we chose this place to stay  we were very pleased  Great place to stay with the family  very close to everything we wanted to do  Check in was easy as well as check out 
484017686949824860,Great location  stylish space  comfortable bed  Unfortunately  the WiFi was down during the whole stay and the hair dryer was broken  and the host did not respond to related requests for help with these issues 
564460165565153156,It was a good stay  shower water is being block for some time
750431271,Our stay in this apt was a nightmare  Stay away from ZenCity they are very clause to what can be easily defined a fraud  The apt is far away from what they advertise and even if they are promoting the Anti covid clean policy they have no idea on what is  clean   If you intend to go there this is what you should know      an house which is at the limits of safety  Screw and spikes all around which are putting at the risk the kid s safety    dirtiness allover the house and furniture fully dirty and stinky  food left inside the fridge and hairs allover   We had to clean up everything and sanitise all the furniture  Far away from the COVID policy    no blinders or curtains which are making the sleeping very difficult  I have requested several time no answers    linen and towels full dirty and full of dust  We had to go to laundry to get them clean  Most of them were used and not washed      services advertised  such as laundry machine  which are not present in the house but in a dirty and stinky basement    windows fully dirty and with sliding guides full  of dirtiness in such a way to prevent any closing creating a serious safety issue  I had to repair by myself  I have contacted ZENCITY several time to solve the issues and they haven t done a single step to resolve the issues  We were there just because close to the hospital and need to stay there but i strongly recommend all the people who want to stay in CWE to stay far from ZenCity host  also other families we met had the same problema in other apartments  Look at my pics to see the reality on how this people are managing their properties 
750329781,Excellent You might want to put a comfortable chair for TV watching instead of current chair 
749472746,Great location   very good for the price  Everything in the apartment was new updated   it makes it feel like home 
751207005,Great location to downtown events Lack of paper products Ask questions no response
546396060545795384,Best part about this place is the location in walking distance to great restaurants  dessert places  Whole Foods  etc  the apartment needed a good deep clean and some touch up paint  but was acceptable  Beds were fine and heat worked well  Seating is sparse for four people  We made it work and enjoyed our time here  The check in instructions were confusing  We thought the key box across from the elevator held the keys  The desk person didn t point out the boxes ON the desk until later  The apartment also needs a good deep clean and some touch up paint  The location was the best part as we got everywhere on foot  Thanks for a good stay 
567415567697453279,Thank you for making our weekend amazing    The apartment was spacious and cozy  It felt like home  We had everything we needed and more  Communication and easy for check in and check out was like no other   Definitely will contact again when in St  Louis    Thank you for making our weekend amazing    The apartment was spacious and cozy  It felt like home  We had everything we needed and more  Communication and easy for check in and check out was like no other   Definitely will contact again when in St  Louis   
567423389919396058,Great place  great location  and great communication with host Great place and great communication with host
751283656,Wonderful stay Great stay
751029037,Great place  Super comfortable 
750976397,None I already told them everything   But the main issues were noisy all night   No towels for a four night stay and again no contact via phone   We left one day early  No phone contact in St  Louis   Only messaging notes No phone contact whatsoever   You left a note and waited 
750423716,Awesome stay  great location 
750979054,This was my first time at an Airbnb and it was a good experience  Nice little place to stay for a couple of days  Great for two people  The parking garage is around a     minute walk but it wasnt too bad  Couldnt find the remote the first day  but someone came first thing the next morning to deliver it  Great place  Would have had an issue getting into the building if someone wasnt there to let us when  When we dialed the cost on the call box nothing happened 
750962314,wonderful   day stay  location was great  in heart of the central west end  place was clean  and unit was updated with modern decor   basic amenities provided for  building had laundry facilities in basement  timely communication via messaging  thank you  
748732878,Not a good host at all  to be completely honest  The suite  location  and pricing was all pretty decent  but we had so many difficulties with getting into our building and communicating with the host  We were given a code to get into the buildings entrance and into the elevator  but that code stopped working on the second day of our trip  The key fob they said would be in the suite was absent  We messaged and called several times about the issue  but it was always  well get back to you  or no reply at all  That  or they continously questioned our ability to reach the elevator in under    seconds even though we did it on the phone with them  We never heard back or received the key fob  and we barely could leave our suite the entire visit because we had no way to get back in unless maintenance happened to be there  Absolute mess of a trip and we will not be staying with this host again 
752145754,What a lovely apartment  made for a great weekend get away 
749977045,classy  clean and in a great location  within walking distance of T mobile convention center and tons of night life activities  the apartment was beautifuland a good price and in an awesome location but the parking was frustrating the Wallstreet parking garage was not working with the parking pass and it was not free like the listing said but the apartment lobby staff allowed us to park in the future grand residents parking the second night so that was nice but part of the reason I choice this listing was for the free parking so we wouldnt have a parking issue so that was very frustrating  we tried everything  the key fob worked for the door to Elevator but the parking pass did not work for anything and we had to pay to park
749482101,This place was centrally located and was very clean and stylish  We actually stayed at another Zencity place and thought it was so nice that we decided to book through them again 
470989254902943359,Great location and good size place  Only issue was a musty smell that dominated the place with zero response from place  Wouldn t stay there again We sent a message about the musty smell with zero response   Wouldn t stay there again
751267869,Wonderful host as always
751917016,It was very clean and the staff was super friendly  The furniture was not comfortable or made for people over      The location was great  It was right by the park and restaurants were within walking distance 
752057515,Very clean  nice view  walls were a little thin but overall nice place Thanks for letting me stay
752007496,This was the first Airbnb Ive ever booked  The process was very smooth and the place was really cool 
751902611,Great apartment in an amazing location  Thank you for hosting us  The apartment was fantastic 
750351756,Where do I begin   I guess by saying PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE  SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE    Ive never has a worser experience with a stay in my life  In a nutshell     There were NO lightbulbs in the bedside lamps so I had to use the closet light for lighting in the living room  They told me they would send maintenance the next day  so I stayed in my room the entire next day waiting and they never came    The microwave AND stove BOTH DID NOT WORK  so I was unable to cook    There was LOUD construction pretty much all day   am  pm   except on Saturday and Sunday  The noise was head pounding and woke me up everyday  I was also unable to use the room as a quiet place to study     WORST COMMUNICATION EVER  If you want them to answer the phone be prepared to wait  and also pray that they actually answer and not just hang up on you after a while  The messaging was a bit faster  but they did a good job of not responding to what I was asking of them  Some instances they would completely not respond at all  or say they would get back to me and I would never hear from them again  It was very aggravating working with them    I complained about all these things and do you know what all they actually resolved  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  They couldnt even compensate me for the things that didnt work  On the  rd day I actually reached out and said I would like to cancel to receive the     refund for the days that I stayed and they didnt even get back to me  so I felt like I had to stay so it wasnt just a gigantic waste of money   I still cannot believe this place would allow themselves to provide this poor of a service to guests smh  Please do not stay here  you will regret it  Will never be booking with you all again  You all should take a great deal of more pride in the business that youre offering to people  I was overcharged for what I went through and no one helped  Ive also told people to never book here and will continue to do so  Non working amenities  no light bulbs in the displayed bedside lamps  and the  view  was just a window with another building completely in front of it  They did not send my instructions prior to check in  This made moving in a long  drawn out  and a hassle  WORST COMMUNICATION EVER  If you want them to answer the phone be prepared to wait  and also pray that they actually answer and not just hang up on you after a while  The messaging was a bit faster  but they did a good job of not responding to what I was asking of them  Some instances they would completely not respond at all  or say they would get back to me and I would never hear from them again Other than the fake view  I liked the location overall Construction in the neighboring units all day everyday  the view was not quite the  view  and very important things in the room were not working nor were they fixed 
752158772,Nice sized apartment nice a nice area  There is construction going on right outside of this until so expect the sound of heavy equipment  Overall good experience  Building did reek of weed  especially in the elevator 
750829207,Very beautiful view of the city  It was slightly confusing on how to originally get the keys but once we had them the rest of the experience was amazing  Very pretty apartment  Cozy and elegant 
542761113348127306,It s a nice updated two bedroom apartment in a lively neighborhood  It s clean the neighborhood is nice and Zencity is helpful and swift with communication  Parking kinda sucks but there s free parking and a parking garage both about a block away from the apartment I had no problems with my stay  I appreciate the stay I enjoy booking with Zencity 
471722237224533326,Communication was on point  Perfect location 
541998525427225772,Very nice place   Lots of space and super clean in a great location within a short walk of Westport   Well stocked gym in the basement and very secure as well  Place is great  very spacious   Love the location  Privately  the Wifi is in serious need of an upgrade   I was unable to use my laptop for the most part if the tv was on and the streaming was not good    Otherwise great place 
752413240,Would recommend 
751961174,Great place to stay in St  Louis  Located near both a grocery and a great food  Everything was very comfy and spacious
751211402,Loved the property Loved the environment
750973765,This was my worst Airbnb experience to date and Im furious with this company    Im in St Louis visiting family but was looking for an airbnb for two nights because I had a major presentation for work and wifi was spotty where I was staying  So I reached out to Zencity before booking to ensure that wifi could reliably support zoom calls  I was assured the average wifi speed at the unit was    MPBS  So I went ahead and booked  As soon as I checked in  I tested the wifi  which hovered between   MBPs and   MBPS  never even reaching above  MBPs  I immediately reached out to Zencicty via Airbnb  told them the situation  and underscored how I needed this fixed urgently  When they hadnt responded in several hours  I found the Zencity website and found a contact email  I sent that address an email and it immediately bounced back    the email address was no longer valid  They were not contcatable    I ended up leaving the unit and taking my dispute to Airbnb  Believe it or not  in the dispute with Airbnb  Zencity has refused to give me any of my money back  I still have not heard back from my original message  which included screenshots of the abysmal wifi speed     The rates are low for a reason  avoid this scammy company  Get your act together   this is no way to run a company I specifically asked about wifi before booking  I was booking this spot because I  NEEDED wifi for a very important meeting  and where I was staying didnt have wifi  I was told wifi would be   MPs  In reality it hovered between     MBPs  I tested the wifi right when I checked in  reached out to ask for help and never heard back   I also reachedd out via the contact email address on Zencitys website  The email address was defunct and my email bounced back  Then  in disputes with Airbnb  Zencity declined to give us any kind of refund  Long story short  this company is a fraud with no care for customer service  Hair on rug I  never  heard from Zencity after reporting the wifi issues  I also reached out via their contact email address on their website  The address was defunct and the email bounced back  I ultimately had to turn to Airbnb 
749942587,Great location  They seemed to have corrected the cleanliness issues reported earlier this year  Really cool space 
752010615,Great location  
750339762,The location of this apartment was fantastic and overall the space met our needs for our trip to Kansas City  However  some small improvements are needed to make this place a space I would return to  Primarily  the front door lock  Each time we entered the apartment it took us no less than   minutes to finagle the finicky lock on the apartment door  Additionally  some very minor basic conveniences  such as a trash can in the bathroom  and a double check to ensure the apartment was well clean before the next guests  lingering odor in the kitchen and personal items found under the bed  would be very helpful in improving future guests  stays  Hosts were extremely responsive and willing to correct the issues but due to our short and busy trip   there wasn t sufficient time to address them before we left  While we appreciated your responsiveness to our complaints regarding the smell and the door lock issue  thought neither issue was ever resolved  in addition to those issues we had several suggestions about how the stay could have been improved  First  we found a woman s fake nail under the bed which left questions regarding cleanliness  Additionally  there was no trash can in the bathroom which was also a hygienic issue  Overall the location and price were great and the place accommodated our needs  but do think some minor improvements could be made
750109252,Great location   great price   Parking garage is a block away if you dont want to deal with off street parking   This was my  nd stay   this location and will definitely book again on my next trip back 
465967556691671387,Great place 
752875715,While the location was fine  and the apartment was as described  the smell of smoke coming from the rest of the building over took everything  It was very strong 
751255426,Very clean apartment   Close to everything you could need or want   I loved it 
750627721,They have an automated system that Im sure works well the majority of the time  But we had trouble with getting our key for the room and had a hard time getting ahold of someone to resolve the situation  This also happened with the checkout process  They have an automated system that Im sure works well the majority of the time  But we had trouble with getting our key for the room and had a hard time getting ahold of someone to resolve the situation  This also happened with the checkout process  Hard to get ahold of and communicate with whoever is in charge 
484811542667988612,Everything was as described and met our expectations  Easy check in  Great location and awesome view   Fit perfect for our group of   and would definitely recommend and book in the future  Thanks for the stay  Everything was as described and met our expectations   Small problem with deciphering internet password  May want to change to something less confusing 
752888675,This was a pretty great hassle free experience with a really convenient location and the room had a very pleasant layout  There was some hair on the shower wall  Like long hair presumably from somebody s head  No biggie 
424574403534024991,Great location  cute furniture and photography books  But it could ve been a little cleaner  The living room rug was too gross to sit on  the comforter in our room had dirt   brown streaks on it  towards the pillow side    Otherwise it was great and identical to the pictures  Wouldn t stay again but don t regret staying  Thank you for having us  Great location  cute furniture and photography books  But it could ve been a little cleaner  The living room rug was too gross to sit on  the comforter in our room had dirt   brown streaks on it  towards the pillow side    Otherwise it was great and identical to the pictures
751898240,Nice stay  nice views  Nice location 
485441027470939786,Wonderful place to stay  I will definitely stay there again  Everything was so convenient  The door handle needs to be replaced with a more user friendly way of entering the apartment  It was very hard to figure out  use the duration of our stay but other than that it was perfect  Thank you very much for our stay  It was beautiful  Coming back to Kansas City and staying with Zencity will be my preferred method  I would suggest getting a different door  It was very hard to enter the unit 
752831401,Clean inexpensive place to stay
752691622,The space is very nice and works well for a pleasant stay  It has everything youd need  The walls can be a bit thin and the occasional rooftop hot tub party can either by a plus  if you want to join  or a negative  if you want to sleep   Overall  great location and space though 
752487729,Absolutely adorable spot  It was a blast 
497131939059891035,What a perfect place to gather thoughts and enjoy your time  Thank you 
752382498,Great location in terms of being walking distance to the arch  aquarium and city museum  the parking garage is a bit down the road and the area is a little scary at night so make sure to have a buddy when parking  There was no hot water     days we were there not sure if it s because of the building or not but it was disappointing to not be able to shower
752134852,It was a great experience staying with Zencity for our first time and we will be using them again  Our apartment was clean and organized with a modern touch  We received all info we needed well before our trip  They was quick to respond with any questions  Before leaving for our trip I received all the information needed to access our apartment  Zencity quickly responded to any questions and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay  I am very pleased with our stay and the hospitality we received 
751291393,great people you guys usually do a good job I dont knowcwhat happened the last   spots no coffee couldnt even change the heater it was cold and no response which was surprising cause Ive stayed with them
752039471,It was a nice location  Walking distance to a few small restaurants with great food   Also close to the highway  The apartment was nice  The only thing was the shower wasn t thoroughly clean  There was blue stuff left on the shower walls  One other odd thing that s beyond your control  Late Friday night  some guy was at the entryway urinating on the door and approached the gate as I was entering the parking area  He didn t harm me but it was a bit scary  Hopefully someone caught him on the camera   
752648305,We really enjoyed our stay here  I was nervous about parking since you have to find street parking  but we stayed   nights and always found a spot on the residential street nearby  Now  we had an issue getting into the building the first night because the box wouldnt accept our code  but Zencity was really quick to answer the phone and solve the issue  which never happened again  So kudos to them for being really on it   We loved the view from the apartment and how close it was to everything  It was also very stylish and fun to stay somewhere that felt so chic and modern  Also felt pretty safe and secure in the area  and in the building   Overall it was good  but my husband pointed out that this is not very plus size friendly  They say its a queen size bed but we have a queen at home and this felt like a double  Even for me having an average build  the shower was oddly narrow  So thats just something to keep in mind if you need want more space  They also said there would be a coffee maker in the kitchen but we found everything coffee related  except  the maker  Not a big deal  but I did notice since I planned to make coffee most mornings  We were okay with the minor inconveniences because it seemed like a great price and location  when compared to paying the same for just a hotel room  I would totally book this over a hotel again  We really enjoyed the place  but if these are apartments  it would make sense that there would be a designated parking spot for each room like it appears everyone else has at The Netherland  We didnt have much problem finding spots though  so I was thankful for that  There was no coffee maker as listed  just k cups  a bean grinder  and a water heating pot  The bed was also surely not a queen size  We have a queen at home and it felt like a double  The call box didnt take our code that we were given  We tried multiple times before calling Zencity and even the codes they gave us over the phone didnt work  But  they did respond to the call quickly and they found a way to get us in  After that it was smooth sailing 
752426717,Great location and comfortable space w convenient parking and great management
751629051,When I arrived at the location I followed the building entry instructions  to the letter literally speaking the codes out loud as told to do in the booking details  However  the doors would not unlock  Much to my surprise  there was another couple who had booked a Zencity listing on Airbnb who also could not get in    We had to wait in the entry until a tenant let us in the building as they exited  Now  even though we were now in the foyer of the building  we could not use the elevator as the access code at the door activated the sensor allowing us to go to our floor  but since the access code at the door didnt work  we could not get the elevators to function without a key fob  We had been told that the key fob was waiting for us upstairs so this would not be an issue moving forward  We tried calling Zencity from the phone number listed but couldnt get through  After    minutes of waiting  still unable to reach them a family arrived and graciously allowed us to ride up in the elevator to our floor  At that point another couple joined us who also was struggling with Zencity their code for the door did not work either   When we all got off at the same floor  we went to our rooms  only to discover that the key fobs were not in any of our apartments  I was finally able to reach them on the phone  but was told that the fobs had been lost previously and there was no way for us to get a new one  When I explained that that made it nearly impossible for us to enter or get upstairs due to our access codes not working  the woman on the phone insisted that the codes did in fact work  I kept her on the phone  went back downstairs  and with her still listening to me out loud tried all three codes  Not a single code for any of the rooms rented worked  I once again found myself locked out of the building unable to use the elevator  I had to wait for someone else to let me in and take me upstairs  Promptly at      p m  California time  where theyre located  the woman hung up on me despite the fact that we were still having a conversation  When I tried to call back at      PST  the phone rang and rang and rang  I attempted calling five times  They never picked up   At that point no one had responded to my pleas for support over the Airbnb messaging platform  Given that I was in town for work  and would be leaving the building frequently  the inability to safely access and use any of the entries made it such that it was impossible for me to stay  Before the woman unceremoniously hung up on me  I had requested to speak to management to get my money back because I would be checking out she informed me that was not possible    I had to go through Airbnb  who were incredibly helpful and handled the situation beautifully  in order to cancel the room and get my money back    By the time I had booked a new place and checked in  Zencity finally responded to my messages on the Airbnb platform  Reiterating they could not refund me and that they had called for maintenance to see if they could let me in the building  Their service is the worst I have ever experienced booking through Airbnb   I wish I could say I was exaggerating  but it is simply a terrible company to deal with  they say misery loves company  but there was nothing gratifying about knowing that four other individuals were dealing with the same issues  We all spoke with one another and confirmed that none of us were able to get help from them  and none of us received working access codes or fobs    If you are considering booking at this building  do not and I mean do not choose a Zencity listing  The building itself was lovely and all its tenants exceedingly helpful  but Zencity made it impossible to safely stay at the location 
750824535,clean  easy check in  would be great if there was a coffee pot  everything else was good 
751030558,Great place  Nice location  Exactly like the pictures 
750598667,Bright  modern  clean apartment with extremely comfy mattresses  Right by plenty of restaurants and shops   Very nice place  Thanks for hosting us in your beautiful apartment with such a fantastic location 
750579961,Great location  loved it  I have a couple suggestions and they would be to place a rubber mat with grip in the shower because it was very slippery and hard to comfortably shower  Also it seemed the bathtub drain was backed up a little bit  Other than that it was a great experience and thank you for hosting me 
752827074,Great place
752680001,Great location  right next to whole foods and walking distance to many stores restaurants  Only issue I had was with parking but overall good stay  cleanliness of unit
752645456,Place was nice and clean as expected N A outside almost over an hour to get the key code to work
751240903,Ooooh ooooh ooooh there is something so serene and soothing about this space I love to stay here when I m in town  The neighborhood is walkable for anything you need and the view is exceptional  Love it Thank you so much it s my favorite stay in st louis
750386386,The only thing we had trouble with was check in  Zencity has a machine where you say the code into it and it lets you in  I will say we spent about   mins when we arrived trying to get in  We were told there would be a fob but we never received one which made me anxious that we might be stranded another    mins every time but surprisingly  the machine actually got our code the first time after that which was much better  the only other thing is the walls are very thin  we were watching baseball and got a message that we were loud  Also  the doors get slammed when you walk out and we kept getting woken up around  am when the people across would leave    I decided to give it a try regardless of the reviews so I knew I Hey there  thanks so much for letting us stay in your space  I think the biggest thing was the fob  but other than the first night the zencity machine picked up our code the first time so maybe its a one time thing  would be helpful to let people know they might have trouble the first time so they are aware  other than that and the doors across being loud and waking us up around  am  it was a great space and walking distance to things we wanted to do  The light in the bedroom didnt work and there was a kitchen cabinet door in the closet but that didnt bother us   great spot  would be willing to stay there again  Upon checking in  the intercom didnt work for the first    minutes until it finally let us in  Not having a fob in the apt gave me anxiety not knowing if we would be able to get back into the building or if it was always going to take    minutes to get in 
462251541890733542,The location is amazing and the apartment was very clean   I would not recommend if you plan on making use of the kitchen as it was extremely limited with what is available  it shows that this was never a lived in apartment and is strictly for rentals   Communication was also an issue for us  we felt that the communication issue in having to reach out to obtain check in instructions despite being told we would be sent them  coupled with the lack of notice about maintenance on the building shutting off the water   was a real detriment to our stay     We also feel that there is a lack of basic necessities in the apartment in regards to the kitchen   i e  no pot holders   no salt or pepper shakers
751914998,The unit itself was good   As advertised   With that said  the listing says there is a coffee pot  hair dryer  and cable tv in the unit   This is false  Having to leave in the morning for coffee is kind of a big deal for us   I contacted the host about this and was ignored   Also  there is a restaurant right below the unit and you can hear music playing at night while trying to go to sleep 
750992711,Very clean and great location  Very clean and neat  The parking was very inconvenient  I had to pay each time I left the garage and that would be the only reason why I would not rebook  Besides that everything was great 
752884229,Clean  neat  huge space  Right in central west end  Only issue we had was with the door and lock  Would definitely recommend
753308248,Pleasant stay near the Magnificent Mile 
752466443,Weird smell no parking This place had a weird smell and holes in some walls  Needed to be clean bad     
752135334,We really enjoyed our stay and it was a cool part of town  We were able to walk to do all we wanted  Which was amazing
434711641180782248,Overall this was a really good stay  and Zencity was a great host   Check in was really easy  they gave us detailed instructions on parking  how to get in the building  and how to get into the apartment  We didnt use the parking space since we came in from Gateway Station a few blocks away so we cant comment on that  But everything for check in was simple and convenient   Once getting in the apartment it was a different setup than the pictures  but it was actually a better setup  It wasnt a studio like showed  it had a seperate bedroom area which was unexpected   Cleanliness was decent   its not a   star there but its certainly not as bad as some of the reviews say  If youre looking to hit the city  and not spend all day inside  this is a great spot to come back to   The view is AMAZING   its on a higher floor so you can see the arch and the city  Theres a view from the living room and bedroom  The windows honestly were a little dirty so it couldve been more enjoyable of a view if they were clean   Kitchen was stocked with essentials  no complimentary water though so if youre traveling in make sure you have something when you arrive  They do have a vending machine but its in a different apartment building   buildings down  This is also where the Rooftop hangout is which we thought was on the apartment we were staying in  Minor confusion there but not too big of a deal   Check out was just as easy and convenient   Leave the keys on the table and parking pass if you used it   We do plan on coming back to St Louis  and will most definitely be booking this spot again  Thank you ZenCity  This was overall a great stay  thank you   Have a complimentary water or two in the fridge for guests   We arrived from Union Station and was quite thirsty when we got in 
752838095,My stay was wonderful  The place is very clean  comfy and close to enough to the heart of St  Louis  If you don t have a car while here you ll be ok  The grocery store and a few bars are within walking distance  Additionally  Uber was no more than    dollars  for every where I went  I d for sure come back  I love what you guys are doing  Very professional  Thanks for the amazing stay 
751481580,Wonderful location on a tree lined street   Can walk to restaurants and bars  Street parking was not an issue for us  Apt is in older building but updated  Be aware that there is only a french press for coffee  Kitchen is not stocked very well   Limited silverware plates etc  Our biggest problem was with the Nest thermostat   It was hot and stuffy when we arrived   Nest was set on      We had to communicate with owners via email  no phone    since the Nest would not let us adjust temperature without a PIN    Owners readjusted the temp setting remotely  but every      hours the temp setting would randomly go back to      We could adjust it at that point  but it was a nuisance to have to do that  Other than that  we would definitely stay here again   The location is convenient to so many areas  You need a sheet of instructions for the apt on how to work thermostat  tv  etc   And also instructions on what needs to be done prior to departure   You should also add note on listing that only a french press is available for coffee   That requires bringing a different type of coffee   And PLEASE make the thermostat available for the renter to regulate  Everyone has different temperature comforts and you should be able to regulate that when you are on vacation  No info on checkin was received with itinerary   Had to email and ask for instructions on entering apt  It would be helpful to have a phone number to reach someone when questions arise   Having to email is cumbersome 
752663275,Great place to stay   very clean and in a beautiful building right downtown   Close to shopping and other fun activities  Thanks   great place 
751283246,This is a very nice one bedroom apartment  One tight reserve parking place in the rear  Half a flight of stairs down  then half a flight up to enter the apartment  Clean  hardwood floors with carpeted bedroom  Nice kitchen living dining area that is all open concept  This is an ideal location  a short walk to the Country Club Plaza   I do like walking around the Plaza with all of the fountains and statuary  The Plaza even has their own security team to do foot patrols  so I always felt safe  even walking after dark Also  it is a short drive to the Westport area with all kinds of dining and shops  and downtown KC is just a bit farther  Only complaint no blackout curtain in the bedroom  Thanks for a great place to stay  Im sure I will rent from you again 
752278410,Pictures do not match  the place  Was very unclean and we ended up canceling our reservation  The whole apartment was dirty  Dig said it hadn t been clean since      and it showed  Yellow stains in towels and sheets  Holes and markings on walls throughout Bathroom fixtures and flooring were dirty  Window shades in the first bedroom were broken  and a chair had a white stain on it  Overall we did not feel comfortable  I have many pictures I can share upon request  Pictures from the listing did not match what the actual apartment looked like  Parking was very confusing Dirty throughout the apartment  Holes and marking all over walls  Yellow marks on towels and bed sheets  Spider webs in corners  Card in apartment said it hadn t been clean since       two whole months  Dirty floors especially in bathroom  Shower walls and shower has were filthy  I took pictures so they ar available upon request  Late responses
750435606,Great place to stay with great view  Thanks had a great stay  Also  the shower cady isnt the safest doesnt really stick very well to the wall and fell a few times 
751269243,Location is great  about a    min drive to every location and worth the stay  did have trouble with the intercom box for getting in initially but I messaged Zencity  Kate  and they responded quickly and get me in in a timely manner   The intercom issue wasnt their fault but the buildings  all I can say is thanks for the help getting into the building  wasnt your fault so no hard feelings
752696767,Great place      would recommend and stay there again  Thank you very much
754730280,We enjoyed our stay it was nice and clean
753051572,This place was perfect  I ll be back 
752662994,The place to stay was great   clean  safe and luxurious like a hotel room  However the intercom did not work while entering the building and the host wasnt responsive to help   Also there wasnt FOB in the room and the host didnt help out  The intercom did not work and nobody helped despite messaging  Everytime I had to check in with someone elses help
751497686,First time booking an Airbnb and I will surely take head to those reviews next time  I saw other reviews complaining about check in and I thought to myself  it can t be that bad  Ha  It was that bad  I m traveling pregnant with a    year old and we get dropped off by Lyft  We re standing outside bags in hand unable to enter the building  Trying to contact host  Contacts Airbnb rep literally NO HELP  Finally an hour and a half goes by and a nice neighbor got us some help  The building manager lets us in  Ok fine  By this point I just want to sit down for a minute and get us fed  Realize there isn t a fob in the apartment and we can t enter the building without the key fob which means we can t leave or we ll be locked out again pretty much  Remind you the host still hasn t contacted me by this time to see if we were able to get checked in ok     I m contacting them again because at this point we re stuck smh another   hrs go by no food no water  Finally someone contacts me and  has me go into another apartment for a fob  We work out compensation but it s been over two weeks and I still haven t received anything  I had someone contact me again yesterday and I reminded her of the agreement that was supposedly already in place and she sees no notes for that  of course  I received a message this morning saying if there was nothing else they were gonna close out my case  Inconsiderate  insensitive  and a horrible business to run  More people are gonna go back to staying at hotels where we have concierge on call  Better the communication of your business  You can t just have people booking a place to stay with no way of communicating  it s inconsiderate and insensitive especially for someone like me who is pregnant  People will just start booking hotels because of the convenience and assistance that s there when needed 
751229697,We stayed   nights  We were told there would be a key fob once we got initial entry  Well there wasnt a fob and there was no access to laundry facility or anything else  Very disappointed  Wont use again  stuck outside for over    minutes Being stuck at front entrance multiple times with it being between    to over    minutes was very irritating  no access to laundry facilities also frustrating  Dont feel you advertise correctly with washer dryer mentioned in headline but there isnt   in apartment   with no key fob I didnt have access to other floors  So what was supposed to be a relaxing little weekend get away turned out to be   frustration after another  Very disappointed  
751267235,The place was so cute  It was great with private parking and we loved the size and the smart TV  It lacked common things we needed like dish soap and paper towels  There was also throw up found on the spare blanket when we brought it out from the closet  We would stay again but now we know we need to bring typical clean supplies like paper towel  The apartment complex is super secure and very accommodating to check in  We also loved the style of the place  The place was so cute  It was great with private parking and we loved the size and the smart TV  It lacked common things we needed like dish soap and paper towels  There was also throw up found on the spare blanket when we brought it out from the closet  We would stay again but now we know we need to bring typical clean supplies like paper towel
753679766,Great location with access to the Streetcar and plenty to do within walking distance 
753316668,A very clean spacious place to stay Everything about the property was great
752664981,INCREDIBLY convenient location  walking tram scooter travel easy here  Incredibly safe  easy convenient to park  and clean attractive amenities  Friendly staff and a great stay overall    Thank you  again such a nice stay  
755841385,Read last comment I wasn t very pleased with not having it clear as to the entering the building or codes  The kitchen was not clean and the bathtub was filthy  I actually had To clean the bath in the shower out before I can get in it  They were broken glasses I have pictures a private sale I won t be recommending this for anybody thank you
751946101,Arrive early enough that theres someone to help when you cant get in because of a bad code for the door or keyholder  Prepare to brush your teeth in the kitchen sink  Please check your own codes to make sure they work  Check in was the worst experience Ive ever had  And there is NO sink in the bathroom  Had to use kitchen sink and they did put a mirror over it but just not usable  I had to call twice as neither the door code would work  someone from the building saw me struggling with it and let me in when I explained  then the key code would not release the door to get the key  I did call host again and got a really nice lady who worked with me to get the key to get in  it was cold and rainy and was standing outside in it trying to resolve the issue  no sink in the bathroom 
751908468,Very nice apartment and great location  The unit was very clean and had everything you d need for a comfortable stay  including a reserved parking space in the building s parking lot  No issues with communication with the hosts  Overall a great value and recommended if you re looking to stay somewhere downtown 
507973685478438392,This is my second time staying with Zencity  Great space  Very clean  Street car stop right out front  I would stay here again  Great place  I enjoyed my stay at your place
752830663,Very nice place 
752476192,Great location and quiet building  Would stay again  Hey  Thanks for the space   one thing I would recommend is maybe adding some blackout curtains  The light that comes in through the window is pretty bright at night  Not enough to change my review but I thought it might be a helpful note 
752415224,My stay with Zencity was great  The place was clean and inviting when I arrived  The building is located downtown not too far from highway access making it easy to get around St  Louis  There were also multiple places to go to within walking distance which is nice   I had read in other reviews that the building would be loud  and that s true  This is an apartment building where people live  so there will naturally be noise  However  I stayed on a Sunday evening and by  pm or so  it was quiet and there were no noise complaints   With regards to COVId    procedures  I did not see many people wearing masks in the building  but the apartment was very clean and it appeared Zencity has followed clean procedures for COVID      Zencity did a great job communicating with me  including detailed instructions about how to access the building and the apartment I would be staying in  as well as where to locate the parking garage  The parking garage is within close walking distance of the building and seemed very secure   Overall  I enjoyed my stay  Thank you so much for everything  It was a great stay and I appreciated how quick you were with communicating  Your space was great 
751535565,Great location near Wash U in the Central West End  The check in information was not provided in a timely manner  and the cleanliness left a lot to be desired  We reported the washing machine and nothing was done  Blood stain on duvet was unpleasant and had clearly been intentionally hidden  as it was facing down on the bed  Despite the high clean fee charged  the apartment was really dirty  The neighbor across the hall left   bags full of garbage out in the hall on Monday  which sat out there all week  No entry instructions until we requested them Duvet cover with a blood stain  Rest of place not clean in areas such under bed  Plates not clean  Rug dirty  Vacuum un clean Washing machine not working it was reported but no action received
751964662,Overall the stay was good  The location was great and the photos were accurate  There was a dog we could frequently hear barking and while Zencity does not have control over that  it is something to be aware of  The apartment was nice  however there was a barking dog in the adjoining apartment that would bark at inconvenient hours  The apartment overall was clean  however there was hair on some of the pillows and in the bathroom sink when we arrived 
753328193,Very clean and extremely easy checkin  Keycard makes it easy to leave the apartment highly recommended place Great stay thank you 
750600428,The host was super helpful and if anything was needed  they took care of it  Gary was super helpful and anything I needed he took care of 
753041347,Great place  very clean  wonderful location Thank you for hosting me once again
753335998,great location nice open floor plan and lots of lighr Great place got confused with their being   elevators in the garage but only the first time
753049230,Location was essential and the communication was even better
753345936,The lobby and hallway kind of threw me off but the actual unit was great nice and clean great location definitely will stay again The lobby and hallway kind of threw me off but the actual unit was great nice and clean great location definitely will stay again
499250818772635421,It was nice apartment  It is very convenient to take a metrolink 
756746323,Would definitely stay here again  awesome location Thank you for the space  very tastefully decorated
757553215,Zen city do a great job at hosting Thanks for hosting   had great time
750625654,Excellent apartment in the perfect part of downtown  Great views from the   th floor  and very spacious with   beds and   baths  Would definitely return here in the future Amazing spot  Only feedback   the apartment was very dry  Every metal surface gave us a static shock   the door handles  fridge  drawer handles  etc  Might need a humidifier or two to help 
751944501,This was the perfect set up and location was great   CLEAN which was so appreciated as well as the response time with the couple of issues we had was amazing and made the issues non issues seemlessly   I would use this again and again  This was the perfect set up and location was great   CLEAN which was so appreciated as well as the response time with the couple of issues we had was amazing and made the issues non issues seemlessly   I would use this again and again 
489150295472125336,Couldve offered something for my inconvenience doors werent secure upon arrival  then eventually was damaged and broken
752859809,great stay  located within walking distance to all we wanted to see and do Thank you  it was very conveniently located to where we were visiting
753332546,hidden camera s in bathroom
752878100,A great view  cozy  and clean  Couldn t ask for a better experience
751544196,Convenient place but it was a desolate area of town  Pictures look greater than it is  Good value though  Was told that the pool was open but it wasnt  Closed because of covid  Washer and dryer is on a separate floor and not in the room 
753036940,Wonderful  Stylish  Clean and affordable  I was nervous about this booking at first as to normally booking houses  But the safety of checking in and convince of finding a paring spot close made it better  The rental is spacious and well accommodating with plenty of closet spaces  Wonderful space it was very warming and stylish 
753360643,Will definitely return Beautiful place   great service
753031743,Super cute place
751499635,We were trapped in our room  The key wasn t there to get into the building and the intercom to get into the building was broken  They gave us a refund but we were trapped in the room all evening and night  The only way to get into the building and elevator was to ask a resident of the apartment building to let us in  There was no one near enough to bring us a key  This place is a corporation and didn t have any way to accommodate us  The workers we talked to on the phone were nice but took    minutes to answer every time and couldn t help us 
755883417,Great space  Quiet and plenty of activities to do  Would definitely stay again 
752638259,The apartment was great  being from KC  loved the location  Would definitely stay again  possibly when I return this fall  Hope they replace the many burnt out bulbs throughout the apartment  the apartment was great  from KC so love the location  Lots of the bulbs in the  ceiling lights were burnt out  the second bathroom didnt even have enough light to shave  That would being said  would definitely stay again  possibly when I return in the fall   The tv the majority of the chanels did not work  extremely pixilated
758073424,Thanks
750815771,Great place  Clean  spacious  and in walking distance to lots of places  Thanks for sharing your home with us   The only two things I couldn t find while there were scissors and a strainer for noodles  I also received a text we were loud around   in the morning and nobody was up except my son watching tv  Either way great stay  Having washer and dryer was absolutely awesome  Thanks again for everything 
755586304,If you are looking for a place to stay for a quick visit to St  Louis this is your place  The apartment is located  downtown within walking distance to several attractions   The apartment is clean and can sleep up to   people in the   bedrooms  The living area seats   on a couch  but other seating areas would have to be at a small table or the bar area   Although the kitchenette comes with all appliances and a few dishes pots pans it lacks basic normal needs like a drip coffee maker or ice bucket  A tv stations guide would be handy in trying to figure out the local tv stations   The check in process was simple  but we encountered an issue with a car being parked in our reserved parking spot  Our agent from Zencity worked quickly to resolve our parking issue  We were told we could park elsewhere which was away from our spot   The parking garage is a great bonus and is connected to the building   Trying to find our room was like a puzzle since the room numbers were not in numerical order and there are no signs indicating the numbers down each hall   Check out was cumbersome since we were  had to leave the keys in the apartment  but needed the parking pass to exit the garage  This meant parking the car on the street in order to return the keys to the apartment  Returning the keys to the front desk  in the same way we picked them up  would make for a smoother departure   If youre staying for more than  a couple days bring your own toilettes as they only provide the small hotel bottles  Leaving the keys at the front desk would help with check out  We had to pull out of the parking garage and then take the keys back up to the room  A coffee maker would be a great addition 
753663997,Great time in STL  Thanks for the stay 
754319997,Initial check in had its share of issues and difficulties  Couldnt get into the building and met a few other Zencity guests experiencing the same issue  Once in the room  it was a nice stay  but the Kitchen and Living Room lights did not turn on  Lots of room for improvement  could easily be a   star stay  But its not  Its a solid    Check In was ruff   
757553218,Great location for checking out all that downtown St Louis has to offer in the beautiful Lafayette neighborhood  Communication and access to the apartment were excellent  Really surprised at how few utensil items you had for cooking   there weren t even cooking knives  steak knives are not cooking knives  Rug in front of tv was grimy   might want to deep clean or replace
752875552,Had such a nice stay  The place was clean  very affordable  and in a great location 
752673987,This may or may not be centrally located to a number of bars  restaurants  etc  but if youre only looking for a place to spend the night in KC  as we were  you could find a better place for this value  or even a hotel     Apartment was spacious but not terribly clean  No bath soap  blue and brown stains on the towels  Building is remarkably loud you can hear folks walking up and down the hallway as though they were in the bedroom with you and  as of April       adjacent to an active construction site  Wifi is on the slower side  at least in the bedrooms    Took about a half hour to get ahold of the keys in the lockbox  we were provided with the wrong code   The room is owned by a corporation  Zencity  and while we were eventually helped  it proved tiresome to communicate with its agents via the Airbnb app   Our phone calls were not picked up or returned    Parking isnt terribly convenient  but that much is made clear in the listing description  Beds were comfortable  Lovely  friendly coffee shop on the first floor  Thanks for the stay  I found a used sock behind one of the metal blocks in the bedroom to the far right you may want to do a thorough clean of the place to see what else might be lying around 
563836979108308594,Wasn t pleased with the stay   I was Looking for a place with free parking   a kitchen in a good location  Although it had all three   when we first arrived the person said he was new   didn know what to do when it came to the zencity apartments  His manager was in a meeting   he was waiting on her to call back  Then they couldn t find the key  Finally found the key   Got in the apartment   it was just not what i expected   There was stains on the counters   handles on the cabinets  Also smeared glass   microwave  The inside of the of the sink drain was yellow   Like bad rusted   Immediately I sent The owner pictures because we was writing each other back   forth because of the issue with the key   suddenly he stop writing me   I had To go out   get clean supplies   other stuff to make myself a little comfortable  The owner responded   hours later   The place wasn t that much so i guess You get what you pay for   Wouldn t stay again As i told You before the house wasn t clean   For it to be Covid going on you would think the place would be clean   sanitized 
754204565,Very much enjoyed our stay  easy walking distance to a lot of downtown amenities  We had a problem with the garage opener the entire time  Also  the air never went below     Both things I addressed via messenger  Also very strange hair dust in living room vent 
754219757,Great space  very cozy and a convenient location  Plenty of nearby restaurants  bars and shops  Bring a hair dryer   there was not one to be found  and ear plugs as the   bars below like to crank it up loud until  am on the weekends  Other than that it was a great stay 
754098113,simple stay  good location  clear communication could have used more body wash  especially for a two night stay 
753694509,Convenient location with great streetcar access  Clean space  nice full kitchen and washer dryer  very comfortable bed  Thank you for the hospitality  There is no real  living area  just one chair  Check in code was wrong  had to call in 
754733509,Zencity has the Best Airbnb s in the city by Far Thank you
751206737,Giving this stay a   star review because the bedding did not appear to be switched from the previous guest  i e  there was a lot of hair on the sheets and pillows  and sheets appeared messy and not crisp  I was allowed to switch rooms but this was still a very off putting aspect of the experience    In addition  there are no staff onsite which means that if there are any issues during your stay  you may have to wait until the next business day to receive help if not longer   Another issue with this listing is that its operated by a company as opposed to an individual  so when speaking with the host about this and other issues  I was speaking with a team of people who werent always up to speed on previous communication with other staff   The location is good and convenient although it is right next to the train station so it may not be ideal for very light sleepers  however I personally did not find it to be such an issue   Overall  the management company  Zencity  ought to have someone on call whos able to come over to resolve issues in a timely manner  For a short stay this place may fit your needs but a higher level of service wouldve been nice at this price point 
753683573,Great place   Clean and perfect CWE location  Would stay again 
753320936,Nice place conveniently located between Downtown and the Plaza  It was very cozy and we enjoyed our stay 
753331780,Beautiful place thank you for that Thanks for the comfort but inconvenience to get in when code don t react
753086745,The good  communication was excellent   fast  reserved parking in a secure garage was very close  the building itself was secure  close to the Arch  we walked there   kitchen was well equipped  space was larger than expected  people in building were friendly   The not so good  area was a bit sketchy in the evenings  no seating on the balcony  electrical outlet next to bed needs repairs  Although it was close to the Arch  it didn t seem to be safe to walk in the evening 
754716993,This was wonderful and cute apartment  The location was so close to many things do in Kansas City  I highly recommend this location and hope i can stay there agian in the future 
752428271,We Were unable to enter property via intercom  there was no access fob in location  While likely just taken by last guest unintentionally  there was no communication or resolution  We had another stranger let us in the building hours later to collect our bags and ended up paying for a hotel  Cute place though  When we had to be let in and searched the entire place for the fob it started as funny and expected  With    hours and no resolution ever offered I had to get a hotel just so we could have someplace to stay we didn t need to rely on a stranger letting us in the building  Unable to use intercom to access  no fob for access in room after another person let me in  It took    hours for them to respond and I ended up paying for a hotel
507236818990554811,As advertised  Apartment was clean  Location is great  Thanks 
754785954,Just what we needed for the weekend 
497874424189464453,Super comfortable check in and check out  Spacious place  comfortable  and clean 
754815641,Great location   Great location   Could of been somewhat cleaner no one asked for my ID at anytime  
753307070,Great space for the price  Had no trouble checking in or out  Peking was not difficult  just download the parking app and you ll be good  Would stay here again  Thanks for the stay  I enjoyed it and it was great for the price  Would stay again  Handles and door knobs were left dirty and the walls were dirty as well  The bedding and bathrooms were clean though
752851914,The books and high fashion literature were the coolest touch  Great conversation piece  the bed was very comfortable and we were so grateful  Other than a few areas that needed deep clean  the place was amazing  Cant wait to be back when the hot tubs are open   Dishes were dirty  walls and trash can needed wiped down  the floor was sticky andthe box of tissues were soaking wet for some reason 
754814779,Great stay  great location 
754753037,Nice place 
753718046,Location  location location  Nice spot with easy access to all CWE has to offer  Small but has everything you need  Enjoyed my short three day stay in the Lou  Great spot perfect for my needs 
751205157,Excellent place to stay in the charming neighborhood of Hyde Park Chicago  I grew up in the area and I can say this is an incredible location to experience the south side  Thank you for the stay  We will be staying here again soon  The buzzer at the door didn t let us in with the code
753050438,Had a lovely time during our stay  Everything was so quiet and cute  Very clean  So comfortable  Parking was a little difficult but overall a great place  Definitely recommend  Had a lovely time during our stay  Everything was so quiet and cute  Very clean  So comfortable  Parking was a little difficult but overall a great place 
753632493,Great space in a convenient location  Lots of beautiful parks and restaurants close to the apartment  Would definitely stay here again 
755092646,Great location and value 
753047969,Great apartment  great location  Very clean and well maintained  The only drawback was that we didn t receive a fob so it made entering the building a bit difficult  However  for future guests  there s a door to the left of the lobby to allow entry without fob  Otherwise a very comfortable and luxurious stay 
754357083,Location and size is great but be prepared for a dirty apartment  Even after cleaners came back  it was still filthy  Hair and dirt all over the floor  a small blood stain on a comforter  sinks and tubs that don t drain and have gross stuff backing up  and gross stained couch and chairs  The kitchen is equipped with dishes but not any salt and pepper  oil  hotpads  or any other cooking basics  I was pretty disappointed in my stay  Very dirty apartment even after it was  clean  
752871979,Read the reviews   Spend the extra few dollars and stay somewhere else   The apartment was cute and the location was super convenient  but thats the only good thing about this place   Despite the not so great reviews  I gave this place the benefit of the doubt thinking it wouldnt be that bad   It completely reeked of stale weed  cigarette smoke to the point that it was unbearable and nauseating  I kept the window open the whole time to try and air it out some  but it didnt help much  I used the washer and dryer to try and rid my clothes of the smell before leaving  and even they somehow smelled like it too  I thought it was ironic that they had a  No Smoking  sign inside of the place   Also  the neighbors were having a rap sesh at      am one morning  and the other morning a woman was screaming  hitting  and kicking the walls outside of another apartment at      for at least    minutes   One of the extra blankets they offered also had a giant yellow stain on it  Gross   If you dont mind the smell and noisy neighbors though  go for it as it is in a great location  Thanks for the stay  May I suggest doing something about the stale cigarette  weed smoke   I know its most likely coming from the neighbors  but it was unbearable and nauseating  Maybe add a disclaimer or offer a more reasonable price  I almost cancelled my stay there because of it  but didnt want to only end up getting a quarter of what I paid back  and instead opened the window and slept on the couch just to have fresh air  Also  one of the blankets had a big yellow stain on it  Gross  Even the washer and dryer that I used to wash my clothes to try and rid them of the smell reeked of it too 
755965807,Nice
755077931,This place is AWESOME     Will definitely be back    This place is PERFECT      Very nice 
753354886,Its a spacious abd very clean apartment  You feel safe and secure  Great parking on site  Felt safe leaving my vehicle in the garage  Beds were very soft and comfy   Thank ful for the stay  Maybe add a  complementary snack  The rooms were warm and the lowest was    and the apartment was still too warm  And though the beds were soft and comfortable the comforters were stained which gave the feeling of not fully clean   We are still thankful for the stay  These are just notes  Also closest door would stick when trying to open and the guest bedroom wall outlet cover was loose from the wall which could lead to potential fire hazard   But honestly all in all it was a good stay  Thank you  The key attendant seemed rushed and loaded with responsibilities 
752867444,Place is nice and worth the money except there s no air conditioning    And they charge a       fee with is outrageous as long as you clean up after yourself you should get the fee back 
752854588,Amazing place to stay if you re visiting STL  Minutes away to everything  with free parking  The space was so modern and peaceful  and the bed was TO DIE FOR  Would highly recommend        
517375949118003385,NO WHERE TO PARK CHECK IN WAS VERY DIFFICULT AN COMPLICATED UNIT WAS VERY COLD COULDNT TURN HEAT ON      On the bright side the bed was kinda comfy Check in was difficult an to complicated the unit was very cold
755839507,Great location and nice interior  You can t control it  but the hallways smelled like pet urine on the lower level 
753345340,This is my second stay with this company and everything went smoothly  The place was easy to find  clean and accommodated all of our needs 
754111373,Good stay  great location  overall was clean  spacious  had good kitchen  washer dryer and amenities at this price  as other reviewers mentioned it does fai rly smell like weed  however this was a mild smell for me and I did not mind at all  overall this is a good airbnb and I think the concerns with the weed smell are valid but overblown  good luck  thanks  great stay
754093660,Enjoyed our stay  Really liked how secure the apartment and the parking were  I would have a single coffee maker with coffee pods  We had a hard time finding coffee shops that opened early enough 
752870636,The apartment was very nicely done and comfortable   Nice off street parking and a great location   Sound did carry through the walls quite a bit into the main living space  but the bedrooms were quiet  Thank you for providing a nice space   Our only  very small  quibble was that the toilet paper was some of the worst we ve ever used   Please consider investing in some decent quality TP       Other than that  we had a great stay   Thanks 
755273656,great location awesome layout
755387336,OMG    Location  Location  Location   I walked to the Arch  Busch Stadium  and to SugarFire BBQ for a meal   Plenty of parking in the area  but as they advertise is not included   A grocery store and CVS pharmacy on the same block   Digital TV available for online watching   Highly recommended that you stay here with Zencity   No noise from traffic or other tenants   Great stay  Excellent stay at your place   The washer was a little musty so I left the  door open to air out   Bed was super comfy 
754788064,A very lovely stay  lovely amazing studio apartment 
751931943,Good spot thats super close to Wicker Park  spacious  clean  and good for a cute weekend stay  Thank you  Thanks again for your help  This was a nice spot for my friend and me to stay at for the weekend    The only suggestion I would have is to make sure that there are extra rolls of paper towels present  There was an abundance of toilet paper but not one extra roll of paper towels to be found  There werent any extra paper towels to be found and the roll we had was empty when we arrived 
754163487,Great stay  Very cool unique building inside the old Wonder bread factory  Thanks for the stay  We had a great time  Just a suggestion if you could have a parking spot available for guest inside the gated area  that would be great 
754360525,The space is really modern and beautiful  and we loved the huge windows with a view of the Chicago skyline  And the rooftop on the building is amazing  The host was super responsive 
754354029,Place was clean and marched the photos listed however the wifi listed was never an option to connect  to nor did any other wifi work  
755571144,Everything was good  Cleanliness and check in process were as expected  Only problems were not be much parking around the area  parking garages are         for daily rates   Got a     parking ticket for going over meter time on the street   The biggest issues was  unloading and loading up bags from the car  multiple trips will be needed if you have extra luggage  over all good experience and exercise 
755620477,This was such a perfect stay  The beds were super comfortable and the bathrooms were nice  I loved having the separate rooms and the fact that we were so close to so many shops  Location and comfort for the win     Locking the door was a very confusing task  I don t know if there would be a way of simplifying this with a different kind of lock  other than that the stay was awesome 
754169586,Not really nice  Condo was not locked when we arrived  Closet door hanging  Hallway smelled of smoke  No bath soap  Old furnishings  Old coffee grinds in coffeemaker  Nothing to make it stand out as a place you want to be  Doorlock confusing  Condo wide open when we arrived 
755088180,Amazing location  great place 
753723465,Good location and great for a short trip 
755059364,Great place to stay  Easy check in   check out

473865060581329548,My experience was great  Found a lovely  spacious spot in a fantastic part of town  just a walk away from good food and shops  for my first Air B B renting  The people at Zencity were accommodating and helpful  The B B was clean  roomy  and had everything I needed and more  Would recommend  My experience was great  Found a lovely  spacious spot in a fantastic part of town  just a walk away from good food and shops  for my first Air B B renting  The people at Zencity were accommodating and helpful  The B B was clean  roomy  and had everything I needed and more  Would recommend 
465964695480476921,First n foremost the apt was located walking distance        min walks  to local spots  The area was quiet and the building altho needs some upkeep  was chill and safe    The apt however  advertised tv  wifi but there was issues with both  First off the tv had no remote and  buttons on it wouldn t work so  had to stay with it on or unplug it    The wifi i was given barely even showed up as available and   times it did  the password given both by airbnb app and written in apt was incorrect    The sink wouldn t drain quickly so water would accumulate quick and slowly drain    The shower head had a rack and i believe it was too heavy and pulled the shower head out of wall exposing a hole which had bugs crawling out of   Nothing crazy but a bit disgusting   All this was communicated to the host who not only responded    hours later but inly addressed one issue after multiple messages  New wifi  Name n password was given almost   says later  And missed out on one day of work bc of the lack of internet    The host seems to have multiple staff that manage multiple properties therefore diff people responded yet didnt follow up     Check in was smooth altho needed more time to clean apt  Ut they extended check out until    right sway for that inconvenience  Experience wasn t horrible  just wish i had the wifi addressed right away so i could have logged into work and that tv had a remote  Good communication is key bc even when things don t go your way  if you at least make an effort and communicate to customers that your trying to resolve issue promptly we usually are very understanding  Just something to be mindful going fwd and to improve on 
754123659,Great room for a great value for those who want to sightsee during the day  The other residents are friendly  It was very nice to have a covered parking spot in a secure garage instead of street parking  The fire alarm that went off once as the fire trucks were driving away seemed concerning untimely  Also  the park across the street got very busy with foot traffic at dark  We did not go out after dark because of safety concerns with walking around  We loved the room and did most of our sightseeing during the day  so it all worked out fine 
751283872,Work in progress  look forward to new location and better experience Call your clients back when they have concerns regarding your property Very dusty looked like someone just left
754720253,Zencity s place was very cozy and clean  It was more than I excepted  I enjoy my stay very secured  Didn t find out the balcony windows open til the day I left  Lol quiet and a great view from parking garage  I shopped til I dropped  My visit was pleasant with my sister  Will be back  Says will respond in an hour not so but beside that I enjoyed my stay 
753629905,awesome place to stay  Everything that was listed was accurate  Enjoyed my stay  The only thing I would change is the parking  The parking spots are really close together 
761073337,Very nice apartment  easy check in and check out  Highly recommend Thank you 
756142807,Wonderful location   Easy access to walk I  The park and  only a couple of blocks to walk for dinner   This is close to hospitals and on a fairly busy street so  there is city traffic noise  Thanks for a great location   Suggestion  the drapes in the bedrooms don t block out much light  That plus traffic noise made it hard to sleep for this suburbs girl    Also  a small bag of ground coffee with sugar   creamer would be a seer addition 
755404356,my stay was ok  they didn tclean the sheets  it a lot of hair and even looked like dog sheddin in the bed and all over the pillows  even the back up sheets had hair all over them  so i had to go downstairs and wash everything  Then once i contacted the host  they replied back the same day i was checkin out to have someone bring fresh coverings   i sent them pictures the first day i came and washed the sheets   requested my clean service fee back    i never got it  host wasnt very understanding nor helpful
754699343,The location was excellent  The apartment was as advertised  although not as clean as we had hoped  It appeared clean at first but the rug and carpet were definitely not vacuumed  which made us skeptical of the rest of the apartment  Easy check in and check out  The host was pretty responsive  Thanks for having us  Two things that can be improved  the rug and carpet was not vacuumed at all  had multiple hair clumps of different varieties  so it definitely made us skeptical of the cleanliness  and the batteries in the fire alarm need to be replaced 
563734922431799404,Host was not honest about the Airbnb  They knew the building would not have power during my stay before I booked the room and did not share that  When the power went out and I tried to contact them they were extremely slow response and were not honest about the problem  Refusing any refund but offered     off my next stay with them when I made it clear I will not be using there company ever again  Host was not honest about the Airbnb  They knew the building would not have power during my stay before I booked the room and did not share that  When the power went out and I tried to contact them they were extremely slow response and were not honest about the problem  Refusing any refund but offered     off my next stay with them when I made it clear I will not be using there company ever again 
755066120,Check in was super easy  Zen city is great with communication and the place was very clean  The smart TV had all steaming services so that was plus 
756209244,Great location near KCs famous Country Club Plaza   Nice  basic  simply furnished property that is a good value 
753635637,I always love staying with Zencity however don t always love every location  So after following parking instructions I still received parking tickets on my vehicle  sigh just use Uber  Check should have been a breeze UNFORTUNATELY my code didn t work for the kiosk for Key fob retrieval and I had to wait almost an hour on the phone with customer support while they released the backup keyfob I didn t feel as secure knowing the other key was out there somewhere with someone else  I always love their rooms and amenities  spacious studio  nice kitchen only thing was the OVERWHELMING smell of cigarette smoke when I walked in  the host assured the housekeepers don t smoke inside but I could be to differ with this location  Overall I enjoyed my stay and will always Rebollar with zencity just not this location 
753356837,We had a wonderful stay at this location  We appreciated the proximity to County Club Plaza and we walked down there every night  It was nice to have assigned parking  it is outside  but convenient to the entrance   It looks exactly as the pictures show and it was clean  a big deal for me    We would stay there again  We really enjoyed our stay  Thank you    A couple things you may need to consider      Supply more than   bath towels  My husband and I need   towels minimum       Change the listing that shows you have cable TV to streaming services       Provide more clear cut check out instructions  What to do with towels  Sheets  Trash   It may make things easier for your clean people        The washing machine needs attention    It makes a horrible racket when in use  Also  the dishwasher s spinner wasn t working       The kitchen is pretty well stocked  but could use more silverware       Please respond more quickly  Do renters have the wrong contact  I sent a simply email and never got a response  Communication would have been appreciated    We loved the location  and loved many of the amenities  There was no cable and some supplies were lacking  We had a couple of simple questions and had no acknowledgement  I hate to think what would have happened if we had a major issue 
567403603798857362,Great place and responsive host  Great place and responsive host 
563091550683650282,Looks exactly like the pictures and really clean We exact like the pictures and it was really clean and a lot of room
755563589,Great internet and nice and quiet
756117037,Spacious closet   Bathtub is small  but water is hot  Nice kitchen  Limited cookware Left a few items in the space but they would not respond to allow me to pickup those items  Waited     weeks  Still no response 
755373717,Excellent stay  The location is great and convenient for zipping around Chicago  So nice to be close to the lake for walks in the morning  easy check in and check out 
755052459,Great stay and view      Will be back again 
752884253,Our check in process was very difficult  but overall the stay was good  The staff at the building were friendly enough  There is no available parking around the building  however  surrounding blocks you can find parking
563074780291180255,Had a great stay nice area parking was not hard to find  
756759299,Good value and location was great  Communication was not good  We didn t have WiFi and couldn t get an answer as to how to resolve it  Washer and dryer is not in the unit as advertised  It s in the basement of the building   which was fine  it just would have been nice to have known ahead of time  I d stay there again but I suggest Zencity pays closer attention to details in there ad and communication  We had no WiFi and did not receive a reply as to how to resolve the issue  It was also advertised as washer and dryer in the unit  They were in the basement of building   which was fine  but would have been nice to have known ahead of time 
756157421,Perfect location beautiful view of the city very clean and stylish   stars Thank you so much for letting me stay at your place I enjoyed myself loved the view I loved the location
755626786,Fab
755055677,Great spot that s close to anything and everything downtown St  Louis
755896855,Amazing  Would stay here again 
754734834,Our stay was pretty great  Only problem was walls were a little dirty but other than that  the place was spotless and also provided just enough towels  soaps and also detergents  It makes you feel like you re at home  definitely would stay again 
755561807,The unit was not clean  The fridge had dried up juice at the bottom and sticky drippings on the floor  The ventilation system did not work also the ceiling had mold from what looked to be water damage  The bedroom door had a whole in it the bed was full of hair and the bedroom closet had dried gum in the wedges  The bathtub had not been clean it had dried up soap residue and hair all over it    guess the clean fee is money well spent  Not to mention this was a totally different unit than advertised in the photos when I booked  This stay was totally unacceptable  I sent in photos  messaged in dozens of times and was only offered for someone to come tidy up and on top of that I was still charged full price  This was a totally different unit from what I requested and booked and when I reached out to the host  I was told that it was when the whole decor  furniture and floorplan layout was different from the pictures  Upon arrival the stove had  crumbs on it  the fridge had red dried juice in the door shelves and at the bottom  their were also sticky drippings on the floor  The ceiling had mold from what looked to be water damage  There was a hole in the bedroom door  The bed was full of hair  as well as the bath tub and floor  The tub also had dried up soap residue  The bedroom closet door had dried gum in the wedges  Which makes me question why your company is charging a clean fee   The host replied but was not much help  The dirty unit and the host being unwilling to assist  also the A c unit didnt work
754738122,Zencity gave very clear and concise instructions which I appreciated  The location is great  limited free parking on street but I always found a spot  Place was clean and what was expected  I don t know if I just never found the right light switch  but I couldn t turn on the overhead lights in both rooms  The light switch by the door didn t seem to do anything  the switch in the bedroom only turned on the fan  and one of the lamps by the bed would only flicker on but never stayed on  Wasn t sure if you were aware  Otherwise  the place was clean and a nice stay 
522475653068277632,Great apartment  Enjoyed our stay
757135828,Great location  beautiful condo  and the views from the balcony were amazing  I would definitely recommend this condo  Thank you
755621170,Absolutely loved it Everything was great 
757134867,Good value just couldn t get in the correct way
754770781,Good location  But Beware of the people hanging out outside  Kansas City is a dangerous city  The courthouse is right next to the building with a great view  There s tons of stuff to look at and tons of things to do around town thanks to the scooters and train car  Check in was awful  The code to get into the building did not work and then the code for the door didn t either  I got ahold of ZenCity though and they solved my problem and Took very good care of me including giving me an extra night  Which I was very thankful for 
563014378505562896,My  nd time staying at this location  and it won t be the last  Cozy and Great place if you wanna stay in the city  right next to the Subway  station brown line  that will get you to pretty much anywhere you like to go in Chicago  I like this place cause its got a homey feeling to it   Thank you  My  nd time staying at this location  and it won t be the last  Thank you 
757112819,This place was spotless  comfortable  and very spacious  It was everything that I expected 
755836043,Very convenient location for sightseeing or theatre  easy Check in and  out  clean and safe  Wifi excellent for working but bring all you need  Water  coffee  etc  as I haven t found a store nearby  Had a great last minute work and travel stay  In comparison with other Airbnb s  the kitchen is equipped pretty basic  eg coffee  tea for   or   mornings would be nice and certainly wouldn t ruin you  Also I missed a binder with all the information about the place and you  phone numbers etc  but also some additional information about things to do  just some flyers and City map everywhere for free  also good   emergency Contacts  eg closest  Hospital  and closest supermarket or      to buy the basics 
756141124,Very Disappointed 
754139446,There was a mixup and they double booked us with another group and we did not have anywhere to stay for one night  However  they did give us a refund for that night and made steps to ensure something similar wont happen again
563010323070384309,My stay was great  Small and spacious  It was clean  And the Wi Fi worked well  There was a broken chair that s the only thing I have to complain about  Besides that my stay was great 
757331138,Very nice home
755583000,Great apartment   Roomy  Great views of the city  Easy walking to several restaurants bars  Great location  Will definitely stay here again  Just FYI  parking lot was completely full two nights I was there so had to park on the street those days
754240063,Very comfy beds  Building itself needs some maintenance but the unit was very clean  Make a note to check out where to park in the area as not included  Near shopping and restaurants 
455551170581067936,Sehr sch ne Wohnung  super ausgestattet  sehr gute und Schnelle Kommunikation  perfekt sauber und in der besten Lage von Stralsund  Es ist alles fu l ufig in k rzester Zeit erreichbar  Definitive Empfehlung  Vielen Dank  es war alles wunderbar  Vielen Dank auch  dass wir den Parkplatz noch den ganzen Tag nutzen durften  Viele Gr  e Alex und Kathrin
757537147,Worth the money 
757537177,Great place for the price  Very spacious 
757103795,  out of   
755086467,Really nice place  Clean and comfortable  Convenient and I felt safe  Plenty of parking when I was there  I parked on the street overnight then moved my car to the public garage a block away during the day when I wasn t driving  Would definite stay here again Great space  Only thing I would ask is if you could stock some coffee tea and sugar  Kinda sucks to have the appliances but not coffee Might just need a deep clean  There were dust bunnies in several places
759316537,Great place to stay right in the heart of the city with an amazing view  Will definitely book again 
755395992,Very nice place next to anything you d want in Chicago  ball game  pizza  coffee  beer  cta    you name it  its within short walking distance  You re staying in a home thats over     years old  so keep that in mind  But no complaints at all  very comfortable stay  Thank you for the use of your place  a little difficult to get into the door at street level however  But once in  the stay was very comfortable and homelike 
757530889,Amazing place  Will book again 
755580215,We weren t able to get in the place wasn t as clean as expected and while they were responsive on some issues they could use some adjustment on how you get in and get out Do you know the glitch which is two things number one place was not very clean it smelled funny seconds him we couldn t get in and out and that system you have for the door code does not work you need to come up with a different method for letting people in because that one that doesn t work
756701208,This listing is a great spot to spend a weekend with friends  A few blocks from Ballpark Village with plenty of stores and restaurants nearby  I wanted to say thank you for finding us all a new place for the weekend after the little mix up we had  The new place was much nicer and in a way better spot for the price  Thank you all for everything 
756737497,Really great space in an awesome location  Outside of some noisy neighbors  would recommend staying here 
767507525,This Airbnb was pretty good for a little weekend trip  A few minor issues were getting into the actually apartment Zencity provided the wrong information for the call box but we got lucky and got let in  Secondly  our fob did not work  which you need for the elevator or to get in and the stairs only go to floor    but luckily after a few hours of communication the next day and the office being open we resolved the issue  Our bedroom light went out the first night which we just worked around  All things aside location was great and the Airbnb had basic needs for a comfortable stay  
757048794,Modern  spacious condominium that was very comfortable  Great place
755897738,Great place for a great price   Would definitely do again extended my stay do to work and they accommodated greatly will use again   Thanks for being accommodating and understanding my changing needs   Thanks for helping and accommodating my Multiple reservation changes do to work commits  constantly changing over this week  Thanks again  
755865229,Great location  hand prints on wall and places with wet spots on wall  something like a leak in the wall 
505854225314862498,Great location with great views of the city  The representatives of the company that run this airbnb were very accommodating  attentive  and responsive  The only slight cons are parking and the bed not being very comfortable  Everything else was great Thank you for being so accommodating and responsive
758124197,The apartment was outstanding my only complaint was the Bed squeak a lot It was very nice thank you
757046753,This place was perfect  The front desk staff was also very welcoming Thank you   We had a great time  and the apartment was perfect for what we needed  The only feedback would be to include salt and pepper   
756108407,Nifty There was no loud noise at all  And there was no garbage which is why I rated it   stars  Overall  it was amazing and I have   qualms about staying there again  Hard to find
758109772,Could have been better overall
465132095132491404,Great place to stay  Very clean and walking distance to all the cities museums though a lovely park  
757352777,The location seemed to be just throw together to rent  Obviously there was no effort to make the until comforting for the renter   No pots  no pans    and the door was not safe and could be easily broken into  It was plain at best  The location seemed to be just throw together to rent  Obviously there was no effort to make the until comforting for the renter   No pots  no pans    and the door was not safe and could be easily broken into  It was plain at best 
757151719,Amazing quality  Nice  contemporary spot  The bed is low to the ground  So  if you have bad knees don t get this unit  Loved this unit  Definitely will rent again 
758454100,Had a slight issue and Marty went above and beyond to take care of us thanks      Thank you Marty for making our trip so much better by relocating us   Thanks again 
754723213,Great location  The reason for the   stars is because the AC was not accessible during the first    hours of my stay and the place was very hot  I was finally able to access the AC control but it took a while to receive guidance on finding it  Once that was resolved  everything else was great  The place was great  the issue with the AC played a huge role in my experience since I was sweating profusely during the first night and during the day  It would have been great to have better communication regarding controlling the temperature 
758038568,The room was as listed and very clean  The view from the roof was amazing the room was awesome as was the view
757769656,About as listed  Nice  stylish place to spend the evenings in  Not sure I d want to spend a whole weekend in  but it was great for the price  Lack of parking and all the sirens of emergency vehicles headed to the hospital next door were the only big drawbacks  Difficult to contact host  Front desk staff were not knowledgeable  LOTS of sirens 
755364972,This place was clean and perfectly located   The perfect location in KC  everything is no more than    minutes away  D I recommend this place highly for itll make you fall more in love with wanting to live in KC   This place was absolutely beautiful   what a wonderful way to offer potentially living place tryouts as well    D
759277765,Worst Airbnb experience I ve ever had to the point where I more than likely won t be using this service ever again   I reached out to both Airbnb and the host directly about extremely loud construction noises that were impacting my ability to work remotely   despite me putting in my initial request that that was the purpose for my trip  I wasn t even able to get on conference calls because I couldn t hear  The construction was daily from  am to  pm and ran all week  I wish I could upload videos to share   With that said  I reached out in a timely manner and just stopped hearing from the host altogether and have been bounced around through several  help  assistants from Airbnb  The host tried to offer     of the nightly rate back which after Airbnb s astronomical fees  was less than      for a weeklong stay that was unworkable for my sole purpose of being there    Terrible  terrible service  If you re planning to book with Zencity  don t waste your time or your money  Their lack of communication impeded me from options to relocate and actually be productive during my work week   From the fees to the customer service issues to hosts buying up properties and jacking up prices  Airbnb is starting to become what it allegedly wanted to change about the hotel industry and you hate to see it    I m only giving two stars because the apartment was cute and the bed was comfortable 
759173656,Great location in Hyde Park 
759106415,Great place in a nice area
758558310,The Airbnb was filthy  The host had good customer service 
759082184,Nice place  great money for the spot
481175509027313760,Simply the best place I ve stayed in Hyde Park  I love this place 
759434610,Never got to stay bc it was canceled Sorry but y all canceled
767289813,This property did not live up to our expectations  The lights did not work in the kitchen  TV only got limited stations  washer machine did not work and we were missing a towel and had to go purchase one   Even the carpet in the hallway was disgusting dirty  The whole experience was not good  Excellent location but that was it  This property has not met our expectations and lacked attention  Lights in kitchen did not work  were missing a towel and had to go buy one because after calling and seeking help yet no towel showed up and yes we have permission to enter the unit 
757342322,b
757129608,Place was really nice fit for a small family I think the      is a bit much for a couple stains but I enjoyed the stay and thank you for the hospitality
759941301,They have a  nice clean place to stay Place was great
758462670,My stay here was just what I needed  I am moving to the area and was looking to get a feel for the neighborhood and this rental did just that  The check in instructions were very clear and I really enjoyed my stay 
756795196,Doors squeaked very loudly and bathroom door wouldnt close all the way   Shower was clogged   As long as Zencity takes care of those issues it is a decent apartment and good location  The bathroom and bedroom doors squeaked so loudly upon open and close it woke everyone up each time someone entered or exited   The shower was clogged and filled with water when used   My husband had to plunge it out   The refrigerator was empty but shelves not wiped down   Should offer more than one key to get in outside door as it was difficult to coordinate with multiple people in the unit 
759669007,Easy check in and near a lot of nice locations Thank you for the stay  Would love to stay again
757757653,Great spot to check in accurate descriptions would  stay again Thanks for always making my process painless      Oh the door under the sink was broken when I arrived but I m making you aware of it just in case
759698996,great place  great location  and fast response time great hosts
768339233,The pictures are of the unit  The unit has a very strong urine smell  The toilet is not safely secured to the wall or the floor so it rocks  The room was NOT clean  The location was great 
758469473,Nice place Thanks
758467705,Nice  spacious and very clean  Highly recommend 
758420503,I enjoyed my stay  the place is decorated really nice  Location close to a lot of great places 
759869494,Love theareas Thank you
759051936,Great place to stay Only had problems with the fob not working but great place would definitely stay again
758462538,Wow it s so nice  Such a great location  so many good bars and restaurants to walk to  It was quiet the whole time  The apartment is immaculate  and gorgeous  So comfy and just great to be in  honestly couldn trecommend a place more than this  great job  Beautiful place  Good job 
757574011,The place was super gorgeous  A little confusing to get in but afterwards super easy to get in and hang out in the apartment  Only issue was the lack of guaranteed parking due to the unassigned parking spot  Personally  was a big hesitant to leave late and not find parking in the lot  Other than that  the place was great  Thanks for having us 
766585213,Great location  Nice little apartment for singles or couples looking to get away and experience KC  Only issue we had was with the check in procedure  Better instructions are needed for building access  Check in procedure was difficult to follow  I tried step by step to work through the building entrance panel and never even got to the step where you speak the code  On attempting to find apt     manually on the touch screen  we found everything but apt      Someone else eventually let us into the building and the building manager let us upstairs where we found out that the key fob was being fixed so we didn t have one initially  That should have been done before check in at    Aside from all of this  we enjoyed the apt and its location and would recommend it to friends if the check in process improves a bit 
530489525431919389,This place is magical  Great walking distance from parks and zoos and great driving distance from downtown  I fell in love with Chicago while staying here  Thank you for letting us stay at your magical spot
759140020,Its a fine place to stay  Sadly it is a corporation renting out apartments rather than an individual host  So if that matters to you  theres that  otherwise it was generally clean and comfortable  Just pretty lifeless 
760125235,Great location  great price  Definitely recommend 
760123827,Great stay  Very Clean  Great stay  Very Clean 
759615064,Great for anything you have going on   coffee shop attached  just everything overall  its the perfect place to stay if you plan on being in the area The room had a faint smoke smell  But other than that it was perfect  And will book again 
522517500978403589,Love the location   the building amenities  Love the location   the building amenities 
769368093,This apartment is huge and in a great location near shops and restaurants  The assigned parking space is bad if you have a large car heads up 
766331543,This place is really nice and I felt very safe  The brick wall and private balcony were really great features  I loved how convenient the location was to  Thanks again  Thank you so much for the stay at your place  I was a little confused at first because there are   parking spaces labeled    and   black gates  but the pictures you sent were very helpful  The decor was awesome  the bed was super comfy  and I felt very at home  I did want to let you know that there were some ants by the window next to the bed that had made their way to the night stand my second night there  But overall I had a great stay  Thanks again 
758114611,Horrible communication and response time if you have any issues  The check in process is horrible I couldn t get in through the intercom box and had to wait for security to let me in and door to the apartment code didn t work that you all sent me 
470967261804011418,My rental wasnt clean upon check up  despite me asking that they ensure its cleaniness prior to me checking in  Please ensure your cleanliness in the future 
767350842,This is a stylish apartment in a wonderful location   just a couple minutes walk to coffee  ice cream  and a beautiful park  Thank you for hosting us  It was a relaxing stay in a great location 
757320051,Great Job 
757139643,They were quick to respond when we were having trouble getting in the building  Nice  clean space 
756815579,Hi tech modern space with every amenity you can think of  in a very walkable area of KC  Thank you  It was awesome 
756820635,Cute apartment in an excellent location  Very short walk to the plaza and a quick drive to Westport area as well 
756707777,Great location  clean and cute apartment  With awesome restaurants and bars in the same building  Thank you for the stay  Such a great location with cool bars and restaurants attached to the building
756192064,It s wasn t to bad
757080580,I stay in a lot of Airbnbs for work and travel and this was one if the worst  The carpet in one of the bedrooms was dirty and when we arrived the window was open  letting in the cold and rain  The latches on the window did not lock  and when I tried to report it  I was given no help  The place was minimal to the point of soullessness  Dont stay here  just get a hotel  Its not worth it for the price   I will never stay here again  It was a horrible place with dirty carpet and a broken and open window  The place had no amenities and was completely soulless  The carpets were dirty and the window was open   broken
756823494,Decent Whoever is clean isnt taking the time to thoroughly go through and actually clean and wipe everything down  The floors were disgusting Floors looked like they hadn t even been swept  it was picked up and organized but not clean
756799565,Great place to stay  that too at a reasonable price  The place was more spacious than I expected  This place has everything you need  and is fairly close to the city  I would definitely stay here again and recommend this place to others Thank you for letting us stay  We enjoyed the place and would definitely recommend this to others 
517424416918260990,Super nice and convenient  Amazing amenities and location  Zencity property is always too notch 
424461460627734699,This was my worst stay with Air BNB  The host was very responsive at the beginning when booking  I asked to stay later than the original   am check in  They mistakenly charged me for a whole other night instead of the     for staying late  They then took over    hours to respond when trying to get it refunded  Upon arrival check in was super simple and the place is keyed entry which is nice  When I got to my room at first things looked fine but a closer look proved otherwise  The sheets on the bed still smelled like someone s cologne  Definitely had not been washed or changed  The floor wasn t vacuumed  crumbs everywhere The windows had cobwebs  and the curtains were filthy  I couldn t stay  I booked the next flight home and was refunded  No way I could stay in there  Please actually get this room clean  The surface clean is not enough  Sheets should be changed after every guest visit  The should probably be a mattress cover as well  Curtains are dirty  Shades are dusty  Surfaces in the kitchen are not clean  This is such a safety hazard  Especially with COVID 
757770573,Good spot but it s pretty bare  Would be nice if they had another bed or futon in there 
742458877,If you like the charm and beauty of an older home this is the place for you  Thoughtful touches throughout 
768391778,Great location and views
761760181,Nice location
758115626,First I want to thank Zencity for the wonderful days that we stayed  Everything was very clean  The apartment  condom was amazing  We book another night and Zencity approved it within    minutes  I will most definitely book again with Zencity  First I want to thank Zencity for the wonderful days that we stayed  Everything was very clean 
757795511,Very clean and easy check in  The walk to the parking garage is a little further than I thought   If youre not     friendly  this may not be the place for you 
760103108,Great place  Recommend replacing the ceiling lights with some LEDs   current lighting is a bit dim  Otherwise great place  No issues 
758047891,Nice place good location Nice place good location
464466299589336796,You can expect exactly what the pictures show  This place is amazing  Ensure you receive your check in procedures prior to arrival  Please ensure the box on the door works prior to visitors arrival 
423099369875169945,SO GROSS  This apartment had toe nail clippings all over the living room floor  black hair balls all over the bedroom and bathroom  dusty  nasty    The shower doesn t drain  YUCK   Also  it s directly on the Blue Line Train line SO LOUD right outside the living and bedroom window  Over     trains pass by everyday  Keeps you up at night  Finally  it s    stairs up to the apartment  on  th floor  no elevator    ZENCITY is not local and was completely unresponsive  We begged them to move us from the moment we arrived to the  toe nail stairs palace   Sent    photos of the GROSS APARTMENT  After   days of asking to move  they gave us     refund for the unclean apartment  Wait what  We had to get Airbnb involved and after   nights in this NASTY PLACE  they reluctantly moved us to a new apartment  BEWARE   ZENCITY did call us   times on the  th day at the apartment because the owner realtor wanted to come in during our stay  THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON THEY URGENTLY CALLED US  Not one time did they call to discuss the DISGUSTING floors  Not one time did they call to explain why their description states  single level home  no stairs   Every message from ZENCITY was from a different person  so you basically start the whole discussion over and over again    If your dream is to vacation above a Taco Bell in Wicker Park  then this is your spot Please make sure that apartment description is HONEST do not describe as  single level home  in amenities  there are    stairs  and make sure future guests know that the apartment is directly on the blue line train tracks  It s SO LOUD  And this apartment needs a DEEP CLEAN  The toe nail clippings and hair balls were SO GROSS  It needs a serious dusting and make sure that earrings and personal items from previous guests are removed  DISGUSTING
429703646364025214,We really enjoyed our stay here  It was a beautiful  modern home with the most comfortable beds Ive ever slept in  It was also very clean  I struggled with getting into the building using code but there is also a key to use  if needed  There wasnt much nightlife nearby  that I knew of  but very close walking distance to food and shopping  Also close enough to downtown Chicago  just a short drive  If we visit Chicago again  well be sure to stay here again    
759090517,Very nice well furnished apartment  The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with everything one might need  Also very close to many restaurants and attractions  Very nice apartment  but it was a little too noisy in the neighborhood 
757147481,Overall great value for the price  Make sure to ask for extra bedding and towels before hand  or you ll only be given    Only issue that arose was some flooding after a storm and our car got towed  so make sure to park behind the bank across the street  Thank you so much for hosting us  We had a wonderful time 
756135513,Good place to stay and work vacation for the week  Easy access to the city  Internet reliable  Comfortable beds  Great check in and check out process  Zen City communicative  Hey  thanks for the stay  Overall it was good  but a few things fell short of expectations  so I wanted to share privately so you can fix this for other guests  Thanks   Coffee maker   advertised you had one  There wasn t one  Wine opener   didn t have one  This is standard  Deadbolt   did not work from inside  Garbage can   broken and didn t open with foot  Would be nicer if under counter pull out  you have the space  Recycling   no recycling bin Measuring spoons   no measuring spoons No coffee maker  had French press but no kettle  Kitchen was dusty and inside of cabinets were visibly dirty
759602698,Pros  Awesome location   Lots of restaurants and bars in close proximity  Just a  min drive to the Enterprise Center if you re going to a concert  Easy check in  Con The noise level they want you to maintain is beyond ridiculous  I don t want to stay anywhere where I m scared t  make a peep  Thank you for hosting me  There was a big ball of hair upon check in in the living room
757827000,Place was great    Stay was great     Host was very informative     would give a     rating always  Stay was great and the host was very informative and made sure I had everything I needed for my stay  Definitely great price for the whole place  Would highly recommend  it 
767918671,The building is nice  and grocery delivery straight to the unit is a huge plus  Roku TV was really nice  too  but the WiFi bandwidth is low and I kept losing connection constantly both on my devices and on the TV    The unit itself was clean and the pictures are accurate  however the unit is in need of updating and repair and you cant see that on the pictures  The dishwasher didnt clean dishes at all  they came out almost unwashed  At the same time  there was almost no hot water in the kitchen sink  so washing dishes by hand was tough  There was an infestation of little bugs in the kitchen  too  The bathtub fixtures were scotch taped to the wall and there was a lot of cracking and pealing in the bathroom  Finally  the couch was  unsittable   You just fall straight down to the ground  It needs replacing  If this unit gets renovated and repaired and furniture updated  it will be great  but right now its in need    Also  my neighbors were smokers and the unit smelled like a dirty ash tray constantly  I complained  as the building is nonsmoking and Zencity replied  but the smoke never stopped 
757526315,This home was perfect for a quick trip stay  The location was nice and convenient  Bare minimum essentials in the home itself  but super cute and we enjoyed ourselves nonetheless  Both bed spreads sheets seemed to not be visibly clean 
760153734,I really enjoyed my stay at this beautiful downtown St  Louis apartment  The onsite parking is easy to use and super nice since finding parking wouldve been expensive and a hassle otherwise  The host was also very communicative throughout the stay  I thought the apartment was exactly as advertised  The only issue was that the toilet in the master bathroom was clogged to the point of needing maintenance when we arrived and was not fixed until the morning we left  but there was another bathroom in the apartment so it wasnt a big deal to me  If you are looking for a welcoming and safe place to stay in downtown St  Louis  look no further than here 
756741102,Perfect location for shopping and restaurants within close walking distance  We loved the balcony and ambiance of the apartment  Definitely recommend  The code we were given to initially access the elevator didn t work but a neighbor let us ride up with her as she stays on the same floor as the apt and knew about it  We had no other issues after getting the key fob  Loved our stay and will likely return 
764337315,Good  clean  well lighted apartment close to downtown 
762585202,This apartment is very close to Lincoln Park  and has plenty of restaurants and stores nearby  It was easy to get a Lyft within a few minutes  It has a lot of space for the price  It is above a bar  which I found very busy on Saturday night  but quiet the rest of the nights I was there  The floors were filthy   I had to sweep them to be able to walk in bare feet  Two of the three dishes I pulled from the cabinet were dirty  The shower had hair in it  I was very disappointed in the lack of cleanliness but the rest was good 
760394152,great place to stay 
761763271,I would highly recommend  Very pretty
760174002,thank you for the great hospitality
759873499,The place looks even better in person  Beautiful upstairs and down My only problem was finding parking other than that great stay 
767290469,DO NOT BOOK HERE They failed to provide me with extra towels after multiple requests not to mention I was forced to stay here without any air conditioning in the heat  There was no one who came out and checked this issue nor tried to compensate me in any way  This stay was horrible and I was doing anything not to have to be stuck melting in this apartment  It was not thouroughly clean everywhere but enough for me to be able to still stay  The windows are broken  shower curtains inside out  and mix matched curtains just to name a few  The Zencity staff offered nothing but excuses during the whole stay  Good luck if you do decide to stay here  I am very i pleased after my stay of having to sleep in uncomfortable temperatures with no help or compensation  I will not be returning and I still deserve some of my money back for the lack of performance of air throughout the facility and my sweat and tears 
757305258,Had a great stay  recommend this AirBnB  Thank you so much 
757095203,They conveniently leave out that there is no parking  Whether you park on the street or in the garage you are paying at the least     a day or more  So beware before you book this place  Also the walls are paper thin  You can here the elevator and anyone who Is in the hallway or by the door  I kept thinking someone was coming in the door all night  The tub was clogged with hair that i had to remove with a fork because the water wouldnt drain  Imagine taking a shower in a tub full of water  THE WORST  And the host was unresponsive  She offered late check out in the check out details and when I asked could she accommodate late check out she stated she couldnt because the housekeeper was scheduled to come at    of which the housekeeper was late cause no one came while I was in the lobby  The location is cool if you trying to shop but if not  find another place with better parking options  Most of the shops had long Lines outside due to Covid restrictions anyway  Overall  the only good thing about good place was the view 
470936960558777363,Overall my stay was okay there were a few issues  I get the feeling this was the first time this unit has been rented so I hope this is taken as constructive criticism  The wifi didn t work which they offer to send someone to come fix but I didn t want to deal with having a technician come into the residence during my vacation  the bed didn t have a box spring so the mattress just fell into the frame causing uncomfortable divots in an otherwise comfy bed and sheets  I wasn t sent instructions other than  lockbox  there wasn t a lockbox number or code so I had to call host and wait on hold to get into the residence  when I called customer service seemed surprised that I had booked a stay this delayed us about    minutes  there was also someone else s headphones left plugged into the wall  All in with these inconveniences I d be hesitant to stay with this host again  Overall my stay was okay there were a few issues  I get the feeling this was the first time this unit has been rented so I hope this is taken as constructive criticism  The wifi didn t work which they offer to send someone to come fix but I didn t want to deal with having a technician come into the residence during my vacation  the bed didn t have a box spring so the mattress just fell into the frame causing uncomfortable divots in an otherwise comfy bed and sheets  I wasn t sent instructions other than  lockbox  there wasn t a lockbox number or code so I had to call host and wait on hold to get into the residence  when I called customer service seemed surprised that I had booked a stay this delayed us about    minutes  there was also someone else s headphones left plugged into the wall  All in with these inconveniences I d be hesitant to stay with this host again 
758033075,Very convenient space in the heart of the Central West End  Its a fairly small room  but if all you need is a place to sleep while visiting the med school or touring St  Louis  this is perfect  Walkable to the med school and Forest Park  with a metro stop nearby to get you downtown  Check in was a breeze and Zencity was very responsive to any questions  The A C would come on for a few seconds and then turn off  It wasnt a problem for our stay  but just so you know  Thanks for such a convenient location 
759277328,Place was clean and in the perfect  safe location  Great stay and would definitely stay here again 
758110982,A beautiful nice comfortable place to stay Thank you for a nice and comfortable place while getting house remodeled 
422429175211083242,Apartment is in a great location directly above bars  near cafes and the really nice Oz park  Lincoln park is a short walk away  If you re looking for a great spot in Chicago  this is in one  Hi there  Apartment was good and in a prime location  It was pretty dirty though  despite paying the clean fee  Happy to send photos to show you what I mean   but all round rooms  flies round vents  bathroom  windows  kitchenware and drawers etc were all dirty  All the rest with check in etc was very smooth  Thanks
759134101,   There is NO cable    There is NO sofa bed   its a   loveseat    There is NO shower  The faucet for shower bath doesnt work so dont plan on bathing    Check your dishes before use   many were unclean and grimy    Theres no kettle for boiling water for tea or coffee so forget that    The plus side is the location but its on the ground floor on a busy traffic corner so the noise level is quite high  Parking is a bear so you have to find a spot and watch the parking limitation signs  I would like a discount refund applied to my credit card  There is no sofa bed to sleep on   its a   loveseat and Im      Theres no cable  The shower bath faucet doesnt work so I was not able to bathe   stupid  Theres no cable  There was no kettle to boil water for making coffee  And the bath mat had to large wads of long black thick hair  gross   You charged me         which is way over priced for a place with no shower or sofa bed as we had planned  I expect a credit refund for one night            And you should not be in the Airbnb business as youre not a homeowner with the care factor that should go into the facility and the service  No one available to respond to no shower bath usage and no sofa bed to sleep on   This is not a host but a corporate outfit that does not know how to provide proper service for Airbnb  There was no sofa bed to sleep on so I had to share the bed with my traveling companion  the shower bath did not work so you couldnt get any water to run through the faucet  There were long black hairs in the bath mat  gross  and the cup glasses I went to use in the kitchen were dirty and grimy   had to rewash them all  No way to make coffee  no kettle  but they have a press but no kettle to boil the water  Carpets are dirty into the bathroom  Oh and theres no cable tv as stated  Only a very bad connection of a few local channels 
758068146,Nothing
768163198,The apartment is beautiful and more spacious than what you see in the photos  we really liked it when we arrived and stayed for   days   But the clean part we were not happy with  it was not totally clean  the ceiling fan in the room was very dusty  the floor of the whole apartment too   In the furniture a flea appeared apparently there was a dog in the place   And the communication with Zencity was not satisfactory at all   At the end of the stay we had left the keys because the instructions said it was to leave it on the table but my husband left it on the shelf   In minutes they were charging us          saying that the keys were lost   We were already at the airport to take our flight and in the middle of the airport we had to do these steps which Zencity did not answer us  we had to ask Airbnb for help to help us and Zencity never answered the calls and emails sent by the operator of Airbnb   Thank God they did not charge us but they did not contact us to let us know  even following up if they had found the keys   My husband and I love Airbnb but with this company Zencity was the first and last time  we did not like their service at all  The apartment is beautiful and spacious we liked it a lot but the clean part we were not happy with  it was not totally clean  the ceiling fan in the room had a lot of dust  the floor of the whole apartment too   In the furniture a flea appeared apparently there was a dog in the place   And the communication with you was not satisfactory at all 
476776613797137675,Nice spot downtown
770052968,Very nice location Very location
760113021,We were nervous to book because of mixed reviews  but overall better than expected  Check in was smooth and parking was just down the street  Location is within walking distance of most downtown restaurants and attractions  Our only complaint was that it smelled strongly of weed the entire time  including inside our apartment  especially the bathroom  though the complex is advertised as non smoking  Entire apartment and complex smelled of weed
758032796,Clean and minimalist place that suited our needs perfectly  Getting into the apartment and acquiring the key to check in was simple with the detailed instructions that were given to us  Definitely a place I would stay in again  Thanks for having the detailed list of how to get into the apartment building and how to acquire the key  The place suited our needs perfectly  Also  the bath tub and sink in the bathroom could use some draino to be unclogged
757326584,Everything was awesome we only got to stay for a night though  and had a later check in bed was one of the most comfortable beds I ve slept in  Check in was difficult for us because the lift arm to get into parking garage was broken and because of our late arrival office hours were closed  That would be my only complaint but everything else was perfect  Very clean I will say the parking check in was hard because the lift arm was broken so we couldn t get in for awhile
760428141,Nope  don t   Apartment would be fine with a good clean  maintenance  decent furniture  but Zencity s lack of organization and communication is incredibly frustrating   No parking access  so I had to pay to park   Bad experience and was extremely frustrating  Seriously poor communications  response to issues  cleanliness  poorly maintained property that wasn t the same as listing   Garage access never worked  so I paid to get after attempting to resolve every day  Maintenance man walked in while I was buck naked and after I had said to wait until after I was gone   You guys need to get it together or get out of the  rental business 
415914047385746534,Amazing stay and I would stay again anytime Amazing stay and I would stay again
414422992336179436,Amazing location  with a great patio  The apartment is huge  two bedrooms and two bathrooms  There is a supermarket on the first floor of the building and you don t need to go outside to get to it  The building is a little dated  it s not a brand new building  but the apartment has been repainted and decorated  Good views of the city  Amazing location  with a great patio  The apartment is huge  two bedrooms and two bathrooms  There is a supermarket on the first floor of the building and you don t need to go outside to get to it  The building is a little dated  it s not a brand new building  but the apartment has been repainted and decorated  Good views of the city    PRIVATE  It could have been a little more clean when we checked in 
415198336486216833,This is a great apartment in the heart of Wicker Park  steps from great cocktails  food and shopping  The walk up to the  th floor is not for the weak of heart  but looking out over Milwaukee Ave during Wicker Park Fest made up for it  Theres plenty of room and natural light  but also light blocking curtains in the front bedroom  which is a huge plus   On a sunny day  the curtains create a series of small pinholes for your own mini camera obscura on the ceiling   We made Ina Maes Tavern our  neighborhood  spot and hit them up several times for food and drink  Easy to follow check in instructions and securing a cheap multi day parking spot in a garage    miles away  made it an easy pad for a long weekend  The instructions were timely and clear  Its a great apartment and cool location  The only things that were great was that there was no shampoo or soap  which we didnt discover in time to negotiate a call to correct  and the edges of the rooms were a bit dusty  and included a smattering of cut fingernails that werent ours    Overall  great stay and would return 
760424669,This location allowed me to be near my spouse during her extended stay at BJC  I felt relatively safe walking home late nights with its close proximity   It s nothing fancy but clean and plenty of room  Cooking meals could be a problem as the cookware and utensils were in short supply 
413018613204869822,Good home for the value  Location is quiet but close to shopping and restaurants on Division or Chicago    Apt is good for one person  The place was nice  Good location  A few comments to fix   There was no key in the lockbox upon my arrival so I had to call the company and get a new code to a new lock box    The couch was a bit dirty  just needs a good clean   The oven handle and a few cabinet handles were broken and never fixed   There was no bathroom soap or kitchen soap  Would be nice to have some household amenities for guests 
760362714,Great location but parking can be a pain 
762568782,Great stay  Great place to go  Beautiful apartment and beautiful area   Getting in the room was a little tricky but worth it
769913389,This place was not at all like described in the listing  Noisy neighborhood  uncomfortable bed and couch  no street parking ANYWHERE and unresponsive host  The description of amenities was inaccurate and the host did not respond to any of my questions about them   she simply sent me copy and paste messages about check in  parking and check out  On top of that  the entire apartment looks out toward the community dumpsters   not exactly a  home away from home  situation  I love AirBnb but was sorely disappointed by this place 
769029182,Excellent apartment at a premiere location  Close to many great restaurants at walking location  Has forest park as its back yard  While there is no parking on the premises  the host is diligent is suggesting options both free and paid  nearby  Highlights of the apartment include the roof top  amenities  gym  and appliances included  Would definitely stay here again without reservation
413015447151744440,Great location to U  Chicago and Hide Park  Clean  very quiet with plenty of amenities  Great communication too  Our stay at the appartment was great  We enjoyed it very much  We only had a little issue getting in initially as the code to enter the building did not work  We managed to get in eventually by contacting the front desk but could have been a bigger issue after hours when the front desk is unattended 
758415051,great location   bring your own cooking basics Host never responded to my question about bedding for the  rd guest  kitchen was lacking basics and essentials  real knives  salt and pepper  bathroom soap dispenser didnt work
769957675,Great stay  Would definitely go back Thank you for this stay had a great time 
381865494994981682,For the value  this is a pretty good airbnb  especially for the area  There were a couple of problems  loud construction on the floor throughout the day  VERY loud AC unit  light fixture fell out of the wall   but the access to the gym and rooftop were very enjoyable  The construction on the floor was very loud  making it at points impossible to do work  The AC unit also is very loud and not very not very effective at cooling the whole place  Additionally  a lot of the construction in the place was a little shotty  Like the light fixtures next to the bed were both falling out of the wall   one of which fell out in the middle of the night scaring the crap out of m 
768654626,This is a fantastic location  My third time staying here  It seems the host has worked out the kinks in this particular property  I had zero issues this stay  Gated parking lot is very nice  This unit is in basement and is fairly quiet  A bit of street noise during the day  rather negligible  I would absolutely stay again  Love this location  my third time staying there  It seems you have really worked out the kinks now  This visit was pretty well flawless  The best of all three 
760171984,Great place  very attentive to the minor problems we had 
412308390066083812,staff was amazing  will be coming back here again  We will be coming back  the staff is amazing  Host was prompt and kind as well 
770050168,Such an awesome location  The space was as advertised and definitely met the expectations for our trip  Thanks for the great stay this weekend  Such a perfect location 
760357701,This is a clean  stylish  and comfortable space  It is an excellent location  and I ve found ZenCity to be excellent hosts  Thank you  I ve enjoyed my stays with you 
759870334,a good spot to stay if youre looking for something cheap and straightforward in a good location  we enjoyed being close to downtown and were grateful for the free parking even though its definitely more inconvenient to park in the garage than it is to just parking on the street  but the only reason I comment on this because it was raining hard during our stay  overall good value  We were grateful for the good communication and quickturnaround in terms of accepting our request to stay here  however the floors were really sticky  maybe some sort of clean solution residue  and that was kind of gross 
420921739439209097,Horrible host  I requested an early check in  which had to be approved by the host before I was charged   They immediately accepted my booking but DID NOT provide early checkin  I m VERY disappointed with this travel experience    The space on the other hand  was in a great location and we were very happy with the actual place  Terrible check in  Requested a partial refund and you ignored it  You should be ashamed of accepting my early checkin request and not accommodating it  Tells me you are money grabbing 
383320298102011414,Great location  good amenities Already sent over my notes
768357401,Great location   price  
763472627,Three problems     WiFi does not work properly      A C does not work properly      Host provided invalid smart lock code  was not able to access properly for   hrs until new code issued  Please refer to my email communications via the Airbnb app 
759891720,This is a very neat and up to date Airbnb  it is very relaxing and overall just a great vibe to be downtown  Hands down the best Airbnb I ve stayed in so far  Very nice location and the views are amazing 
768387103,Nice location  parking wasn t bad  Check in was easy  host took a while to reply previous to the stay but during the stay I had no issues  The walls are paper thin  so if you like listening to music this place isn t for you  The walls are paper thin  I wasn t listening to music Loud and received a lot of complaints when it wasn t ever loud 
757089402,This place is super clean   you get everything you see in the pictures as promised  It s a very big space in a great building and it s safe as well  I highly recommend  My stay was wonderful  Zencity truly provided a clean and welcoming stay with all of the amenities promised  Overall  I had a great experience and would come again 
759679616,Great beautiful spacious place loved it
768370280,Awful stay  The intercom to enter the building doesn t work and we had to bang on the door until some workers let us in  The main light in the apartment doesn t work  The water in the tub doesn t drain  The pool is closed and they falsely still claim there is a pool available on the listing  Communication was bad  Do not recommend The intercom to enter the building doesn t work and we had to bang on the door until some workers let us in  The main light in the apartment doesn t work  The water in the tub doesn t drain  The pool is closed and you falsely still claim there is a pool available on the listing  Awful stay 
759614373,Really nice place apparentlythe neighbors thought my mom and I laughed too loud with each other so we got an noise complaint I heard others as well but did not complain because clearly the walls are just really thin but for the most part I loved the stay
762800860,This home was exactly what I needed  very clean  easy to access  amazing location with easy parking  the bed was without a doubt the most comfortable  and the claw foot tub was to die for  Hoping I can come back and stay here again  Thank you so much for allowing me to stay in your home  it was the perfect location and it was so clean and cozy 
757821109,Amazing place  super cute  close to some of the best pizza I ve ever had  Loved the neighbors  Super friendly neighbors Amazing apartment  Made us want to move to the city

768363493,Nice unit on a high floor with very good city  and sunset views   Building elevators always arrived quickly   We were quite comfortable cooking in a nicely equipped kitchen  and slept well   The bedrooms have separate AC units from the living room  a plus   Hot water is super slow to arrive  but eventually it did  Building seems to have a decent maintenance team  they quickly fixed a broken exterior door handle lock   Fine basic unit  furnished just as the pics show  IKEA style   Gritty but improving neighborhood   Parking worked well   Quiet   We walked all over in daytime and evenings  June  long days     Try the Oyster Bar behind Busch Stadium  we walked around the stadium during an evening game  that was fun to see people coming together again  City keeps the area and parks looking good  we felt safe before dark   We would definitely stay there again  We enjoyed our stay  great location   We enjoyed the sunsets and watching the ferris wheel after dark  Wifi was excellent  No problem with Roku  we have them at home   Bikes fit in elevator fine  even with all of their panniers  This is a lot more than I would normally write  but this is apparently a new unit for you   Floor was quiet   Loved the hot water pot   french press  Enough pots   pans and dishes  more spoons and forks would be nice   Everything worked well except the hot water and dishwasher   Front door security is hit or miss    It would be a really good idea to get the bathroom baseboards wiped clean  they were really dusty dirty and it doesnt go well with the rest of the bathroom which was clean   Those are the only baseboards that are glaringly obvious  Kitchen was clean    The dishwasher failed to wash the dishes clean  it couldnt even knock crumbs off a very small cutting board    x      So after the first night we washed dishes by hand and didnt try it again   I doubt you can do anything for the hot water  seems to be a building issue  One morning and  one afternoon it took opening the kitchen  bath sink   shower to full hot for at least    min to get hot water   But it finally arrived and was ok after that   But it might be a help to let people know   Front door security was compromised but fixed rapidly a couple times  we didnt turn it in  but it appears someone cares    Someone broke a handle off back door and it could be opened one morning  fixed later that day    and front handle the next day  but that door still locked  also fixed   Not your problem  but thats a function of the gritty area    Its obvious the city is clean up the area  outside was clean and we had no problems at all walking all over in the daytime and before dark   We did not walk after dark   Great location  went to Arch and Oyster bar  Library and more    Would stay again 
760668683,Great location on a very quit street  Lots of good restaurants in walking distance  and no problems with finding free street parking  Having co hosted an Airbnb Plus in San Francisco with a super host  we are  perhaps  more critical than a usual guest  I am sure that the unit was a total showcase once upon a time  However  now it just looks tired  with drab colored walls  peeling paint on the deck  touch up paint on walls that does not match  little artwork  empty hooks on the walls  etc  Bed was comfortable  and master shower was great    Unit needs a good clean   living room floors were sticky  carpets dirty  oven and microwave dirty   island countertop was sticky  light switches dirty   Door to closet with washer dryer was off the track and stuck shut  making it unusable  Dishwasher did not work  Only   of the   burners on the stove worked  No kitchen towels to dry dishes  empty soap dispenser in downstairs bathroom  Would  also  recommend more silverware and dishes   Unfortunately  our  welcome  when we arrived was an electronic door lock that would not accept the code we were given  Alejandro was prompt in sending a new code   that also did not work   Alejandro then sent me an electronic key that required me to download and install the igloohome app  and create an an account  all while standing on the front porch  During our stay  the igloohome app would at times fail to open when I wanted to unlock the door  or would randomly log me out  requiring me to log back in  Per my request  Alejandro also sent an electronic key for me to put on my wifes phone  The app would not accept the key  and I never received a response to my complaint to customer support the next morning 
758457723,The apartment itself was okay  The main entrance to the front of the apartment complex was being held open with a rock  so that initially made me question how secure the building was going to be  We felt safe inside though and our room was fine  Heads up about the parking situation  The parking garage itself is actually about a block away or     miles so it was kind of a haul with baggage and a   year old 
768628219,I don t always leave review feedback info but this place was one of my absolute favorites  Very spacious  modern and exceptionally clean  location couldn t have been closer to the Plaza  Zencity was very quick to respond to any messages   One recommendation might be for an easier exit out of the parking garage after checkout   but secured  reserve parking onsite is well worth it  Would absolutely stay again  and would recommend to anyone wanting perfect location with amazing accommodations 
759165832,I had a very pleasant stay in this place   The food options were amazing   this is one of the main reasons I picked this place to stay and I was not disappointed   The bed is comfy  the interior is clean and modern  the TV is nice  and overall I really enjoyed my time here   Parking could be better  but it has a dedicated spot close to the building  so theres no hunting for a place to park  I enjoyed my stay in your place  it was an overall positive experience   There were a few points of frustration  that could be improved with better communication about the location      It was difficult to find   I ended up in the parking garage next door  nothing in the instructions indicated that Id have to go around the block from the default Google directions  go down an alley  and go to the SECOND building  not the first  both of which have big black gates   I ended up going to the wrong building  trying the codes  the gate is broken so I got in   before figuring out that the entrances had individual addresses and I was at the wrong building      The parking is TERRIBLE   I had to squeeze in between two trucks  I could barely get out of my car  the parking lot is at an insane angle and its in terrible shape   I was quite paranoid that my rental car was going to get damaged by one of the trucks in spots   or     Im a very small person  I was able to get in and out  but I had no idea if they could or would be kind      The pool in the back of the building is DISGUSTING   My kids were alarmed and were made very unsure about our entire experience  its a terrible first impression      I had no idea how the door lock worked   A photo of the Yale digital lock would have been very helpful  I thought it was some kind of proximity key lock  I was very confused and after struggling to find the place  find the building  park  find the door  and decipher the lock  I was incredibly stressed out      The thermostat in the unit is ancient   I ended up looking for  the real one  because the archaic thermostat did not fit well with the rest of the modern apartment at all   You have a beautiful apartment  the food options in the area are absolutely stellar  but your  first impression  of the place could use a lot of work 
464304449988083937,You couldn t pay me enough money to stay in this place again besides the key fobs not working  there is no on street parking like advertise there s construction going on  The closest place to park is a block away  The host was rude when I was upset and could not get my key fob to work and she hung up on me  I would say definitely that the apartment was very nice but the mechanics meaning the key fob in the rudeness of the host I would caution anyone from staying here
409320449430482383,Great stay in a fantastic location Hey  Thanks for a great stay  Just so you know when I arrived the place was not super clean  There were some things in the trash can in the bathroom and hair on the floor  also some of the utensils in the kitchen weren t clean either  Other wise the place was great 
760684572,Terrific Parking can be a challeng but everything else was terrific 
770134239,Fantastic stay here  super clean and great location  Check in was fluid and the place was just absolutely gorgeous  Had a wonderful stay here but the heating cooling lock was the only slight discomfort  It was    F inside but the little air blower was a nice alternative to have 
766265472,The pictures looked extremely beautiful which is what attracted us to the place to begin with  The location seemed ok  but the building over all was nice with the convenience of the restaurant  gym  and rooftop patio all in one  My complaints came when you enter the apartment and there was a smell almost like take out curry  which made me nauseous every single day   the dishes were still dirty  like they had never been washed  and to the point that we were forced to eat out every night  even the cutting board still had food left on it  There were missing light bulbs  shower curtain was broken  the chairs were broken  my   year old actually had fallen backwards in the chair and nearly busted her head  the couch was ripped  don t expect to sit on it without laying another blanket down because you will itch  If you re looking for cable or to watch the news  forget about thst  They only had Netflix  internet went in and out so much that the tv was constantly on buffer  After we left  they actually tried to accuse us of smoking in the unit and not clean up after ourselves even tho we paid the clean fee  So if you are planning to stay  make sure you take pics of the place the first day  And the last  And keep it in better condition than they left it for you or else they will try to get you on for an extra         moral of the story  dont stay here 
760754390,Good clean place
769311597,Very nice   It was affordable and in a very easy to get around  areas very close to everything  Communication was awesome  Answered very quickly and very nice  I d book again   Thanks again   Everything was very nice I d stay again   I thought it was affordable and also in a very convenient place  Don t change anything   I enjoyed my stay  Thanks again 
760760507,A fine stay in a wonderful neighborhood  Close to a great park and delicious eats  Really beautiful houses make for a pleasurable hiking  nit picks  a little musty  windows look out onto dog pooing area      keypad code is to damn long A fine stay in a wonderful neighborhood  Close to a great park and delicious eats  Really beautiful houses make for a pleasurable hiking  nit picks  a little musty  windows look out onto dog pooing area      keypad code is to damn long
760347598,Overall a great stay with Zencity  all together the place was fairly clean and had great views with huge closets  We were able to walk to Busch Stadium and City Museum within    minutes  We had a small issue with our first lock on the original air bnb but we called the help line and were quickly helped and moved to this location  All together really enjoyed the trip and a few local eats like the coffee shop downstairs  Overall great stay  I believe Naz helped me during check in due to there being a lock issue on the original location however realizing there was an issue quickly transferred me to another nearby location  I still enjoyed the stay overall  great views and loved the parking available  There was a few chips left on the carpet from the previous stay but overall great everywhere else 
761558630,Worst AirBnb I ve stayed at yet  It was very dirty  very loud  the toilets were hardly operable  and zenacity did not respond until it was time to check out  Never again 
760754198,I can not say enough about the location and view   Amazing   But it was not a comfortable stay as the beds were just terrible  One of the beds was actually very badly tilted so I slept at a slope   Then the mattress was so poor that it only added more to the slope   Sleeping inverted is not comfortable   The lighting in the bedrooms were also very dark so it made anything a struggle   I would not stay here again  The beds and lighting in the bedrooms really need work 
759335270,Such a beautiful place  Right downtown we could walk to an amazing   floor mall  surrounded by other of millions of stores and restaurants  The rooftop was BEAUTIFUL  Perfect hangout spot  Very nice and clean it was truly a great stay 
760393308,Amazing place  very spacious  Loved the balcony  A few mishaps with the keypad  but theywere quick with fixing it
760683921,Nice place  Thanks guys  overall pleased with my stay   There wasn t any shampoo  the bathroom floor and tub had a lot of hairs on it   Lots of marijuana smell from neighbors even though it s a no smoking building 
770586329,Perfect little apartment
768963166,The unit and building was amazing and sparkling clean and stocked with all of kitchen appliances and utensils that you would ever need  We enjoyed the building amenities and the neighborhood feel  We were a little surprised that the unit had three burned out lightbulbs  which was inconvenient  We brought it to their attention so hopefully it has been addressed since  Overall  we highly recommend staying here 
761586532,Thoroughly loved the room  the view  how it was decorated   really helped me have a great weekend away in a great part of town   Im definitely saving this in a list  favorites  tags  whatever it takes to visit again  Thoroughly loved the room  the view  how it was decorated   really helped me have a great weekend away in a great part of town   Im definitely saving this in a list  favorites  tags  whatever it takes to visit again 
761002115,Unbeatable location  The studio is cozy  quiet  and has all one needs  Communication with the host was good  It was a good stay  If possible  I would suggest to put a slightly bigger table  The description indicated the existence of a work area  but the current table is very small  making it hard to use it as a work surface 
759914469,Really wonderful place to stay  Very  very clean and cute  Walking distance to many great bars and restaurants  I will say the couch that can supposedly sleep one person is loveseat and pretty worn in  I m      and could not have slept on it  My main issue overall was with check in  the code they give you to get into the building does not work at all  I had to be let in by a tenant of the building  Once you re in  you do get a key fob and don t have to worry about that anymore  though  You also have no key and have to type a    digit code into your door every time you open the apartment  There is a lot of free street parking around the building  I never had any issues finding a spot  They also have a gorgeous hot tub and pool area  we didn t get a chance to try it because crappy weather but we looked and it appeared very clean and well taken care of   Definitely would stay here again if the check in process is updated  Hi there  I really enjoyed staying at this Airbnb  overall it was a wonderful experience  except with check in  If I had not been let in the building by a person who lives in the building  I would have never got in  And I never got a reply when I sent a message about it  Definitely would recommend updating the directions 
770600686,We had a perfect stay and will come back  Great stay 
760693717,Perfect location  Safe and great restautants in walking distance  perfect location to reach out  safe and great restaurants in walking distance
762242027,This apartment is fantastic  however be sure you have earplugs or are okay with the L noise  it s right by the station which makes it fantastic for getting around town  but loud 
759159480,Location location and location this was Convenient for my stay  The host was amazing quick check in  Apartment clean and the area is safe  Thank you for your Hospitality  The apartment was and this location is convenient 
518164759472205929,Excellent location for shops  restaurants and cafe bakery opposite  Accommodation very good  Heating system very effective  Kitchen excellent  Beds comfortable and clean  Three sets of stairs to climb  Many thanks  Comfortable  Air freshener a bit over powerful on arrival and rug in living room needed a clean  Kitchen excellent  bed clean and comfortable  location ideal  Outer door lock not working  Heating system excellent  Bathroom very good  Fridge excellent 
770610770,Very quiet place  Pretty view of the St  Louis arch out our windows  Great location to nearby attractions   very Accommodating  Clean and bed   pillows were very comfy  Great having a quiet place to relax   bed was very comfy  Nice   clean    nice view of the Arch 
765104349,Overall  this is a functional place to stay if youre not fussy about cleanliness  Its far from luxurious  but has a pretty good view from the living room   The host is prompt and clear with communication  The check in and check out was slick and easy All amenities were provided as listed and functioned  The location is ideal and this ideal location is where most of the value lies in this accommodation  The photos of the interior make the apartment look nicer than reality  however  if youre in town to get out and about the city  then this may be a good fit  Hi   Thank you for the accommodations  I appreciated the clear communication  quick response to my parking question  and ease of check in and check out  The location and view was nice   I ranked on the lower end for aspects of the stay that were about the overall state of the apartment  The floors are sticky  there was a very strong odor of smoke and other foul smells  there were hairs found in multiple areas including bedding  couch  and bathroom  a vase of old dead flowers on the couch  dirty windows and walls  Cigarette burns in the furniture and rug  and there were  minimal  fruit flies and water bugs upon arrival  There were stains throughout  lamp shade  comforter  rugs  etc  and bathroom fixtures are heavily rusted  The photos conceal the true state  Therefore  I was disappointed   especially considering the price of this accommodation  Other good aspect  however  TV worked  lights worked  toilet worked  low pressure flush and seeps at base   kitchen functional  AC worked  hairdryer worked  hot running water  and felt safe  Note   Neighbor s  were heard ragefully screaming both in their unit s  and in the hallway  on   occasions  but it never lasted more than    minutes   Best wishes  Melanie Moralez
763091737,Nice and cozy Thank you for the stay it was immaculate
762233424,Perfect location  Great views 
760393766,Great place to stay  I felt right at home here  I couldn t have asked for a better stay   I had a wonderful time  I will most def book in future 
759078639,Though it is a studio  it is very large and has nice windows that make it seem bigger  Great location  There are   bulbs burned out in the track lights The washer was really loud snd had a terrible squeal that went away asthe cycle continued  Loud might be normal but the squeal maybe a slipping belt or other problem  I loved the mattress and the pillows 
760374492,Great place love it
770608875,Nice place to stay  Clean  comfy beds  On Only way to watch tv is through Hulu or Netflix and buffers alot Nice place to stay  very clean  beds comfy   Wi fi is lacking only way to watch tv is through Hulu or Netflix and buffers a lot
407926492818611960,Really enjoyed my staycation retreat   quiet building and area   so many restaurants and shops around too Really enjoyed my staycation retreat   quiet building and area   so many restaurants and shops around too
761033955,Clean  comfortable and a great Ravenswood location near transit and a number of good restaurants 
769940296,We loved this spot  Right by the park in a great neighborhood  The views from the roof are amazing  the front desk staff is really nice and accommodating  and the apartment is very comfortable  Would stay here again 
762830195,Clean place  do not recommend going in the summer because the AC does not do much  just old  
759893840,Building staff was very pleasant and the location was great  Thank you for a nice place to stay  the clean can be executed better  It can be cleaner 
757537425,The space and location were very nice  However we did have some problems with equipment failure  once on check in on getting into the building  When we came into the room we had a window  fall out and break  because the sash was broken  totally not our fault  To make it worse they sent us a bill for the broken window  The place and location were very nice  As you know we had a problem checking in  And worse the sash of a window fell out when we simply opened it a few inches  That was a drag but it was upsetting to get billed for it when it was absolutely not our fault  If anything you should at least apologize for this failure to properly maintain this feature of the property 
768409931,Place was nice  clean  safe and good location  We just had a problem with the parking card that wasn t fixed by the time we left Place was really nice  The only thing I did not like was that the white card for the parking lot was not working  and I wrote you several times to let you know and didn t fix it 
761041233,My husband and I stayed here for a week while I was recovering from a medical procedure  The location and proximity to the hospital and restaurants was ideal  and we were spoiled by having a Whole Foods across the street  The keyless entry made checking in and out flawless  Everything was great  The only suggestion I have is to provide a sheet pan for cooking  Everything else needed to cook a meal was provided except this item  Overall  it was a great apartment and amazing location 
770083134,Exactly as advertised
405891644285470630,This was our worst Airbnb experience we have ever had  Upon arrival to the apartment  it was apparent that this had not been clean whatsoever  beyond setting some clean towels out on the bed  There was mold in the toilet bowl and shower  Every surface was hairy  dusty  and or dirty   There was dirty linen in the closet  Although we appreciated that the host immediately responded to us with an offer to  retouch these spots   we had to demand that it happen immediately  not the next morning  Unfortunately  even after that was done  it was still unacceptable and disgusting  It was not in line with what the pictures in the listing or description depicted at all  This consumed an entire day of our trip   involving extensive communication with the host and ultimately Airbnb   and we ended up relocating to a hotel for the remainder of our stay in Lincoln Park 
489104248064977990,Not clean  Host was nonresponsive about many issues  including lack of water  heat and laundry 
765053746,Great stay 
764961472,Great location  great place  super clean  has everything you need for a perfect stay in Chicago
769100837,Getting into the building was difficult due to the inaccurate codes we were given and the TV was left on by whomever was there last  which made it concerning that we were entering an already occupied apartment   Never saw the inside  we cancelled our stay  since I was traveling with small children and felt uncomfortable  Staff has been fairly communicative and helpful with a refund  Though it has been    business days and I still have yet to receive the full portion that  Also  it was inconvenient if you re traveling with a lot of luggage  there s several stairs you need to walk up in order to get to the entrance of the building  I was appreciative of the attentiveness of the staff once we had decided we weren t staying there related to the difficulties we had getting into the building due to the inaccurate codes and concerns that we were entering an already occupied apartment  since we heard voices on the other side of the door  I was also appreciative of the assurances of the full refund  However  it has now been more than    business days since I was guaranteed this from Zencity and I still have yet to receive it   I have only received         when I was told I would be getting back         total  I would really appreciate some follow up related to this issue  Thank you 
757092032,A very clean and cute place to stay  Had everything that you need and in great location with lots of restaurants and shops 
765950807,Great place
763433414,Great area
761070416,Overall great stay Maintenance was a disturbance early in the morning and the trash run daily was noisy
769344598,Wouldn t stay in this unit until issues are addressed  Air did not work good   Not very clean  Air did not work good  Stayed    to     I let y all know and noting done about it  Seemed hotter at night when trying to sleep but couldnt  sleep well because too hot  Bed didn t get fixed in a timely matter in one of the rooms  Also I had to fix the shower head myself  Unit wasn t very clean either  I should be given money back for all the inconvenience had to go through  If you look in emails I mentioned these issues  I wouldn t stay again and wouldn t recommend anyone to stay in this unit until issues are fixed  I was very disappointed  Specially when we are in the area working already hot from a days work and come home to a warm apartment   
450672496221041807,The unit was not clean upon arrival  Dust was everywhere  along with a few dead bugs  AC was blasting at an uncomfortably low temperature  I asked if we could have the code to turn it up but customer service did not answer  We all woke up feeling like we had a slight cold because of the AC dust  The blinds were broken  Random marks on the a lot of the walls  The coffee table top was broken  Overall  the space look better in the photos than it does in person  I would look for another location in Wicker Park because it is a great area to stay in 
529734767742582220,Great stay  Location was great for moving about  bldg is fun and the Combine had some fantastic pizza  Clean  comfortable  great communication  all in all   this KC gem  Loved our stay  Location was great  fun building  Combine was fantastic pizza  Only two issues  bathroom sink was slow to drain and the dryer makes a crazy noise  was going to dry our towels   Other than that we loved it all 
764305201,This stay had an amazing view  was close to everything we needed  clean and accurate to what was described        would stay again 
763397702,Great value for the price  Awesome location and view  Would definitely recommend to experience downtown  Thanks for the experience  enjoyed it 
760365792,It was sooo nice  wewill book again  We had a great time and were very comfortable  the whole time  Thank you for putting my fears at ease and communicating so clearly about check in  The only improvementIwould make on the place is that it could ve been cleaner in the carpeted areas  either the vacuum isn t proficient or it wasn t vacuumEd  there were also mysterious stains on the comforter
762216490,Great location  great ambience  Would definitely recommend  Had a great time  my apologies about the noise complaint  Would definitely come back 
759295646,This place is definitelyrecommended  Easy parking  great location and super nice  Youll be glad stayed here  Thanks for letting us stay here  It was a pretty fantastic stay at your place 
767865542,Fantastic location   Easy walking spot   It was safe   Along the light rail which was great    The unit itself was clean  bright and large   Basic dishes and cutlery are available   If you are a coffee drinker  know there is only a French  press available  but    across the street is a great coffee shop  steps from the main door   If you are driving into Kansas City  make sure you arrange parking and understand where you will be parking    We would stay again  The location is perfect   It was a very nice apartment and we enjoyed our stay    Few things that I would make note of  and that is that we could not access the deck  the key pad would not allow us to access   I would take that off if you cannot access   The microwave was not working   The fan would come on  but the appliance itself was not working   We made do without it  not a problem     The bedroom off of the living room  the headboard is loose and continually hits the wall if you roll over or even slightly move in the bed   The main carpet in the living room was not vacuumed    These are all small things that would not deter us from staying again     The only big issue was parking   That did prove to be a headache  but I am sure that it can be worked out   We had to constantly call to be let out or in  even with the key card on the car   Parking   blocks away was not an option for us 
767405614,My stay at Zencity was good  I had a good time there with my friends  Easy check in and check out  towels were provided and the kitchen had lots of plates and glassware  Overall good but the only thing I ll say and I wasn t a big fan of is the fact that it wasn t as clean as I wished it would be 
763374052,beautiful place  great rates  excellent view  cozy quiet  comfortable  poor clean job in some areas  had to rewash some of the dishes and there were hairs in the tub and bathroom floor  not alot but definitely not ours  otherwise amazing experience  beautiful place  would love to stay again 
763093503,Perfect location to see my favorite city  The place was as described  My only complaint is the cleanliness  There were bugs in the shower 
762829543,This flat was excellent  perfect location and adjacent to the Belmont Metro station  Although you can enjoy the city vibes of the metro outside your window  the apartment was quite soundproof      points  Safe building  great location  super clean  easy entry   check in  Would highly recommend 
770030673,We had a great weekend   Lots of space and great views of downtown    Perfect location just a few blocks to the arch one way and union station the other  Building is very secure and it s nice to have parking in a garage  Thank you   Thank you for allowing us to stay  It s a beautiful place and we had a great time    A few small suggestions  that may not be needed  but I noticed  so thought I would share    Supply a coffee maker or key rig in addition to coffee press  More seating in the family room    some info in St  Louis in the room  a couple of hooks in the bathroom  hook up water ice maker for the refrigerator   Thanks again 
761770051,Great spot in the cityand a wonderful place to stay for the weekend  The place was beautiful  We had a slight issue getting in as the keys were for the back door  but overall the place was wonderful 
761604725,Great location with awesome views  You can t go wrong with this gem  Location is great   Setup was perfect   Thank you    Floors were not clean and do yourself a huge favor and get rid of the rug in the living area   It s NASTY   Not only does it shed  it wasn t clean    Lastly  buy a regular vacuum cleaner   I was willing to clean the floors but the vacuum provided was pretty much  not a vacuum   It was terrible   Also  provide a regular ironing board   You have plenty of room for one   Traveling business people would appreciate it I promise    Again  many thanks   I would love to stay here again with these slight improvements 
764901723,Great place to stay and close to all Wicker Park   Bucktown have to offer  Would recommend  Was a great place to stay and close to everything we wanted to be near

762808879,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Zencity  the space has a dreamy atmosphere complete with a lovely view and a perfect location for seeing all St  Louis  Thank you so much again  Your place was clean  beautiful  and absolutely perfect for our visit in St Louis
760417600,Location is phenomenal   Access to the place was very easy and the place was big  The apartment is very old and needs some TLC in many areas  The floors turned our feet black just from walking around  and the blankets in the common area felt a little grimy  The beds were nice and the sheets felt great  Location was amazing    I would say the value and location were awesome  but some tlc should go into the place like deep clean the rugs  furniture  and floors  Overall we were pleased  The bottoms of our feet were black  and it just needs a big deep clean 
762370120,Super charming  The listing and pictures do not show how charming this apartment is  Every room has exposed brick and large windows  The beds were very comfortable and I felt the apartment was clean   it passed the clean floor sock test    I felt attention was paid to the small details  My family and I loved this place 
762349921,Great location and the place is as advertised  I would definitely recommended it for short weekend getaways  Thank you for letting us stay in your apartment  The location was excellent and we enjoyed ourselves very much 
761717733,Sencillamente la peor experiencia he tenido  Uno de los ba os sin agua  Todos bebimos usar el ba o que est  dentro de la otra habitaci n  En lugar de mandar a alguien a componer el asunto el anfitri n me solicitaba videos y fotos del ba o  Al d a siguiente ducha no se pod a cerrar  y solo agua fr a sal a  Imposible usar el segundo ba o  Los d as siguientes fueron fin de semana y nadie respond a los mensajes  ni pasaron a componer la fuga de agua  Sal  en domingo y a n era imposible cerrar la ducha  Ha sido la peor experiencia de hospedaje que he tenido 
760736941,Nice apartment and perfect location  Everything that we wanted to do in St  Louis was less about a   min drive  There is a washer and dryer in the apartment that was really a nice perk to the stay  My only main feedback would be that there was no TV in the bedroom  Water bottles in the fridge or soda cans would have also made the stay feel extra special 
767301230,Great location and clean just the weekend getaway I had in mind nice view
770044438,Check in was delayed due an issue accessing it  Took about     mins but was promptly resolved when they were able to  There was some miscommunication with a maintenance man and the company so we    females staying by ourselves and in town for continuing education  were woken up at       with a man in our bathroom without any notification prior  The man and company were very apologetic but it didn t make us feel comfortable to stay another night or make up for the lost sleep 
770037200,Great place to stay  My husband and I stayed for the weekend and thought the location was great  Easy access to to all parts of the city  The apartment was super  clean  and very modern in its design   Checking in was a breeze and the lobby staff was very helpful  Parking wasnt included  however there was a parking garage a few steps away  We will definitely be back 
770771621,Best value downtown highly recommend
767232784,clean and convenient
769033510,Perfect little place in an amazing location  Your review process is way too long
770769415,Nice spot
759592121,Pros      The pictures were accurate      The house was clean and the bed linens were very comfortable    Cons     Check in is a HASSLE  I was very frustrated trying to check in  Clear instructions are not given and the security guard is not always at the front desk      There is a Decibel reader in the apartment  We received    automated text messages saying we were being too loud and I also received a phone call from an actual person saying that the decibel meter was reading to loud  We had four people in the room who talk loud  we had  a normal indoor speaker to play music  Hello   this is my follow up message to the conversation   with Adalisa  about the lack of clear instructions on how to access the   th floor    I was given instructions to  use the key card to access the building door and access the elevators by the security desk        There are three entrances to this building  There is an entrance that can be accessed through the garage  Since the guest get the key from the garage it would be beneficial for the guest to be made aware that there is an entrance in the garage      There are    elevators in the lobby and all of them are  by the security desk   Now   the two elevators that can access the   th floor are  the closest to the security desk   The elevators  are labeled with a sign  that says  elevators to the Sky on Main  and two arrows pointing at each elevator  In order to call the elevator   the guest must place the key card on the black key reader outside of the elevator  While in the elevator  the guest must touch the Key Card to a scanner  then the guest will be able to press the button for the   th floor    The instructions given were vague and led to a lengthy and frustrating check in procedure 
770786474,Lovely place
767460207,Great view and overall was a great experience  There was an old towel left in the shower  Also  there was dog hair on the floor in the bedroom  Lastly  the plates were wet in the cabinet  Overall  I enjoyed my stay and it was great experience  The view was amazing and I would stay again with just a couple clean hiccups  Thank you all so much 
761631225,Very useful and practical place near great amenities and restaurants  Bathtub is very slippery Wouldhave been nice to have coffee or tea available
760819644,This place is not clean  not remodeled  No central air  no washer and dryer  The laundry room is DISGUSTING and everything was broken  Look at the hepa filters and vents    I DIDN T HAVE HOT WATER FOR TWO DAYS EITHER Do better
767389578,This is a great spot  Perfect location  I highly recommend it 
760169413,We chose this location for the parks and restaurants  There is fantastic food within walking distance and    min drive  This is a city apartment with city noise  construction begins at  am outside the bedroom window  Thankfully it doesnt last long each day  Window units provide a c  The front desk is staffed      and very helpful during check in  There is a parking garage at the corner but we had luck each day with street parking  It was very nice having a whole apartment for our stay  The bed was unexpectedly low to the ground and the plastic mattress was hot and uncomfortable  Not all airbnb provide the bare minimum for bath towels  washcloths and hangers  but thats what we got with this one   My clothes stayed wrinkled in a suitcase since I couldnt hang them all up  Im not normally a complainer  but its dollars difference to make a stay much more pleasant 
770801682,They did try to charge me for random things that I felt was not appropriate  but came to a peaceful resolution 
768995071,Nice  large unit with great decor  Good access to downtown  Hey  the parking situation was really a big deal and not being able to use the microwave was also a problem  Neither got resolved and I had to do some pretty ridiculous workarounds to get parking and they cost me money 
766222625,great place great location  and definitely keeps in touch with you
763372622,Not too bad of a place considerinthe location  would definitely recommend it for a first time trip if you re nervous
761082751,unconditionally recommend  theyre a giant company and can be a bit hard to get ahold of  but the space is clean and luxurious  and they use local folks to do the clean  if you dont mind a lil corporatism then I wholly recommend them  painless and great  great stay  I unconditionally recommend it    I found it difficult to get ahold of you via chat  which was frustrating  and your keypad management caused access problems once  I also noticed my neighbors having similar issues  I dont want that to overshadow how fantastic my stay was  great place  great location 
770777347,Great stay  Clean and convenient location  Parking not included  but plenty of options close 
760706233,Amazing place  Has everything you will need  Close to the plaza 
464504970189484755,I am torn on this place  The unit is wonderful and the location superb  The management company here  however  is nonexistent  During our week stay I messaged them about a sewage smell in the unit  Luckily it passed after a few hours  The team never bothered to even check in on us  I would give them a   on communication if I could    The parking pass also does not work  I saw other reviews complaining about this  I dont think they really care 
770085272,nice location  cool apt  nice place to walk  after they finally gave us a parkingpass it was pretty good    Kathy was reallly nice and solved the problem of our door lock not working  the apt was nice  we liked it lovely location 
761539571,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay   This apartment was great for our short stay in St  Louis for our daughters graduation from Wash U   The location right on the edge of Forest Park was delightful   The Central West End area was also great for finding restaurants and just for walking around   Building security and amenities were lovely   I would stay again   The unit itself did cause a couple of minor annoyances   I should note these did NOT significantly impact our stay but I mention them here for others awareness   There are very loud window AC units that are disruptive if you are not used to them  which my husband and I are not    The window AC units also prevent the curtains from being drawn all the way   In the bedroom  this is frustrating because of the bright lights that are on all night at the hospital building next door   There is also no fan in the bathroom  which gets incredibly steamy when somebody takes a shower   so much so that it is pretty overwhelming just trying to breathe in there   For anybody used to a drip coffee maker and a fast brew  just be aware that the coffee maker provided is a small French press  We enjoyed our stay   many thanks for the easy check in and check out process and for the wonderful location of this unit   It would be great if you would consider blinds instead of  or in addition to  curtains   The really bright light coming from the hospital next door kept us up at night and you cant close the curtains and still have the AC running   It was really hot when we were there and so we really needed to have the AC on 
386153998016326795,Nice place to stay Thanks for letting us stay at your place   we loved our stay  The fan in the first room was not working though 
762248552,This location was great for me but the parking is terrible  The lot is reserved for residents who pay for the spaces so you have to find parking typically off street and be sure to follow signs so your vehicle isn t towed which can be a bit stressful  There s a restaurant one the  st floor of the bldg which is cool I guess but really doesn t help make the parking situation any better  My key fob access wasn t accepted for some strange reason but I contacted them and they called back   assisted me in a timely manner  My room wasn t as clean as it should have been  I addressed this   received a follow up call in which the cleaners were suppose to come do a touch up and correct some things but they never showed so I had to call back   cancel that after waiting a few hours so I could move forward with my day  The people who live in the bldg are sweet  everyone I encountered was so nice   helpful  The bed was super comfy  I was a bit disappointed about some things especially since someone I know who s used them multiple times before stated how good they are but all in all it was an ok stay   I would give them another try when traveling  You may want to consider having a back up clean service or possibly replacing the one you have  I addressed my concerns  they were noted   the cleaners were suppose to show within   mins of my conversation with Marty on       The cleaners never showed to touch up the place   after placing my day on hold   waiting a few hours I had to call Marty back to cancel them so that I could move forward with my day 
761557789,Great location 
768652647,This apartment is very bright  spacious and clean  The A C worked great  and kept us cool on some very hot days  There is a fully equipped kitchen  fast WIFi  SmartTv  and the most comfortable bed I ve ever experienced in an Airbnb  There are a couple of close places for food  Close drive to all the major attractions downtown  Easy garage parking  The carpeting is a little tired  But other than that  amazing value for the money  We really loved it  Thanks so much for a lovely stay 
762238780,Amazing place for value supernice neighborhood anyone coming in towm for the baseball games and need a theee bedroomthis place is it everythingwas perfect Perfect not to far from city center nice  bedroom everything wasperfect
762221177,Quiet property in a great location by Forrest Park  Hospitality was wonderful and  they were very accommodating to a very short list of requests  Late check out was not an issue nor was trying to find a place suitable for our English Shepherd  I would highly recommend this property and look forward to staying again in the future  The hospitality we received during our stay was stellar  The lack of private parking wasn t an issue and we were easily able to find a spot for the car  The complimentary dog treats at the desk were just an added bonus and the pup loved them  Thank you for your kindness and hospitality 
465129563225319340,This was a fun  clean and convenient place to stay  Very nice location from downtown as well as a few blocks away was a grocery store  coffee shop and a nice park area to walk in or let your kids play at the playground  We also enjoyed the rooftop hot tubs and view of downtown  We would stay here again  We really enjoyed the location of your place as well as the overall place  We did notice a few things while we stayed  the dishwasher leaks and the garbage disposal didn t work  It could use a fresh paint job and a good baseboard clean  Lastly it did rain while we stayed at your place and the ceiling was dripping water above the rug area in front of the T V   Hopefully this will help you know what s going on with your place  Thank you   It was a nice stay 
386211449884183261,Great place to stay looking forward to booking again Great place to stay looking forward to booking again   
386143161320305147,The place was in the perfect location and beautiful  The only issue we had was the cleanliness  The couch had crumbs on it and was dirty and the floors were very sticky and unswept when we arrived  The cleanliness of the place was sub par at best  The couch had crumbs on it the floors were sticky and unswept 
386136667435173348,Awesome area Surrounding area of the square is an awesome place easily within walking distance of several restaurants and bars
765921576,Ok
761698815,Great brand new building with amazing amenities  Walking distance to lots of stuff  very clean  Would recommend and stay again
543449498509554429,Apartment was very clean and was in a nice location  Had a lot of cool restaurants within walking distance  Would not mind staying here again
386149309797388988,Great stay  the neighborhood is very nice to walk in  the people in the building were very helpful  and the metro is a short walk away 
540586570868448669,The apartment has everything you need  Zencity  did something out of the ordinary and agreed to help pack up the rest of my stuff to FedEx back to me since I left early with some of my belongings there  However  I am really disappointed that I did not receive some really valuable items sent back to me  I was very clear with all the items I had left in the apartment and I received everything else  but two things    it s again disappointing that they did not follow through on what was agreed upon  I am still grateful that I got most of my stuff back though  The apartment is really nice  FYI  it s on a busy street during the daytime  but you don t hear any noise in the apartment  I had some items not delivered back to me such as my Red Light box as well as some brand new makeup I bought at Sephora  I am really disappointed that I did not receive all my belongings back to me  It s interesting that I received all my other items except for those two expensive things 
767305139,Just a block from a bakery for morning coffee 
761713174,Honestly a great stay  The place was cute and clean and exactly what we needed  we had a very nice time in St  Louis    Zencity was also very responsive  We would definitely stay here again  Honestly a great stay  The place was cute and clean and exactly what we needed  we had a very nice time in St  Louis    You guys were also very responsive  My only suggestion would be to refill the detergent pods so the laundry can be used  Thank you for letting us stay at your gorgeous apartment 
478933882814588848,This is a wonderful home with tons of character   The two bedrooms were spacious and comfortable  while the downstairs was roomy and wonderfully decorated   Slawik is very responsive and helpful   I would will definitely stay here again  Thank you very much for hosting my daughter and I   Although it was a short visit  we really enjoyed the time in your lovely home 
762576747,Clean  affordable  and comfortable  Check in and check out were a breeze  Parking was good  too  You have to stop on the street to go and get the fob to open the gate  but after that  close and convenient  Very nice  Only ONE issue  The box spring was so squeaky it was a distraction  The bed could use a new box spring  Also  the Roku didn t work at all  The TV wouldn t connect to the wifi  Everything else would phones  computers but the TV refused  That was weird 
769901436,Couldn t have asked for a better place to stay   Quiet and clean building just steps from The Plaza  my wife and I had an incredible time and would definitely book again  Had a wonderful stay and an amazing weekend   One thing we did note and perhaps it was glanced over in the listing  the shower was a little tricky   In the future  maybe just leave a note with check in instructions 
769000697,Very spacious place  Great value and location  Will def stay again with Zencity 
761660240,Check in took    minutes keys not available as indicated   Apartment was not worth the amount charged  Check in took    minutes   Concrete floors looked cheap  Neighbors complained about noise was using hair dryer at       am  Next night neighbor came in at      with lots of noise 
542091736187266337,Our first disappointment with a vacation rental  I really hope you address the safety issues with the electrical and gas in this unit  We tried several times to reach out  leaving a phone number  before receiving a    minute window to respond with no verbal acknowledgement of our concerns 
767283676,It was a nice stay until I was accused of smoking in the apartment     hours after I left the apartment 
767265596,Great place to stay  Loved the location  a lot of places to walk to like food and coffee shops near by  Just a heads up the walls do not connect to the ceiling  Also it can be loud at night with windows by the street  Other than that loved the apartment  Thank you for this stay  The roof top access was a big selling point though and the roof top access wasn t what it was meant to be  Maybe rephrase adding that to the comments in this 
762554868,Great location in downtown Saint Louis  Easy access to Busch Stadium  Enterprise Center  the Arch and Riverfront  Great restaurants and bars in every direction  Thank you  our stay was great  The location was perfect 
761749793,Nice unit  comfortable bed  easy check in  and helpful front desk people  If you want to be in the central west end  you can walk everywhere from this unit  A map of parking possibilities near the unit might help  Other than the parking  the unit was great  Very clean with a comfortable bed   We were happy 
770146874,Perfect location close to all the action  T doorman every day was extremely helpful and friendly  Helped me get checked in and was helpful during our entire say  Close to Central West End  And lots of dining and other activities  Easy to catch an Uber anywhere in the city  This apartment is older and while it s decorated in a modern style probably keep that in mind  no central air that I could find just a window unit  So it was a tad hot at night  I did stay on some of the muggiest days in June  But I wasn t aware that I d only have a window unit to keep cool  Could use a few more common amenities  There was only a French press for coffee  And nothing really to boil water in  I didn t feel comfortable microwaving their glassware   But other than that I had a really nice stay  Worth the money I know you don t necessarily have control over the hallway  But when I arrived there was random trash directly in front of the apartment door  I assumed maybe the clean team would make sure that the entryway into the apartment looked a little more presentable  I had to kick a broken cassette tape some giant hairballs and some other random trash out of the way just to get inside  Other than that our stay was pleasant 
762593212,I can t say that I was at all impressed with this stay for a handful of reasons   The location is undesirable  the area feeling unsafe and sketchy and smelling bad  The neighbors are extremely loud  dogs barking  people yelling and stomping in the halls  loitering outside  we literally saw a man and woman aggressively shoving each other and verbally fighting in the street outside of the building our first night  This was at all hours of the day and night   The apartment itself was not that clean or well kept  it was dingy  there were blinds broken  bed was uncomfortable  space was small  wires from the WiFi router were messy covering the floor next to the right side of the bed where I slept to a point where I couldn t step there without stepping on wires  The only great thing about that apartment was coming into the air conditioning that worked very well after a hot day out   On top of all of that the parking situation is a nightmare  No clear instructions and super hard to find  had to figure it out ourselves and when we reached out to Zencity for help the response was not timely  You re given one spot far away in a parking garage with a parking pass  but the pass that was given to us had the incorrect number on it  so when we went to park someone else was in the spot we were supposed to be in  When finally gotten back to I was told to just park in another place that the former pass supposedly covered with a different number  but the whole time I was afraid of being towed  I told them of that fear and got no response back until my check out time when they asked me to leave a good review and didn t even address my last message   All that being said  the few things that were decent were  close driving distance to everything  when I did get a response they were kind  my car didn t end up getting towed  and nothing bad happened to me   It served its purpose  but honestly this would not be a stay for me again  Not my first  second  or even third choice 
762579139,Great place for   person or a couple  Great location as its near the Power and Light District and the River Market area 
470962802611420868,The trip was good  the area was decent  but not having access to the thermostat  and it being an issue the   days we were there with it being    degrees in the apartment and no outcome  the likeliness of us coming to this site again is slim to none The stay was decent  the area was alright  but there was an issue with being able to use the thermostat  and due to acclimation preferences  we were a little unhappy  We understand that the thermostats are eco  but it was a simple code to unlock it   it became the whole   days that we were there that our apartment was stuck between      
768929680,Nice property  good location   Basement apartment  but still had security and vaulted ceilings  Nice place   Downstairs has an odor  like sewer gases   Not terrible  just noticeable 
766233217,Excellent location  Helpful door staff on site  Comfortable bed  Would stay there again  Enjoyed our stay  Couch had some stains but otherwise everything very good 
762557813,I have nothing but good things to say  The place was clean  comfy  and in a great location  Host had great communication as well    We had a great stay  thank you so much   
765067717,This Airbnb was in a fun and accessible neighborhood for us  However  the apartment is directly above some late night bars  so it s rather loud and rambunctious at night  and we had to cut through the crowd and line to enter the apartment  Definitely recommend bringing ear plugs 
769986336,This is in a wonderful area of downtown  safe  between P L and The Market  Host was wonderful  and the room was a delight 
762319721,This is a studio run by a company  It is set up like a hotel   it is not what I consider and actual air bnb  response times are nonexistent  There is no one to actually contact since this is a company taking up housing from others to use it as vacation rentals  I would never stay at another Zencity place  This was not a home away from home as I couldnt have guests  The entrance light doesnt work  the outlet by the window in the living room doesnt work  and all the lights are really dim  The place smelled like Chinese food the whole time  Cant open windows for fresh air  no extra blankets for chillin on the couch   I had difficulty getting to to building  seeing as how the instructions dont say to push send or talk after speaking the number code  I tried calling multiple times and received no answer other than a message    minutes later  You are trying to run a hotel business from out of state   This is not the point of air bnb  Im better off staying at an actual hotel with concierge service  I dont feel I got the value I was looking for  I feel pretty ripped off 
547791601306788682,Great location 
770550813,Pros    Generally comfortable apartment    Great air conditioning  in      heat     Great location   Beds really comfortable   Nice thick towels   Clean kitchenware   Easy check in and combo key pads  Cons    The building is old and has a bit of an old building smell    Carpet is a worn and old  maybe where the smell comes from   but vacuumed and clean   Thin Venetian blinds in bedrooms  so lots of sunlight when the sun comes up  great for early risers  less great if you want to sleep in    Can hear upstairs neighbors moving around and sounds outside the building  but if you re used to that sort of thing  nothing out of the ordinary
384758103156876143,Cleanly and in a great location 
765949303,Great place to stay  hard to find the gym though lol 
764374045,Overall  this was a really great Airbnb  The space is well designed and pretty spacious for an apartment  The only concern we had with this Airbnb was that the keypad was broken during our stay  so we had to use a single physical key   Besides that  the amenities offered  location  and service from the front desk really made for an enjoyable experience in this Airbnb and I would highly recommend this place to anybody else  Overall  this Airbnb was really great  My only issue was that the keypad was broken when we were there  This made it difficult to share the space with another person since one person would need to be at home to open the door for the other person 
761783387,location was perfect  central to everything and safe  parking was nice but tight and low we have a full size truck    The biggest issue was the ac broke and we couldnt get it fixed  The location was clean  but a but sterile like a hotel  loved being in the middle of the city though  the ac was broken while we visited  we tried to communicate  this  but still didnt get it fixed during our stay  we were told to open the windows but it was over    degrees outside  the only solution was to leave the front door open  to get ac from the hallway  there were several other small things that needed fixed or repaired 
761779429,What a wonderful property   This apartment is safe  near everything  easily walkable  and very soothing   The property felt bigger than it was described   The information and communication provided was ideal   I felt well informed and prepared and would  and will  recommend this site to my friends  Dear Zencity   Thank you for letting me rent your lovely apartment   It was lovely and I felt very safe and calm there   It was a really rough weekend for my family and I  making your property even more valuable to me   Thank you  Meaghan
761083501,The place was so cute  The bed was comfy and they had a smart TV which was already signed into Netflix under a complimentary guest account We went to a Cardinals baseball game and only had to drive about    minutes from the stadium to get to the Airbnb  Would stay here again 
762558322,It was a great experience  comfortable  and secure stay  i wish there was a full body mirror or others mirrors than the one in the restroom  the listing said shampoo and shower stuff was provided but it wasnt  i was disappointed that the TV only had local channels and wouldve brought my Roku if i had known  I had trouble with some of the outlets  But overall it was a great comfortable stay  Thank you 
386153213718903638,nice  walkable area  good price  clean room with laundry Front door was blocked due to some major construction on the building  would have been nice to know this up front
762856261,Highly recommend
762839331,Location isn t the best  the surrounding blocks are mostly empty building  However  the parking accommodations and building amenities are a really good value 
762829987,Very accurate  good location  Wasn t there for long  but overall accommodation was great 
762828606,Great stay 
762814978,Great stay  Communication was great 
762216178,Great place  We loved staying there for the weekend 
763068667,You need app todo wash that was awful
763066390,Very nice place  Convenient location 
484075598652163341,This studio space worked out perfectly  The host has put a good effort into making the space enjoyable and clean  It is just across the crosswalk from several eateries and conveniently located to many St  Louis destinations  I was there for a last minute professional trip  but this space would be perfect for a couple just in for the weekend for a fun getaway  Thanks for getting this space confirmed for me in a matter of hours  I did not hear back from another Airbnb hold reservation  so it put my mind at ease to know I had something else  The studio space worked out perfectly  And I can see you put a good effort into making it a pleasant space 
763776726,It s a convenient location in a nice building  The couch and bed were both very comfortable 
767807649,Great location within walking distance to power and light and river market  Very clean  private  secure  Also great view of the city   Beds were a bit firm and walls a bit thin  but average like most hotels  We had no major complaints  we re very pleased with our stay and would come again  The location  cleanliness  and communication was great  We were very pleased    Was not able to get the voice check in box to work  another resident said she struggled as well and let us in  We were concerned about how we would ve gotten in if she hadn t come by  Key fob for room worked great   Key code for room was a little long  had to look it up every time  and could pose a safety risk if someone was trying to enter their room quickly    Otherwise  we had great stay and would love to be back 
767779518,Not bad but poor emergency plans
763071932,Great place to stay  Quiet  clean  spacious  and amenities were perfect for a quick overnight in KC 
386898370037880752,I enjoyed my stay  There was a little hair in the shower and on the blanket in the living room  but it was very clean over all

765115789,Great location  quick walk to bars restaurants and the lake 
763057038,I was unable to access the unit because the key code that was given to me didn t work the keypad was missing numbers   symbols so I couldn t gain access   The front deskman was very rude and invasive and even followed me up to the unit and quizzed me for several minutes  treating me as if i didnt belong   I will give Zen City this  they did answer me promptly after I had to call the number though   i was not giving a resolution and was left without accommodations for the night   I was told I get a call back within    minutes after waiting an hour after speaking I was told I d get a call back within    minutes after waiting an hour after speaking to someone from the hosts office and I didn t hear back anything until     the next morning   mind you I was depending on that stay for my accommodations so I guess they didn t care whether I had a place to stay or not since I didn t hear from them throughout the night  I m not sure who dropped the ball when the ball was dropped or how the ball was dropped but it was dropped so someone needs to contact me ASAP to get this rectified or do I need to call Airbnb directly I don t know please advise
767423302,Great location   Some elements were a little cheaper more dated than the listing would make you think   Specifically the mattresses  toilets  and showers   Other than the occasional ambulance  it was quiet  felt safe and friendly  had restaurants nearby   Felt like pretty solid value 
764444432,Nice place and location  Clean and comfy beds   Make sure you enjoy some time on the roof top  Pricing does not match the quality of the stay  Real close but not quite  Consider putting art on the walls  aside from the two small offset pieces  or even having simple refreshments in the fridge  Otherwise the value isn t there 
763379837,The staff is absolutely amazing and the apartment was great  Parking was a bit of a challenge  however  I had a fabulous time  Thank you so much your staff is so wonderful and the apartment was absolutely beautiful   thank you 
763052220,Excellent  Excellent problem solving as well 
762546229,Bed was was hard  Only complaint  Others may like hard beds  but we did not  Everything else was perfect  Bed was hard  my only complaint  and that s only an opinion   everyone has one  Others may like it  but my lady and I did not  Everything else is perfect 
763389194,Stayed here while my wife was in the nearby hospital  It was a great place for this purpose  as it s about the closest apartment complex to the medical campus  BJC    Only issue I had was the check in process   They had a mechanism to get into the building if the doorman was not present  but it didn t work  tried    times    Someone let us in  and they the key box said it was not connected to the network and had to be reset  We called Zencity from two phones and got put on hold   Even selecting the  talk to someone immediately  option  we got a message to call back later  This was a very stressful    minutes   Finally the key box worked again  after not working after the reset    We got calls back from Zencity as we got in the elevator  so they did follow up with us quickly and it did all work out  This feedback was provided to them and they said they would test the access    The apartment was fine with a small kitchen and a comfortable bed  In window air conditioner kept the room pleasant  No coffee maker so I brought my own  apt had a bean grinder and a French press   I was initially concerned about parking  but there were many garages for the hospital nearby so was not a problem at all  There was even a ChargePoint charging station in the Leclade garage around the corner  so I was able to charge my electric vehicle there   Great location  nice clean apartment  and aside from a few minutes of terror getting in  was a great stay overall  Already provided feedback on checking and dead bathroom outlet 
763422224,This place was awesome  A full flat with all amenities you will ever need  The entire process of checking in and out was really easy and well communicated  parking on premises was a great selling point since this is in downtown KC  The building and all the apartments are newly renovated  I remember this being abandoned when I lived in KC a few years ago  but it was great to see what has been done to the place  Nothing to add  you guys are great 
762227415,Great place to stay  Awesome view and great area  Perfect for weekend getaway  Loved this place  Great view and perfect for weekend getaway  Awesome location 
529755028436539385,Great location  Easy check in  Listing is accurate representation Really strong weed smell from neighboring unit during second night   like so strong we were worried our clothing from styling would absorb the smell  Otherwise  great 
765661108,I enjoyed my stay here very much  The place was clean and inviting  Thank you I would come back anytime  The bath tub was kind of gross  but everything else was amazingly clean and simple 
763484375,Excellent stay    Enjoyed my stay thanks communication was great
763390714,Great place and service 
763477644,Amazing downtown apartment  Very clean and modern
763401268,awesome place clean quite all around great place to stay licked it alot
547024481672615696,INFESTED WITH RATS Rat infestation  unsafe conditions 
766301750,The bedrooms are huge and the beds are fantastic  Cooking for more than  people is a little tricky  There are no big pots and only a few plates  It would be great to have some more kitchen amenities like hot pads  larger pot  more plates 
387172622741459593,This booking was a terrible experience but I ll try to be as objective as possible  The pros are that the location is perfect  The place was quiet and mostly clean except that the clean person missed some hair in the tub and a dirty wash cloth that fell from the shower curtain when I closed it    When we arrived the intercom system would not allow us access to the building  A resident finally came by and let us in  A fob was supposed to be provided to allow access to and from the building but there was no fob  Similar issues have been reported by other guests that were staying when we were  My first customer service response was a text message that told me to read the check in instructions  Then  someone called me and condescendingly just read the check in instructions to me  Several hours later someone responded that there was an extra fob In a lock box in the foyer  The lock box was empty  I was stuck there the first night because I wouldn t have been able to come and go    I had to leave the next day and left another message reminding them I didn t have access to the building  When I returned I had to wait several hours outside until another building resident was kind enough to let me in  When I finally got in the place looked like it had been completely torn apart  All the linens and towels were gone  the bed frame was apart  the head board was off the wall the mattress was standing up against the wall  I called zen city about this and they assured me no one had been inside the apartment  After sending pics  I was informed that someone came to spray pesticides for some unknown reason   I had to fight them to get a refund at all and it left having to book something twice the price    I contacted air bnb and they said they couldn t help because it was more than    hours since the check in time  I m extremely disappointed with zen city and air bnb    I ve learned my lesson about booking spaces with out of state management companies  They just aren t equipped to deal with problems that pop up    If you have any trouble checking in immediately ask for a refund or contact air bnb don t give them the opportunity to waste your time and pass that    hour clock
763476840,Good place to stay Clean good place
770613533,Great stay  Couldn t have asked for a better experience  Great stay  Couldn t have asked for a better experience 
770006289,The location of the apartment is great  close to a park and the museums and many restaurants  and the check in was smooth due the friendly and helpful front desk staff of the apartment building  However the apartment itself is terribly maintained and not ready for guests  On the surface the appliances and furnitures are not new  but the basics things are not working  The handle on the bathroom door was loose and I was locked in the bathroom  It took my wife more than an hour and considerable ingenuity to free me  The faucet handle for shower was also very loose and wobbly  Before renting it out  the owners do need to do their homework and properly maintain the apartment  The way the apartment is falling apart makes the apartment hard to recommend  I was locked in the bathroom due to a malfuctioning door handle  and the faucet handle for shower is loose and wobbly  Please improve the apartment before renting it out 
770725608,I would not recommend this place 
762299301,A beautiful loft  Very confusing check in   very confusing elevators   super helpful Staff  Checking in   Was an absoluteNIGHTMARE 
520978951170606465,Great location   Nice house   It was perfect for our trip 
762801706,Building location is fantastic in downtown next to Soldiers Memorial and Public Library  The building appeared secure with entry exit using an access card and gated parking  Although finding the apartment unit was a bit confusing at first  it was otherwise well situated  quiet  and spacious  Would be helpful to have customized check in and check out instructions  I never even received check in instructions  so I didnt even know that the apartment unit had a reserved parking space and didnt know where to pick up the key or park the car  Fortunately  the building doorman had the keys building access card and was able to tell me how to get to the unreserved parking spaces and how to access the building   The building access card was also supposed to allow us to enter exit the parking deck  but unfortunately was not functional  The card sensor would beep  but the parking gate arm would not lift to allow us in out  For check out  the automated check out instructions told me to leave the keys building access card in the unit  However  this specific apartment unit used a metal key to lock and unlock the door and does not lock automatically  Also  the building access card is required to exit the building  so is very difficult to leave the keys card in the unit  It was easiest to leave the keys card with the doorman  and also made sense because that is where we picked up these when checkin in  
762875559,Clean and comfortable great location Great placeamazing location Thankyou for having me
761048482,This is a REALLY GREAT apartmen  So fancy  Each bedroom  has its own restroom   The Windows didn t open very much but there was so much light still  Honestly I was stunned Do better

763404466,Awesome Awesome peace of mind  Older building but very safe  Directly across from Whole Foods and great restaurants  
763402066,Good value for money  in a great area  with plenty of restaurants and bars  A little noisy from outside traffic  but a very comfortable apartment The kitchen was not very clean  very few pots and pans to cook a meal  The washing machine and dryer stopped working  which I mentioned to Zencity  asked to check fuse box in kitchen but we couldnt find it  It was very noisy from outside traffic  Otherwise the apartment was comfortable and good value for money 
763132091,Gated  not hard to find parking most of the time  It is good in general for staying couple of nights  Thank you 
387654908939432969,Nice place to stay 
387575792258228066,My stay was the worst experience I ve ever had at a Airbnb or anywhere else  while checking in the female staff member was so kind  I also came across   male slim black and   white male slim staff members whom were the best and gracious  One day coming from work which I m on a traveling contract assignment I entered the building which no one was at the front desk as I walked to the elevator there was a going white guy standing there so I assumed he was waiting for the elevator to come down so I stood behind him to get on also  A big black guy walked down the hallway towards us and asked may I help you his demeanor wasn t the best usually I m greeted with Hi      How are you  have a nice day from other front desk people  I shook my head no and showed him my key dot which gives anyone who rents the apartment access in the building and elevators  he responded what room are you in  I said  m I stay here  then he responded I ve never seen you before  I automatically knew this guy was judging me on my braids  tank top  and jeans not knowing that I m doing pretty good career wise  I whispered under my mask if I was white you wouldn t ask me this  he responded if you have something to say you need to speak up       It took everything in me not to defend myself from this horrible person  I knew I was in a city I knew no one and if he lied and said I was being a hostile black woman I would be on the streets with no where to go especially knowing I took a plane to get here  I did let Zencity know what type of person was representing the apartment building that rent out to others they did respond and apologized and asked was it was employee I said yes and let them know that something definitely needs to be done  after that Zencity didn t respond to that   On the day I checked out which was a day before my actual check out date because it was horrible I m paying for a place there cruel  unkind  and prejudice  yes prejudice there are people out there of the same ethnicity that look at others in a different manner based on their assumptions and believe they are better than them  The day I checked out the black guy at the front desk asked me if I enjoyed my stay I respond yes until the situation happened with the big black guy he apologized and told me knew whom I was referring to  I appreciate his apology even though that apology should ve came from the heavy set guy  I don t believe in spending my money anywhere that causes hurt and shame to others because I was raised completely different to show love  respect and joy no matter the race  and outter appearance of a person  never ever will I come back to these apartments again  My stay was the worst experience I ve ever had  while checking in the staff member was so kind which was a female

770606140,The place was really nice  I will be booking again 
763817773,Exactly as pictured  Thanks for the last minute stay 
763059037,What a great spot  Small but perfect size for the two of us for two nights  Loved the in unit laundry in the midst of a long road trip  Would highly recommend  It would be great to make sure to update to go around the Euclid side of the building to walk through the garden gate rather than the front  Seeing the condemned sign on the front was very confusing and had us very worried 
472467495507566314,DO NOT RENT     Very dirty and in disrepair  Listing shows rooftop  but at check in we were informed that the rooftop was not available to renters  The rooftop was the only reason we rented this apartment  Zencity  the rental company  utterly ignored my complaints about the state of the apartment  Also  location is not   minutes from Wicker  Neighbor s  on floor above got up around   am every morning  there appears to be no insulation between floors  Very unpleasant experience  I am copying here the message I sent you on the day i checked in  I never received a response from you    Oct          Select to open user profile for Elfe Elfe     PM Hello  Im deeply displeased with this rental  The place is filthy and in disrepair  The ensuite bathroom had hair all over the bathroom floor  I clean it   the shower is full of mildew and disgusting  The mattress cover in the en suite bedroom has blood stains on it  The two kitchen rugs  one in front of the bar  the other in the kitchen  are very dirty and old  The pillows in the ensuite bedroom are a joke  Furthermore  your advertisement of this rental is very misleading  It shows the roof top seating and it is the main reason we chose this rental  When I received the check in info  there was confusing language about using the roof top  I was subsequently told that we are not supposed to use the roof top  How could this be  I trust you will be able to fix all of these issues tomorrow         You can reach me at              if you need to discuss  I expect you to have a cleaner here tomorrow morning to do a thorough clean  and I expect a deep discount   I would like to add additional shortcomings problems     The ensuite bedroom  which I used  had a plastic mattress protector and no other mattress cover     The sheets on both beds where old and thin and tired    The kitchen was ill equipped  There was no coffee maker  can be bought for       except a French press which was broken  It was impossible to keep the coffee grounds separated from the coffee    There were two cutting boards in the cabinet  they were absolutely filthy  they even had large food particles sticking to them  I ran them through the d w several times and left them there  Hopefully theyre a little cleaner now    There were no tea spoons  The forks were cheap and of inferior quality    There was just one utility knife    The shades in the ensuite bedroom had numerous slats missing    The shades in the living room could only be partially raised and were crooked and ugly    The two stools at the kitchen bar were so wobbly  we couldnt sit on them    This is a   BR apartment  yet there was just one shabby   seater couch   It looks like this apartment was nice enough when it was first provisioned  but its clear that there has been no upkeep and that the clean crew does an extremely shoddy job  There was a little card saying   This apartment was last clean on            by              There was no info on that card   The apartment is significantly farther than   minutes from Wicker  another incident of false advertising    We paid       night for this very unpleasant experience  Ive never stayed in such a filthy place  and your staff totally ignored my communication  only to send me check out instructions today    I would like you to refund me at least     of the rental fee  I cannot imagine renting another place from Zencity 
770128645,Great location    walkable to everything in the CWE  Check in was super easy  Download the parking app ahead of time  and you are good to go 
763810327,Would only reccomend if you know that this place has the bare minimums but is in a KEY location  Apartment was so dirty  We had issues with the air conditioner which was never fixed  If the apartment was not in a KEY location  I would rate it even worse  All it needs is a deep clean  Communication was sometimes incredible and other times awful  I disliked that I had to speak to a different person each time  
763469307,The location is very nice  The apartment was NO ZEN   the smoke detector battery beeped EVERY NIGHT for  weeks  Finally the battery died  The company stopped answering my emails and calls  and said  don t worry we have our top team working on in    It wasn t complex   I needed a    foot ladder to change the battery   The manager for the building wouldn t answer my requests and airB B actually sent me texts telling me to stop making noise   This was a work assignment at a hospital   I was forced to move the mattress to the floor in the living room   only feet away from the bedroom  but with the kitchen exhaust fan I slept some   The shower has ZERO water pressure  seriously around   inches and warm but not hot   The Only plus was the neighborhood   I give both Zencity and AirB B a big fat F  my simple request was never met   I spent close to          and got a      refund  SHAME on you AirB B  for allowing this company to rip off a nurse at a hospital  Shame on you Zencity for your lies and complete ineptitude     So heads up if you have a problem with your space from the many places this company owns   you will not be helped by them or AirB B   Your response to my Valid and HUGE request was pitiful and completely unnecessary  The simple request to stop a smoke detector from beeping  but I had to wait until the battery actually died in two weeks    I was forced to move the mattress to the floor in the living room    and all you did was give me      off  I should have received   weeks free  The water pressure in the shower was ZERO   I decided your actual offices must be in China or somewhere  as your email responses were grammar wise inaccurate  I give your company a complete F  a FAIL for response and sincerity 
387692373900894003,Great Place
385426635277873480,Fantastic location   The kitchen has everything you need  Stylish  safe  with a very comfortable bed   we really enjoyed our stay  A new shower headwould make it perfect   The existing one doesnt have much flow   thanks for a wonderful stay 
770601881,Our stay here was phenomenal  Instructions were sent for access  It s a walk to get to the elevator for the unit so if you have a lot of luggage you will be traveling to and fro and up flights of steps  The couch can be replaced as it s been worn out from usage  The bedroom could have a TV in it  I didn t like that the lamps all are connected to the switch for the main lights in the living room but the overall unit was amazing  The view was extravagant being on the   st floor  It was spacious and up to date  The layout is odd but it is fitting and enjoyable    The door isn t hard to get in  you just have to be smart enough to know how to use the type of lock door used  You simply need to turn the key and hold the lock while it s unlocked then push the door open  It is set up that way so the unit is always secure in case you forget to lock up after yourself  Like a hotel door just with a key    The parking is horrible  I parked at the library garage which is    every    minutes up to     for the whole day     prepaid for overnight parking and    when you leave out in the morning  It s secure and safe  I parked at the top of the garage so I could monitor my vehicle from the unit    The sink and tub both need some drainage attention as both drains took a minute to drain water    The roof top area looked plain and boring from the unit  Looks like only thing on it was a huge Chess game and tables and chairs  Nothing to brag about or have interest in   I would absolutely recommend this place and will stay again  It s location is nice and you have a city view  I loved my stay and was very comfortable  This is overall a great place  The drains in the bathroom  sink and bathtub  need serviced as it took a minute to drain    I had to find a way to prop both drains open to let out water    The couch needs to be replaced  It s worn out and noticeable    Also maybe a deal can be worked out regarding parking  That is frustrating when you have to look for somewhere to park and then walk blocks if you can t find it  The unit is too nice and in great location to have to deal with that    Overall I loved your unit  I absolutely would stay again and recommend it  It s a really nice place and the city view is phenomenal 
547823676606850823,Beautiful apt   Central to everything  and beds were super comfortable   Very clean   Would stay again for sure  Thank you so much for a wonderful stay here   Beautiful apt 
489095890536974901,wonderful  as described great stay 
764560063,Sorry but  I had a terrible experience here Worst place ever  Never l stay here 
386189057133434982,I was unable to access the apartment so contacted Zencity from the lockbox area   They had a back up key but chose that moment to ask if the apartment had been clean   the person on the phone admitted that they KNEW the clean team had been unable to clean   They did not call to inform me that I would be walking into a place with dirty bed   bath lines  trash in the trash cans and dirty dishes   They suggested I clean and change the dirty bed linens with spares in the apartment   I was told the place would be clean by       the next morning  I booked a hotel for the night   Next day  again  not clean with no answer as to when it would be clean   Then they had the audacity to argue about a full refund as I had to book a hotel due to their inefficiency  Once I notified and spoke with Airbnb  I was refunded but only after   days and countless emails   Zencity should have contacted me beforehand as they knew the place was dirty     all in all the worst experience with a host  If you know you will not have a clean apartment unit  call the customer in advance   You knew the clean staff was unable to service the apartment   Secondly  if you have a service failure  which you did  for two days in your inability to clean the unit  dont make your  very upset customer have to spend time asking for a refund   I only received a positive result after contacting Airbnb to tell them about the abysmal service    Such a poor experience with Zencity   Never again 
763396465,My brother and I stayed here for   nights in the middle of the week during a road trip  I had to work remotely for parts of the day during the week  The neighborhood and apartment building were both extremely quiet  One upstairs neighbor was singing all day one day that my brother found irritating but I could barely hear it from my side of the apartment  Wifi was great  had no connections issues  All streaming apps were available  already downloaded  and signed into on the tv  Not sure if it s the host s accounts or previous guests just forgot to sign out but either way  it was a nice perk  Getting into the building   checking in was easy and smooth   We had no issues  complaints or questions the entire stay so we had no reason to reach out to the host  Overall  a great stay and would stay here again 
763080535,Great place highly recommend Thanks for allowing me to book with you
385512292701165112,Great location  great space  Terrific for a long term stay  Great communication  Will stay again  Thank you so much   this allowed some semblance of normal in trying times
767507021,Great location in the city and very clean  The L is right next door and you cant even hear it  It also has convenient spots for cars to stop if you need to be picked up dropped off  Also great brunch spots close by  We really enjoyed staying at this location  Thank you 
763386194,Loved the room and the location was perfect 
764870609,Great location just blocks from the plaza  smooth check in process  comfortable beds  hosts are responsive if you have questions 
387605131912377520,Had a very bad experience with check in   I had to wait for a long standing n street in sun during a hot and humid day just because the building entrance code provided to me was wrong   after check in there were some issues of cleaniness  Bathroom was dirty  there were some stains on sofas and carpet  wifi signal are very weak in bedroom and wifi was slow   I liked the location of central west end so this place is located at a very nice spot 
385518577496299567,Space is large and location is great   VERY disappointed with the following    CONSTANT harassment over noise level when we were not breaking any of the rules  number of occupants  quiet time    Misrepresentation of capacity  listed as   but there are only beds for     Beds are old and super uncomfortable   Place was not thoroughly clean  sticky floors  visibly dirty bathrooms    Kitchen is barely stocked with the basics for cooking Location was great and the space was large and open  as advertised   VERY disappointed with the following    CONSTANT harassment over noise level when we were not breaking any of the rules  number of occupants  quiet time    Misrepresentation of capacity   you list it as   but there are only beds for     Beds are old and super uncomfortable   Place was not thoroughly clean  sticky floors  visibly dirty bathrooms    Kitchen is barely stocked with the basics for cooking
764852133,Great stay  Location is right near CWE and the park 
770161369,Good location for walking to other parts of the city and very easy weekday parking  Overall a fine stay but the intercom box to enter the building was torn off of the wall  We were only able to initially get in with other guests residents  That might have just happened but worth mentioning for any near future guests  Also  the neighbors directly next to us were incredibly loud from     am      am  yelling   Im not sure if thats also an Airbnb or if theyre residents but for myself and traveling with a toddler  who somehow didnt wake up   it made for a really rough night 
386140407330515978,Would highly recommend  Loves your place    Thank you so much for letting us use the AC 
386139556333021646,Place looks like photos but not clean  Bring clean supplies  Place also had an odor that would not go away after I clean  Place needs to be clean properly before allowing someone to stay there  There is an odor  Carpet and flooring where not clean  Counter tops  and appliances not clean  No supplies were available and I feel I was charged to much  There was not a day I wanted to stay just to relax as this was a trip for me to relax  I only slept because  was uncomfortable  Bed should be higher  Everything is so small and close to the floor  I recommend having toilet paper and paper towels for guest to use as part of their stay  That was a lot of money to hand over for a place that was not comfortable 
470246587586602413,Great location  super clean  and wonderful rooftop bar make this place terrific  Super clean place and the rooftop is a huge asset  Coffee and better sheets would have capped it off for us 
387679608557470922,Everything was as is and the stay was great 
764845429,We were very disappointed in our stay at this residence  When we arrived  the floors were so dirty and there were visible clumps of dirt and hair balls all over  The bottom of my daughters feet were black after walking on the floors for    minutes  The couch is covered in stains and has springs popping through the cushions  There was hair from the previous renter in the bath tub  The windows are paper thin and we could hear every noise on the street outside all night long  We barely slept for the   days we were there  I would not recommend this place to anyone  We were very disappointed in our stay at this residence  When we arrived  the floors were so dirty and there were visible clumps of dirt and hair balls all over  The couch is covered in stains and has springs popping through the cushions  The soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken  The temperature in the unit was    degrees when we arrived and we were freezing cold  There was hair from the previous renter in the bath tub  It was a terrible stay and we were very unhappy that we spent almost      to stay here for   days 
763123864,Great place just make sure you can get in the building Was unable to get in building for   hrs had towait till someonewas going in
387578296214817257,Great stay  Very spacious  your privacy is superb   I will recommend anyone to use it  you will enjoy it
386234472545048477,Great place great location nice big apartment i just wish it was windows in the bedroom   you could control the ac it won t let you go over or under a certain temperature
768335773,Great value and location  thanks for another great stay 
765120458,Great spot in the CWE  Great for exploring Forest Park  Only criticism was the lack of AC  It was mostly fine as this weekend was relatively mild but I know how hot St  Louis can get  Might not want to have that listed as an amenity on Airbnb  Apart from that  the decoration was incredible as well as the location 
765046567,Loved it  Great stay 
763785893,great energy in building  beautiful  space and area will definitely visit again great energy in building  beautiful  space and area will definitely visit again 
386936713942253420,Great stay  Parking wasnt too hard but make sure to plan your parking expense  The neighborhood was wonderful and I met some neighbors on the rooftop who were amazing peeps  Id recommend this place and the location  I will be coming back   Thank you so much  I had a good time  Only one complaint   Im not putting it on the review  There was hair in the personal spaces  Between the sheets  in the towels  and stuck in the tub drain  The drain of the tub was not draining water out and wasnt clean so I clean it  And Im guessing who ever clean up wasnt wearing a hair net   But all in all Great  I will come again and bring my sisters   
764876825,Lovely apt  simple but tastefully decorated   Complete amenities in the apt to make for for a nice stay   Concierge  name is Teelah  made checkin very easy and was helpful throughout our stay   Minor issue initially with WiFi but response from Zencity was in less than a day and the issue resolved quickly   Nice  central location would stay again when back in St Louis  Lovely apartment  simple but yet tasteful decor   All the basic needs for the stay were there   Concierge who checked us in was fantastic   made it very easy and he was very nice throughout our stay his name was Teela  not sure of the spelling    There are a few issues in the apt you should be aware of     There is an apparent  strong pet odor in the living area from previous renters   I probably should have asked if pets were allowed because I am allergic to dogs and cats    Couch also had strong odor of pet on it and was a bit dirty  It could really use a clean   We had to put a sheet over it to sit on it      Shower liner was covered with mildew  very dirty   I had to purchase another to replace it because we could not take a shower with such a dirty shower liner in it     On the last night of our stay the bathroom sink started to spontaneously filling up with dirty water  around    midnight   The property mgt company sent a plumber in the middle of the night to fix it   Appears the plumber had been to apt next door with same issue earlier that day   According to plumber all of it is caused by apt upstairs because plumbing is central and old  therefore one issue affected multiple apts   Plumber could not fix  because other tenants were not answering their door when he knocked  so we were unable to use bathroom during the last night and following morning 
388302200853264555,Great place to stay  Everything we needed was there  Loved the simplicity of the place  Thank you for having us  Thank you for having us  We greatly appreciate it 
506556750863824056,Fantastic stay  Super nice location in the city with lots to walk to and see  The place was very clean  spacious and had a great view  Thank you so much for the stay  The place was great and had an amazing location in the city 
386898107385997642,I absolutely love staying with Zencity  Every time I visit St  Louis it HAS to be Zencity for me  Great quality  Always clean  Check in and check out is incredibly easy  I love staying with you guys  The only thing I d recommend  definitely not needed  is have more shampoo and body wash available 
764822840,This place was a great experience  It was very clean and secure  At first I was a bit concerned about parking since there was no assigned spot included  but street parking was readily available and affordable The place was amazing  I d recommend replacing the couch if possible
387643820293354891,location is great and the apartment was clean  toilet seat was a little loose but it wasnt anything that hindered anything 
387650653801046307,I loved this stay  the host was great on communication  detailed check in instructions  and a very great area  would love to stay again soon
763415596,Great little apartment in Kansas City  We felt like locals when we stayed here 
478778018226511399,Sehr sch ne und top ausgestattete Ferienwohnung in sehr sch ner Lage mitten in der Natur in direkter Nachbarschaft des Boddens  Wir w rden jederzeit wieder dort  bernachten  Vielen Dank  wir hatten eine sch ne Zeit bei euch  es hat an nichts gefehlt  au er vielleicht etwas Sonnenschein   
388362533499747098,Not the best Airbnb   Experienced a c issues during the heat advisory during the past couple of days and wouldn t fix the issue
764904847,The check in was difficult  was not easy to communicate with 
387597117409995106,This place was an amazing stay 
765016910,Safe historic building in Hyde Park  Thank you very much  I needed a place to stay that was safe in Hyde Park and this place fit the bill   I was on the second floor with view of the alley and adjoining roof   A window broke during a wind storm and the maintenance crew fixed it in a timely manner and they were vary polite  I was not able to access the entertainment center and when I contacted the company many times and did not get the help I needed  It did not work during my stay  I would have liked to have some one come to fix the TV set so it worked  I would like to rent again in the area   I would hope to rent again in the area and have some way of requesting a better view next time  thank you
488378862019561090,Apartment was fine for the money  Can t lie  parking was very tough  There was an event next door that took up all of it and I basically had to circle for about    minutes before someone finally left   Decent food in the area  There were a few dive bars that worked out great in the area as well  Ask the property to fix the intercom downstairs  I tried it   times and it never worked and half of the screen was hanging off the box  I understand it  but please allow you guest to control their own air  Even with that window I was sweating 
387620570985885386,When reading this review  please note we are Airbnb hosts   As Airbnb hosts we were very dissatisfied with the cleanliness of the unit during a pandemic  the unit is in a beautiful building in a safe location however we didnt feel safe because of how dirty the unit was  there is a wall mounted air conditioning filter in the living room  it was so disgustingly dirty that the dirt came out   in from the filter  it doesnt look like its been changed in more than a year  the carpets were disgustingly dirty the tables were stained and looked extremely dirty  we went to go buy our own Clorox wipes just to sanitize the unit  the light in the bathroom did not work  The bed was very comfortable  the linens were clean  however because of the air conditioning filter and the flat white paint the unit looked very dirty because of the amount of dust and grime on the walls and the baseboards    even though we stayed there for   days they only left each one of us one towel and only one washcloth for us to share  there were no bathroom soap amenities    The kitchen was bare bones     This could be a beautiful place to stay if it was clean   maintained properly   The   am sunrise on the lake was most beautiful  From one Airbnb host to another we were very disappointed about the lack of sanitation in your unit during a pandemic   The air conditioning filter was disgusting   It looks like it had not been clean in over a year   The lights didnt work in the bathroom   The carpet was disgustingly dirty   We didnt feel safe to stay there because of germs   We went to buy Clorox wipes to sanitize the unit 
389032495244547176,Clean apartment  excellent location  great value  Thank you   we enjoyed our visit tremendously   Maybe one comfy chair in the living room
387663528859242976,Great place to stay Great place to stay
765453144,I highly enjoyed my extended stay with Zencity  The apartment was exactly what I expected  Only issue was the bedroom window couldn t get open  and the bathroom may have a hard time staying close  only if it s really windy out  but outside of that Zencity was very accommodating with my needs during my stay  I will be booking again the future   Thanks Zencity I highly enjoyed my extended stay with Zencity  The apartment was exactly what I expected  Only issue was the bedroom window couldn t get open  and the bathroom may have a hard time staying close  only if it s really windy out  but outside of that Zencity was very accommodating with my needs during my stay  I will be booking again the future   Thanks Zencity
765451175,Had an issue with the check in code at first  but they gave us a new code when we called them 
389110541905466870,Great place to stay downtown 
767225374,Our stay was great  and everything shown 
764955046,The entire space was awesome  and we loooooved the rooftop  It was clean and roomy and would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable home base on a St  Louis trip  Awesome space 
763088005,Place was Beautiful  Great Great value      Parking was a little  challenging     But I would stay again     Because  the apartment  was wonderful I would have loved to option to pay for a private parking space in the back lot
466683794448811919,Beautiful place quiet relaxing and peaceful  Loved the property it was beautiful just hated the pool wasnt open  Had an issue at check in but it was quickly resolved 
435411209122837490,Was a great apartment set up in an area close to the power and light district  Walkable to river market area too  Building was very secure  Thanks again for hosting us 
764854439,Great location  Clean and comfortable  Be sure to be clear on check process  It was a little tedious  Help line was very helpful  Streamline key box process  Could not access key  Call help line and got help  Took an extra    min to access the apt   Great location  Clean and comfortable  Well appointed with accessories abs kitchen items   AC in living room stopped working 
387614374363750000,Cool location  The apartment looked nice but i really hated the Nats  and the rug sofa have seen better days  Felt icky sitting on them  The shower in the basement sprayed water on the ceiling calling more Nats  Place has potential just needs minor repairs 
766803295,Cat hair everywhere  Allergic reaction and they didn t give me my money back Cat hair everywhere
404360243598489499,Horrible walked in and had water damage on the wall next to fridge  Found a dirty towel behind the bathroom door someone dirt old sock behind the curtains Hello    Also when I entered I saw mold on the wall witch is do to water damage where the paint was coming off the wall  Witch maintenance saw  Also found a dirt towel on the floor behind the door a sock under the curtains in the bedroom you could also tell the blanket was not washed because we found strands of hair in the bed  then the toilet backed up  So the stains on the towels just wash with bleach and soap and it comes right out maybe a lil bit of baking soda  Gets  the stains right out  So for you to complain about towels being stained is ridiculous and you need to do some maintenance to your apartment before renting 
389088195317349417,Great place and location to stay 
387682498107878308,If you are looking for location then this is your place    if you are looking for cleanliness  especially during COVID  then I would avoid this location at all costs   I had a few other smaller issues with regards to initial communication and at check in the door code was not correct  but in comparison to the place being so dirty that I had to clean myself those were trivial   Upon arrival when I walked in I noticed crumbs on the floors and the counters   as I was on the phone with someone from ZenCity because I was unable to get into the unit initially I mentioned that I was seeing some dirty issues   their comment was something like    we only vacuum every few weeks so maybe this unit is due for a vacuum  I was floored   I then proceeded to walk around only to find more things that were just plain dirty   I ended up clean the unit myself   the paper towel that I used to wipe the small section of the kitchen floor initially with just water was BLACK   After looking for some clean supplies I came upon a broom that had about   inches of hair and dirt hanging off of it  a mop and bucket of which the mop was so dirty  it was originally white and now was brownish  and the bucket containing dirt  along with a floor duster that had not been washed in what appeared to be ever      There was also a half an inch of dust under the bed and console etc   I called and sent pictures and they offered to send the people back to clean  of which I declined given what I had already seen   instead I asked for a refund of some sort  especially on the clean fee   which I thought was extremely fair   They declined any refund other than half of the clean fee and gave me an hour extra for a late check out for the hassle that I had checking in  this I did not request    I have never written a bad review of an AirBnB  but this experience definitely warrants people knowing what they are in for  especially if you are looking for a clean space to lay your head There were several issues that I had with this property   one was the lack of communication initially    they wrong code was provided on check in and I was not able to get into the unit and had to call    the place was FILTHY and I had to clean myself and was only refunded half of the clean fee   this is my mind was unacceptable
764935512,As much as I try to write positive reviews  I am unable to do so for this listing  Although this is a great location and the building overall is nice  there were three major negative factors   The whole apartment smelled of cigarettes  I recognize this is mostly out of control of the host since it is due to bad behavior of a previous visitor  but this ruined our stay   The check in process did not work  Thankfully another Airbnb guest in the building recognized our situation having gone through it a few days before  if they weren t there  I m not sure we would have been able to get into the apartment  There was no washer   dryer in the unit despite that being in the listing  There is a hook up for one in the massive walk in closet but none was present
765958372,Loved the place  Great location  Secure building  Very comfortable space  Would definitely stay again  Thank you for the early check in 
768086682,Prime location   super clean and comfortable  Thank you for a wonderful stay   It made for a memorable vacation  
765126981,Pretty solid place  The negatives were that one of the bedroom doors didn t lock  and you have to come down to the door to let people in which gets annlying especially when there s only one key  Rest was good though and the place was clean and spacious An option for multiple keys would be helpful And you should be allowed to buzz guests in or tell doorman to let someone in
765086542,This was just the perfect location and value for my Fiance and I  to re visit and explore St Louis  What a GREAT City  The apt had everything we needed  And what a FANTASTIC location  Whole foods is   blocks away as well as many restaurants  Just a short walk away are restaurants and very cool neighborhoods  We dined at the BBQ Saloon   times  I enjoyed learning how to make a morning cup of coffee with the French Press provided  The lobby staff was extremely nice and helpful  Parking was not a problem for us  We were always able to park our car on the street right next to the building  The building and apt are somewhat  older  but properly maintained  Weve been back in Florida for a week now  and Im still missing the neighborhoods  urban charm and energy of  Old St Louie   We really had everything we needed  Took us a little while to get oriented  being older folks    and      to the apt and the building  but were perfectly happy and comfortable once we figured things out  Heating and Cooling were a little difficult to manage  but for the most part were very comfortable  Bathroom and kitchen gave us what we needed  We were getting more and more comfortable by the day and I think we both were sad to leave  Its an older building with a younger transient tenancy  so visitors like us  need to go with the flow and enjoy the adventure  The French Press coffee maker came in very handy 
767879949,Awesome stay we enjoyed the location  the apartment was extremely clean  beds were comfortable  and showers were great  Nice place for a family  girls guys trip  or even a couples trip  I will be staying here every time I come to St  Louis  Thank you  we truly enjoyed the space  Happy customer here 
766264957,We had a great time in the heart of downtown St  Louis  Just a few blocks from where we went out to dinner  View was amazing overlooking the park  university  and the arch  Thank you for letting us stay 
382509789964240265,The location is great  close to shops  restaurants and parks  but the place could use a little deeper clean  Thank you 
766254097,Could not have asked for anything more  Excellent  I ha k you I had a wonderful time and everything was fabulous 
766672198,Cozy studio apartment in a great location  Thanks for letting us use your space for my birthday getaway  We will definitely be back 
765458608,This was one of the best Airbnbs we ve stayed at  the place was gorgeous and really nice to have a dedicated parking spot  It was right in Lafayette Square neighborhood so we were walking distance from all the historical homes  great restaurants and a lovely park  It was minutes away from downtown too  One of the best Airbnbs we ve stayed at  Thanks for hosting us 
765729446,This is a cute  small place with a lot of cool history  The only downside we experienced was the check in process that did not go smoothly  Once you make it to your room  there is a key fob that allows you to come   go from the building easily but initial check in requires an intercom box that was difficult and never worked  Beside that  it s a great AirBnB and convenient to drive  walk  uber  bike  or scooter to lots of fun places  As of June          the pool was still closed due to covid 
405032010257870023,Overall  I d definitely recommend this place to others  There were a few things that the owners might consider fixing  listed at the end   but it was a very good stay in a convenient location in Chicago    First  the highlights   COMMUNICATION   CHECK IN   Instructions were sent little under    hours before check in time  Coded entry was simple and straightforward    CLEANLINESS   PRESENTATION    The place was very clean    The photos were a good representation   For some reason the couch is pushed into diagonal slant in the photos  In reality  it was squared up normally to face a wall mounted tv    LOCATION   The location was also great  It s a few blocks away from the  Chicago  station on the Blue Line  which is just a couple of train stops from the downtown loop  and restaurants and nightlife in the Wicker Park   East Village area     There s a large CVS store nearby for all daily needs    For breakfast   we d also recommend the Windy City Cafe a few blocks away  Delicious   FACILITIES   We couldn t take full advantage because of rainy weather but we did pop our heads out to see the rooftop  It seemed like a nice bonus feature    Otherwise  there are a few details that future guests  might take into consideration but didn t affect our stay all too much   Hopefully  the host will fix these items so the stay can be perfect    GUEST BATHROOM  right of entry    The hot water became scalding hot after water in the bathroom ran for a while  Water that ran very warm before a shower became dangerously hot after  Guests with children might want to be vigilant    At the time of our visit  the bathtub faucet leaked continuously at a good trickle  It was just slightly audible if you closed the door  I was mostly concerned about the wasted water   MASTER BEDROOM   At the time of visit  slats were missing from the master bedroom s vertical blinds that face the apartment building across the street  If privacy is a concern to a guest  that may be a consideration   LIVING ROOM   The door leading to the balcony didn t close very well  We need to play with it and force it a bit to shut and lock it   AMENITIES  The ad for the space was inaccurate for a few items    There was no dedicated workspace    There were no hangers    No oil  salt and pepper for cooking    Hope this is helpful  Thanks for the good stay  My friend and I enjoyed our visit and would recommend this accommodation to others  There are a few things that might improve the experience for future guests   GUEST BATHROOM  right of entry    The hot water became scalding hot after water in the bathroom ran for a while  Water that ran very warm before a shower became dangerously hot after  Guests with children might want to be vigilant    At the time of our visit  the bathtub faucet leaked continuously at a good trickle  It was just slightly audible if you closed the door  I was mostly concerned about the wasted water   MASTER BEDROOM   At the time of visit  slats were missing from the master bedroom s vertical blinds that face the apartment building across the street  If privacy is a concern to a guest  that may be a consideration   LIVING ROOM   The door leading to the balcony didn t close very well  We need to play with it and force it a bit to shut and lock it   AMENITIES  The ad for the space was inaccurate for a few items    There was no dedicated workspace    There were no hangers    No oil  salt and pepper for cooking 
522486170101007437,I am very disappointed that the Zencity management does NOT maintain their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   Its deceptive selling  and its personally disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my second encounter with a Zencity apartment and you continue to disappoint your guests   The lack of proactive communication and response is aggravating and is a major business downside    As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together   I am very disappointed that the Zencity management does NOT maintain their rental properties on the Airbnb platform  From previous guests hair on the floor and shower walls to stains on carpet  pillows  and sheets   ZenCity is not following CDC   Airbnbs guidelines covid    clean protocols   Its deceptive selling  and its personally disgusting to come into a filthy unit  and that was my second encounter with a Zencity apartment and you continue to disappoint your guests   The lack of proactive communication and response is aggravating and is a major business downside    As a property management company  your management team should be FIRED and as an Airbnb provider  your registration should be pulled until your company gets its act together  
766619961,Amazing people to check us in and feel very welcome  Helped us with restaurants nearby and the best spots to go
766603455,Worth the money Awesome stay
767239156,Cool place
401417146375677198,Great location  However only one bedroom has AC which makes it a bit uncomfortable on summer nights  The AC in the living room is also underpowered   Need to make sure that basics like shampoo and soap are available in the apartment  Also the statement about AC is not fully accurate  One of the bedrooms does not have AC  It is a bit of a misrepresentation  The main door knob is difficult to use 
766312187,Good location Good location
389775834836094707,Quick stay great place  Helps if you know the city to navigate parking 
770610945,Location was very convenient to the WashU Medical campus and Forest Park   It was cheaper than the hotels in the area  but there rug clearly hadn t been vacuumed prior to my stay  just in the living room  rest of the floor is linoleum tile  and I noticed a little black mold where the countertop of the sink was coming detached from the vanity beneath   I mentioned this to the host and hopefully they ll correct it   Otherwise the space was very nice and I hate leaving a negative review but I know mold can really be a health issue for some folks so if that is true for you I would recommend verifying with the host that they have indeed addressed it  Prior to booking I hadn t reviewed this place as thoroughly as I usually do because I ve had such great Airbnb experiences   This one seems to be a company managing multiple places and it was lacking in some of the little things other Airbnb places I ve stayed at have  like coffee tea basic spices   Also unless you check with the host about whether they ve added a some sort of water filter to the unit perhaps bring your own  the tap water tastes terrible  Hi there  I already made these comments in a message  but will repeat here as I really hope you address them for future guests  The only complaint I have is cleanliness   The rug clearly had not been vacuumed prior to my stay   The area around the lamp next to the couch also wasn t very clean  which is less of an issue since that s not an area I would walk in  but I would recommend a thoroughly sweep mop of that area and under the couch   Also the counter top of the sink is partially detached and there is some black mold underneath  which can be a health issue for some people   I would also recommend a water filter in the suite as the tap water tastes pretty bad   Coffee tea would be a nice touch   Otherwise it is a nice space   Thank you 
429671830136582394,Nice apartment and great value
400010400197507865,Had a terrible experience after my friends and I could not enter the property since the door was jammed  I tried calling the host s immediate assistance helpline several times but got no response  After several hours and waiting outside the bnb at   am in the night  I received a call back for the assistance I requested  A maintenance person needed to be sent out to check the door lock  Since it was already really late in the night and we had plans for the following day  we were forced to take a hotel room for  x the price it would normally cost  The next day I had to follow up with the host again to find out if the door had been fixed and they seemed clueless about my issue  We were finally able to get in the next day and complete the rest of our reservation  I am still working on getting my refund for the money I paid for the hotel rooms and uber   Location      Good neighborhood  clean spaces  Property       Shower curtains have black mold Bathroom door does not have a lock
765988993,Quietness and peace Thanks for allowing me to stay and get away
767783585,Unfortunately  I had a comedy of errors during my    day stay at Zencity s   bdrm apartment on Milwaukee in May       The net net    the apartment is not set up for a    day stay  and here is feedback   THINGS THAT CAN NOT BE HELPED  The apartment is on a very noisy street with the very loud BLUE LINE train going by every X minutes  This made it very difficult to sleep and work from the apartment  The building is old   there are smelly pipes  old HVAC  and   flights of steep stairs to walk up   THINGS THAT CAN BE HELPED  Zencity s communication and air tight cancellation policy  esp for long term stays  The company has multiple people assigned to the account that do not communicate with each other  Most of the time  issues were handled in a timely manner  eg code on door to apartment did not work  but it would be resolved in a matter of minutes   But many times  communication just totally broke down  WiFi went out for   days during my stay  I had to tether from mobile   Each person I spoke to on Airbnb app just requested I re boot the router  When I frustratingly demanded they call the internet provided and stop asking to complete the same task  and when someone from internet company finally came to the building  they discovered the internet cable to apartment had been cut  and the provider was able to restore WIFI  but it took   days   When I requested some dirty and mismatched kitchen appliances be replaced  I only had   mismatched forks for a    day stay  and one was a cocktail fork   it was never addressed  When I requested a mid stay clean refresh  the clean team never came and then arrived TWICE at random times that were not agreed upon  These miscommunications came from the Zencity office  The AC and heating is complete out of wack  too cold during cold nights  too cold during hot nights  and I sadly ended up with a sinus infection  The apartment is top floor   th floor   of an old building  and that was not communicated until approximately    hours before   when I was already packed with   large bags and on my way to Chicago  It was extremely difficult to plan to get bags up stairs by myself and into the flat upon arrival  In early days of stay  I think the first day   I asked ZENCITY to find me another place to stay because I knew I could not stay there for    days with all the noise from train and street traffic on Milwaukee  though they manage multiple apartments in Chicago  they never got back to me about that inquiry   THINGS THAT ARE GOOD  The apartment is cool and in a fun central location  and could be fun for a weekend stay if noise is no issue  eg you don t need much sleep or to work on ZOOM   Hello Zencity Please contact me directly to have a debrief of the many things that went wrong during my stay   all which were disclosed and in some cases not addressed during my    day stay
764934218,Nice location  the host was very responsive  the check in process is super convenient  and the bed is super comfy  I had a great stay  Just a few issues I ran into that if it was resolved wouldve made the experience even better     the blinds in the bedroom by the balcony is broken  the outlet in the bathroom in the bedroom doesnt work  and the hair dryer barely works 
763799804,Great place to stay  Would definitely stay there again  The place was very clean and I was very pleased  Only thing I would suggest is a bathroom rug for when you come out of the shower 
766289347,Good Place
762265549,Good spot overall  Great spot overall  However  there was some medical drug paraphernalia  which I did have communication about at check in  left behind  Thanks for being on top of that issue 
422457536453236126,We had a very nice four night stay   The apartment is accommodating and as described   Plenty of room for our family of five   The best part of the stay was the location  literally a    minute  or less  to all the attractions on our list   Definitely a great stay  Loved the place
403628693083576361,Zen city is the worst  Don recommend them  Filthy apartments and horrible customer service Apartments are super dirty  I stay with you guys allot and your clean ladies which are employed by you do a half fast job that is not worth what you charge for clean fees  Also there is no pool please don t mislead people
765951922,Amazing place to stay loved it Amazing place to stay loved it only slight problem was the remote for TV  Had slight issues with using it 
765987816,We had a miserable check in process because the so called  welcome kit  had apparently been misplaced   Zincity did not have a substitute  kit  available nor did they send an agent with a second kit   They just kept telling us that the  kit  was at the front desk  but never offered any real help   Fortunately  the  kit    the card key to exterior doors   a remote to operate the garage gate   was finally found by the doorman   But Zincity should have been responsible   actively helped us   The apartment lacked in many key ways   In the living room  there was only a small sofa with dirty pillows on it   a single pole lamp in the corner for lighting   No comfortable sitting chair   The living room rug was stained   The kitchen  also dimly lit  lacked so much as a  tea towel  potholder or even a salt shaker   the ice trays had been filled   The beds were comfortable but likely were doubles  not queens as advertised   While the apartment was spacious  it was very sterile  not a welcoming place to stay  esp  in comparison to the many other Airbnbs weve stayed in over the years    Hopefully  Zincity will respond to cure these defects in its service and property  Check in was the worst process weve encountered in all our years of using Airbnb   The  welcome kit  wasnt at the front desk as it was supposed to be    Multiple emails that I sent to Zincity met with the same response  the  welcome kit  was left at the front desk   But it plainly was missing   the responsibility for this failure   for correcting it was on Zincity   Instead  calls by me to Zencity  Customer Service  were unanswered by a human    I did receive one phone call from a Santa Barbara  CA exchange but there was nothing from an identified  Zincity office or agent     There was no offer by a Zincity agent rep to come with a second  kit     The  welcome kit  was no more than a card key   remote for access to the building   garage   There should have been a contingency plan   like a spare  welcome kit  when the first  kit  is missing or a Zincity agent should have brought us a second   We   the paying guests   should not have lost   an hour of very stressful time until the  welcome kit  was finally found      Then  the apartment was incredibly sterile   ill equipped    The living room did not have any lights except for a single pole lamp in a corner  and the only seating was a small sofa with two gross  dirty pillows on it   The living room rug was stained and dirty      The dim overhead lighting in the kitchen didn t adequately light that area   There were no tea towels  potholders  not even a salt shaker   Only ice cube trays in the freezer  which were filled   I had to rearrange lightbulbs to better light some areas   There was only one spare lightbulb   three burned out ones   I moved a pole lamp from a bedroom to the living room for more light   Shelves in the the entry hall lacked any books or other decoration   the walls throughout were nearly blank   There were no instructions on trash disposal  check out procedures or even how to gain entry to the garage from the building at the  th floor  the doorman showed this to me   My husband   I make frequent trips to St  Louis   The apartment is spacious   well located for proximity to our sons house   entrances to from I     but well not stay in Zincity properties given our check in experience   the poor service   maintenance of the property itself 
399943559043389600,The place is great  The location feels safe and is right by Division street which has delicious Puerto Rican food  It is an uber ride from everywhere you need to go and had a great view  Good price and was clean and looked exactly like photos  Thank you  Hope to come again next time I visit Chicago 
389105761596893497,A great location within walking distance to good eats  The apartment was clean and comfortable   wish we would have stayed longer  I got a quick response when the TV fell off the wall   I appreciated that because I was a little freaked out  Would definitely stay there again   thanks 
388325368110358058,Honest review here  The place was dirty  It has a weird smell  Found bugs in the bathroom  Carpets were very dirty  Good location but I must say the smell was a big turn off  It felt really dirty just to be there  Decided to leave after an hour of check in and did not go back at all  Hopefully hosts see this  Honest review here  The place was dirty  It has a weird smell  Found bugs in the bathroom  Carpets were very dirty  Good location but I must say the smell was a big turn off  It felt really dirty just to be there  Decided to leave after an hour of check in and did not go back at all  Hopefully hosts see this 
389058100899362908,Bed pretty much was on the floor Great stay only problem I had was the bed was pretty much on the floor other then that it was very comfortable and clean 
388313229135485823,Very convenient for downtown activities   We were able to walk to all the nearby attractions and restaurants   Secure  free parking located just off property and included in the excellent price 
765908176,Nice place within walking distance of Lafayette Park  Clean  Kinda quiet  Bed is nice  Shower is great  Rooftop views are cool to take in at night  Accessible to downtown and other various parts of town  Recommended  Thanks    A nice stay 
766251863,This place is a good value   low price in a great location  But our concerns were pretty big    the step by step instructions for getting in were immediately defunct as the main entrance was blocked by construction that cant have begun very recently   Thus our impression that the management is not around   So we had to find our way in through the back   via a space used to relieve dogs  scatter alcohol containers  smoke etc    and then up non ADA accessible rickety back stairs    Then theres the fellow sleeping in   and likely living in   the lobby  Guess what   the code to get that far has been the same forever  you can tell by the numbers rubbed off the key pad  and non residents seem to have it  He didnt cause any trouble but thats still alarming    The code to the apartment itself seems to change with each guest and the space felt secure and was quiet   once we had calmed down from our original alarm  So it is a place one can stay in if youre willing to take the trade offs    The photos of the place are all legit but manage to convey the place as nicer than it feels upon actual arrival  The renovations are even humorously slap dash  Recent  re glazing  of one bathtub being some goopy painted on substance that someone stepped in while wet and tracked onto the floors  Doorknob missing from bedroom door  etc  These were our experiences and responses as a couple with two children in tow  If Id been in my   s with some  friends in town for fun Id have said it still beats hotels any day  But for us this was a booking we mostly regretted 
389850100385779374,Great location for a university visit  Safe and quiet neighborhood and reasonably priced  Nothing fancy but comfortable beds and basic necessities  We will probably stay there again on our next visit if it is available  A few small things would go a long way  Specifically  soap for the bathroom  besides shampoo and cream rinse   coffee filters  we left some for the next guests   and fix  tighten  the kitchen chairs 
388357039872991448,Zencity provided an excellent experience  Great apartment in a great location in Hyde Park  Apartment was clean and well furnished  Highly recommend  Thanks for a great stay and the allowed   night extension 
387623463634543432,Lovely spot with a view just like the pictures  The record player has Bluetooth allowing you to create a nice ambiance with your own music to the room  Bathroom also has a heat lamp  Prompt and through responses from Zencity  Typically easy to find free street parking in the surrounding area unless coming late at night      pmish   Is on south side of Chicago so be wary of the rush hour traffic if you want to go to central Chicago  Would recommend 
767395883,Bottom line  if I had to pay the same amount to stay at this Airbnb  or another one run by Zencity  I wouldve just stayed at a hotel instead   The price was pretty close to some decent hotels downtown  but I wanted to check out Pilsen  so we went with this place   the pictures looked nice   The root cause of our issues was that the property is run by a conglomerate  who probably isnt local  and probably doesnt care if they get a few bad reviews   The good  location didnt seem unsafe to me  it was in good proximity to restaurants  we only parked   times but we were able to find street spaces within    ft and the unit was reasonably sized   As one reviewer mentioned  the AC unit is somewhat loud but it worked well and it was around    degrees outside all weekend   The bad in order     Bugs   there were tons of gnats or gnat like bugs all over the unit  but particularly in the bathrooms   What was weird was that the number varied throughout the stay   Sometimes it was unbearable  one person wanted to shower in the downstairs bathroom but was too grossed out and ended up showering upstairs    Sometimes it was just an annoyance   Either way  gross     Check in   we followed the check in instructions  but the key in the lock box did not work on any of the doors to get into the building   Messaging was useless  the first guy said hed look into it but never got back to me   Messaged again    minutes later and got a new person and had to explain the whole situation again   Meanwhile  we tried calling and when you follow the appropriate prompts for check in issues  the call just dropped   times   Finally  on the  th attempt  our call went through but was put on hold for    minutes   Once we got somebody on the phone  we were able to run through the other lock boxes to get another building key  which worked   Luckily there was another available key  otherwise Im not sure how long it would have taken us to get into the unit in the    degree weather with all of our luggage     Cleanliness  while it appeared that they followed the Airbnb  enhanced clean  steps  it seemed like they half clean everything else   The floors were dirty  the bathrooms were just ok and the bedrooms were just ok   Certainly nowhere close to spotless  which is the experience I normally have with well run Airbnbs      Wine glasses  there were   of them and   of them were cracked   I wouldve been fine with plastic ones  but not cracked glass ones     Dogs  there was quite a bit of barking from the neighbors dogs   Im a dog person so it didnt bother me that much  but it was frequent enough that I noticed     TV  didnt really use it at all but I couldnt figure out how to control the fire stick with the remote provided   No other TV options available unless you had your own device to connect to a HDMI cable 
767853289,Todo bien Todo bien
764860879,Amazing response times  easy instructions  great view  amazing room  Also very close to virtually everything  Loved it  Thanks so much for a great stay in Chicago  I will definitely seek to use Zencity again when traveling 
389822126590690361,Big space in a great neighborhood   Definitely a professional operation   Just enough furniture and furnishings for a pleasant visit to the city Great spot  but a few items need some attention for your next guest  the alley door to the building isnt locking closed  one of the soap pumps in the bathroom was broken  and the light in the front bedroom  nearest the entry door   kitchen  is constantly strobing 
766239058,Place was great  Had   issues  Code did not work to get in  Took about an hour on the phone before they could get it to work  Listing said there was free street parking  There was not  It was all meter  Chose this place because we had   vehicles and the free parking was important  Eventually got refunded for the paid parking from AirBNB as a courtesy since the listing was not accurate 
765720432,This is my second booking with zencity at this location  Great host great stay  Enjoyed the stay as always 
765419261,The place itself is really nice and cozy  However  the check in process wasn t smooth  The keypad wasn t working properly and it took the host hours to respond  If you really need to stay here download the app Igloohome and ask for the Bluetooth lock since the beginning of your stay  They didn t tell me about this until later of the check in day 
766330007,Great stay for a great price  others stated they had trouble with parking  I never once had any issues  Zencity made it easy to get into the building with no need for a face to face  only downside was the walk to the unit itself  Unit is exactly how the photos show  very well kept  would definitely recommend and would stay again  Thanks again for a great stay thanks again for hosting me  had a great time visiting St Louis  couldnt have asked for a better stay
386955530401417571,Place was nice and exactly as described   For anyone looking for the fitness center  we finally found it on the lower level through a maze of doors heading opposite Main Street  but it was very nice when we finally found it  Checkin was was convoluted and difficult and instructions were not correct  I had to finally call and get new instructions sent  It was also difficult to find the gym   This information should be available without having to ask people all over the building   Thanks 
765928329,Gorgeous apartment and view  Very communicative host  Perfect spot in downtown  can walk to restaurants convenience stores  Would book again 
399230680102683771,This location is great  There s a Whole Foods  a Trader Joe s and a convenience store within short walking distance  It s also a very nice part of Chicago with tons of parks and places to check out    The L train is also very near  and downtown is       minutes  drive away    The apartment was clean  nice and functional  We loved it both for staying in during rainy afternoons and for using as a base station to check out downtown Chicago and the surrounding parks and lakes    Highly recommended  We loved our stay here  As a suggestion  adding that the laundry facilities are located in the basement would be great  As folks from out of the country and the city it was a bit of a hiccup for us  and adding it to check in information or as a follow up message would be super helpful 
765975972,Perfect location and a decent space with very friendly staff at the reception desk  Great view  However  the room smelled like cigarette smoke and made the stay pretty unpleasant  I hope they can figure it out and get rid of it before the next person stays 
764310429,If you book this  make sure you read plenty of the reviews  and ask questions about the entry problems beforehand  First negative experience I have had with an airbnb and it was miserable  The key code that we were provided to get into the building did not work and my wife and I were stranded outside in the middle of the night trying to get a hold of someone from ZenCity with no success  When we finally got an answer from Zencity  the person we talked to was unable to help us  After   hours of trying   we finally ended up booking a hotel room which was overpriced and scarce due to the holiday weekend  The next day we were finally able to reach someone with zencity support who told us that we would be buzzed in when we arrived back to the building   When we arrived back at the building we called zencity to have a manager buzz us in  but they couldnt get ahold of the manager  After a bit a passing resident finally let us in  The unit was a good place to stay once we were finally in  and the location was very nice  but this was a terrible first night experience for us  We are already unhappy that the person we spoke with said we would not be reimbursed for the full expense of the emergency   am hotel option we had to go with  but we were told that at least some of what we paid would be coming back to us for the check in instructions stranding us and this still has not happened  We know this is not our error on the building entry  as there are tons of reviews having the same problem  Please do something to try and make this right  We have made airbnb aware of our issues as well and are waiting to hear back from support 
393406288340601599,Could use some attention to detail in regards to clean in some parts  but otherwise great stay  Front staff was so nice  and check in was a breeze  Didnt have an issue with parking  Tip  Condo is to the right of the elevators right when you step out  Dont follow the wall sign   youll just walk back and forth  I saw this tip in the reviews  but just want to reiterate    Some of the pots pans and plates were still dirty or had food on them  particularly one pan   We re washed anything before we used just to be safe  Bathroom ceiling needs to be redone  Other than that  good stay  Front staff were so nice  and apartment was cute 
397726751047119737,The location couldn t have been more perfect but the apartment wasn t clean very thoroughly  The toilet seat was left dirty along with the silverware  There also isn t a wifi connection so a Xfinity hotspot is provided but doesn t work a majority of the time  Hey you guys   it s really hard for me to write a message like this but there were some things that were just not clean  Under the toilet seat there were still urine stains and the silverware was dusty and there were still crumbs in the drawer  I normally understand some things being dusty but items that are considered essential it s just not okay  I hope that you can pass this feedback on to housekeeping for future reservations   
394152278713185962,Good spot that is within walking distance of a lot of places such as the museum  the beach  food stores  the park  The neighborhood is quiet as well  The building itself looked really nice and the apartment was relatively spacious  Trash was left over from the previous attendants and there is a slight leak from the toilet handle  Besides that  the apartment was exactly like the pictures and description 
766328704,I cancelled my reservation after finding a broken door lock and being forced to wait in a parking garage for an hour after being given a fake parking pass for an occupied parking spot  Also neighbors outside this place fighting on the street did not make it feel safe 
765961454,This place was super nice especially being close to forest park and the zoo  Parking isn t too bad if you don t mind walking a bit to the parking garage down the road  The cons are that there isn t really a whole lot of options around the area to shop or eat  Also don t go North  go South of here if you need or want anything  The shower drain doesn t drain very well at all  so if you have someone needing a shower after you they either have to wait or they have to be in the deep water  We enjoyed our stay a lot though  so we appreciate how nice it all was 
768148166,Very cool place  Kitchen is really lacking so you still have to get take out and coffee in the mornings  But still better then a hotel   
765008426,The place was very nice  clean  comfortable   Convenient if you re needing to stay close to downtown   Some items to note  there s a lot of dogs in the building  there s a couple next to the apartment and they bark loudly all hours   Even late at night so be very aware as they don t let you know that    Also they won t let you use the gym if you re a guest there  only the tenants are allowed  also not mentioned     Other than that  it s very nice and cozy  Place was great  couple things to note and make people aware is  There are lots of pets  dogs in the building and they bark through out the night    Also the gym is not available to guests  
390530586530919773,Thanks Great stat
465138764621823133,Great location  The photos are an accurate depiction of the apartment  I did not find parking was hard to come by  There are metered spots in front of the building and meter free on the side streets  Great location   I would suggest a longer shower curtain as the current one is not large enough to cover all of the shower  Additionally  not sure if the clean people or someone else is responsible but when I arrived every light was on inside the apartment  I literally mean every light including the oven and microwave lights  That caused it to be very warm inside and due to the warm weather  it took a while to cool the apartment down 
767904231,Great place  I came for a tour at WashU  s medical campus and this place was at an ideal location  Very close to Forest Park and close to plenty of great restaurants and cafes  The place itself is super clean and my parents and I had an excellent stay  Thank you so much  We had a great time at the Montclair 
389864680413907762,Amazing location  Really big bath tub to soak in after long city walks adventures  Thanks so much  Helluva bath tub in the bathroom  Loved the location and the checkin process wasa breeze
770790329,very nice and cozy loved my stay nice and cozy
420235297716737486,My only complaint would be the cleanliness of the room it wasn t horrible but could have been clean better before our arrival besides that everything was fantastic and I would stay again  My only complaint would be with the cleanliness of the space besides that everything else was wonderful 
387587833811419398,This unit was okay but not as nice as the other unit we have stayed with this company  The coffee maker was missing when we arrived and not replaced during the stay  The garbage can was not clean and had mold growing in it that need to be deodorized  The company was responsive to our needs when the front door lock was inoperable but could have been more responsive to the other issues  The trash can smell in the unit was unbearable for most of the stay  I had asked for this to be corrected and nothing was done  Disappointed 
766633532,This was a great place with a very easy walk to the ball park    The check in process was awful and the instructions that were given were not how to check in or check out   Hopefully they will get this figured out for the next guest  The check in process was awful and the instructions that were given were not how to check in or check out  The AC was lock and not setup to where we could change the temp in the apartment 
765656178,Pros  The apartment looked just the way the pictures show  My daughter was getting six weeks of radiation at the childrens hospital and I loved how close the apartment was to the hospital  The apartment is in a good area and I felt very safe during our entire stay  There was always someone working the front desk and they kept track of the visitors in the building  The building was very secure    Cons  My daughter and I stayed here for six weeks so some of our cons may not be a big deal if you are staying for a short time  The biggest issue was parking  It said street parking but it was not communicated to me till the day before we got there that I would have to pay for that street parking  I was spending almost      a week for six weeks to park  I would have looked at other locations if I would have known that  There was a few free parking spots but they were very hard to get  Also the noise was a huge issue  The parking garage for this building was being worked on an the apartment is on the  nd floor right over the parking garage so we could hear all the work  Sometimes it was so loud I couldnt even hear the TV and I would get a headache  Also it says washer and dryer but it doesnt say that it is in the basement of the building and not in the unit  The only way to pay for it is with a card and one day the internet for the building was down so I had wet clothes for hours in the dryer  Also I would have to wait for a dryer sometimes because the other residents didnt get their clothes out promptly  I wish the kitchen was stocked with more cooking materials  Staying there for six weeks eating out a lot was not an option  I had to buy mixing bowls and measuring cups because the apartment didnt have any 
386887470208412710,The place is just as in the pictures   It is on the  th floor I believe  there s an elevator and they give you clear instructions  Easy to enter and leave   Don t forget to leave the FOB   They charge you     if you take it on accident  The bathroom is a decent size  nice TV  mini kitchen and the bed is a little low but aside from that it s ok   You just can t make a lot of noise and you can t watch movies with the volume too loud  but the location is great  Thank you so much for everything  The place is great 
386983789975678706,wifi did not work and they lied about all the amenities  She said they were open and when we got there it was all under construction 
763400653,Very beautiful very beautiful and clean place convenient to all the restaurants The people in the from this were a spectacular nice but management  Zencity have to do some improvement with communication When I arrive and check in my apartment was not ready when I checked the apartment the parking permit was missing I never got to use the Wi Fi they sent someone a day later with apartment for parking  Unfortunately I travel with my children for an emergency my mother is in the ICU in North Kansas Hospita  I really needed the Wi Fi I end up using my phone to give my children a hot pot so they can continue classes here for a week online it s very very stressful but it s nothing to do with the place is something to do with the management
766656435,Great location and Spacious Thanks for the stay  Everything was great except the bed is very shaky  I am not that large but if someone bigger or a couple was in the bed it feels like it may collapse  I didnt feel like I could move around in my sleep because the bed would wobble  Not a huge issue for me but may be for other guests in the future    Also  you are currently not allowed to enter the front door and have to go around the back  The same code still worked  luckily  but something to note on the instructions for other guests  Thanks 
391205593122586467,  Great place to stay
768160148,Very nice place with a great view
766316192,The blinds in the apt were blinds were opaque blinds meant for living rooms or to accompany another blind that would actually block out sun  As the windows were huge it meant at night all the lights from city shone in and at crack of dawn sun came in  I did not sleep the time I stayed to the point I left early  Still trying to chase a refund  You didn t fix the blinds which made apt unlivable
417292930329437009,I haven t had a bad experience with Airbnb s except for this time  My husband and I booked a room with Zencity  at  am they messaged me the day we were supposed to arrive and they asked if we could change reservations to a different room in the building  We agreed because it was the same price and looked comparable in pictures  After arriving we were able to get keys but it was for the original room we booked  We were confused but went along with it and messaged them on the Airbnb app to see what to do  Not wanting to hold our bags in the lobby we just decided to go up to the room we had keys for  An hour went by and they messaged us saying you re booked for the other room  I hope that answers your questions    Needless to say it didn t lol  So we tried calling the number attached to the reservation confirmation and could only reach an automated phone line  They called us after an hour of trying to reach them and said you need to move to the other room  and we can try and help you figure out how to get the keys to the other room  This was such a hassle  We had plans and reservations so we didn t have time to troubleshoot their mistakes  After trying to reason with them on the phone  we finally just asked for a refund and said we wanted to leave because the room wasn t very clean  the street ally parking was so sketchy  the building itself smelled horrible of body odor and smoke    they refused to refund us because that would take  manager approval  and refused to get the manager    they finally just texted me after another hour went by and said just stay in the room we were in    needless to say  we will not be coming back or recommending this company Airbnb location to anyone in the future 
387615405614483432,Great little spot with plenty of room  had a great time with friends 
435494532555898586,Great location and clean  Would stay again The key fob didn t work at the gate  but everything else was perfect 
767881441,  Hi there  I just want to recommend that the cleaners should do a better job  need more wash cloths  a coffee maker would be nice  needed to hunt to find the blow dryer 
767335770,I would not recommend renting from Zincity at all  We stayed at a zincity owned Airbnb in St  Louis   The apartment was much larger than the photos led us to be and it s in a great spot in the city  Security there is also amazing so we were very excited   We noticed the AC wasn t working at all so it was very hot in the room  We contacted zincity through the Airbnb chat section  They spent the first day trying to get me to check the thermostat  like I didn t know how to work one   Long story short we stayed there for   nights and it was hot the entire time  They never fixed the AC  They would try to get me to fix it but I told them I m not a AC repair guy  They suggested I just open the windows  which are   stories up and did not have protective screens  I told them that was too dangerous with my young kids    They never offered to relocate us  even though I asked numerous times   they did bring up portable ACs but they worked like box fans  so they wouldn t cool any rooms down at all   they only offered us our clean fee back for compensation  and they promised a supervisor would contact us a few days ago and he never did  I explained to zincity that I was a disabled combat veteran with a wife and four kids and being in this heat would make my disabilities worsen and my kids and wife uncomfortable but zincity still didn t resolve the issue at all   I will not be renting from them ever again  I understand stuff happens  such as an AC breaking  but not resolving a problem and taking care of your customers should always be number one and we weren t number one that week  We stayed here   nights and we noticed the AC wasn t working  It was very hot in the room  I am a disabled combat veteran and if I get to hit them I can get very sick  I also have four children and a wife who were with me  who were also very uncomfortable   I notified y all of this that night and it was never fixed  It would take hours to hear back from y all on chat and at first it was just y all trying to make sure I had the air on properly  No attempts to move us or offer us a refund occurred and I didn t have the money to just leave and get a new place  so we had to stay in a hot apartment for   days  making the evenings of our vacation miserable   Finally I was told portable AC units would be brought up but what we eventually got did absolutely nothing to cool the rooms   Y all told me a supervisor would contact me a few days ago and no one did  I asked numerous times to be relocated and was either ignored or was told ok y all would and no one got back with me   Y all gave me the     clean fee back but that in no way compensates us for   days of misery in the rooms   I asked for half my money back to compensate us and no one has got back with us   On top of all that y all also had left books inside the room  probably for decoration  and one of em was filled with male and female pornographic imagery  I have no Idea why this would be left in an apartment that rents to families  My kids could have looked through it I d I didn t happen to first    This was an absolute awful way we were treated and we are still waiting to hear back from y all to see if your going to make it right 
390533540811727373,  The Airbnb and the building were both dirty  I have pictures of all of the unsanitary areas
766227803,Bring your own hair dryer  No amenities  coffee tea bags     A C unit in bedroom is full of black mold    Cannot block out   am sunshine without covering the A C unit  Plug ins on one side of bed are not functioning    I have traveled all over the US and Europe and have never had to leave a bad review on any Airbnb I ve rented  This is my first  Communication by texting was terrible on your end  only partial text came through   Airbnb was bare  no hair dryer  no coffee or tea bags  a semi functioning TV  Curtain in bedroom could not be drawn to block out   am sunshine  because it would block A C  Need to improve that with a blind on top  Ruined our sleep quality which we desperately needed    And as for the A C unit  covered in black mold  Shouldn t allow guests until it is professional clean 
765413579,Could of been clean Better for the clean fees we pay
391250603955432386,Great place to stay  Awesome stay  Want to book again

390521557352146164,Very clean  Great location  Responsive host  Wonderful stay overall 
767269398,Very quiet room  Comfortable bed and pillows  Great location  Hello  We really enjoyed the place  My only suggestion  more towels  extra blankets and extra utensils

765972580,Great place Love the area as well as the apt  The check in process was bad due to fact that the security box at the door was broke and we had to wait nearly an hour to get in by another resident  Otherwise it s a very nice place
766703222,Could be a lot better didn t like it Could be a lot better
391928513745936963,   This was a great trip  Thank you 
390521202159061927,This property is OK  The location is great if you want to be in Hyde Park  which we did   The bedrooms are fine  There are   bedrooms  but the rest of the apartment does not reflect that fact  There is a very small dining table with only   chairs and the only other seating is a couch  The internet did not work  but the owners gave us a work around   There were few amenities    no soap in the bathroom we could find   In other words  it seems like the owners are trying to spend as little money as possible on this property   As such I feel it is overpriced for what we paid  Luckily there was someone leaving the building when we arrived so we could get in   the entrance code for the building did not work 
390505771951241898,the TV didnt work there  it keep saying network  disconnected  there were still broken glass in the door of the second bed room  there was so much build up around the tub Some of the electricity outlet didnt work The tub was stopped up to where we couldnt take a shower  we have to use the sink  the bed was comfortable  everything else was false advertisement  I appreciate it for you letting me and my family stay there but everything that was said about the place was completely wrong  the TV didnt work there  it keep saying network  disconnected  there were still broken glass in the door of the second bed room that my son got cut on and hes four  there was so much dirt and grim in the corners of the washroom  and around the tub  Some of the electricity outlet didnt work The tub was stopped up to where we couldnt take a shower  we have to use the sink  The only thing that was nice was the fact that it had a nice kitchen and the bed was comfortable everything else that you said was completely wrong  false advertisement 
765464898,The good   great location if you want to be close to streeterville gold coast   couldnt ask for better location overall   Check in and in out privileges were easy and had no issues with apartment access during the stay   There is a convenient starbucks downstairs and small market around the corner in addition to nearby pharmacy making this even a better location with easy access to amenities   The apartment was organized  good size  had comfortable furnishings  and location was quiet   Nice balcony with view of city      The bad  shower drain  mentioned in other reviews  drains extremely slow and you will be showering with feet full of undrained water  It looked like the small fan in the bathroom wall had years of dust collected in it and was not functioning properly   The faucet in the bathroom had a very weak stream making it difficult to wash hands   not great in the middle of a pandemic  There was no laundry soap  but empty container was there for it  for the washer   The lint tray in the dryer had not been clean in I would estimate       cycles and ugh   had to dispose of large glob of lint from unknown number of past guests   WAS CHARGED for damage I did not cause to a mirror which was not even shown to me in the original location it was located   if you are staying here  recommend to take pictures of everything before and after to avoid bogus claims      fix the drain in the bathroom shower    clean the fan in the bathroom   literally dust ball in there looked clogged    reconsider clean crew   the lint catcher in dryer must have had    loads of drying clothes lint in there and given bogus mirror damage charges           have faucet in bathroom checked   dripping faucet water with extremely slow stream made it hard to wash hands    make sure there is laundry detergent available if you are going to have a laundry room
391317404887668445,The furniture was broke and not well made there was no dinette table or chairs  The leg on the couch was broke therefore we could not use  the lounge chair was hard and very uncomfortable  you could feel the metal through the vinyl covering  and there was a strong fume of gas throughout the place the rod in the bathroom was missing  One of the chair was missing two screws  Lastly it was difficult to find parking  On a good note the service of staff and the location was excellent Also the room was very peaceful and spacious  The furniture was broke and  not well made there was no dinette table or chairs  The leg on the couch was broke therefore we could not use  the lounge chair was hard and very uncomfortable  you could feel the metal through the vinyl covering  and there was a strong fume of gas throughout the place the rod in the bathroom was missing  One of the chair was missing to screws  Lastly it was difficult to find parking  On a good note the service of staff and the location was excellent Also the room was very peaceful and spacious 
765928225,Great place to stay  Really get the Chicago vibe with the views of the train station and the sounds of the city  Location is excellent  Really enjoyed my stay  thank you very much 
422476972360634842,This stay is very accurate to the photos  It was a beautifully decorated space  It also felt SUPER safe and secure   I had a few problems with our stay but overall  I would stay there again   Some of the problems concerns that I faced were    slow communication    the apt not being fully clean   there were dirty footprints on the tile from the previous tenant   the carpet was not vacuumed    the apt door not unlocking with the fob   i just used to key pad code each time  it unlocked everything else though    the tv is on the same switch as the kitchen light so you can t watch tv in darkness lol  Honestly  me and my husband had a good time and loved the location  The gated parking lot is definitely a HUGE plus  All of the negatives I listed still would not stop us from staying here again   Also the rooftop deck space is amazing  Thanks for letting us stay  Overall  we enjoyed it  Just had a few hiccups that prevented my rating to be   stars 
764914555,Great location  Very clean Kitchen described as having cooking basics like salt pepper oil  which it had nothing  Also described as having soaps for showering but only had conditioner and lotion  no body wash or shampoo  The front desk person at the apartment building was very rude about us being Airbnb guests  Otherwise The location was very good  Very clean and nice apartment  Would book again 
765098943,Good location  Great kitchen  Thanks  
765132965,Nice clean space in a great spot  Some of the codes are pretty tricky  but it could ve been user error  Thanks for letting us stay  I really struggled with inputting the original code to get into the building  Additionally  we noticed you had a minut tracking device and it was really off putting that it was disclosed  It s not against AirBnB but I would have like it disclosed  but that s why I m mentioning it here 
388346821685863935,A great little studio  think hotel room with full kitchen and laundry   The train noise didn t bother me at all  but if you re a light sleeper just bring your white noise device and you ll be all set  There is a great view of the sunset at night and it met all of my needs for the week  The only feedback I have is the floor made my feet dirty when I walked around barefoot  luckily there was a target across the street and I bought some clean products  and the sheets could be a little softer  All in all would     stay here again 
765473740,This apartment is an absolute steal  The check in is just via door codes both at the building front door and the unit s door which is great for those like myself traveling and arriving at odd times  Then the unit itself was amazing  clean  and central to most anything you would want to do in the city  You can stay local and walk or the red line hits most major attractions and is   blocks away    Most importantly  I never felt I needed anything extra  but anytime I reached out to the host that we had checked in or that we had clean and checked out a bit early they responded within minutes  even when we checked in around  am   Thank you so much  I really have no suggestions   I think both frequent travelers and the casual tourist will both recognize how great this space and the service you provide are
404989066751134084,Great location  Very quick and responsive host  Hi    Thank you for letting us stay in your home  We did want to let you know that your neighbors upstairs were very very very loud  You could hear everything through the ceiling  They were stomping around and making noises at all hours of the night   sounded like they were dropping weights on the floor 
386961280106804867,When we arrived  the front of the building was condemned and we has to use the back door  no problem  except the elevator was broken and we has to go up four flights of stairs to get to the room and back  However all of that wasnt even a dealbreaker if the room had been clean properly  We had even found hard used towels hanging over the shower curtain when we arrived  Mention the front being condemned and four flights of stairs with no elevator  also we had found the apartment semi dirty and found used dirty towels from previous renters still hanging over the shower curtain 
765082332,Loved visiting KC  stayed at one of the apartments in the Netherlands building  It was clean and very cozy  The location is great with a lot of things to do       recommend Loved staying at Zencity  The location is great  not too far from downtown  many restaurants around the area  The only problem was that the bathroom door did not close completely we often had troubles opening closing it  either than that we loved our stay 
764443187,I wouldn t stay here again  There were a lot of problems   host s instructions for building entry were wrong  dishes were broken  no cooking utensils  inaccurate listing of kitchen appliances  thermostat broke halfway through  and host entered twice without advanced warning  The host is a company  not a person  so I was unable to get any help with these issues  Whenever I reached out  I kept getting corporate responses   thank you for your patience   The place was fine  but the host Zencity was terrible  I d book somewhere else 
392002557700252882,Great price  place and location  The bel is one of my favorite homes away from home   I had a wonderful time   Great place always have loved the bel
390548771465141688,Amazing location and very cool building  All new inside and very nice interiors  Ideally adjacebt to the    Bus to the loop  A bargain  Great accomodation  The air conditioner needs to be clean or replaced  Same for the carpet 
429691110769649303,Great location in central west end   with a lively neighborhood to explore  The airbnb itself isn t the cleanliness place  it has all amenities and reflects the pictures advertised very well 
767292446,Very responsive team  and the stock of amenities was great  Only   min walk to the Chicago blue line stop  and the intersection has coffee  cvs  and a couple bars  It was quiet at night which made sleeping easy  Safe area too    The building is very old so prepare for that cozy charm  Pillows a tad flat but the bed is so comfortable  Shower water pressure a little light  One window AC in the kitchen so you gotta leave it on to need the bedroom cool  Thank you so much for the stay    It got a little hot in the bedroom especially during the    degree days  Wish the shower water pressure was a bit stronger    we appreciated the extra toilet paper  the extra blanket  The bed was SO COMFY  The TV had everything  You were so responsive   Overall a great stay 
766329233,Pro s  close to downtown if you have a car  House looks more or less like pics  Private space in both floors   Cons  ac too loud  tv didn t work because the control had no battery  not enough basic stuff like coffee  not much light coming from the windows  bath hanger fell after one day  there where small flying bugs and two spiders in the lower floor  neighborhood is kind of sketchy at night  not the best place to walk alone   The apartment had wifi but it never worked  That was one of the worst things  My computer would connect to the line but no Internet whatsoever  Parking on the street is hard  we use an app  parking hero    and that work    Zencity Is a big company  so a new person answered me every time I needed to solve a problem  I had better experiences with Rbnbs managed by owner 
768107402,Exactly as described  Great little place right across the street from forest park  Lots of great food within walking distance  Thanks for letting me stay  Enjoyed the apartment 
389837159041545639,Location is amazing  located in middle of downtown    Check in was easy  simple   There were many amenities in the Airbnb but no iron which I was disappointed in   The worst part of my stay is that the power was not working in half of the room during the second day  Which included the air conditioner  I spent the entire night and morning sweating profusely as it s summertime now    When I reached out  I was asked to go find breaker box in the basement  This may seem reasonable  accept the fact that this is an apartment building with    floors and it was      pm  So this was unacceptable  Fix whatever issue causes the air conditioner to stop working  It s summer and this makes for a very unpleasant stay 
389068751618690876,Clean nice condo Thx you
387627367932615196,Wonderful experience  with tons to do even right inside the building  Good access to downtown KC  but still felt private  Thank you so much for a wonderful stay  My husband and I had a beautiful experience  Thanks 
768168072,Nice Place  Enjoyed my stay 
391952251893043771,I ended up staying at a hotel  The entire building reeked of cigarette smoke  The unit has central air and a portable A C  but the bedroom was still absurdly hot  The hosts would not refund me for my stay  despite the fact that I didnt stay there  dirty any linens  etc 
386203118161487295,Unfortunately  I would not recommend this particular stay  The neighbors are sensitive to sound  While we were watching a movie  wasnt even that loud  we got a text from the host that they relieved a noise complaint   No toiletries are provided and the toilet paper is like Sandpaper  So if you book this stay  keep in mind you should bring your own   I definitely enjoyed the bed itself  It was VERY cozy  The place was clean    Overall  if I had known more about the place then what was listed by The Host I would not have booked this stay  It was not at all what we were anticipating for our vacation  I think it would be more appropriate to list it as more of a single person or business trip AirBnB  The Host themselves had great communication and were very kind  It might be nice to have a little note on the posting that the neighbors are a little sensitive to sound  Also we had a little difficulty getting in the front doors the first time around  The instructions were good but could be more detailed  It took us a few tries to get it  there also werent any toiletries and I think that should be noted in the posting as well  for the guests to bring their own  Most guests assume there will be toiletries provided  at minimum a body wash  One more thing  as an added bonus  you might consider spending just a little money on some toilet paper  My work doesnt spend a lot of money on our toilet paper and it was the same kind  The Sandpaper type  if Im going on vacation  I definitely dont want to wipe my derriere with the same toilet paper I use at a job that doesnt care about me 
522467824507238479,The loft is amazing and it s at a nice place 
497790144511065045,Always come thru
420289955185933901,Very nice and modern as pictured  Location is great and central to most attractions  Bed was firmer than I prefer  but if you like a firm mattress it will be great for you  Apartment was relatively clean but could definitely have been cleaner  Overall it was  good experience though  We could not find the dumpster so we were unable to take out our garbage  It may be helpful to leave a note about its location in the future  I wouldnt say it was dirty  but the clean could definitely have been more thorough An extra set of towels would have been nice as well 
420289017822364384,Great place  Great place  very nice  organized and clean 
392672462324403049,Weird apartment layout only one sink in the kitchen
392647939142409596,Nice place to get sleep  Coffee shop right down stairs and lots of food places near by  Little run down but you get what you pay for 
435418945673927317,Nice place to stay if you are in town for     nights Little details in the bathroom can make a big difference in the experience
768349460,Nice clean and comfortable Nice clean and comfortable
768346305,Cute and close to CWE 
765646616,Good stay  WiFi was out for a bit but it was resolved in a few hours 
768402670,It was a great stay    Thanks 
402120639667937463,Be aware of the checking process   It s not the way it says and not easy  They will ask you to Download the igloo app  if you are lucky to follow a resident entering the building just follow and take the elevator to the right to your rented apartment  Once a the door follow the instructions to enter the apartment  make sure you click on the door key pad so you see the  s  Once in the apartment you will find the fob hanging next to the fridge  The checking was terrible  I read prior reviews before we checked in  The main issue people complain about is the checking process  It says use a code to get into the building  It s a LIE  Why    We try to use the code but we couldn t get in  I called customer service and spoke to a lady who had no idea what to do  She put me on hold four times  Finally I decided to follow a resident who just got into the building and proceeded to the apartment   and finally was able to use the code to get into the apartment and found the fob  It took us    minutes to check in  Few days later  we met a couple having the same issue trying to get into the building and we helped them with the process  They were at the door for an hour and a half trying to get someone on the phone  Terrible      The apartment was nice  one queen bed for a couple  friends will not use a queen bed to sleep together    The couch was not comfortable  I traveled with my kid only  so I gave him the bed because he was competing for   days   I suggest that they invest in the kitchen  They definitely need silverware bigger coffee cups and utensils    They need to have a layout of the building  We had to explore to find the laundry room  it is on same floor where your apartment is  the gym is on the second floor  don t be fooled by the pictures  there is   old treadmills  one bike and one elliptical  No wipes or spray or d sinfectant to wipe the machines  prior to and after workout  The weight room Is limited to one one machine and free weight adjacent  to the cardio room    THE POOL  is an indoor one but closed by the health department  A notice was posted on the door   It s definitely convenient because of its location but don t walk alone  specially at night   It s a  quiet and a clean building   Despite the negatives we made the most of it  We used it to sleep and cooked breakfast  we wanted to cook more but they didn t have enough utensils to work with  It was an ok stay 
768352232,Amazing place amazing views on rooftop all around good place definitely  stars Best stay ever amazing apartment amazing views will definitely rent again
470958735264124122,Location of the apartment is great and close to the hospital and the vibrant place of central end west  The check in was a bit turbulent because the main door of the building was stuck and didn t open with code  i had neighbor living in same apartment to help open the back door  The apartment is spacious with good living room and big TV with Netflix and Hulu access  It is overall clean but it seems it was clean days and may be weeks before my arrival considering there was some cockroaches in the bathroom 
391261676775358762,Parking can be a little confusing  but I would definitely stay again  Thank you so much 
768353462,nice apartment 
408695758357196236,The apartment was very nice and clean  The bed was comfortable and the location was perfect    We had a lot of issues with check in  as the key fob wasnt working for us to get into the parking lot  Communication via Zencity was quick but of no real help  We did accidentally encounter a Zencity employee  Kathy  in the foyer and she gave us a new key fob  which did work  She was very helpful and accommodating    The second situation was there was no coffee in the unit  Again  email with Zencity was quick and we were told they would send coffee over  however  we never received anything  We would have brought our own coffee had the online description stated that we should  We stayed two nights and no coffee was a bummer  Also  the  coffee maker  was a French press    We would stay here again  The check in process is somewhat confusing  but now that weve stayed we understand how it works  provided that the key fob is in working condition  And we would be sure to pack our own coffee 
766471516,This is not the hosts fault  but theres really loud construction noise right outside the window  Jackhammering  drilling  sand blasting  etc  Its impossible to work  have calls or relax during business hours     If youll only be spending nights and evenings in the apartment  Id highly recommend staying here  The location  apartment and lobby staff are all amazing  Otherwise  you may want to check on the status of the construction before booking  It looks a large ongoing construction project 
764956163,This is a great little apartment with an excellent location  The FlashCube building sits at the northernmost end of downtown  just south of the interstate and two blocks from River Market  Right outside the front door is the street car line  Parking was easy  Instructions in getting into the building were detailed but not complicated  The room is modern with great windows looking east onto Main Street  Separate bedroom and full kitchen made this a wonderful find in a spot where hotel rooms are hard to find  Thanks Zencity for a  great stay  I hope you found the keys and parking tag on the coffee table  Great apartment  Our son just moved to River Market  so the location was excellent  My only suggestions are that you may need to replace the ceiling fan in the bedroom  it makes a rattling noise  And the two table chairs have splintered legs that may break soon 
389851504230786323,This was a great location and the room was amazing   Will definitely recommend  It was a great stay   Only issue is the toilet bowl was loose 
768409857,Great place and location  Very clean  Great experience 
489860207607558099,Great Area
390487941217249103,Check in could be improved but overall the place was super clean and is in a great location  There was also no hand soap in the bathroom  The microphone keypad didn t work when we were trying to get into the building   We were never prompted to enter the code and it keep giving an error message    Someone coming out of the building let us in  Luckily  the leasing office was open and the employee used a her fob for us to use the elevator 
767330646,The location was really great   walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go and a quick Uber if you want to go further  We were able to find on street parking and didnt move our car for the weekend  Make sure you dont park on a permitted street or side of the street  There was a lot of space to use and the outside decks were a nice bonus  If you need a strong wifi connection or need to connect for work  this space maybe challenging  Wifi was fine on the main floor but not great upstairs  It seems as though the pictures in the posting may be from some time ago because the space has seen some wear and tear  It must be difficult to keep up everything with so many people passing through  but some touch ups would be helpful  I would not say the condition is a reason not to stay  but it is important that expectations match experience  Thanks for letting us stay  We had an enjoyable visit  and we were able to get around to where we wanted to go  Some small issues   no soap dispenser in the master bathroom  we used the giant jug   saw some ants in the master bedroom  wifi wasnt usable upstairs  master bedroom fan had a lot of dust  fridge filter needs replacing  There is also a cooler thing on the deck that we never planned on using but had water and or mold in it  I wont include anything except for the wifi in my public comments  I would say  and I will mention this  that it seems like your pictures might be from a while back because the overall condition didnt match what we saw   floors  deck  walls  cabinets  etc  I understand how hard it must be to keep the place in top shape with so many people going through it  I think some small touch ups would go a long way to bring it up a bit 
767308378,great location  nice clean unit  my friends and I fully enjoyed our stay here   the dishwasher doesnt work  we were unable to turn it on and start it  but other than that the unit was very nice  
402850299499507571,It was peaceful I  feel like for the price the place could have been better kept  Some detector and wires were exposed and pulling out  blinds damaged etc  but not too shabby 
389060554952174489,Horrible customer service  I run my own air bnb and would never treat my guests the way Zencity treated me  Zero help  no one lives in the city that works for this property management company so I was left to sit in the hallway till I left to go rented a hotel for the weekend  ZERO STARS Horrible customer service  I run my own air bnb and never would treat my guests the way you treated me  Zero help  I couldn t gain access into the the apartment and you  left me to sit there in the hallway  ZERO STARS
410057005525822506,Great location  lovely spacious pad
435490631830362978,Great room and great location 
435480146095302966,Very clean with friendly front desk staff 
767363788,This is a great location and wonderful accommodations  Thank you for the accommodations  We loved the apartment and appreciate your timely communications 
390487943465151426,Great place  Check In requires a little extra time as the instructions are a bit complicated   But the place is great and gym is perfect  Place was great   Building was great  The internet is VERY SLOW  Speed tests clock rates ant   mps consistently  Otherwise great stay
767308033,Really great communication with the team and was super easy to get in and out of the unit  For the price point  it was alright  The space was a bit messy when I arrived  The soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken and there were lint balls and bits of trash I found throughout the unit when I arrived  For the large clean  I kind of expected it to be spotless
767787247,Nice stay
768617944,They are little late to respond  The place was pretty good  I enjoyed the stay it was exactly what I thought it would be  Very nice   
768413319,Beautiful apartment  very clean  Great friendly customer service over the phone 
768600035,This was a great location and a place yo stay  great stay   thank you 
768656201,Cool Place  HUGE  Priced right  very easy check in  Great shops near by  On the bus line overall stay was GREAT  Thanks ZENCITY  Will Stay Again 
765077739,We won t be staying with Zencity again  they don t care for their properties well  We wouldn t have been able to check in if the property manager hadn t been walking out the font doors  the system to let you in is glitchy  The AC was broken  no batteries in the remotes  floor wasn t swept  doornob was gone from the back of the bathroom door    That being said  location is great and we slept well on the bed  water pressure in the shower was pretty good and water was always hot  Hopefully they get some more staff and care take care of their properties better in the future  This place is clearly not cared for   I know it s not a private home but it didn t make for a welcoming experience  beginning with bad directions and not being able to get into the building  It s fake luxury but could easily be taken to the next level with some staff who give care and attention to keeping up when things break and adding some welcoming touches 
768355489,Great Host  Great Host  Thanks 
767863482,everything really good everything good
767390448,The rental was great and it was a fantastic location  It was an incredibly smooth process to check in and the rental was very clean  We had a great time at the rental  The location was fantastic and we loved how clean it was when we checked in  It was was a great weekend and will look forward to staying at a Zencity rental again 
769028519,Clean and simple  Loved the roof top deck  Great location  Thank you 
768991406,It was a cool old apt  Parking sucked but nice place  Changing the code to get in kinda sucked but other than that ok
767232532,Location was great  apartment is ok but basic and we had   days without air conditioning  Also the front door automatic lock stopped working which we had to fix ourselves and there was a smell in the unit when we checked in  Communication from the owners acknowledging and resolving the owners was poor  I think I ve said enough but here goes again  the smell when we checked in  the lack of air conditioning for   days  the lock stopped working in the front door  poor communication and zero effort to help offset the issues we faced 
768921311,Nice stay close to downtown
768124158,Very professional and made me feel so welcome during my stay 
767361426,Decent for a stay but the listing could use some updates  The interior has a few repairs that were made that do not show up in photos and laundry while on site is coin operated only  Everything appeared clean but the shower had not been which made me question the unit as a whole  The building next door was currently under construction so there is some usual city sounds during the day   Walls are thin but thats expected in an apartment  Thank you again for the stay
389868926070156165,This airbnb is in a great location  Check in was also super easy  and the apartment was very clean  Highly recommend Thanks for the great stay 
389082940442679414,Good placec
765988569,The apartment was very sleek and stylish  Parking was a nightmare  We couldn t find anywhere close when we came home around   pm and had to walk pretty far in a somewhat sketchy area  The next morning we had to get up early and move the car because we were worried it would get ticketed   The shower took forever to get warm and the water pressure wasn t very good   There s a bunch of steps to do to get your keys for check in  Bed was very comfortable 
767886780,The apartment location is great and the apartment itself is nice  We did have some issues at check in  but Zencity was helpful in resolving them    I did not report it during our stay  but we had problems the with apartment door  which is a keypad and uses code for entry  and auto locks when you exit  Upon entry of the code and exit of the apartment  the mechanism failed to lock and unlock on the first try every time  We had to spend a lot of time re entering the code before the door would unlock  and many times of exiting  opening the door  closing the door and repeating before the mechanism would lock  This issue with the door locking was part of what gave us trouble with check in  Whether staff was aware  I would think it had been reported by a previous guest or by the housekeeper  or perhaps they were unaware and we were the first to experience this issue  but just make sure you confirm this issue has been resolved before you arrive    Overall  I do recommend this listing for the apartment interior and location  and staff responds fairly quickly in the airbnb message center  There was an issue with the mechanism on the front door auto locking and unlocking  and we had an issue with the initial building entry code which gave a stressful check in situation  The initial building code for entry did not work  although I was able to follow someone in  my boyfriend came to the building later with luggage  and was unable to enter the building  The elevator code did work   Because the door failed to auto lock from the last person who exited the apartment  when I approached the door a few minutes before  pm  it was open and I was able to obtain the key FOB  When my boyfriend called to say he couldnt get in the building  I exited the apartment and the door did lock  I tried the same code to make sure it would let me back in  but the door would not open  I messaged through the air bnb app and Mauricio responded quickly  and resolved the issue of a functioning apartment door code  but was unable to resolve the building entry code as it needed to be repaired by the apartment admin    There was also confusion about building access  whether it was a miscommunication from staff or a misunderstanding on my end  Mauricio and I went back and forth on needing to obtain a working building code to be able to enter and exit as we please without having to follow another resident in  I had thought the key fob was strictly for parking garage access  but obviously  the issue of the building code was obsolete since the key fob is able to grant access to the building as well as the garage  After about an hour  Mauricio clarified the use of the key fob  and all was good for that issue   However  the door failing to auto lock and unlock was an issue every time we exited and entered the apartment  The mechanism appears to be damaged  as it sounds like the device tries to move the lock shut   open  but fails and beeps several times  Each exit entry from the apartment took MANY  sometimes more than     tries of exiting   inputing the code for entry before the door would lock   unlock  It was quite irritating and inconvenient  but after the issues with check in  and figuring that getting someone to come and fix the lock would take longer than our stay  I did not report it to Zencity during our stay   Otherwise  Mauricio was very nice and helpful  and the apartment itself and location are great 
765453772,Great location and comfortable all white bed  It is quiet for  sleeping  and it is an easy walk to the Plaza   Great location  One wine glass was cracked and broke as we used it  There were only two   The carpet is dated and dirty looking  The keypad is difficult to use  It often took   times trying to get it to lock or open   The bed is very comfortable and the location is so quite 
765438295,Getting checked in was difficult  The code they gave to access the building didn t work and then took about    minutes to fix  So when it s       at night and you ve been traveling all day  it s not a great way to start off  Once I got into the apartment and had the key fob for entry it was fine  The place was clean and comfortable  The kitchen was minimally appointed so maybe plan on eating out or getting takeout  The thermostat didn t work so it was a bit warm in the apartment and since the windows don t open I was a little powerless to address that  If I had it to do over again I would totally stay here but I would bring a large coffee mug and a candle smelled a little funky   You need to fix your check in process  That was so frustrating  
768976938,Simply awesome Simply wonderful location 
766704833,The Zencity team was super helpful as well as everyone at the Del Prado  The unit is exactly as listed  the only issue was the cleanliness of the unit  hair in tub  food residue in microwave  food left in the fridge  grimy dust along baseboards thought out   I booked very last minute and they were able to accommodate me  It s just a minute s walk from downtown Hyde Park which made the location ideal   Thank you so much for accommodating a last minute reservation  the Del Prado team was great and the room worked out  Wonderful location   Only comments are regarding the cleanliness  there was hairs in the shower  food residue in the microwave  food left in the fridge  and just a layer of grimy dust throughout the baseboards that made it feel like it hadn t been deep clean in months  Just a lived in clean 
768124180,I loved the flat   the location  I plan to reserve again  I loved the flat   the location  I hope to book this location again 
767449667,It was nice enough  Didn t pay much attention during booking very high fees for a two night stay  Would just as soon have stayed in a hotel 
451404817376414130,it was a nice experience  I recommend 
393451322825100436,Nice loft  no complaints 
505810336224397249,We stayed over the Thanksgiving holiday at a Zencity apartment in the historic Del Prado  a beautiful  Art Deco building that still has some apartments  in a different area of the building  that are home to its pre gentrification tenants  they are geriatric and many are in wheelchairs or use walkers  The location is excellent  very close to Hyde Park s restaurants and shops  a walk  during the daytime  to Whole Foods  Trader Joe s  etc  The apartment was spotlessly clean  cozy  and warm  with beautiful views  We found street parking during our entire stay  The one glitch was the bathroom  The shower head fell off each time  and when using the shower the water pressure wasn t great  Also  a grab bar near the high walled tub is very much needed  I ve alerted Zencity about this  and am hopeful they will fix these concerns  There is a severe shortage of hotels and Airbnb s in Hyde Park  and if you need to be near the U of Chicago  this is an excellent place to stay  A few notes  in order of importance  for Room     of the Del Prado  Bathroom was a big problem  The shower head is not secure  falls off each time  and the water pressure when using the shower is weak  Next  and more seriously  you must put in grab bars near the tub   it is downright dangerous to get out of the tub  which has high walls  The tub floor is slippery and there is no place to grab onto when getting out  The drain needs clean  the tub filled up  even when the stopper is not closed  during our showers     Please put more hangers into the closets  needed for longer term stays  we were their four nights    Although the desk staff was by and large friendly  when we checked in the person at the desk seemed confused by  Zencity  and I had to explain we were staying in an apartment that was an Airbnb    The video streaming system was confusing but we figured it out and by and large it worked  Detailed instructions would be helpful   Otherwise  the apartment was lovely  warm  beautiful views  spacious and cozy   I will recommend in my public post  as there is a critical shortage of hotel space and Airbnb s in the University of Chicago area  Please fix the bathroom and you have a goldmine 
451414078125021740,The ac never worked they never came out to fix it or clean up the room it was a horrible experience When we got there bed was not made up clothes in washer it needed a full detail just sad the way they treat you after you spend your money
410130807235614495,This was a great find in a quiet St Louis neighborhood  Perfect for our small family of three  We loved having the full kitchen and a washer and dryer  Bed was super comfy  too  Close to downtown and easy to get in and out of  Street parking was accessible and the hallways were quiet  Pool area was nice but a little more busy and rambunctious than we imagined  There was what looked like a huge college party the Saturday during our stay  We managed but it was a little surprising  No noise complaints from inside the apartment  There was a small mishap with our door s keypad since we extended our stay a few extra hours on the last day  I called the owners and someone was able to fix it remotely so we could get back into the apartment  They were always quick to respond and very accommodating  I would totally book here again  Thank you so much for such a lovely place to stay at  It was a perfect size for our family and had all the amenities that we needed  One suggestion I d have is to check the silverware in the kitchen and make sure they re properly clean  There were several pieces that were pretty dirty  especially the steak knives which had a lot of food still on them 
431886136744172462,Especially wonderful establishment nice clean at Friendly what to do nearby I recommend to all I would like to thank you for your hospitality I had a great experience only one complaint and it wasnt on you it was good neighbors upstairs the kids are running around till like   in the morning
392759571018922642,Great place to stay in St Louis  Right across the street from the park and just down the block from a Whole Foods and a bunch of restaurants   Apartment is anything super fancy  but has everything you need and is clean and comfortable  Would happily stay there again  Thanks for a great stay  
405040500441425685,Excellent room with a great view of Hyde Park   Very clean and comfortable   The lobby of the Prado is a bit tired and the elevators were broken down for about a half day  but it was all good   Desk clerk was very friendly and helpful   There was a bit of check in confusion but the desk clerk worked it all out and I was happy    The neighborhood is wonderfully diverse and I felt very safe as I walked around   The Prado is near   the waterfront  many parks  the Museum of Science and Industry  and the University of Chicago   There are a lot of good restaurants and stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joes are within walking distance   All in all  I give this room two thumbs up  Check in was a bit difficult  My wife made the reservation so they were expecting her to check in and would not let me check in until they confirmed it was okay with Zencity   The desk clerk had a some problems getting a hold of the correct person at Zencity    the first person she talked to could not help her and the second one kept on dropping the call   Thanks to her tenacity  she finally got through and got permission to give me the key to the room   That was a relief   I was not in the mood to chase down another room in Hyde Park   So  kudos to the desk clerk for working so hard and bad marks for Zencity for making it so difficult for her 
399914544517691756,such a great stay 
431897315826686966,We stayed here while traveling for work and it was a great location  It was a peaceful and spacious suite  with a great view  I loved the rain shower   Thank you again    Everything was wonderful
429693493130002336,Nice space for a quick visit  Location wasn t terrible and the space was clean  I love that the kitchen has the right supplies to make a variety of meals  The only issue was parking could be a challenging  I would definitely stay here again 
392668765353223213,The apartment is really well appointed  quiet  comfortable and a great location  However  the key fob that was meant to be in the apartment was missing  which meant I had to rely on the front desk staff of the building  who are all lovely  to let me in the front door  the elevator and the gym  It was really inconvenient because I needed to come and go quite a lot  The host was responsive and promised to get a spare to me several times but it never materialized 
410093746605241284,Everything was great  thank you 
392667567380169132,Easy  convenient  great location  modern feel 
430400539293146560,Im a frequent Airbnb traveler and this time booked the place for two weeks for my business trip  I found the Zancity apartment not suitable for my needs  there is no working table and a comfy chair  in the picture you can see a tiny table and a plastic chair   so I mostly worked standing placing my laptop on the microwave in the kitchen  There is a lack of drawers or other surfaces especially in the bedroom and bathrooms and I kept my stuff in the suitcase  The handers were missing so Zenticy stuff brought us some  We also got only one key even though we were two people with different schedules and were told that there is only one  Last but not least the apartment wasnt clean as we used according to the Airbnb standards   having some dust  stains  and peeling all around  Zencity sent a clean person but the place requires deep clean of the kitchen and maintenance in the bathrooms  I wont recommend this place as its also not so cheap  Please clean the apartment for the next guests  especially the kitchen and bathrooms   We highly recommend adding a working station   a table and comfy chairs for   people  Everyone works remotely today  Also adding some drawers would be great  I would go to Goodwill and buy some pictures and items to make the place cozy and reduce the feeling of a ghost apartment 
410097176448448602,I had a great stay here and would definitely come back again Thanks i really enjoyed my stay loved the place btw
406463826682186503,Great place to stay  great area  Looks just like the pictures clean environment  Only negative was I wasn t left the key so I couldn t go to the rooftop and could not park in the designating parking  but zencity did answer back and tried to fix the problem  Other then that everything was perfect I ll definitely book with them again  
421661979857123673,This unit is NOT market ready  It needs a major deep clean  the unit was filthy when I arrived  The blind doesnt work and the outdoor furniture is in terr vel condition  Customer service from Zenicity terrible  renter beware  Your clean standards are below grade  Terrible maintenance of the unit  it was filthy 
427447160458878479,Fantastically situated apartment in cool repurposed building offering great space  form and function for a professional of leisure stay in KC  Check in process wasnt great   telecom system appeared to be a know fault and your backup fob in mail box   didnt work  there was no fob  save for tail gating I would have not have gotten access   there is a pretty strong sewage smell in the apartment which I figure is just a function of the older building plumbing but wasnt a great vibe when going to bed   There was some heavy marks on the stove top and some general wear and tear type stuff around the apartment   Otherwise a great stay  great spot and great value 
392713885146261049,Great location and more spacious than the pictures indicate  The multiple floors and master bed bath are great  Would recommend staying  but as others have indicated  keep in mind WiFi was not great unless you are next to the router  streaming on the TV in the living room was choppy and no internet upstairs  Had issues with the door lock at check in and it required fixing new batteries halfway through the stay
407227862937961697,if you want a Zen place thats got a city feel with out the traffic in Kansas city  This is the place for you this place was amazing      loved the hallway and the location thank you so much for letting me stay  
484696465237638190,Not suitable for a long term stay because the more time you spend at the property the more issues arise    In most cities downtown is the hub for greatness  not the case for STL  Close to lots of nightlife  only one grocery store across the street that is limited in what it carries  The building is close to the metro but I don t recommend taking it unless you want to encounter questionable smells and sketchy characters    Out my three months at the apartments the elevator broke at least three times a month I stayed on the seventh floor and was not given the code to the back alley stairway until after I had to hunt zen city down through Airbnb and wait almost an hour for a response  If you re handicap or have trouble with stairs I wouldn t even risk booking a stay here    The entry to the apartment almost pick and chose when it would accept the code  Sometimes it wouldn t register the number until after the  rd try  and other times you would have to jiggle the handle to reset the system and then enter the code    The apartment looks like the pictures but it does not show the cracked paint  holes in window linings  the slow drains  and the weak water pressure    This unit is suitable for a very short term stay if it s the only option but I do not recommend it for travelers in need of extended accommodations  Update the apartment  address the weak water pressure  change the batteries in the tv remote because since check in it s been low  actually communicate about maintenance issues in the apartment so you re guests aren t caught off guard 
410088960720744875,yes yes
433281303476684844,Good location  good space  Not the cleanest but was good for a   day stay while working in Chicago 
391205038858195310,It was nice and comfortable Thanks
434717948423655452,Lovely place     bed   bath  and kitchen    Perfect for my family    Convenient location   Forest park   whole food   shake shack   Vietnamese food and many many more       church   There s some traffic noise   occasional sirens   but my family are ok with it   No problem    Thx for a beautiful stay Lovely place     The bathroom sink drainage is slow pls check  Thx for a beautiful stay
405772867422439360,Great location  beautiful space Thank you so much for being a great host
389855912182326785,Exactly as described  Perfect for what I wanted at the time 
389859598207304983,The lock to the room was broken when I tried to check in  and the door was wide open when I first got there  It was unsafe for me to stay so I wasted      on this Air BnB and had to get a hotel room downtown so I could have a place to stay where I wouldn t have to worry about someone breaking in 
744145528,Nice place as always 
444867323342794839,  several of the ights were burned out  wich left the lighting to be desired   the stove and sink were not clean   my guest had his truck stolen just outside the west side of the building  across from the federal reserve bank durring the day sometime between  am when i returned from work   and      ish when we checked out 
391285180985266847,Nice stay nice location everything was perfect Nice Stay Beautiful Place
389044843557619957,We really enjoyed the space   You are close to a blue line station which is super helpful  uber lyft is not much of an option in the city    The place is clean  tidy and well taken care of  One takeaway we had was that the listing said that shampoo  body soap and conditioner would be provided  but there wasnt anything in the space   This isnt a huge deal  but we did have to go shopping after a long day of travel to be able to take a shower   Overall we really enjoyed it and would recommend   I just would have packed travel soap Thank you so much for the stay   We really enjoyed the space   One takeaway we had was that the listing said that shampoo  body soap and conditioner would be provided  but there wasnt anything in the space   This isnt a huge deal  but we did have to go shopping after a long day of travel to be able to take a shower    Also the backdoor was difficult to open  so we just left it alone 
547122672758233004,By far the worst Airbnb experience we ve had  all because of management  There were a plethora of shortcomings with the apartment during our   week stay  but the worst was when our thermostat stopped working and the heat turned off when it was    degrees outside  After multiple attempts to work with Zencity to rectify the situation  days of them lying and telling me that maintenance was  on their way    someone finally came on day    only after I contacted Airbnb directly  We literally had to turn on the oven to heat the unit in the middle of winter  I travel for work and use Airbnb monthly  and have never been so frustrated than I was staying here  Do yourself a favor and keep scrolling 
389024267912298651,Great quite area   Easy free street parking    Kitchen could have been a little more clean 
388416503820082059,Overall  we enjoyed our stay  I m a Chicago native and I graduated from Kenwood  so I m familiar with the area  The location is amazing  However  we knew that cleanliness could be an issue  and it was  We knew that parking  could be an issue  and it was  The washer and dryer aren t in the unit and you ll need to navigate staying in an older building  If you choose to stay at this apartment  adjust your standards  I appreciated the quick response to our check in issues  The location is amazing as we were able to visit our family and the Museum of Science and Industry  However  the apartment could have been cleaner  It wasn t swept or vacuumed  one of the windows was open  one of the beds did not have a fitted sheet  and the fridge had an odor  Considering the amount we paid  which included a clean fee  we should not have had to sweep the apartment  We shouldn t have to navigate stains in the area rugs  We shouldn t have to hold our breath when opening the fridge  Our stay should ve been no fuss  especially considering the rules that are listed for the apartment and the cost 
471677130017273932,Great apartment   Good location and very clean Thank you so much for the stay  Great place
423842624661369104,Great location    short blocks from the Plaza  and the pool was a fantastic way to spend a Friday afternoon  Most tenants seem to be in their late   s and   s so the atmosphere was extremely chill and friendly  Staff was very helpful and courteous  The amenities are excellent and the apartment itself is sleek and clean  That bed was DIVINE and the place was quiet which made for some great sleep  Will stay here again in a heartbeat  We loved it here  Our only issue was with checkin  The keypad intercom at the main building entrance simply wouldnt work for us so we had to call the front office  They came out to troubleshoot it but it wouldnt work for them either  Luckily they just let us in so we could go upstairs and grab the key fob so we wouldnt have to fuss with it again  Minor hiccup but everything else was delightful  Next time we have a Kansas City getaway  I will look for this rental first  We would stay again in a heartbeat 
430369837506279792,Very spacious apartment and really attractive space with really comfortable beds  The price was affordable for the location  Some of the decor was a little sloppily done  paint splatters tile in main bathroom floor was broken and the door would not close  There were grubby fingerprints on the tv and the apartment appeared clean but had a slight stale cigarette smell  We had some difficulty checking in  when we entered the key code the door would not open  After repeated tries we called the rental agency and were told we needed to pull the door toward us  So we had a frustrating    minute or so delay getting in to the apartment  It would have been helpful if this tip were included in the checking info  A great neighborhood and an otherwise nice  very comfortable space somewhat marred by a little shabbiness and dinge  This could easily be remedied by better clean  which is warranted given the steep clean fee  We had a difficult time checking in bc the door would not open  we called for help and had to wait about    minutes to be told to pull the door toward us when opening  I would suggest including this in the instructions
389134496667856567,Good place  very modern   clean  great views  quiete  Nice A C good water pressure  SUPER COMFORTABLE beds  Overall everything was superb  There was small things that needed fixed like one or two bulbs were not functional and a couple hinges were loose in cabinets but it wasn t a major issue for me  Also I think the garage  had issues with access because the card didn t work to get me access but luckily the help button granted me free access to get in and out of private garage  Good place overall  some things needed updates  Some light bulbs did not work some hinges were broken at the kitchen cabinets  Besides the little small things there was one issue that was somewhat major  and that was parking  I m not sure if it was the card for unit     but it seemed as if it didn t have access to the indoor garage so luckily the help button on site granted me access to enter and leave every time I left the garage  Otherwise the parking bill would have been very expensive 
447084138854790974,Larger place than you might expect and the bedroom is DARK and relaxing  Walkable to cool restaurants  Real beautiful and quiet park of town  Great  functional kitchen    Remember you re dealing with a company  It s fine enough but the service isn t personal or particularly accommodating  The deal you sign will be the deal you get  If someone wants to extend  make it happen  Don t turn around and rent their place out 
388382311470395378,Great stay

465859928794621439,We especially appreciated the location of this Airbnb in Hyde Park  including its close access to parks  shoreline  sandwich shops and cafes  Although the room showed some of the aging associated with the historic building  we had everything we needed  including good internet connections  air conditioning  comfortable beds  clean bathrooms  and fully applianced kitchen  Thanks  We especially appreciated the location of this Airbnb in Hyde Park  including its close access to parks  shoreline  sandwich shops and cafes  Although the room showed some of the aging associated with the historic building  we had everything we needed  including good internet connections  air conditioning  comfortable beds  clean bathrooms  and fully applianced kitchen 
387671912697076046,Departamento est  bien ubicado y es lindo  pero  el anfitri n deber  mejorar la limpieza y el equipamiento del mismo  Nuestra estad a podr a haber sido mucho m s placentera si el departamento hubiese estado limpio y mejor equipado   Las camas son comodas y sabanas y toallas adecuadas  Falta aire acondicionado en el segundo dormitorio que tiene un ventilador chico que no refresca el ambiente  Fue casi imposible dormir all  ya q recibe todo el sol de tarde  La cocina estaba muy mal equipada  con vajilla rota y poca  No hay bols  para hacer una ensalada  ni rayador de zanahoria ni colador para mencionar algunas deficiencias  No hab a ni un salero en la cocina  La tarjeta para el lavarropas est  desactualizado y no sirve  Solo funcionan con tarjeta de cr dito  Es una lastima que el anfitri n no se muestre m s servicial ya que el Depto es lindo y bien ubicado 
387606459461056564,Great location  lovely apartment and truly brilliant building amenities  pool  gym  grills  roof lounge etc  perfect for a summer stay in Chicago  Hi  We loved the stay and think if anything youve undersold it in your ad  The building amenities and location are so great you could definitely feature them more     We had a lovely stay but a couple of things that would make it simply perfect  Spoons  tea   normal    baking tray  hangers or drawers for clothes storage  The cutlery drawer was also off its runner  I think your team knows but its quite heavy so definitely worth fixing before it falls on someone 
386907287611304551,Very nice Airbnb clean just makes sure there is nothing loud because I got a noise complaint over a fan  Can you please buy a fan for any next guest cause it was really hot in there that s why I got the noise complaint cause I had to get a fan 
425324929123417873,The location is amazing  but there were multiple problems during the stay  First  the codes to check in did not work so we were stuck outside the room for over half an hour while someone on the phone attempted to get us inside  Secondly  we were never given our door fobs to enter the building room so we had to use different codes  up to   digits long  every time we needed to leave the room  Thirdly  the elevators broke down at one point leaving us stranded on the   th floor while they were fixed  The room was great  and the location is amazing  the rest was problem after avoidable problem 
426820245072263565,This Airbnb was in a safe  beautiful apartment building that was within walking distance of many things we did during our visit  It was clean and comfortable and made for a great home away from home  Everything was as described and we had a smooth check in and check out process  thank you for allowing us to stay at your wonderful property  we had a great time 
410144793955722712,Great place to stay  Perfect place anyone who wants to visit St Louis
409423875724317183,We enjoyed our stay  The parking was great  comfortable bed and loved the amenities  Such a perfect location  We enjoyed our stay  Although when we first checked in it smelled like someone had just gone to the bathroom and there were some clean items missed 
419467653193221381,The location of the Airbnb is amazing  Right in the heart of Lincoln Park neighborhood  Check in was easy  all of my questions were answered within a reasonable amount of time  The Airbnb is more of a bare minimum space  if you are just looking for a place to sleep with minimal amenities in an awesome location this is the place for you 
393377354511162431,great location  exactly as described thank you place was great
401367788763740956,Great location  clean apartment 
400014721441469744,There isn t any parking near at all place was dirty pricing is good tho Please Add Option For Paid Parking
435476420588526967,Do not book with Zencity  They took my reservation and never sent me check in details  I waited around for   hours only to have to contact Airbnb for a refund  This occurred while sitting outside of the property 
391281991917592650,This place was pretty good so comfortable and have a beautiful view  I had an amazing stay   The place was perfect but the parking was so difficult   Everything else was amazing 
386170318583171685,Be prepared to fight with the door when you get there  it s impossible to unlock and they didn t tell us this until AFTER we d been trying to get inside for    minutes  Also they will try to scam more money from you  They were unprofessional upon check in  only informing us that the door was tricky to open AFTER we were locked out for    minutes and had called Them multiple times  They finally sent me a video on how to properly open the door  but they should have sent that to me up front    Also they tried to charge me extra money claiming we checked out too late and they were unable to host an event they had planned for that evening  However when I mentioned possibly wanting to book another night with them to extend our stay  they happily sent me a bill for      and didn t mention that they needed the space for an event that same day  Seems shady to me  Overall they could have been more professional
386161046264447218,Great area   The place was extremely nice  clean  parking wasn t bad  We stayed on a mon wed  One suggestion is that they should rent to only     ppl  The other residents complain of simple noise  The television  group conversation  It s an old building and the walls are thin so you should expect a lil sound 
386138221772597694,Fantastic apartment in the thick of wicker park  There is a lot about    miles away with reasonable daily parking rates  keep in mind that this is a  th floor walk up in case anyone in your party has any mobility issues  And do yourself a favor and grab some Devil Dawgs from next door  Had a great time  the apartment was lovely  would rebook 
389781377741390144,This downtown apartment was beautiful and was perfect for my husband and I and my in laws  We had plenty of space and everything was very clean  The check in process was a little confusing but once we got the keys and figured out how to use the elevators  it was a breeze  Would definitely recommend 
471657327442508965,Conveniently located  Great view  clean place  Would stay again
385402612836010361,A friend and I spent a week at this AirBNB  First the pros  The location is thirty minutes by bus from every major tourist attraction and fifteen or less by Uber Lyft  It s a great

it looks great in photos and also in person   Now the cons that we experienced are going to echo some previous reviews on this site  This is the first place run by a big leasing company that I ve stayed at and I was disappointed  Once we got into the apartment  we discovered the place was swarming with gnats  so many that the downstairs was uninhabitable  This necessitated another call to the      number where a man named Marty intimated that he knew they were there and immediately offered    dollars off our      stay  while telling us that we would have to take care of the situation

which we got to stare at for the remainder of our vacation  along with our bowls of stuff   The gnats never went away   Additionally  the internet was spotty and didn t work well enough for the tv to

In general  communication was poor  We received our check in information on time  but it was incorrect  There was no information in the apartment of expectations or other typical information that I m

airport   Each person that we talked to was a different person with a different understanding of the apartment  the history of our stay  and our requests   Finally  my last email from Zencity

384780626955689572,This place was great  Perfect for a solo or couple s trip   in a historically tich neighborhood  Vibes   mood are right out the door and a short walk around any corner Thank you so much for the stay  We really enjoyed ourselves    I ve been invited back for some speaking engagements so I hope to stay with you again  Thanks so much
384778174723872383,Really clean and comfortable living space  I booked this apartment for my mom and aunt who were visiting for my graduation  They are seniors and we needed something quiet  nearby our apartment  secure and comfortable  This was the perfect stay for them and check in and check out was very seamless  Thanks for the beautiful apartment  it worked perfectly  Only issue was that the wifi wasnt working and there wasnt responsiveness regarding that matter when we messaged the host  We were able to connect to a xfinity hotspot so it wasnt a huge problem but heads up 
392709645857700625,Such a nice stay 
386878232587202607,Good location  Very comfortable space  A good feel to it for either a weekend or an extended stay    Coffee shop downstairs makes for a great added extra 
384771289651075271,Good location  Not very clean  One of the comforters has a blood stain on it  couch was dirty and stained  floor was filthy overall the place was dusty  I think you should reconsider who you chose to clean this place 
384764097205200858,Awesome view of the city and provides easy access to food  including a grocery store on the first floor   parks  shopping  lakefront  and public transit   We would definitely want to stay here again  We really enjoyed our stay   Only thing to consider is whether theres a way to manage the shedding rug  This may have been more of an issue with our stay because our kiddo was playing on the rug  and on the couch and was getting rug fiber and  fur balls  everywhere   Also  stools at the kitchen bar top could be helpful to avoid food stains in the main living area 
384745670553837433,I think this spot is great in terms of location  but the bed was uncomfortable almost like it was broken  Also there s a really bad smell throughout the building and in the apartment   If you can withstand the smell   location and space of the apartment are perfect 
410048399571450266,Great neighborhood  location  and cute comfortable accommodations  Great location  cute place space  and comfortable beds  Need more outlets in the family room and detailed clean 
473938812639906776,Great space
384743283443240112,Overall it was a nice place  The view was great  free wifi  and for me parking was a breeze  It was a quiet place and the doormen were such nice people  Made check in smooth  The clean wasn t that great  When I got there there was still food and crumbs in the fridge from the previous guest  the floor needed to be swept and mopped  On the floor in the bedroom there was this weird sticky looking stuff on the floor by the closet  I didn t touch it to figure out what it was   And the window curtains were stained at the bottom  That part wasn t that big of a deal but appearance wise it could be something to think about  And the bathroom shower caddy is extremely dirty 
384698297435688954,Bed sheets on a couple rooms were not clean  other than that  things went smoothly Hi   A couple of things to note   First of all  the bed sheets were dirty  There was dirt  hairs  and they smelled like sweat  So I find appropriate to get a refund for the clean fee  since the apartment was not clean from the get go   Secondly  the code expired on the door lock  making us late for our flight  We had to call and figure out a new access code while the lyft was waiting for us at the entrance   Increased the lyft fare by       Please provide a refund for this as well   This is the first time that something like this happens to me at an airbnb   I know that sometimes these things happen  However  I find it fair to receive a refund for both the clean fee and the increased lyft fare given the inconveniences   Thank you  Juan Carlos
384687537867770871,Location for U Chicago is great  very close  Be ready for an old apartment  it is    years old building  Lobby nice room is old  Price is good  Carpet should be cleaner  If you want to have windowcurtain installed during their stay  you should let them know before they check in  We do noted elsewherecomfortable to have people walk into install curtain during this pandemic period 
430354384476224208,Great space in a safe location  Would stay here again 
384060853145448148,Really liked the location but we had difficulties at check in  Due to travel schedules  I arrived to the airbnb late where I discovered the lockbox containing the key was empty  I attempted to get ahold of someone and had to wait    minutes for someone to pick up the phone  on hold as its an office handling the property and not a person   At that point  the instructions to get into the building were not super helpful  the wifi information was incorrect and the place was not particularly clean  The bed sheets and towels were but the floor was not  There was also a lot of damage to the doors  walls and carpet  I liked the location but check in was difficult because of the issues with the key box  it took a while to get ahold of someone to help so I was stucking standing on the street at night with all my stuff in a neighborhood I didnt know  the information provided was all incorrect  including wifi and password  plus there was a lot of damage in the apartment and it was not very clean 
741592965,Great place
429612160054801389,My friends and I had a fantastic stay here  The apartment was comfortable  We were within walking distance of many attractions  We had a great stay  Thank you 
384058851085555987,Decently located  Zencity was helpful  A cute place with a small yet equipped kitchen  I would stay here again  Mariano was super helpful  I had a few concerns with the stay  First  the shower curtain has some mildew and could be changed  Also I asked questions twice through the app and didnt get any response  Other than that  we really enjoyed our stay 
384034285907114512,This was such a great location  Walking distance to tons of bars and restaurants in Wicker park  The inside was nice  living room area was spacious  The one thing to note is that the unit is on the fourth floor so there are LOTS of stairs to go up  which mostly was a pain when bringing all our luggage up but definitely manageable  The kitchen did not have many ingredient essentials which was fine for us but more of a heads up if you plan on cooking  Thanks for a great stay 
383997443839229331,Great unit  Great location  Great value  The space needs to be painted and given a little TLC  Hard to call it luxury just because of the location  However  because of the location and price  I d expect a better cared for space  Great unit  It needs a refresh 
754119001,Not Superhost quality  No hand towels in downstairs bathroom  No working lights in east bedroom  No working outlet in main bathroom  Needed a good clean  See message sent Sunday  May   at approximately      pm
393428911876459662,Great apartment and had everything I needed  Across the street from forest park and just a few blocks from Whole Foods 
391930927068814677,This space was incredible and very reasonably priced  Check in was easy and the rooms were very well presented  If traveling with larger groups or if you just desire more space  I highly recommend this location  Thank you for letting us stay 
407892643624375197,An amazing stay  stylish and in a great area I definitely recommend this stay to anyone in the saint Louis area 
489770598616879761,Good location and space  one of the bathrooms didn t work but not a big deal We accidently have your small pot from the kitchen  I can drop it off this week if needed
451436483193323493,Beautiful room and great location close to good restaurants  coffee stations  and the metro  Only complaints are that there s very little hot water pressure which sucks for showering and bathing  and the bed is super creaky  You can hear every move 
473903523910860909,great view  great location to be outside the city  city but close enough to Uber anywhere  downtown to st Charles for a decent price enjoyed my stay thankful  until next time
383997258161258493,The Zencity apartment was a good little apartment and it met our needs  There were a few things about the apartment that were a bit annoying  They only gave you one towel per person  a huge section of the blinds in our room were missing so the sun was SUPER bright  the place was fairly clean but you could tell is was done quickly as tons of dust and such piled up in the corners  there was absolutely zero amenities in the kitchen to use  this may be due to COVID   and there was no seating in the living room other than a small couch  so it wasnt the best for hanging out  They also came over to fix things  not requested by us  twice during our stay  With that said  the location was great   it was right by the metro  The check in process was smooth and easy and the price was great for the location  Overall  if you just need a place to sleep thats affordable and easy access to downtown and other areas of Chicago  its a great option 
383995700607618296,The apartment was clean  comfortable  and laid out as advertised  The main issue was that the wifi connection did not work  We contacted the host  a management company  via website and phone  and they didnt get back to us until the next day  The solution was to give us a different hotspot link  which did work for the duration of our stay  There was also a weird communication issue where we were emailed an invitation to extend our stay by a night or elect for late check in on the last day  but when we tried to confirm  the host was unable to approve the extension and apologized for the confusion 
390570685068544943,You get what you pay for  There are SO many reasons this place is significantly cheaper than places around St  Louis  The floor was so sticky it was hard to walk in the room and it reeked   When we got there  there was no fob for access to the building  and no one answering the calls for the access code  We never received a replacement fob which impacted our access into the building as well as the parking garage  This meant we had to pay for parking every    hours in a public lot  The floor was so sticky it was hard to walk in the room  We never received a fob which impacted our access into the building as well as the parking garage  This meant we had to pay for parking every    hours in a public lot 
410130444638033692,Located steps away from Lake Michigan  this is a bright  clean and comfortable place  Perfect for visiting University of Chicago  So glad to see the new couch 
383982654185273965,Corner flat was nice  I would have been nice to have   keys for building access 
383975565700271309,Great location and a lot of space  Thanks 
383305118435319135,We had a bad experience  We stayed there for more than   months  The kitchen doesnt have an oven tray  pyrex or anything to be able to use it  after they said they dont provide it we had to buy one   The oven was dirty  but they clean it the day after we told them  They also dont have tea spoons or anything to be comfortable cooking eating there  When we arrived the bed slat was broken in many places  the living room lamp and one of the bathroom lamps were not working  These thing were resolved     days after we told them  They dont have cable tv and the firestick stopped working correctly  had to reset it many times every night  We asked for a replacement and after   weeks of waiting  and complaining  they told me to buy it and that I was going to be reimbursed  They never did  and they are not replying my messages regarding this  Honestly  in my opinion  the only good thing about this apt is that it is nice  true to the pics   If you are planning on staying for a few couple of days and dont want to cook there  it might be ok  But dont expect to feel homey  Also  keep in mind that it doesnt has a dinner table  just a coffee table  as you can see in the pics   From all the airbnb apt houses that Ive stayed in the US  by far this was the worst  I believe you could have make us feel great with really little effort money  The things we were asking for are simple easy things  something to be able to cook in the oven  tea spoons  solve the firestick issue    after   weeks of waiting for a new firestick I was told I could buy one and you were going to reimburst the money  I feel scamed    not only you havent done it  but also you dont reply to my messages regarding this issue  I believe after paying over       we deserved not to have to buy our own firestick and oven tray  I feel disappointed  I have stayed in many airbnb apts houses in US and this one was the worst experience  In the rest of the places  you felt more at home  they even had coffe tea sugar olive oil conditioner and shampoo  big bottle not the tiny ones   I dont think you care  so I am not sure why am I wasting the time to write these    
407920616242749780,When we first got there we didn t have to put in the code the door was broke so that was the first issue  Walking in the whole building smelled like weed cigarettes  All we he was a sheet to sleep with there was no blanket  The room itself was clean but the location was terrible  The Airbnb is a room basically in the projects just tidied up  I wouldn t stay here again  I didn t feel safe walking from the garage to the building  When we first got there we didn t have to put in the code the door was broke so that was the first issue  Walking in the whole building smelled like weed cigarettes  All we he was a sheet to sleep with there was no blanket  The room itself was clean but the location was terrible  The Airbnb is a room basically in the projects just tidied up  I wouldn t stay here again  I didn t feel safe walking from the garage to the building 
386192505966786962,The check in process was awful  there was no intercom for us to enter the building like the check in instructions described  We had to wait for someone who lived there to let us in  Furthermore  they did not leave us a key for us to get in and out of the building and did not provide one until a day later so we could not leave the building  Also  was later contacted by the host that there was evidence of BEDBUGS in the couch so we needed to leave immediately  We tried many times to contact the host for these problems but would always be on hold  given an inconclusive answer  and no help  In the end we had to hound down a security guard to help us 
407218675909454098,We had a lovely stay at this Zencity Airbnb  Its a great location in Hyde Park right next to the lake and   th St  beach  The unit itself was everything we needed  and the check in was very simple  The front desk staff were always present and very helpful    Parking may be a bit tricky if you plan on coming and going frequently  theres free on street on the side roads   but we always managed to eventually find a space within a short walk  You can also park temporarily right outside the Windemere to load and unload your stuff     Great place  Would definitely recommend  Thanks Zencity  We had a great stay
390581126734825412,This building is gorgeous and located in a lovely neighborhood  Apartment is very spacious and has amazing natural light  Across the street is the Science   Industry museum along with multiple parks  I was working remote for work during my stay  Wifi was fast and building was great  Will definitely stay again  Apartment was lovely and very spacious  Only positive things to say 
409320720869328166,We were very disappointed with the level of cleanliness in the apartment  Everything felt very dirty and the shower was clogged so it was overflowing every time we tried to shower  The shower curtain was also dark brown on the bottom and should be replaced  The apartment also smelled like vomit and cigarettes  All the sheets in the beds had stains on them  including blood  and didn t smell clean  The carpet and couches were extremely dirty  It was also very uncomfortable to work remotely because the dining table chairs did not fit the table properly  We were also very uncomfortable that there was an automated noise complaint message that we received in the middle of the night  even though we were sleeping  The lack of noise insulation made it very difficult to sleep through the night since this apartment is on a busy street and right next to an emergency room  Also  the lights were severely flickering every time we turned them on and made us concerned for the safety of the place because of how many old buildings in this neighborhood don t have updated electricity  There was also no shampoo left for us and a very limited supply of dishes silverware which would have been nice considering how much we paid for the place  The bed in the front room also has a broken frame  Overall  for the amount that we paid for the place  this did not meet a basic level of expectation  We were very disappointed with the level of cleanliness in the apartment  Everything felt very dirty and the shower was clogged so it was overflowing every time we tried to shower  The shower curtain was also dark brown on the bottom and should be replaced  The apartment also smelled like vomit and cigarettes  All the sheets in the beds had stains on them  including blood  and didn t smell clean  The carpet and couches were extremely dirty  It was also very uncomfortable to work remotely because the dining table chairs did not fit the table properly  We were also very uncomfortable that there was an automated noise complaint message that we received in the middle of the night  even though we were sleeping  Also  the lights were severely flickering every time we turned them on and made us concerned for the safety of the place because of how many old buildings in this neighborhood don t have updated electricity  There was also no shampoo left for us and a very limited supply of dishes silverware which would have been nice considering how much we paid for the place  The bed in the front room also has a broken frame  Overall  for the amount that we paid for the place  this did not meet a basic level of expectation 
389084464839814132,This Airbnb is in a great location  The apartment is spacious  clean and comfy  The check in process was seamless and the host responded quickly to all questions  I would definitely stay again  This Airbnb was great  It s in a great location and very spacious  The only thing we had trouble with was the tv not being able to connect to the internet so we were unable to use it 
382551093134881689,I was surprised how quiet this place was  Ive lived right by the train before in Chicago but this was by the train AND quiet  I loved the space  clean and comfortable bed  PERFECT location in boyztown  Love this place  would book again  The check in directions might also want to include the multiple doors in the front have a timer on it  which i know it says you have like    seconds  but maybe another mention would be good  it took me a second 
430378555210413614,A great stay  The roof top is beautiful and the area is very nice  Thanks for the great stay
420343931689659561,Great location  and once we saw the place it would have been perfect  However they didn t send check in Information  once they finally did send Information it was wrong  Once we finally got ahold of them after   hours of going back and forth they still were not able to give us keys to access the building fully the way we needed to  We ended up cancelling after       hours of back and forth and had to last minute book a hotel instead  which wasn t the easiest to find for the same price  They were easy to work either after to get a full refund which we greatly appreciated but definitely not something I will deal with again nor will I ever book with Zencity  I have always loved Airbnb and this was my first terrible experience  but it definitely makes me hesitant about ever booking one in the future  Hopefully this place can figure it out because it really was a great location and would have been perfect for my family  but after reading reviews seems like there is something always wrong  Wish I Would have read Into that more 
410154884946939668,Very nice  clean  modern space in the heart of downtown  Would definitely recommend  Everything was great besides the AC being out  Spot was very clean  spacious and the location was great 
407145897399542557,Great place to stay  nice value   location I know there was a quick turn around from the time I booked until check on time  That being said  the place was gorgeous and the cleaners did a good job making things LOOK clean  There were fingernails in the bedroom further from door  broken glass on the floor in the living room  and stray hair in several places  Other than that I enjoyed my stay   the instructions made check in easy 
392682094041394050,it s beyond my expectation  highly recommended    nothing to suggest very much satisfied
381879534706582978,Really nice perfect place to stay   I would recommend others  Great location  Perfect place to stay thank you   
381851590300716870,My boyfriend  and I planned a last minute trip to Chicago and drove there  The location of the airbnb is amazing  It is close to all of the stores and lots of restaurants  We felt safe in the area and the apartment building had a doorman on staff all night  The airbnb has a balcony with a beautiful view and you really get to enjoy the city of Chicago  The airbnb was the perfect size for two people  maybe you could fit a third  They also had Hulu and Netflix on the Tv which was nice  There was a washer dryer as well  It felt like home and was very enjoyable  Loved the apartment complex too  they had a fitness room pool table fireplace  We will stay there again on our next trip  Only con if you drive is parking  a little confusing and was pricey  The garages are more expensive then the street parking  but we felt more comfortable parking in the garage  Loved it    Suggestion  Maybe explain the parking situation or specifically suggest a garage  Parking was difficult to understand and the garages were extremely pricey 
381797384912244237,Great stay  Super easy check in and wonderful location in walking distance to so many things  Thank you so much for a great stay  We had a great time 
389091657495016637,Simple  convenient studio apartment  Great communication from the host about checking in and out  The apartment is directly above the L train but it was not too noisy  My one complaint is that the lights from the train station shine through the curtains all night so bring an eye mask if you are sensitive to light when sleeping  Otherwise  great stay overall  Simple  convenient studio apartment  Great communication about checking in and checking out  It is directly above the L train but it was not too noisy  My one complaint is the light   the lights from the train station shine through the curtains all night  Otherwise  it was a great stay overall 
407186530223030999,Great location  felt super safe the whole time  The only problem was parking  which isn t the airbnb s fault  but you will be able to find free parking within a   minute walk which was great  I would      stay here again  Everything was super clean  and had a hotel feel to it but in a homely way  Thank you Zencity   Thanks again  
391279568049637089,This was a great location in a great neighborhood  The place was nice and as pictured  For the price I paid  this was perfect and I would most definitely book with Zencity again  THANKS    Thank you for a pleasurable experience at your apartment  It was exactly what I needed and the location was perfect  I enjoyed my stay 
744635652,Absolutely beautiful house  Awesome amenities   Quick response  I love the fact there is recycling  most places dont have that option  The house was amazing  my kids     year olds  really enjoyed the house  it is beautiful   Just a side note too make sure you know  there is something leaking under the kitchen sink  it is a sticky substance so may be clean supplies  also the full bath on the  nd floor  the screws in the door are stripped and therefore the door does NOT clear the vent   The top floor bathroom the toilet moves   Lastly  again  not complaining just FYI and suggestions  since the house is so incredibly large  it is VERY difficult to cook with just   pans      Absolutely LOVE the fact that you have spices and coffee and filters  We contributed to the spice collections and left powdered creamer  we figured that would be OK   
405015517399155884,This is in a great location if you are wanting to go to a Cubs game  check out food places or shop at all small little stores  The customer service guy that took the call was really nice  The apartment walls could use some scrubbing as there are scuff marks and dirt on them  The only complaint I have is that there were two adults staying there for two nights and we were only provided   towels and   wash clothes  When I called about it they did get with the clean crew  however  they couldn t bring them until the next day  We needed the towels for the first night as well  so that part is disappointing about our stay  Hello  The suggestion I would make is to provide more towels for the guests  Although you guys did bring us more towels it was on the last day we were there  I needed the extra towels for both days  Also the rug by the door needs to be moved  we were only able to open the door part of the way 
381788702820404737,The smoke smell was unbearable  so we left early  As mentioned in a previous review  messages from Zencity were automated and did not acknowledge our complaints  The previous problems around check in and wifi code have not been addressed  so you will need to read the previous review to know how to open the door and connect to wifi  Additionally  the A C unit could not keep up  so the apartment never got under    degrees while we were there  I received no acknowledgement about the smoke smell being unbearable  You should not be renting this place on Airbnb until you remediate it 
768416350,Great location  relatively clean  would prefer floors then carpet  It s very hot no air conditioner  I had a lot of trouble to gain access to the apartment  I don t recommend for summer  The check in experience was horrible  I was tempted to cancel  I had so much trouble obtaining the key  The host seems to be a corporation which does not provide the best experience because they are not even aware of the condition of the apartment   The apartment was not comfortable no Air conditioner and Chicago is now in the      hot temperatures 
392654654206892927,I would stay again  For the price and location  it worked for us  Great rooftop sunset  We had no problems with access to the unit as others had complained  but the floors  specifically could have been cleaner  We had an easy time getting in and out and like the locations a lot  two suggestions     mop the floors between each stay  I splashed water on the floor and when I wiped it up it was terribly dirty     add door stops and then repair the walls  fridge 
430401819780927893,great place  great place  super convenient
768339471,This place is just okay  It s an old building and apartment that hasn t been updated at all  It s a great location  The internet is very weak and we struggled to have a zoom meeting  There were no amenities at all   no coffee maker  salt  sugar  nothing   so be prepared 
768092918,Nice location  but bring your own towels and bed stuff  The place was not properly clean and tons of stains on all sheets   The front staff was very nice  Nicely located and free parking on the streets 
767893867,Great spot  great accommodations and the perfect weekend 
767797504,Very simple place  great location  No air conditioning  it was very hot  I was in town during a    degree weather weekend   prepare accordingly Get an air conditioning unit
767502461,This was a great location  We enjoyed our stay 
767384704,What a great place  Location was perfect for Wicker Park  downtown  etc and it was quiet and quaint  Street parking is a plus  The unit was spacious and suitable for our group  Would recommend and stay again  Thanks for letting us stay  The place was very spacious and was exactly what we wanted  Very grateful for plenty of free street parking too  One thing I will mention is that there was definitely a urine like scent that did not come from outside  so that s about the only thing 
450674758707009695,great location
767275685,The airbnb was amazing  Great location  walking distance from Wrigley strip  Thank you for everything  I really enjoyed staying at your property 
766595834,The bed was comfy  The noise level was unexpected  Not only the bars  but the neighbors and the bus  Not on the same level of cleanliness as other Airbnb s I ve stayed in previously  Overall  it wasn t so bad that I felt I had to move  but I probably wouldn t stay in this unit again  This is more for someone who wants to go out and party  not ideal for a business trip  The floors   bathroom were very dirty  Other people s hair on the floors bed and bathroom  Very disappointed   The noise was unreal  Not only the bars  but the neighbors and the bus  Maybe     hours of sleep 
766302253,Awesome place to work from for a few days  Would return Thanks for the stay
766254733,AMAZING Spot  Value was incredible for price  Place comes fully stocked like a time share  Kitchen fully stocked with dishware  pots and pans  Bathroom fully stocked like a hotel batheoom  The two bedroom extremely comfortable space  beds  and clean  Climate control was automatic and on point  The stackable washer and dryer comes with ALL Clear detergent pods ready to wash which was very convenient  There is a little market approximately    ft  away for anything you need  The parking you just need to be mindful about but we easily found parking nightly in the residential area at the corner street   ft away  I would definitely use this Airbnb again  Zenity did an amazing job of keeping the house  move in ready   There were minor details that if addressed would make the place   stars  The floors especially in the entrance  hallway  and living room area were not very clean  They were swept  Although i decided to walk bear foot one evening and my feet ended up black and sticky  The carpet were the coffee table is same problem for same reason that is a high traffic area and its vaccuumed but not very clean  I decided to sit on the carpet instead of floor to stretch and the gunk was visible  Same goes for the couch and chair  So if that high traffic area the couch  chair  and carpert was deep clean it would be a great improvement  The bed in the last bedroom is tremendously squeaky and any little movement made could be heard throughout the home  Also we did not know were to put our trash when we emptied the trashcans  So we just ended up dumping it in the back blue dumpster  A heads up for guest like a little note on the cute chalkboard in the kitchen  Lastly my teenage son was with us and would have appreciated an extra TV in bedroom   We kind of took over the TV and he retreated to his bedroom on the phone and tablet but another TV would have been nice  Oh and I almost forgot the bathtub was extremely slippery when wet  we kept a towel in the bathtub at all times so we wouldnt sleep  So one of the thise tub mats would work well 
765963451,Everything was as expected Enjoyed the stay thanks for having me
389126832697665858,This is a great place to stay  Only about       minutes away from Downtown  Very clean and well kept 
386862524109101866,You will love the location of this unit if you are looking to access downtown and the river market   Lots to do and explore and you are right in front of a stop for the free city trolley   Unit was very clean  but you will be on your own to figure out what is available for the gym  trash disposal  etc   When you do figure it out  its great   The gym is not heavily used  and the open workspaces are all over the place for you    If you want peace and quiet  this is not the place for you   Most nights the neighbors were very noisy   Zencity is quick to respond  but their answers are not always complete   I spent three weeks on site  so I ended up figuring everything out  but would have liked some additional information   Look at other units if you need workspace for computer  this unit only had a chair the kitchen table and the configuration is a bit odd   Kitchen has the basics  but no cooking utensils  well  one    so bring some with you if you plan on cooking   Bedroom and closets are spacious  laundry is  full size and great  I feel like even though Zencity made efforts at communication  they did not provide a map to the property amenities and left you on your own to figure things out   Also  the photos were taken at deceptive angles implying more space than the unit actually had   Property was entered without notice or permission for exterminators   Property had inadequate kitchen supplies   virtually no kitchen tools   only a plastic spoon to cook with   The location made up for the lack of information  but this could have been solved with some info left in the unit   On the good side   great clean supplies   very convenient and appreciated 
765917729,Great location  nice little studio 
500731284640794263,We had booked this place for two days but our flight was delayed until the following morning  Upon arrival  we found a dirty rental  The carpet grossly stained and covered with debris  the walls were stained  dirty utensils remaining in the dishwasher  and a bedside table stained  When we contact Zencity  they offered us a clean during our stay  However by the time we received noticed of their offer  it was already evening and we were too tired to be inconvenienced by having a clean crew in the rental while we wanted to rest   We were leaving in the morning   I did my best to vacuum but the vacuum available was not good    There is a nice coffee shop in the building  The location is convenient  The apartment would be much better had it been clean  We had booked this place for two days but our flight was delayed until the following morning  Upon arrival  we found a dirty rental  The carpet grossly stained  the walls were stained  dirty utensils in the dishwasher  and dirty bedside table  When we contact Zencity  they offered us a clean during our stay  However by the time we received noticed of their offer  it was already evening and we were too tired to be inconvenienced by having a clean crew in the rental while we wanted to rest   I did my best to vacuum but the vacuum available was not good    I recommend that a better clean crew and also to have the apartment repainted walls fixed especially in the areas that are very visible damaged or distressed     I am still waiting to hear back regarding our last message 
765916797,Nice place and convenient jumping off point for Hyde Park adventures 
765358764,Great stay  
410811527488422079,very nice updated apartment  was in a safe neighborhood  was happy to stay here 
767893854,Nice clean quiet place
389050643003015978,Location is awesome but unit just doesn t measure up to pics or my standards  I should have went with hotel instead this time around  Hi  I did send pics of the mold in shower tub caulking  The unit overall did not look clean and did not have fresh smell at all I had to had fresh smell myself  The A C does not cool entire unit and with TV only being in living room space it was simply uncomfortable staying here  The remote stopped working on day two  Yes  the replacement was offered  I would clean routines  A C performance  adding TV in bedroom  The price was not worth the stay  Thanks 
427445138743013642,This was my first Airbnb and I have to stay it was great  The check in process is super easy and the directions they gave were clear and easy to follow  When I first arrived the unit smelled a smidge of smoke but after about    min it when away and I didn t notice it for the rest of the stay  WiFi isn t the best  It s kinda slow and makes it hard to do too much on their internet  I didn t need it much so it didn t bother me  There is only street parking or garage parking  I did street parking and honestly didn t have any problems with leaving my car or finding a spot  Highly recommend  It was an amazing stay  This was my first week as a travel nurse so the stress was already high with starting a new job  You made it so much easier  Thank you 
407908766479651826,Super clean and a really nice place to stay in KC  Great location too  This place was awesome  Thanks 
527495520986563589,This place is really exceeded our expectations  We really loved this place and felt that it was very comfortable  My girlfriend really felt that it had a feeling of a home  I would recommend this stay to any and everyone    The building is very quiet and it s in a good location  I don t wanted to really thank Kline for everything he did for us  We had a little rough check in but he was there whole way to make it easier for us 
430404721159005043,Great location  Thank you for your hospitality   
391997702189420443,Great location  Amazing view  Thanks for the wonderful stay 
765124208,Great location and tons of charm  but the cleanliness wasn t great and wifi was terrible Lots of charm and great location but there were a couple setbacks  The entry code we were given was incorrect and we were stuck outside in the cold  rain trying to get in  Secondly cleanliness was not great  It didn t seem like they clean the floors at all  Third  there was a lack of attention to detail  No liners in trashcans  no coffee maker  very basic amenity   the water filter on the fridge was     days overdue  dishwasher smelled really bad  not many cups  plates  the downstairs bathroom didn t have a way to dry hands    It s a great Airbnb  with a good scrub and some small adjustments it could be great 
765108474,Location is great  apartment has the basic essentials and overall is cute  Was just   of us and felt like a good size space but think it would be fine for   people for a short stay  Walls are a little thin and can hear the neighbors but overall we enjoyed our experience 
764928021,This studio unit is a good size for a couple  though a little bare feeling  There are two chairs at the table and a bed to sit on  There wasn t really a place to unpack clothes except hangers  It seemed clean  Everything worked fine  Check in and out is easy and contactless  Communication was good  The view is of the train tracks  which you do hear  it sounded like jets rumbling  I had to wear earplugs but I am a light sleeper  The bathroom had plenty of counter space and drawers and the shower worked well  The best thing was probably its proximity to everything  Thank you for a place to stay in a very convenient location and easy check in and out 
410786922598072796,Great stay   Beautiful complex 
763762969,Great location  great view  Train stop nearby and bus stop right out the door  Perfect accommodations  Thanks for a great stay  Everything was perfect  Would have taken the garbage out but didnt know where to take it  lol 
763751497,The location is really nice with good restaurants and necessity stores nearby  Quiet neighborhood  felt very safe  The place itself is roomy  but nothing too big  Cleanliness was alright  Before you get to the site  make sure you ask them if appliances are working because when I was there  it wasn t  Overall  good place to stay at if you re gonna be wandering the city  Hey there  I would suggest making sure all the appliances are clean and working before guests arrived  There was hair inside our fridge that wasn t ours  When we tried using the microwave  it was not working even when we unplugged and restarted the power in the outlet  I assumed the place was bigger so make sure to add the square footing of the building to the photos 
763395733,This studio has a perfect amount of space and an even more perfect view of Lake Michigan  We loved how clean it was and we loved the location  walking distance to the beach and TONS of delicious restaurants  We will absolutely be returning for another little escape  Thank you so much  We had an amazing time and we ll absolutely be returning 
430377441972953234,Everything was Great    location wonderful  Thanks again for everything
410885096600430410,Had a great time I will be coming back Great home had everything for me look Just like the pictures will stay here again
763373936,Cute spot  Really great location  easy access to restaurants and bars 
410853698120340150,if you plan on using the kitchen  just make sure you bring or buy the essentials  cooking oil  utensils  trays   other than that we LOVED our stay   
444208613843712462,Apartment looked exactly as it does in the photos  Would definitely book here again 
763119227,Nice place  nice area  Great host  fast responses  However  I would suggest a new sofa in the living room area  Beds are super comfortable   was my fav 
763084958,Huge place  great value   awesome outdoor area  amazing location I would have stayed a full week if it was available   Made me consider what a purchase would be like Better internet would be appreciated as I had work to do 
763055295,It was over all an okay place to stay  First   days the air was not working took them two days to get back in contact with me  The bathroom shower curtain was dirty like it haven t been clean  There was so much stuff from previous stay that was in the couch 
390580216229050237,This apartment is spacious and the location is perfect if you are looking for the downtown experience  The views are amazing and we were able to enjoy beautiful sunsets overlooking the city  It is also within walking distance of the Arch  City Museum  Union Station and restaurants which was great for our family  Highly recommend staying here  We had an amazing time and the apartment was just what we needed  The location was perfect and having a parking spot made everything easier  The only suggestion is to stock basics like salt  We didnt bring that with us and couldnt find any in the kitchen  Thank you  
762868063,Beautiful view and great location  Beautiful view and great location 
762560665,This property was filthy  Stains on the couch and bedding  dirt grime on all of the walls as well as in the tub shower  dirty appliances  debris on the floors  etc  I left immediately  booked a hotel  and am making other arrangements for my stay in Chicago  I travel for work  staying in Airbnbs for    months out of the year and will never book with zencity again  as they clearly do not manage or maintain their properties well 
762548048,This place is very clean and peaceful and the view is breathtaking I will be back    The only thing u can do is fix the water pressure when u take a shower it is very low  
430387418836775702,Nice place in a great location   Would stay there again  Thanks a lot  we had a great stay 
764355096,Everything as expected  Looks just like the photos  comes stocked with some linens and kitchen   bathroom essentials  Location is a close walk to a couple of the commercial strips in Hyde Park
389046434735781651,This was a great stay Everything pictured is accurate except it s more spacious in person  Only thing I didn t like is the limited parking  in which they tell you this   and there is one window ac unit and it s in the living room so the air doesn t circulate as well to the bedroom  Ideal location  Nice view  Would definitely book again 
451408866695550470,THE GOOD  BAD AND UGLY GOOD   AC  washer and dryer worked well   Unit was well supplied with paper products   Customer service rep  Andrea and maintenance man  Jeremiah were very good in responding to problems  See below  BAD   Property was very dirty  kitchen floor and AC vent were black with dirt   smudges on the walls  drapes were falling off the wall and blind were missing slats and draw strings resulting lack of privacy and security issues  repair took two weeks   Sections of flooring in the hallway were missing which could cause a stumble and fall  UGLY   We had a    day pre paid lease and were illegally locked of our unit for more than    hours   We had to go to a hotel without fresh clothing  sundries and medications  After returning to the apartment we could not leave the unit because the access key pad had be improperly installed and would not lock    Another call to have something fixed 
410835417411008032,Parking will be tough   but the place is decent  
410798325888422363,Loved staying here  The place is in a fantastic location  is super sleek  and very comfortable  Highly recommend 
408609176306296081,This was my second time staying with Zencity in KC  The first time was better  We didnt have the WiFi for our unit available when we moved in  and it took five days for them to get back to us and have someone come out and fix it  Also there was a lot of construction in the building during our stay  Very noisy 
409375914746510320,Very nice  Good location as far add access to downtown KC  Nice resturant bar downstairs  Highly recommend  The only issue was that the key coffee did not cone through  but appreciated having a  hr phone number to get help with that    As far as the place  it is strange to only have sink in the kitchen  other than that I enjoyed my stay  Thank you 
410106772705329580,Flawless experience  Thank you so much for the amazing stay 
423915699406779457,Great place to stay 
386184998458530445,Its a nice space   good location in downtown Kansas City  Looks good for extended stays as well  The check in code was incorrect for me and never got resolved  Otherwise its a nice place to stay and in a decent location 
391219159442315829,Good view of Lake Michigan and simple check in with the on site staff 
386223946702342039,great stay  location is wonderful checking was very easy and convenient our stay with wonderful communication was a parent  everything was great  always a great stay with Zencity  the location is great check in was great this day was wonderful communication was very apparent  definitely will stay again
741117421,This space is definitely great as far as getting around in hyde park  it has everything thats listed  Its clean and the host is responsive  overall everything was basically as described  there were a few things Id say were a tiny bit disappointing  there was a drip in the kitchen sink  the bed squeaked  very loudly and the blinds were kind of torn up  it was also a little disconcerting not knowing where the camera or cameras were 
431865323495512808,Great space  Thanks 
431824633739495643,The apartment itself was a nice place  Getting into the apartment was the problem  The lock didn t respond to the codes I received so I had to call them for an hour and try to figure out how to get into the place  It didn t seem like anybody checked on the place before I arrived  Check in was very unfortunate  The customer service was helpful overall  but it was tough to be in a hallway for an hour trying to get into the apartment  The place was mostly clean but some things stuck out  such as some spilled things on the floor when we entered as well as hair around the place  Also the chairs on the porch are kinda broken 
762246634,Nice open studio  Very convenient location  right next to the train station but you cant really hear it at all inside  Nice  secure building  didnt hear any neighbors or noise  Host was great with communication and info about check in out  Wasnt as clean as I had hoped  but overall really great place to stay  Great studio to stay in  Thanks for the clear and detailed check in out instructions  Building was nice and apartment was quiet and secure  nice amenities included    The only issue was cleanliness when we checked in  the rental wasnt thoroughly clean between guests  There was a glass of water on the window sill  food remnants on the stovetop and long dark hairs all over the floor    Other than that it was a good experience  Thank you 
761752817,An excellent location for shops  restaurants and the University of Chicago in a  safe neighborhood and building  The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen was adequately furnished  There were nice fluffy white towels and the bathroom had plenty of amenities and supplies  We would definitely return to this delightful apartment  I gave you an excellent review  on the assumption that the air conditioning will be fixed before the next guests arrive  I would suggest a bit more wall decor  The space is very bland with just a couple small pictures  rather randomly placed  A bottle of olive oil would be a great addition  as with a small set of salt and pepper  I had thought you would be willing to give a     discount because of the lack of air conditioning on those very hot Chicago days  You might wish to consider a couple small fans since the windows don t open very much and air circulation is minimal  I hope you were able to locate the source of the leak in the kitchen before too much more damage was done  FYI  when we reported FYI  when we reported the leak downstairs  the response was  I will send an email   That is  a lack of recognition that it was a serious problem 
386923401772057569,We found the unit very comfortable and well located  Area was quite safe and we enjoyed walking in downtown KC  There are enough restaurants and transportation close by so you can manage without a car   The unit s amenities   kitchen supply is lacking   but hopefully will be improved   It is roomy  beds are comfortable and it was a bonus to have a washer and dryer to use  Staff was reachable by phone and helpful when needed   All in all  a good value and I would definitely stay in the future  We thought the unit was great  Checkin is a bit tricky for two retired folks but we managed   Feel that in a new unit like this  you need to provide a few more kitchen amenities   We had one teaspoon and one tablespoon    The addition of a real coffee maker and a toaster would be a big improvement    Also the plugs behind the sink did not work and it was very slow to get hot water in the kitchen sink   Staff were easy to reach and very helpful so would definitely stay again if available 
761719425,Great stay  Hyde park is incredible
485529351461901877,Good location to downtown and easy check in  Thanks for the stay  Had a good time  Good location 
433324271414108727,This apartment and experience was both the best and the worst of AirBnB   First  the good news  The apartment was great for what we wanted to do  namely  explore Chicago with our two teenage daughters     and      The location was fantastic  The apartment was really spacious  it was actually bigger than in looked in the pictures   with a large central room  two good sized bedrooms  and a ton of closet space  The small study was a great addition when people had to work online  and having the extra half bath was convenient  The space was light filled  with big windows  and the A C worked well    we were very comfortable even in a hot Chicago summer   The place was remarkably quiet  given that it was on a busy intersection  Unlike other Air BnBs weve had in the past  there were no surprise restaurant smells  If this were a private home the bathroom would need to be completely redone and updated  but it was functional for an AirBnB  Overall  the building and the apartment have a sort of decayed elegance that was charming  real parquet floors    The place was clean  with fresh new towels and linens  The neighborhood is terrific  and the girls could come and go on their own  It was super easy to take the bus downtown  It was much better staying here than the   of us cramming in a double hotel room  and much cheaper than the   of us staying in   hotel rooms    The bad news  We had a disastrous check in experience  We had received instructions on how to retrieve the keys to the building and the apartment from a lockbox outside the building  Check in time was       We actually arrived at the address at       and respectfully waited in the car  parked in a loading zone  until      in case there were cleaners in the apartment  At that point I jumped out and put the code into the lockbox    which turned out to be empty   The next day  when we finally got into the apartment  the keys were hanging on the peg with the  return keys here  sign    we presume the clean crew simply forgot to return the keys to the lockbox   From my fading iPhone   I sent several messages to Zencity through AirBnB  and my husband and I both called the Zencity contact number    he got through to someone  but as soon as he said that there was no key in the box the call was dropped  or they hung up  he thinks   I was on hold for    minutes before giving up  So there we were  sitting in the car for about two hours in a loading zone with a car full of stuff and teenagers in the blazing sun  thank you  nearby Target bathrooms  with no Plan B  I went on Booking com and managed to find us a hotel room  We finally heard from a Zencity rep around       and he gave us the codes for the other lockboxes  the  backup  box and cleaners   But by that point we were already in the hotel  Zencity did agree to refund us for the amount of our hotel bill for that first night  but it was terribly inconvenient and stressful  My sense was that Zencity is an organization based in California  and that they didnt have anyone actually on the ground in Chicago  If that is the business model  they need to have a hotline of sorts where people can immediately speak to someone if there is a problem  They advertise a one hour response time  but that was not our experience  Good apartment  but there need to be more layers of back up plans when the system of leaving the key in the lockbox fails    as it did for us  We couldnt get into the apartment  and it was about   hours until we finally got in touch with a Zencity representative who could help us by providing the codes for the other lockboxes  by which point we had already checked into a hotel    FYI  the ceiling fan in the living room closest to the kitchen needs to be fixed  and it is time to mop the floors 
761635107,This is a very nice studio  in a great neighborhood  perfect for   people looking for a getaway  The host communication was great  check in was smooth  easy  with simple directions to follow  The apartment was clean and was able to provide me with everything I needed for the weekend  Thank you so much for allowing us to stay in your property  There was amazing communication  the apartment was clean  in a great neighborhood and was able to provide everything we needed for the weekend
421643494396270906,THIS IS MY FAVE PLACE TO STAY     FYI it is easier if you park in the alley than trying to find a spot on the street
743248390,Perfect location    Perfect location  
761611526,One of the most greatest experiences of a life time  The suite was spacious the view was stunning and nearby food was delicious   Thanks again for the stay  Will be back again  One of the most greatest experiences of a life time  The suite was spacious the view was stunning and nearby food was delicious   Thanks again for the stay  Will be back again 
759899759,Wow   We originally booked a hotel and then were perusing other options and came across this gem   The location is really great and the view from the room on the   th floor was super cool   The balcony was way larger than we expected and the place was super clean and comfortable   The mattress in the bedroom was wonderful   made us think about getting a new one at home   Seriously you cannot go wrong with this location   close to the Magnificent Mile  the River  and the lake   It also sits right above a Starbucks and a market to grab provisions   Highly recommend  Thank you   The place was super clean and nice      We loved staying there  Such a great location   One thing I would suggest is that we couldnt really figure out how to get the air conditioning working   Wasnt a big problem  just left the balcony door open with screen door  but it would have been good info to have 
434698942570718168,Very nice space in a great location  Host gave detailed instructions for check in out which was really helpful  Great view 
430377613698414054,not very clean  ceilings were scary  floors very dirty  pictures are deceiving  we ended up getting a hotel room for a night
389827791328552124,Great location and apartment layout  problems  with cleanliness and access  The floors were very dirty  Large clumps of dust dirt  Rugs not vacuumed  No soap for shower  Bedding felt unclean  Access code to building did not work and our call for assistance was unsatisfactory  We loved staying in the place in       but it has not kept up its standards  Because of its great location we may stay again but are uncertain 
420257654456416750,The place was in a great location  exactly as the pictures look  Front staff of building was extremely helpful and ridiculously friendly  Great stay  The place was in a great location and the front desk staff was extremely helpful and nice 
409403551006996402,We only had a hot shower one of the four mornings  So if you like to shower in the morning do not expect a hot let alone warm shower  even after running water for       min prior to shower   It was literally freezing cold    The inside is clean and has all the basic necessities  For us the location was just OK as there was no grocery stores or food places within a few blocks  Uber rides were relatively in expensive and easy to catch    I personally would not stay here again but I have read other reviews that really enjoyed it 
759578355,Clean  safe  lots of space and in a non scary location   Fabulous and professional host   We are actually repeat visitors    the ultimate compliment  Thank you  Check upstairs toilet   it s on the fritz   Down stairs bathroom sink is a little slow 
759683252,Check in was quick and easy  Place was clean and exactly advertised in a nice location  Hosts were gracious in accommodating a late check out after I had given them advance notice as well  Thanks for the stay and for accommodating my late check out
759673144,Do not stay here  This apartment was filthy   Bathroom was not clean  Soiled tissues make up wipes in the toilet  empty travel size soaps in the showers  hair all over the floors  grime build up along sink faucet  Dried up contacts and hair found on the bedroom floor  Ashes on terrace floor  Only   outdoor chairs were clean enough to use  Tons of grime on the refrigerator water dispenser  Oil stains on the stovetop  I notified Zencity about this when we first arrived and requested someone to clean immediately  They wouldnt send anyone until our last day  Sunday  when we were checking out Monday    I requested a refund for at least the clean fee and never received a response  Worst Airbnb experience Ive had by far    dont stay here  This apartment was filthy  I sent a message on may   th about compensation and you never responded   completely unprofessional  I would never recommend Zencity as a host 
759668899,PROS   Convenient location  Easy to check in and check out  Spacious interior  It was nice to have   bedrooms    to each person   CONS   This unit was very grimy  especially the bathroom   there were hairs in the shower and other bathroom nooks and crannies and I dont think the tile had been actually wiped clean in some time  The middle bedrooms doorknob was broken from the inside and one of us got locked in the bedroom  I communicated the clean and doorknob issues to Zencity before check out  Furniture was sparse and I ended up moving a side table from the living room to a bedroom to serve as a nightstand  There was only one mirror in the entire   bedroom unit and it was  a waist up sink mirror in the bathroom  Unit is on the  rd floor so may not be the best choice for those with mobility issues  Hi Zencity Im sorry to have to rate cleanliness at   but this unit could really use some TLC from housekeeping  Our stay otherwise was nice 
410805392398471516,The apartment unit itself was really nice and in a great location  Very clean and everything in unit was advertised  The check in process  however  was awful  Zen city sent detailed instructions on how to check in  however  these instructions were null and avoid since the intercom system didn t work  which is the very first step  After calling  apparently this was a known issue by the host and I was instructed to just try to follow people into the building and elevator  Improvements are seriously needed to simplify this process  I enjoyed the apartment and it was a as advertised  The check I m process needs serious improvement  Encouraging people to just follow other into the building can lead to unsafe situations 
436859503526399165,Great location   Very modern  well maintained building  Great location   very modern  well maintained building 
433236868548217040,Big spacious apartment in a secured building  Nice location  Very satisfied Place was great  We did have a problem with the key card not working at the garage entrance and exit
428239973569803005,good location  had all the basics
471756896507561973,It s a good location for people wanting to stay close to the Barnes Jewish Hospital  Parking is a bit of a challenge as you have to pay for street parking and or use the Hospital parking  Thanks for hosting us 
389844576716973255,The place is clean and located in a great area    The only negative is the call box into the building was broke and we were only able to enter if we napped to catch a tenant leaving  This was a huge inconvenience but other than that the place was very nice  Please replace the call box other than that it was a nice stay
410790332432973375,beautiful host lovely stay amazing amenities great location amazing stay great amenities without the tv working

759661743,A pesar de la excelente ubicaci n y servicios de transporte el departamento no cumple con las expectativas  No tiene realmente internet y se mal habilito para hacerlo Airbnb  Seguridad y limpieza as  como los servicios del edificio muy buenos  El departamento muy limpio  la cocina muy bien as  como el cuarto de ba o  La ubicaci n y el transporte excelente  Problemas  No tiene internet  nunca funciono  tuve que contratar un servicio local  La cama no me dejo descansar y el ultimo d a se cayeron dos tablas  muy mala calidad  Compre una cama inefable para poder dormir   El sof  de la tv muy inc modo  No hab a internet  nunca funcion   le escrib  al anfitri n y no se resolvi  el problema  El mobiliario es de p sima calidad  el sill n y la cama especialmente  La ubicaci n es excelente  pero el departamento sin internet que ofrecen as  c mo un sof  y una cama de muy mala calidad 
759322074,Muy bonito el lugar
759316889,No hangers  No patio furniture  Upstairs neighbors are very loud playing music at  AM  Bad music  at that   Master  shower has one unworking nozzle  No hangers    Like    WHY  You can get a dozen for a dollar at the Dollar Store  Also  there are no TVs in either bedroom  No balcony furniture  Seems the owners went cheap to offer this spot as an AirBnB spot 
421019555254824079,Great location in a nice building    with good amenities  Walking distance to plenty of restaurants and shops  The staff in the building are nice  too  Overall  really enjoyed my stay 
420976612186902322,Great space and good Midtown location  In fact  so good  booked twice when my flight was canceled     Great space  a bit high on the price  and there were no toiletries on the second time I booked  Hope to stay w you again   thx 
759262150,Quick note  this was our first time using Airbnb  Some of the negative things we experienced may be normal by Airbnb standards  but to us they seemed a little odd  especially booking from a company that has many Airbnb locations  We expected things to be tighter    The apartment was nice  quaint  and comfortable  and its location was very convenient  It was wonderful to be located directly across from a park  Having kids ourselves  it was a delight to see families enjoying themselves each day  It was wonderful to have food  liquor  coffee and the L station all within a   minutes walk  Each morning I took a walk to a local coffee shop to pickup breakfast and coffee  You could see folks from the community out and about  families going for walks  dog walkers  exercisers and more  all with a smile on their faces ready to start the day  It was also nice being able to walk to the liquor store each night for a bottle of wine  It felt safe doing so  even in the later hours  This all  location wise   was quite fun and convenient for us  The apartment is also in a quite location making it easier to relax  not needing to hear the hustle and bustle of the city   Before our arrival we were provided with rather detailed instructions of how to acquire the key to get into the building  how to get into the apartment and how to access the WiFi  Being a very detailed person myself I really liked this    However  there were a few things we had issues with   Once inside the building and at the apartment door  it took us about    minutes to get in  The instructions said to type in the access code then press the  lock button   We did this over and over until we decided to press the pound   button  which then unlocked the door   We tried to log on to the Wi Fi   but the network name was not what was sent to us in the instructions or what was written on the black board in the main room  both of those were the same   After sifting through all of the networks that our computers were picking up  we noticed one that looked like an abbreviated version of what we were told  Once we selected that  we entered the password that was given and that did work   Upon waking up after the first night my wife went to take a soak in the tub  Unfortunately  she was unable to since there was no stopper for the drain  I messaged Zencity via the Airbnb app regarding this  asking is there was one in the apartment somewhere  We never received a response  We searched the entire apartment and were unable to located a stopper  This was quite disappointing since the point of our trip was to relax and one of the main points that lead us to select this particular apartment was the clawfoot tub  featured in the photos    At the time of writing this review  we still have not received any response regarding this    While it didnt affect us  we thought it may be useful for folks to know that the apartment is an  able bodied only  stay  Wheelchairs would be impossible because of the multiple floors of steep steps and narrow hallways and no elevator  Quick note  this was our first time using Airbnb   The apartment was nice  quaint  and comfortable  However  there were a few things we had issues with  The first was with getting into the apartment   Once inside the building and at the apartment door  it took us about    minutes to get in  The

 I messaged yall via the Airbnb app  at      AM             regarding this  asking is there was one in the apartment somewhere  We never received a response and still have not  We searched the entire apartment and were unable to located a stopper  This was quite disappointing since the point of our trip was to relax and one of the main points that let me to select this particular apartment was the clawfoot tub  featured in the photos  for my wife to relax in  As of this writing    PM             we still have not received any response from the message I sent   We did like the location of the apartment  It was wonderful having it be directly across from a park  Having kids ourselves  it was a delight to see families enjoying themselves each day  Its location was also really nice  It was

would be impossible  and there are many steps leading to the apartment  with no elevator   All in all we enjoyed our stay  There were just the first few things that threw a slight wrench into the overall stay 
759140327,Great studio apartment in the perfect location  This place is for travelers looking for an authentic city dweller stay  Train and bus stop right outside the door  great eats in walking free delivery cheap Lyft distance    min walk to Boystown and   min walk to Wrigleyville    This place is not for light sleepers or those who want peace and quiet  Staying here means being in the midst of active city life  There were some things I would like to see improved with clean and amenities  but the company was responsive    PROS  big deep tub and large shower head  kitchenware  cute decor  nice new high tech building  perfect location for nightlife and good eats I left a three star rating for cleanliness because the throw cover on the bed was noticeably discolored and smelled odd  The rug was poorly vacuumed  with lots of noticeable debris lint litter  I vacuumed myself when I arrived because I wanted to wear no shoes  There was also no garbage can in the kitchen  so I put a trash bag in the bin that was in the utility closet  Additionally  some of the cabinet shelves with wine glasses and coffee ground grinder had a thick layer of dust  which made me concerned that all surfaces arent being sanitized between visits  Last  the outside patio furniture was not in good shape either    The decor and TV setup was great  LOVED the location and easy check in  I was really disappointed not to have a key fob  It made accessing the building from the other entrances impossible  and standing at the call box waiting for the gate to unlock made me nervous after getting off the train  As a native Chicagoan  Im always looking to avoid putting myself at risk  When I was told there was another fob in the lockboxes  I dont think anyone realized that there were almost    boxes there  So improving the quality control before guests arrived is my main suggestion  Id stay with Zencity again if these things were improved 
393447232232011267,I would not stay here again   Lots of clean needs to be done to pass any hygiene standards      The code we were given to get in was the wrong one  the building was extremely hot  the place was filthy per our previous conversations and pics sent   The automation of info wasnt as appreciated as a personal fast communication we received from other AirBnB hosts 
388321872143163378,The intercom at the main door didn t work upon check in   we were lucky enough to be let in by other tenants where everything else went smooth  Parking is a bit difficult and we ended up using the parking garage   blocks away  The keypad to the room is digital   confused us at first b c the surrounding rooms have numbers on the knob  You simply press the touch screen   the numbers appear  Upon checkout they accused us of dismantling a doorknob to one of the doors  which we did not do  Overall went okay   would stay here again  The intercom at the main door didn t work as described upon check in   we were lucky enough to be let in where everything else went smooth  The keypad to the room is digital   confused us at first b c the surrounding rooms have numbers on the knob  You simply press the touch screen   the numbers appear  We did not dismantle a doorknob  Overall our visit was great and would recommend to others 
539112855103479472,NOT a Zen experience  ZenCity does not comply with the Chicago Heat Ordinance which require landlords to keep daytime temps a minimum of    degrees  As a result when I arrived the pipes were frozen   it was in the single digits during my trip  No water in the apartment until the middle of the next day   And I was unable to stay warm in the apartment  I was denied my request to control the temperature  they control the Nest thermostat  And my requests to speak with a manager went unfulfilled   I do not recommend staying here  Need to align your policies with the City of Chicago Heating Ordinance  Your lack of compliance with the law made my trip miserable 
758372706,Check in is smooth and the location is really good  However  the apartment is not that good  The screens of the window are left on the floor without being assembled  some light fixtures don t have light bulbs  the plug in is left on the floor  The bathroom is not clean  as there are stains on walls and the bathtub  Speaking about the bathtub  the water keeps dropping though the tap is turned off and there re hairs in the bathtub drain  Also  the shower caddy seems to be used for a long time and is left with stains  One more thing about the window  the shades  are translucent and they can t provide privacy  Overall  it seems the apartment hasn t been well refurbished and soon opens for reservation 
758024200,Slight hiccup at check in but everything else was perfect  Great location 
757788603,Great location and high price quality 
757786574,The apartment is very stylish and has everything one would need  The only reason I put a   star rating is because the thermostat did not work  It was quite warm in the apartment even with the balcony door open  Otherwise very clean and neat  Thank you for allowing us to stay in your space  The view is to die for  Wasn t informed of the amazing  rooftop  area 
436902157775453228,I had a great visit 
757760209,Very clean and the host is very responsive  Even though it is close to the train and a lot of stores  it is pretty quiet inside  Overall would recommend  especially for a long term stay   it has everything you need 
757587069,Good location  peaceful place  clean  and I also fall in love with the bathroom  High recommend 
436969385923680794,Good experience

757576681,Genial Excelente
757324986,Overall the unit was nice   However  the walls in the bathroom were visibly dirty in the bathroom and it took   weeks and multiple reminders from me for someone to come clean them  I ended up just clean the built up hair from both the shower and sink drains myself  While all of the customer service representatives I interacted with were very pleasant and responded fairly quickly  actually fixing issues was much slower and less satisfactory  I think this is a systems issue for Zencity  not an issue with any individual staff member  It took   weeks to get my bathroom clean  the walls were disgusting  I sent pictures and requested that they be clean on    April  had to follow up multiple times  gave permission multiple times for a cleaner to come into the unit while I was gone  the next day  and it didnt get clean until    April   and I had no notification they were coming that time   It was also unreasonably frustrating to get the thermostat set so that I could adjust it and not be freezing in the unit 
389091673514600670,Great location with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby  Right next to Forest Park  Only thing we wish would have been communicated was that we had to pay    per hour for parking all weekend  We had such a great time  thank you so much for everything  The apartment was great  Only thing we would have liked was a parking pass  there seemed to be plenty of room in the parking lot 
389077170166711913,Great for a weekend getaway 
389131671874257234,Great location  Thank you  It was a great experience 
489115559047636511,Nice place
407203948518632834,The stay was good other than the group of kids across the hall screaming and fighting all night  Also it was raining in the bathroom from a bad leak and you would get soaked while trying to take a crap  And supposedly maintenance was scheduled and decided to let himself in without knocking or anything  and I didnt know who he was and just pointed at the back of his shirt and said Im maintenance duh  the stay was good other than the group of kids across the hall screaming and fighting all night  And the random maintenance man that tried to let himself in without even knocking and the leak that was dripping from the ceiling terribly onto you while you were sitting on the toilet  those issues should really be resolved before rented not while someone is paying good money to deal with random maintenance men coming in and out interrupting our stay and raining in the bathroom  So Ill pay the    but I think I should get a little money back for my inconvenience 
756817062,Great location and nice unit
756585242,Really convenient location right off the Belmont metro  near lots of good restaurants  The train is  present  but I didn t find the noise too disturbing during sleeping hours  Apartment was well equipped and had good wi fi
756185468,Thank ya for the chance to stay  Check in process and clean after previous customer could be improved  It was ok 
421012266473388624,Nice comfortable and clean place to stay off of   th  Was a little surprised that there wasn t a sink in the bathroom and the TV was a bit glitchy  but a very comfortable and convenient stay in KC  Thanks for a great home base while touring apartments 
426769567428030176,    Thanks for the stay but you were sending me so many text that was false because the time you texted I was never there and I did not have a baby with me
392027973129031592,Great host   great stay as well I loved the stay   would love to come right back
756169604,A very excellent and clean property  Great location with easy access to everything from restaurants to transportation  I highly recommend  I will stay here again  thank you so much for your hospitality and professionalism  I found a location to be excellent and definitely worth the money  I will continue to stay with Zencity whenever I visit Chicago
446388955424994568,Overall the apartment was decent and its in a pretty nice spot  I travelled from Indiana and had asked several times about how the parking worked and never really got a clear answer but was offered a  pm early check in which I accepted  I asked all of my questions between  a  p and all of the responses came overnight so I essentially got the response the next day  not a big deal until I had problems getting into the apartment    First off  the parking garage isnt available until you check in so you have to park on the street temporarily  check in  then move your car into the garage  The front desk staff was less than helpful and literally handed me the keycard and said  Im sure you can figure it out   not really Zencitys fault but they could provide more info in their check in instructions   From there I figured out that the ONE assigned parking spot is on the  th level which connects to the  th floor of the apartment building  The one keycard is needed to access almost everything   including garage entrance and exit  building entrance  elevator buttons  except floor    and so on  Not a huge deal but the one card created a few logistics issues  Check out is also a bit of a hassle because you are asked to leave the keycard in the room  but you need it to get out of the garage   so you have to get your car out of the garage before you go back upstairs to leave the keycard   Check in was a bit of a nightmare  as I mentioned earlier Zencity offered early  pm early check in which I accepted  I was able to get the keycard  park  and get up to the apartment  with a ton of my mothers luggage I might add  only to find that the   digit code I was given to unlock the electronic deadbolt didnt work  I reached out to Zencity for help but didnt get a response  We decided to put all of our luggage back in the car and continue on with our day  Later when we came back  well after the normal  p check in  the code magically worked   The posting says the apartment hosts    and with an air mattress this could easily be    I had indicated there would be   in my group yet there where only   towels  There was also only one dish towel in the kitchen  There were no hot pads or oven mitts for the oven  and there was only one cooking sheet  There was no standard coffee pot  just a french press  again  not a huge deal for me but it may be for someone   The  smart  thermostat constantly changed to some setting other than what it was set at  There was mold in one of the showers  the fridge is scratched and dented  one of the tables is damaged  the wall mounted toilet paper and towel holders where all falling off  the trash can was broke  the doors squeak and one of the chairs is so bent it doesnt sit level  For those that care  the apartment building has a rule stating only two persons per apartment in the pool   This may seem like a lot of complaining but I spent the most Ive ever spent on this particular Airbnb and I feel like there were a lot of little issues that all added up  Its obvious no one lives here permanently and so many of the little things have gone unnoticed  Need to improve communication  All responses to my requests happened overnight  When I had an issue checking in no one responded  Also provide more info about parking   you have to park on the street for a bit before getting the pass to the garage  Parking spot     is on the  th level which connects to the  th floor of the apartment building  If you offer someone early check in the keycode needs to work at that time 
463017569937746907,Make sure you get door codes before you get there  The customer service takes forever to pick up  Got locked out twice  I didn t have the door pin code upon arrival 
531182884843389393,We picked this unit thinking it would be nice and in a nice area  the area was not bad  However  the unit it s self was run down  You could tell they tried to give  luxury  upgrades to the unit  We arrived on       the unit was not clean pass first glance looking  In fact the last time the unit had been clean was       and the property manager forgot to wipe it fully off the wifi board when he did the walk through  The sad part is he knew the unit wasn t clean and tried to comment that he was checking behind the cleaners  Not only was the unit not clean there was bugs flying around in the bathroom and on the ceiling in the bathroom  the walls in the unit are thin so the neighbors walking and continuously barking dog are heard all night long  Literally the dog was barking from the time we arrived till the time we left  The windows also need to be resealed as they let in quite the dead as one on us now has a cold  We would turn the heat on and the rest of the unit would be warm but the bedroom freezing  To top that off on our second day we came back to the unit only to be staring at an eviction notice from the building owner stating they were evicting zencity and all occupants in the zencity unit from the building  This was the Worst Airbnb experience the host was not communicative at all and we were very uncomfortable leaving our things there upon receiving the eviction notice  We dealt with an eviction notice and an unclean unit  The floors were gross  there were bugs flying around in and on the ceiling of the shower and the window seals let in a bunch of cold air making one of us get a cold  The walls are super thin in the unit and we constantly heard noice from those above us  The neighbors dog barks a majority of the day 
423922437042042624,Great location  The apartment is small  bathroom  is very small and it needs to be remodeled  Overall is OK 
391943656680316208,Great location   Loved the neighborhood  awesome restaurants  bars  and shops  Apartment was comfortable and the Nest heating and cooling system was great  Right on L which was convenient but loud  The   flights of stairs are not for the faint hearted or those with large suitcases  Hello  We really loved our stay  The apartment was comfortable and had a great location  However when we arrived  we found the bathroom in need of clean  We were able to find the clean supplies and do a quick clean of the shower  toilet  and sink  however the state we first found the bathroom  hairs on and in tub  toilet unclean  does not meet our expectations of an Airbnb stay  Also it was disappointing to not have coffee or some toiletries 
433275502574046826,Very good place  nice and clean  acs were really good  just wished check in was easier Thank you for the stay  I really enjoyed the aesthetics and cleanliness of the apartment  Just wished the check in could be better because I had the wrong code  but the customer service who helped me get in is really nice 
423918718020565230,Great place will book again soon Great place will be booking again soon
445623081582270449,Great location  though the parking space was a bit tough to find the first time  Longest hallway ever  my   year old thought it was great   and lots of space to spread out  The building lobby is stunning    Its a little sparse  decor and artwork is very minimal  When we got there a fuse had tripped and the lights in both the bathrooms were not working  I messaged the owner and never heard back   it took my husband a while to find the fuse box himself  We also washed all the cups and silverware in the dishwasher before use   they looked a little suspect    The view was wonderful   my daughter loved being able to see the Ferris Wheel at Union Station  Plenty of room for my family of   
756125536,Great place to stay in Hyde Park  The location was wonderful for access to the lake as well as walking distance to the center of Hyde Park  The apartment was clean  the building staff were very welcoming and kind  and the gym was a good place to get a good workout in on a rainy day  We stayed for a week and were very comfortable and happy here  We had a great stay and will highly recommend this place   We do have two suggestions that might be useful to you      Have oil  salt  pepper for basic cooking      Add a couple more pieces of furniture that would warm up the space as well as make it more comfortable  We would suggest a desk or small table to the living room and a slim table or dresser in the bedroom to add a couple more surfaces to place things  As well as a second couch or comfier chair 
756112502,Beautiful apartment  exactly as shown in pictures  Very sensitive to any noise  The noise monitoring system is very sensitive  if anything falls it alerts that too much noise is being made  Would advise altering this for future stays
755903385,Unfortunately didn t have the best experience with zencity this time  I ve stayed with them a few times before  Love the locations and price for the most part  but in general the spaces aren t really clean  This last time there was loose hair all over the Airbnb  even in the shower drain  I took pictures and sent them to zencity  as they requested and they did nothing for me      clean fee  dirty Airbnb during a pandemic  I just feel it could be handled better  Anyway  I m not saying dont stay here but in general don t expect it to be as nice or clean as in the images 
389117928294432531,Perfect location for a weekend trip
755859619,Beware  This listing is located directly over a very loud bar that is open until at least   a m  While I very much appreciated ZenCitys efforts to find an alternative place to stay for my second night  the description of this unit gave no indication at all that the apartment is located above a VERY loud bar that was open until   a m  when it then turned rowdy customers out on the street to continue the loud partying until   a m  The floors were vibrating because the music was so loud  This resulted in me getting about   hours of sleep before a very important  day long business meeting  It was a nightmare  In addition  there was no hair dryer after I doubled checked the listing before packing my bag for the trip  Finally  the entrance to the building was blocked by HUGE boxes left on the staircase  I literally had to wedge myself and my suitcase through the door and climb over the boxes to get to upstairs to the apartment  Very dangerous and completely ridiculous  While I very much appreciate your staffs efforts to find an alternative place to stay for my second night  the description of this unit gave no indication at all that the apartment is located above a very loud bar that was open until   a m  when it then turned rowdy customers out on the street to continue the loud partying until   a m  The floors were vibrating because the music was so loud  This resulted in me getting about   hours of sleep before a very important  day long business meeting  It was a nightmare  In addition  there was no hair dryer after I doubled checked the listing before packing my bag for the trip  Finally  the entrance to the building was blocked by HUGE boxes left on the staircase  I literally had to wedge myself and my suitcase through the door and climb over the boxes to get to upstairs to the apartment  Very dangerous and completely ridiculous

755578794,Great space and absolutely amazing location
755360116,great location  great stay   the bar downstairs was noisy at times but overall was amazing great stay  thanks so much  
432543588766147244,Great place to stay  within walking distance to many neat places and a cute little main street area  Easy communication and complete instructions  lovely space with all you need to enjoy St Louis  Thank you  There was a glass that was cracked so I left it on the counter  also one of the blankets was stinky  and when I put stuff in the laundry it had that same smell  so it might not be draining completely every time  Regardless it was a great place and a great stay  thank you so much for the hospitality 
397777609848652056,I definitely would book again   It was perfect  I would definitely book again   It was perfect

755059995,Excellent host   I would def stay again
754800731,We were disappointed that the apartment was not as clean as we had expected  The front bedroom bed sheets had not been changed  There was no top sheet  creases that looked like someone had just slept on them and there was hair on the pillow case  I was going to put fresh sheets on the bed  but the ones I found in the little freestanding bedroom cabinet were in a ball on the shelf and also had hair on them  The bathroom door was filthy  and there was toothpaste on the wall   The entry to the building was filthy as well  I wouldnt rent this airbnb again  They dont post photos of the tiny bathroom  most likely because they couldnt get a decent angle for the camera lense due to the size  It wasnt as clean as I would have liked  not terrible  but definitely not as clean as a bathroom should be  The grout is filthy  the door had splash marks of some kind down it  there was toothpaste on the wall  and the paint around mirror that acts as a door of the  medicine cabinet   where the extra shampoo is kept  is completely worn off where you open it  It wouldnt take much to touch up the paint every once in awhile to make it more presentable  Its obvious the owners have no pride in the place  It was easy to get the key out of the lock box that is attached to the door of the building  That being said  the tiny entry to the building was not only filthy  it was full of old mailers and boxes  Its actually a hazard  If I could post the pictures of the tiny entry and the narrow  dirty staircase that runs at an angle  I would  The bedroom that looks over Belmont was not clean before we arrived  There was no top sheet and there was hair in the bed and on one of the pillow cases  There were creases on the fitted sheet which looked like a sheet after someone has slept on them   I looked under the fitted sheet at the mattress pad and it had disgusting stains  I found extra sheets in the little freestanding closet  but they were dirty as well  It truly was disgusting  Needless to say we didnt use that bed  When I complained to Zencity regarding the dirty sheets and mouse poop in the kitchen cabinet  they kindly offered a  touch up   However  I truly didnt want one of their cleaners back in the unit when we were not there  and since we were not going to use the dirty bedroom  or any of the kitchen amenities  we decided it best to turn down their offer of sending someone in to clean   They did offer a refund of our clean fee  which we accepted   That was very generous of them  Location is good  and street parking was easy and plentiful  but noisy at night due to it being directly on Belmont 
754746658,Place is nice and quiet  Area is very safe and a lot of public transportation routes nearby  You can walk to the Lake Michigan  Museum of Science and Industry and the Jackson Park  University of Chicago is also very close  Downton is not so close but the public transportation that takes you there is just crossing the street  Coffee maker was not very clean
754720654,Worst experience traveling ever with Zencity   Never going to use Air BnB again   st time last time  Never will I use Air BnB again  Chicago is a dump 
754203947,This bright apartment has an amazing location with every amenity around the corner  Street parking was easy to find  It is well equipped with what you will need  Amazing views  amazing public spaces in the building  The response from Zencity was prompt  We were comfortable and will definitely use it again 
436968452996936153,Great place with awesome views  I also got a great deal on it  Would definitely stay again  Spent the night enjoying the views and working from my laptop  Awesome  Thanks for the awesome stay  Such wonderful views 
402879560550428733,This is a nice  modern chic condo with great views of Downtown Chicago  with a cozy balcony to enjoy the view and city sounds to relax and unwind  There is a fully stocked kitchen  washer and dryer  extra blankets and pillows  and plenty of towels  The main bedroom has a good size walk in closet and private bathroom  Each room has nice large size windows with views of the beautiful skyscrapers  sky  and night city lights  Easy access to the building  safe neighborhood  and walking distance to all the main hot spots  including the river  lake beach  and Magnificent Mile  We absolutely love it and had a wonderful time visiting Chicago with a great place to stay  We loved staying at the condo  Beautiful views of Downtown Chicago  clean  accessible TV streaming services  and great prompt response from Zencity customer service team when we had concerns with the WiFi service  Thanks so much for the wonderful experience 
754155460,Great location in Wicker park  busy city and train nearby  Although oddly difficult to get ubers  Overall good stay and place  Very open layout  Poor response with actual host  I kept getting automatic messages about general rules or stay and no responses to my actual questions  Very odd  Thanks for the stay  Only tip would be a stronger shower head haha  Asked fir early check in multiple times with no response  Askd got late check out and early check in  Was told to ask again closer to the date  No response just automated messages  Minimal direct contact with the host 
753678049,It was nice stay everything was close  It was better than why I expected  Bathtub
753645779,The place was clean and actually better than how it looks on the pictures  I enjoyed my stay there  I really enjoyed my stay there  Thank you for this wonderful experience 
753642183,This place is great  The bathroom is big  the kitchen is nice and the bed is comfortable  The only reason I couldn t give it a   star is because it s really noisy  The train is so loud you can literally hear the words coming from the train as it stops  If you re a light sleeper it will be an issue  However after a couple days I got used to it  But overall I was super happy with this place  It was super stocked with everything I needed and loved that laundry was in unit 
430376514356583996,This Airbnb was beautiful  Nice and in a quiet location  Finding the door to the apartment was a bit tricky but just a pointer for someone who books it  When you go threw the main entrance take the steps down and keep walking straight until you come to a door and you see a gym  Once you see the gym you turn the first left and walk all the way down the hallway and boom it s your Airbnb lol  I felt very safe in the unit  Perks were the washer and dryer along with detergent  Overall I give this place a    out of    Thank you
389116471663735507,Great location and stay in KC  We enjoyed the views of the city that this place had to offer  Do pay attention to every detail on the check in instructions and it ll be a smooth process  I would book this place again  Thanks for hosting 
753403576,Excellent location and value  loved everything about the place  the only recommendations for improvement would be adding the ability to control temp in the unit
394153038758305208,Great place to stay  Everything was great  Only problem there weren t enough towels left out for the whole trip 
411565456782986620,Great stay
411535612816934968,horrible  dont do it  horrible customer service
391965505528588107,Great place  Super spacious and clean  Great neighborhood with lots of places to eat nearby  short drive from downtown  Really enjoyed our stay  Thanks so much for a great stay  We really enjoyed our time in the city and the little touches like the phone charger and coffee press were much appreciated 
523211980341138567,Great location  very clean 
411504373879130889,ok place
424609708101242495,Great location if you dont want to be right downtown easy access to the lake and walk bike path there  Comfortable  simple space perfect for you if you dont want to eat every meal out  Clean and spacious  Thanks for another great visit  Loved the convenience  location  security  cleanliness    quick notes     The toilet in the bathroom that is attached to the bedroom down the hall never quite shuts off theres always a trickle happening     The big trash can that was in the kitchen was attracting breeding flies  which were there when we checked in  so we swatted what we could and put the can outside the back door  which solved the fly problem and Im afraid someone moved took it from there  Sorry 
753371096,Check in was great as the front desk staff was amazing  So nice and helpful  The building was secure and i felt very safe coming and going  The room itself was nice and looked just like the pictures  The bed was very comfortable and o loved the natural light that came in from the windows  The room was clean there were just a couple of surfaces that weren t wiped down like the nightstand  But overall i loved my stay  Would definitely stay again 
753328315,Great location with so much to do around  Good central location to walk almost everywhere you would want to go in the city  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back  The view from the balcony was great  the building was nice and clean  and neighbors were not loud  Felt very safe in the building and surrounding neighborhoods  would highly recommend  Thank you for proving such a great space  we really enjoyed our stay and would come back again 
752870507,My experience with Zencity is exactly why I avoid staying with corporate AirBnBs  While the location of the apartment and customer service were both good  there were many things about the place that were an issue  especially cleanliness  When we arrived  we noticed that the floors underneath the couch or bed hadn t been clean  there were some old food wrappers found even   there were leftover pizza crumbs on the kitchen counter and work desk  some cobwebs on the ceiling and when we swept up before leaving  we even found ants  Additionally  there was a lot of water damage to the ceiling in most of the rooms and the bathroom even had some mold growing above the bathtub  The bedroom door doesn t close completely and will lock you out if you try to do so  As far as the kitchen amenities  be sure to bring your own water if you book here because they do not provide a water filter and there is only hot water from the sink  This all reflects the fact that THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL APARTMENT  This is a corporate owned space that is just trying to make as much money as possible with the least amount of effort  The day before we checked out  we received an email offering to extend the stay by a night for      We considered this because of the location and requested the extension  only to receive an email saying they would allow this extension for       When I declined and sent them a message about this email discrepancy  they changed it to      stating that it incurred the extra     because of taxes  what kind of tax is        Anyway  I could not recommend staying here unless you want to overpay for place where you have to live with ants  mold and re wash all of the dishes because they are coated with dirt  aka the dishwasher does not work properly   All in all  the effort is not worth the price  Please see review for feedback While the location of the apartment and customer service were both good  there were many things about the place that were an issue  especially cleanliness  When we arrived  we noticed that the floors underneath the couch or bed hadn t been clean  there were some old food wrappers found even   there were leftover pizza crumbs on the kitchen counter and work desk  some cobwebs on the ceiling and when we swept up before leaving  we even found ants  Additionally  there was a lot of water damage to the ceiling in most of the rooms and the bathroom even had some mold growing above the bathtub  The bedroom door doesn t close completely and will lock you out if you try to do so  As far as the kitchen amenities  be sure to bring your own water if you book here because they do not provide a water filter and there is only hot water from the sink  This all reflects the fact that THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL APARTMENT  This is a corporate owned space that is just trying to make as much money as possible with the least amount of effort  The day before we checked out  we received an email offering to extend the stay by a night for      We considered this and requested the extension  only to receive an email saying they would allow this extension for       When I declined and sent them a message about this email discrepancy  they changed it to      stating that it incurred the extra     because of taxes  what tax is        Anyway  I could not recommend staying here unless you want to overpay for place where you have to live with ants  mold and re wash all of the dishes because they are coated with dirt  The effort is not worth the price  
390483435013961892,Check in directions were not accurate   Place was dirty and worn   Smelled terrible in the entry way  Bed linens has stains on them  microwave was dirty and the floor was dirty  Couch is cheap and uncomfortable  No pillow protectors  so gross  My son didn t stay with us for it was gross and we left unsafe    Overall  the listing description and pictures do not reflect what you really get   Don t believe the listing  I contacted the company and they do not care about making us feel better about our experience    Hostile neighbors left us feeling unsafe    THIS PLACE IS A BIG NO  I have shared our experience and you don t care
389098042979030973,The room looked exactly like the pictures  nice and clean   The only feedback I would provide is it would be nice  especially in the spring and summer months  to have the air conditioner started the day of   prior to check in  to avoid the guests having to endure the heat while waiting for the room to cool off  Also  The parking garage mentioned was a lot closer than expected   Approximately   block away from the property   The free parking available on the street is extremely limited  so the garage option is worth it  The room looked exactly like the pictures  nice and clean   The only feedback I would provide is it would be nice  especially in the spring and summer months  to have the air conditioner started the day of   prior to check in  to avoid the guests having to endure the heat while waiting for the room to cool off  Also  The parking garage mentioned was a lot closer than expected   Approximately   block away from the property   The free parking available on the street is extremely limited  so the garage option is worth it 
394195264447111102,Don t get me wrong  this apartment is nicely remodeled  the location is perfect  the building is secured with gated parking and smart locks on every door  However  we contacted Zencity within    minutes of arriving at our reservation to inform them that the smart lock on the door was broken and wouldn t allow for the door to lock  We were consistently told that the maintenance team was coming  however the maintenance team never arrived  We checked in with them every few hours and we did hear back from them each time   However  we never got a response on how we could fix this ourselves or an ETA of the maintenance team  We even asked to be moved to a different rental or reimbursed in order to find a different rental property on our own  We were left there and received no assistance  It was incredibly frustrating that this company would leave young women alone in a city without the ability to lock their door  It put us on edge  and their lack of caring or urgency was not appreciated  As well  this unit was definitely not clean  There was an obviously used wash rag in the bathroom on the counter  previous renters trash found on the couch  and old food  rice  all over the floor next to the bed  Don t get me wrong  this apartment is nicely remodeled  the location is perfect  the building is secured with gated parking and smart locks on every door  However  we contacted Zencity within    minutes of arriving at our reservation to inform you that the smart lock on the door was broken and wouldn t allow for the door to lock  We were told that your maintenance team was coming  however the maintenance team never arrived  We checked in with you every few hours and never got a response on a fix or an ETA of the maintenance team  We even asked to be moved to a different rental or reimbursed in order to find a different rental property on our own  We received no assistance  It was incredibly frustrating that your company would leave young women alone in a city without the ability to lock their door  It put us on edge  and your lack of caring or urgency was not appreciated  As well  this unit was definitely not clean  There was an obviously used wash rag in the bathroom on the counter  previous renters trash found on the couch  and old dried food  rice  all over the floor next to the bed 
752801382,This is above a bar and VERY loud   Do NOT book this place unless you are cool with no sleep till well after  am   The host never responded and only gave me back    bucks when I canceled my reservation after the first sleepless night  I had booked for   nights    It was awful   And  there was a nasty hair folded into my towel   AWFUL experience   It is above the bar and very loud I had a huge hair in my bath towel Host never responded when I complained about the noise It is above a Bar It was above a bar and I had paid for   days and only got    bucks back after cancelling when I had no sleep the first night
752700810,The place is very clean and as advertised   Check in process is not seamless and we had issues getting into the building  The place was very clean and as advertised   The check in process needs to change  plain and simple  It simply does not work and I am scared to think of this happening to someone arriving alone and at night  Check in process using code at intercom box does not work  Tried for    minutes while also speaking with rep at zen city who couldn t figure it out   Eventually someone who lives at the building let us in  Did not respond when I said we couldn t get in   Call center could not assist 
436910373541615474,Great place to stay  Easy walk to the Arch and other top destinations  Quiet  very clean  Would definitely stay here again  Stay was great  Awesome responsiveness  Just need to fix the hand towel holder ring in the master bathroom  I would definitely stay again 
411590111936429088,I had a wonderful stay with Zencity Thanks for a wonderful wonderful stay 
421651018658738024,The location is perfect   The apartment is roomy and nice  I loved having access to a work out room and gated parking  I will definitely visit this place again on my next trip to St  Louis  The location was perfect   Check in and check out was so easy  The apartment was so nice and I had access to a work out room which I loved 
752654624,Great location  clean environment  Everything we were expecting  Great stay  very nice accommodations  The only suggestion I have is to please provide better instructions to use the tv  We were not able to access any programming while  there 
752650101,It was a great space   Very modest and functional   Washer and Dryer  bonus points   Starbucks and Target a few steps away   I enjoyed my time there   The wifi is spotty but I only used the place to sleep   Comfy bed  I enjoyed my stay   You need to check the dryer lint catcher   Can you fix the broken slat or cover it up with a piece of cardboard   I used an envelope to weave thru it   Just nit picking but place was great 
752634359,Clean  friendly host and what a steal of a stay 
752398187,This space was really nice and in a super convenient location  Walking distance from the lake  a lot of good restaurants  and Target  Other grocery stores like Trader Joe s and Whole Foods also conveniently located close by  This space is above a bar and you can definitely hear noise from the usual traffic Saturday night but did not disturb us at all  Just something to keep in mind if folks are looking for a more quiet night weekend stay  The area was generally quiet during the day and Sunday evening  Would definitely stay here again  Check in was super easy and your space is really great 
392665266781913958,Parking was quite confusing but amazing stay  Definitely check out the rooftop   Hot tubs  hammock   great view  Parking was quite confusing but amazing stay  Definitely check out the rooftop   Hot tubs  hammock   great view 
752047939,This place what pretty much what I expected  It was easy to check in and the host responded quickly  The place could use a deep clean but there wasn t anything that completely threw it off  Overall it was a good place to stay for a quick weekend trip  The shower curtain was pretty dirty and the refrigerator was dirty as well  Over all the entire space needs a deep clean 
752006730,It was just as I expected  I ve stayed in other places from Zencity and overall it s always a great stay with pleasant touches  The overall stay was pleasant  There is buildup in the tub  so use drain o or something to unclog it  The wifi speed wasn t super great  I d spend a little extra on one that can support multiple devices and not just the tv  But my gf was happy and that s all that matters 
751570112,Enjoyed my stay at this place  Convenient and in a lovely neighborhood  Some stains in blankets and pillows
409412208357373087,A    minute walk to Busch Stadium  Inside of the apartment is nice and clean  but the apartment building itself is a little rough  Host communicates great and the parking spot that comes with it is great  Thanks for our stay
389795731956213444,Place was great  I read complaints about water pressure  I could understand what people meant  however  the water was plentiful enough for two people at the same time and was not an issue for me  Very clean  Could not figure out how to turn the lights off to watch a movie without turning off the power to the outlet the TV was plugged into  The amenities on the roof were amazing  Local restaurants within walking distance  and a coffee shop too  The nearby Lafayette park was beautiful  Almost everything is flawless in the apartment  Take the time to clean up the grout in the bathroom  thats the only suggestion 
421018105956855241,Great spot  clean  comfortable  and perfect location  We would definitely stay there again  we enjoyed our stay  thank you 
751544204,Great accommodations and a great location right in the middle of Hyde Park and close to UChicago  Zencity was great responding to our questions and requests quickly and very accommodating  The space is beautiful  bright and airy and very comfortable  We had everything we needed for our stay  The only thing that may have been added was a regular coffee maker and some filters and maybe some ground coffee  We are not  very adept at French Presses unfortunately  I would also recommend taking off the plastic cover off the mattress  Being someone who runs hot  it made me hot  sweaty  and woke me up frequently the first night  Putting a towel between the cover and the sheet the next   nights helped a lot 
452181093616730454,Excellent
751520611,Great place and made my stay even better
751517437,Good  Big space  Very pleased 
751478140,Great place  beds are comfortable and the space feels bigger than the pictures  The description does not point out well that you will hear the music from the bars directly below the unit  and it is even louder on the weekends  The street facing bedroom will also get all of the noise of people outside the bars  Noise from bar directly below
424547557827801365,Great location at a decent price  Removed enough from the city that it s peaceful but you can still get anywhere with an   minute drive  I had a question about parking that was never answered and you must have gotten your rooms mixed up because you attempted to invoice me for      for a lost parking pass in a different room  Other than that we loved the space and community  Would totally stay there again in the future 
751266788,Great place  great location  everything went smoothly
751260289,Great location  good amenities and the space had everything I needed 
388407207013831327,There was no water pressure on Kitchenette Sink  Bathroom Fan doesnt work  bathroom sink and shower did not drain well at all   Our  nd morning there was no hot water at all  The bed frame is weak and wobbles pretty bad  Also there was a big barking dog across the hall   The apartment smelled like other peoples cooking with very little ventalation  The TV didnt have regular Live TV   The A C workred great though  and the bed was comfortable minus the wobble and loud skweaking  Overall the stay was just fine  however we would not stay here again  Thank you  No water pressure on Kitchen Sink  Bathroom Fan doesnt work  bathroom sink and shower did not drain well at all   Our  nd morning there was no hot water at all  The bed frame is weak and wobbles pretty bad  Also the barking dog across the hall was  very obnoxious  Not too happy about those things  but overall the stay was just fine 
430372282783122966,Excellent Stay Will book again
408691162783737913,Great location with wonderful amenities  Clean condo with easy checkin and parking once we figured out the fobs  Can we ask what kind of mattress was in this condo  We really liked it 
391309981900164694,Make sure key work before
751241582,Thank you for hospitality
427474926256430093,This is the most perfect and comfortable place to stay while in Chicago  It is maybe    minutes away from the center of Chicago but there are so many good restaurants  cafes  bars  stores  literally anything you would need  There is a Thai restaurant steps away and it was so incredibly good   Its a really cute neighborhood  Transit is a short walk away and there is plenty of free parking around the corner  The place was so clean and nicely decorated  it had just enough of what you would need  I was sad to leave and hope to be back soon  This was my first time staying at an Airbnb and it was the best experience  Check in out was easy  and the apartment was so clean and comfortable to stay and hang out in  Its apartment goals 
751238611,The space is small but perfect  the location was great it was close to everything I wanted to see 
751237796,Big place with a great location in a nice building  Good value 
751212575,This apartment was very suitable for a few days stay  It is on a pretty quiet street  The owner was slow to communicate access information but once I contacted them they emailed them immediately  Fortunately we called them during their office hours  Everything was pretty good  but the bathroom sink was a problem since it took so long to drain  The lobby was messy  The instructions were not completely accurate  WiFi address in instructions didn t match the actual requirements to log into the router  I had to comp tact host after checking time to get access instructions  Once I contacted them they immediately sent to details  Checkout instructions came after I had already left  I put the key back in the lock box then after I was gone I the instructions they emailed me said leave them inside  The apartment was clean  But the bathroom sink is extremely slow to drain  It took the sink probably   minutes to drain  Late  I had to call after checking time to get access instructions  He
770059777,Zen s place is in a great location in the heart of Hyde Park  The apartment is appointed in a spare manner but it has the essentials including good wifi and AC  It would be nice to fix up the place a bit  e g  replacing or repairing the chair in the bedroom that largely unusable 
751022787,Beautiful space  Even better area  I was able to get to everything  Definitely recommend Thank you so much for an amazing stay 
489883395296351050,Slawik was an excellent host  Communicative and accommodating  I highly recommend him  Slawik was a great host  House is exactly as described and in a great location
391944460658232398,      loved the place great location  clean apartment parking was a lil complicated but so worth it great stay    Thank you so much for allowing me to stay the apartment was amazing    The only suggestion I d give was adding water bottles and little things like that but that s literally the only thing I could complain about lol amazing place amazing location again Tysm  
750977330,Nice Not clear
750966826,Highly recommended   Thanks  
750962018,Solid apartment   Spartan   one more LR chair  and another floor light would go a long way  Great interactions with Zencity staff   And I really appreciate the team sending me my power cord after I forgot it  Additional fees do make the value proposition a bit less attractive
750776637,Good location  sunny apartment 
750585703,Great view
392689134109411534,Great space and clean  just as advertised  Quick drive rideshare away from restraints and bars  Good location  Great stay  Place was great and just as advertised  Only issue was entry door code    apparently it is      to access the building  The provided code worked on the other tower but not       Thanks 
424609235588339262,My stay was great  The location is fantastic and the space was very clean modern and easy to check in to 
437625946342823989,Clean  Cozy  and Comfy  Perfect spot for a good time in Chicago  it s a walk to food  there s a park right across the street and it s only       minutes from downtown  Had a blast and will BE BACK  Thank you for all the accommodations  Had a beautiful time 
435438048898891619,Great place
424614265152635508,An amazing condo in an amazing location  Walking distance from Forest Park and the bustling Central West End and more affordable than any hotel in the area   cannot recommend enough  Thanks again for such a wonderful stay 
394119298886046552,Was clean and cute and centrally located  There was some confusion with how to get into the building upon first entry as the system was down but otherwise a good stay  Thanks so much for the stay 
750131745,Difficult parking  as expected   a little less clean  Overall great for the price  Will be back surely 
750130606,The Airbnb is located in a great location  many restaurants and bars  Would definitely stay again  Thank you so much  The Airbnb was great and in an amazing location 
391955223855147231,No parking was a bummer   bed frame was broken to the point where half of the bed is completely unusable  Otherwise cool  Bed frame was broken and honestly a danger to your guests  Check in took    minutes as I had to troubleshoot the key box malfunction with customer service  No parking in the middle of a busy city was a pretty big bummer 
391246782829916198,this large apartment offers a comfy bed  stylish digs  and is in a great location  The parking isnt great and we had a less than super clean experience  My wife and I enjoyed your check in process and the location of this Airbnb  It was very stylish  Our stay was made poor because the apartment had not been clean thoroughly before we arrived  There was an old mask on the counter  dirty dishes in the sink  hairs in the towels and on the countertops  and a bunch of trash in the trashcan  The lack of hot water was forgivable but the cleanliness was not 
389032534574486637,Not fancy  but comfortable  Loved the old building  Great location  Very convenient to shops and dining  More towels washcloths would have been nice  We were showering morning and night due to summer temperatures and getting sweaty while walking around the city   Coffee and creamer would be a nice touch since there is a coffee pot 
750109931,Great place with a quick walk to Wrigley  Thanks for a great space to stay  already recommended to friends who want to be in that area of Chicago 
750083703,This place is just as advertised  Clean quiet and conveniently located in the City  
749929637,Very roomy for    Clean  Cool  modern decor  My boyfriend and I stayed there for the weekend and loved it  It was quick and super easy to communicate to Zencity with questions  Definitely recommend this place or any Zencity location 
749891641,thank you  
749460873,This is an outstanding and fun location   I loved walking thru the neighborhoods   Chicago has been  taking good care of their city lately   Kudos   Good deal for the money   This unit sleeps   with   bed   But I enjoyed the stay  I thought your place was excellent in location and cleanliness    I see you need some work in the bath but for the money it was good   I suggest that you put up a new shower curtain tho   there is bold at the bottom and that is a quick fix   good luck in the future the unit was advertised to sleep   ppl   also the host said   could sleep in the bed   this is not the case   the bed sleeps   and the sofa is not a sleeper sofa and was cushions were aged and uncomfortable  really pretty good communication
424601879360799700,Dope spot
394117959444406553,The apartment was exactly as advertised  It was perfect  I had a wonderful experience  Everything was as advertised  and if the need ever arises again I will be back 
437680385931092147,As described  very stylish  clean apartment with secure parking  Will stay again

437630609657842331,Very nice
410060055816707535,Over all a great apartment
411604123964024764,This space was clean  cozy  and wonderfully located  Parking was a bit of a hassle but other than that this stay was great 
431138225635477750,Beautiful Apartment with Spacious Bedroom  Quick Response time Beautiful apartment with very spacious bedroom
749232037,the property was not clean at all  Zencity offered me an immediate refund  Outside of being disappointed with the room  and having to find a new place same day  I received good service from Zencity  Absolutely filthy  Didn t match the pictures online at all  The art on the wall in the main online picture isn t even there in real life  I don t understand how that was clean  and how someone is expected to comfortably stay there  Should drop the price to     bucks a night 
421650272747910291,Good location for a good price Overall good place to stay  There was just a bit of miscommunication upon arrival  The keys were not ready 
749207896,Very cute  Clean private space  Beautiful at night  Netflix and food delivery options are available  Only downside is parking like other reviews have stated  If you have a car it may not be the best stay  Thank you for the accommodations 
748952512,great place in gold coast area  gorgeous views and comfy beds 
748906528,The place was excellent  I would definitely recommend staying there while you re in chicago  Thank you for allowing me in your space 
748896745,can be tricky to find nearby parking  which Is definitely inconvenient but decent neighborhood and lots of nearby stuff today and great bang for buck
748892601,Highly recommended
748735023,Wonderful location  and great view  Had a great time
753661599,It liked my stay in Hyde Park  Communication was smooth  After having some issues with my first apartment they quickly arranged a new one for me  If you are planning  a short or even longer trip to Chicago I can recommend Zencity  Hi    Thanks for being so helpful during my stay  I enjoyed especially my second apartment  It would be nice to have a short instruction in the flat with e g  description where to find the laundry room etc    I will recommend you    Best  Julia
408290750465765096,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
392712593735215454,Great apt  I didn t like how the washer didn t work correctly  I consistently had to press start and it simply would not run on cold  However  the apt is awesome  It was so beautiful and there s a jacuzzi on the roof  Great vacation 
748726225,This apartment is in a prime location  It is around several restaurants  bars  and parks  It is even within walking distance from a Target  A short    minute walk will even get you to excellent cafe s  gyms  and clothing stores  It is also within walking distance of Fullerton train station  The most important part  to me  was that it is in a safe location  My friend and I felt secure walking in and out in the evening  of course  if you stay here  use common sense and instinct  and checking out the local eateries        As far as Zencity goes  they were very helpful and communicating was easy  The check in and check out process was smooth        I do recommend this stay  especially if you are unfamiliar with the city  This was my first time in Chicago and with the help of this stay  I have nothing but great memories here  Thank you again for the stay  Although brief we had a great time  We have pretty much no complaints as the location was perfect and we felt safe going in and out of the building  The only issues were that there was a lot of hair on one of the beds when we arrived and in the other bed there was a lot of dirt around the heating system with a cigarette butt stuffed under one of them  However  this did not really negatively impact our stay  Thank you again for the accommodations 
748715979,very large space for price  had lots of amenities and close to public transportation  home wasn t the cleanest but was a great value for the space nonetheless i wasn t sent check in instructions and had to call to get them the house wasn t super clean  a dirty mask was left  a bit dusty  etc 
748319069,Great spot will be back soon Great looking forward to staying again
748288848,Good service and enjoyed my stay   Appreciate the accuracy of the listing and covid countermeasures  Good service and enjoyed my stay   Appreciate the accuracy of the listing and covid countermeasures 
748281585,Nice place with everything you need Thank you 
748244420,Great place
748049480,The location is convenient  right next to the Belmont L station   Plenty of restaurants and shopping in the neighborhood   Lake Michigan is just a short walk   The space is small  a studio  and rather stark   There was no place to sit other than the table and chairs   The kitchen was minimally equipped   Train noise is not an issue since the windows are well insulated   We had a problem with the condo door keypad for entry   It took a call to Zencity and downloading an iPhone app to gain entry  The entry process was a bit complicated with all the codes   There are two gates and one door to get though before entering the building   The condo front door key pad didnt work   I had to call Zencity   You provided me with a phone app to open the door  which was a bit complicated and time consuming 
748021569,Easy check in system  Great location and great value  The only issue I had was that the check in information wasnt sent beforehand  Maybe it was an anomaly but I sent a couple messages and then received all the check in information within a few hours  I did check in late though so they may be more responsive during the actual check in hour  Clean space and again the value  I would book with Zencity again 
429618327640207946,Great apartment 
747947082,Great spot with a great view    th floor with a dining table that is surrounded by windows  In and out is easy  Parking isnt included  but with Spot Hero or Parking com we were able to snag some good deals for as low as     a night  Theres even a    minute unloading space in front of the building  which made it more convenient that I anticipated  Finishes are very nice  The kitchen is tight  but very functional  Perfect for two couples on a long weekend  The balcony is pretty stellar as well  Would stay again  The listing states that there is air conditioning  but there was clearly no air conditioning  Im guessing the building as a whole hasnt turned over yet to AC  but it would have been nice to know prior to booking  or at least check in  We all slept poorly    Otherwise  the apartment was beautiful  Incredible view and great decor  Details said air conditioning  however it was clearly not turned on in the building  None of us slept well because it was hot and stuffy in the evenings and loud with the windows open 
394874164571298269,Clean apartment and great location  Easy walk to get anywhere downtown  Thanks so much  we enjoyed our stay at your apartment 
747889448,Im hesitant to write a good review because I want this to be available for my next visit   The location is perfect and the apartment was so nice   Ill definitely be looking for this one when I return  Thanks for the great stay   The apartment was in a great location and I hope that Ill be able to stay again next time  Just something that you may not have been aware of  there are no bulbs in the bedside lamps   Thanks again 
747134771,Great view  The inside decor was amazing  Easy in and out access  So much to do around here right in the heart of the viagra triangle  The battery in the lock is dying it kept reminding me  The floors hadn t been mopped in a long time so my feet were black from walking around  The black chair also never been dusted so yeah that was nice to find out  So much was just not clean clean but looked clean 
412287001686547764,Nice clean unit with great amenities in the building  It would be great to have basic kitchen items in the unit   Lacking a kitchen knife  mixing bowls and coffee machine    Also garbage disposal isn t working and shower head slips down when showering     Otherwise all good 
747127808,Very swanky  Got a great deal  would recommend  Very strict no option to check in earlier  I was given instructions to get into the building but had to wait outside of the apartment for about an hour before I could get in as the lock on the door was set on an automatic timer  It was a setback for my work and slightly inconvenient but I guess I now know for next time 
746625876,there wasnt no parking after a certain time of day no parking
746594633,The view and balcony was incredible  Very nice location and building  Definitely would stay here again 
434075078396217446,Wonderful location in Hyde Park in a grand old building  Close to lake  shopping  U of Chicago  Plenty of space and very functional  I had everything I needed  I found the key to be very tricky  for what its worth  It always opened eventually  but  it usually took multiple attempts  Other than that  everything was great
392738479841908369,Great location just a couple minutes walk to Lafayette Park and near the highway  Gated parking was super convenient  Was perfect for the two of us for our week stay  Thanks 
412226036693028039,Just be prepared to haul your luggage a long distance  possibly up   flights of stairs  The elevators to the garage  the garage your advised to park in  were broken and had been for months according to staff  The roof top that is advertised is for  residents  only not Airbnb guests  All in all this was a disappointment  Not recommended for older individuals or anyone with knee issues 
409359851584188157,Great location with plenty of access to restaurants and nightlife  Was a short walk from the KC Streetcar as well which was convenient to go down to the City Market  Really liked that it came with a free parking spot  Would recommend the listing to anyone  Only thing that confused us was the parking garage and how to utilize the secondary fob  With all the signage in the garage saying we needed a   digit code to get in  we mistakenly thought it was supposed to be the code on the parking pass provided with the Airbnb  We eventually figured out that we needed to scan the key pad with the secondary fob provided  Not a big deal  but just thought I d point it out    The WiFi passcode and name listed in the apartment itself was discrepant from the info provided in the email for check in as well    Overall though  we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the location  Made it very easy to go to Kauffman Stadium and all the other locations we went to this weekend   Thanks 
389803661036936376,The only toilet broke in the apartment on our first full day  there were   guests  which was already tough to share one bathroom   Zencity was not responsive for an ETA for a fix or any help throughout the process   they did not fix the bathroom or provide us with any sort of solution or remediation   Ultimately ended up not having a usable bathroom  On top of that  the wifi went out and we were unable to use any of our devices 
387650982296132637,Very comfortable beds and pillows  super clean apartment  very comfortable place to stay  If we ever head back to KC  Id be happy to stay here again  Thank you so much for working with us on getting us some more towels 
746590082,Needed a last minute place to stay  The host replied within minutes on a holiday weekend  The apartment was cozy and clean 
746441515,The apartment was great  Nice bathroom in the front of the place  A lot of space  Quiet  Easy access to public transportation  the lake  biking and restaurants   The guest policy is a bit limited especially when visiting close friends and family 
746438175,Exactly like the pictures  Very clean and stylish place  Right by a field for a school  Lots of yelling children 
389119909206849831,Great location  very nice building and apartment Place was great
765648284,This Airbnb is in a great location in Hyde Park close to campus  The apartment was clean  spacious  and generally nice  Check in was easy and the building seems secure  I would say that the place is not suited for a long term stay but works for a shorter visit   The bed is not comfortable  so the place may be a bad fit for guests who are sensitive about this  Hi there  we enjoyed our stay at the apartment and it generally suited our needs  A few essentials were missing  however  A dish rack would have been very useful  as would a lamp of some sort in the bedroom as an alternative to the harsh overhead light  The windows are very dirty on the outside  making the rooms darker than they otherwise would be during the day  Finally  the bed is very uncomfortable  If these shortcomings were corrected  the apartment would be a great Airbnb 
412264364881636785,Thank you
452816694927243709,great stay here  Close to everything  restaurants  grocery store  CTA literally next door    Washer and Dryer which is always a plus  Would definitely recommend
426105579108828353,Good spot if you re on a budget  Block away from Whole Foods and bus stop  driving distance to downtown 
394840599813619610,Great location  about    minutes from Downtown Chicago with nightlife  attractions  and lots of places to eat   The place was very clean  Everyone at Del Prado was super nice  Thank you so much  We had a great time
746427348,This place was amazing  Will be traveling back to Chicago as long as I can book a stay here again   I felt so comfortable and at home here  This place was amazing  Will be traveling back to Chicago as long as I can book a stay here again   I felt so comfortable and at home here 
417347983736963148,Totally workable plain pad for the week  Glad there was a filled ice tray  The bed is very noisy and shakey  I was worried I was going to break it   
412235913953232745,The apartment appears a lot bigger in pictures than it really is  That being said it was in a great spot  The balcony is attached to other residents and is literally directly over the train station  but you can t hear much of anything at night  The apartment was pretty clean just the sheets had hairs on them and the back ups did too but with laundry in unit and reading some previous reviews I knew to bring my own set  Overall place did its job 
424735266569927297,Though the location of this unit is perfect and had potential to be a wonderful stay the unit was not clean and we needed to move to a hotel   Immediately upon entering the unit  we were hit by a strong cigarette smell  After walking around in     degree weather waiting for check  in we needed to shower  One of us hopped in the shower and we soon found out they there were no towels in the unit  Not even a hand towel  The  shower was filthy and was covered in the last guest s purple shampoo  The purple shampoo was in the tub and the shower curtain  The shower curtain was covered in mold and extremely dirty   We needed to dry our selves off with back up sheets which were in a closet that unfortunately also had stains    Gross   In between the sink vanity and the cabinet there is black mold which is a health hazard   The bedsheets had hair on them and appeared as though they had not been washed  The carpet was covered in crumbs  and the floors were covered with dust and debris in some sections    The couch pillows were stained   The kicker is that there was a  last clean  sticker by the wifi code  The date on it was over   weeks before our stay   Though the bed was made and the trash had been taken out it was very clear that the unit had not been thoroughly clean in between guests  Which is shocking as it is listed as  enhanced clean    We immediately tried to get in touch with the host and they did not get back to us for hours  until air bnb cancelled our booking   and processed a refund   When that happened  they immediately contacted us   What was extremely frustrating was that all of the other comparable units in the area had been booked and we were unable to relocate with another unit in the central west end with a kitchen or access to a washer dryer  We wound up getting the very last room at a hotel in the area  Needless to say  we reshowered    On a positive note  the doorman was fantastic  Our plane landed at    and they watched our bags for us until check in  The building staff were extremely lovely as well    Air Bnb also support was easy to work with and made it clear from the beginning that we were protected in this situation   I would avoid booking with this company 
406449967160296675,Great space  Wether for one day or multiple this is a clean  calm space to enjoy  Bonus that it s over a great coffee shop  The host was amazing with communication and any request we had  Thank you so much  This was such a beautiful place to escape to  Everything was wonderful and we are honored to have been able to spend time here 
746417274,Great place and location  some of the dishes were a bit dirty 
409410054542563934,Good location for what we wanted to do while in St  Louis  This particular rental could be made better with a moderate amount of updates and refreshes to paint and furniture  This rental was a  big miss for us  The following were issues we encountered     Light out in bathroom    Inability to control air temperature  Please provide standup fans as an alternative  It was very hot and uncomfortable     Paint the walls  The pictures online appear are very different from what actually is  The walls are very dirty      Paint on bathtub    Shower and sink did not drain    Perhaps invest in a new couch  It is worn and stained  We didnt even sit on it     The lock for the door is not secure  Anyone could break it in easily  There was a guy pounding on the door next to us  screaming in the middle of the night at whoever was inside  You could see peeks of the outside through the crack of the door itself  It was scary 
394123775699926542,Nice place with great amenities 
438362776341606860,The home was absolutely phenomenal and spacious        I enjoyed my stay  the ceiling was high and super cozy to stay at with fine art work that compliments the home  The host was very responsive  Informative and checkin was super easy  The place was clean and had everything needed  The TV had plenty of entertainments such as multiple streaming apps which is a huge plus and the linen was so comfortable as I slept like a baby  Thank you for allowing me to stay here  I will definitely be back the next time I m St  Louis and I recommend coming here as it is extremely peaceful  Thank you so much for allowing me to stay at your beautiful loft home  The home was super cozy and beautiful all around  I love the art work and touches throughout the home  Please leave great feedback as well  Thank you  A       
394940835269180624,Great place to stay for a few nights with the convenience to many things around the city  We enjoyed our stay and it definitely met expectations  The only thing that was a bit of a bother was the parking situation 
746407008,I really enjoyed my stay  I was expecting less about the apartment due to the review but I was wrong  I love the apartment and location which I enjoyed my stay and it was sparkling clean and well arranged  I will recommend to anyone  Thank you so much  I really enjoyed my stay and I m very sorry for the loud tv noise on the previous day 
746179429,Definitely felt like home We loved the apartment  It was beautiful and stylish and extremely quiet  It was a bit farther from the city but we loved the costal and chill vibe close to a Whole Foods and restaurants  Check in was a bit of a confusion but definitely not a deal breaker 
394934468989321275,Loved the inside 
746178899,Zen city was amazing  although I did not like the unresponsive host and difficulty check in   it was still worth the experience 
746111915,The space looked exactly like the pictures  It was clean and quiet and i enjoyed my stay here overall  The host provides you with towels  pots and pans  and clean supplies  The TV is also logged in to almost every streaming provider so that was nice  The only thing that was a bit annoying is that Free Parking is listed under amenities but there really isn t anywhere to park your car  We had to park far away and walk to the apartments because there is VERY limited street parking  Also  the listing gives you the option to look on the SpotHero for paid parking but just a heads up if you park in any garage you cannot leave and come back in even if you paid for multiple days  Also there is a washer and dryer but its in the basement and you need quarters to use it  Thanks i loved the space  The only thing I would say is that you should let guests know that there isnt really any parking near the apartments and they will either have to pay for a garage or park far away and walk to the apartment which can be annoying with a lot of bags  no parking
523193260831645874,very nice 
452849703405296795,The A C wasn t working for the first day and a half of our stay  and it was extremely hard to get a response from the hosts without going through Airbnb first  The hosts had the maintenance people come on the second day with no warning  and we had to cancel plans we had because the maintenance people were given no instruction on how to get back into the unit without us there  The key FOB given to us did not work to access the unit  even though it was supposed to as specified in the check in instructions  On our last night of our stay  we were locked out of the building because the keypad screen was frozen and the key FOB couldn t grant us access into the building  I could not get ahold of the hosts until I finally reached out to Airbnb support  The hosts did nothing to help  They just kept asking for photo and video proof that we could not get into the building  We waited outside for   hours just to get back into the unit  The only reason we even got back in was because of a resident walking her dog  This will be the last time I book an Airbnb from this company 
452883374253630430,Easy check in and great location   Price     
431819302523250702,Just didn t meet my standards  Property is old and the clean crew sucks  I got to one unit it was dirty  Communication suck and once I got in touch with somebody I was told I couldn t get a refund so they moved to another unit in a different building cleaner but old and the shower curtain was nasty dirty
412232610415066743,Wonderful stay  good location  and super easy to park and check in  Just wanted to make sure you know  I couldnt get the hair drier to work and the living area blinds would not clothes  Otherwise all was perfect  Thank yiou
745654702,Perfect location and such a wonderful place to rest at the end of the day   We cannot wait to return to Chicago and stay here again   We loved your place   Thank you so much   We did want you to know the bottom door never locks which were fine with and your coffee table is so cute but past renters must have been hard on it because it is very shaky  We cannot wait to return and will suggest your home to others   Thank you 
745621661,The apartment overall was fine  There were handprints on the window and stains on the couch  Unfortunately had a period of no WiFi while I was there and the host didn t respond until     am  Other than that  it was very cute  Check in was quick and easy  Street parking is terrible  Better off paying for a lot  I would book again though  There were handprints all over the windows and liquid stains all over the couch  There was also stains on the back of the couch  The WiFi went out at     pm and when I tried to reach out she didn t respond until     am  Unfortunately I was trying to do work on my laptop and wasn t able to complete it because I didn t get a response
434737875919398169,Great location
434712008449621044,We got there and the electric lock wasn t working properly   The code they gave us didn t work   We called and did get it all worked out but it was kind of a pain   The AC wasn t working and they had floor units but they really didn t do much   It was hot in there   The location is excellent but the AC being out in August made it a rough stay   I messaged Airbnb to send someone to check it out but never got a response  The AC in the place was not working and the electronic lock was not working properly when we got there   Overall it was a decent experience but I don t know if I would recommend it to anyone until the AC gets fixed
467409044786602793,Beautiful Place Perfect Location Nice Views Thank you for Hosting Me it was a pleasure
745593501,I wish they would have spent more time setting up this place before making it available on Airbnb  TV wasnt set up  No lightbulbs in lamps  Price tags on decorative items  Also  we were only given two towels for the two of us for the entire weekend  No washcloths  No hand towels  I also had to ask multiple times for check in information  They finally sent it an hour after the scheduled check in 
438333860454118131,BEWARE  READ AND BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS      I have rented many Airbnb s  This is by far the worst experience I have had  I wished I believed the negative reviews and steered clear   to note for everyone  the host ZenCity is a large property management company that specializes in marketing and AirBnB and drives their costs down by offering terrible management services   here are the Key issues I ran into  They are all common themes amongst reviews     the digital locks malfunction OFTEN  we were locked out of the property for an entire evening  We called the host  a call center in the Philippines is who answers  and we were on the phone with them for   hours  in the rain  with my   and    year old daughters  to argue with them about the problem and they never sent anyone to help us  We gave up and got a hotel for the night   We made videos and provided to the host on how their new wifi   digital only locks were not accepting input     service is terrible  if you have an emergency  liked a family of   with young kids being locked out for the entire night due to a wifi lock not working   there is no actual owner   people available  ZenCity  the host  is a large property manager and you only talk to call center representatives in the Philippines   When we eventually had to get a hotel for the night  the host even argued   declined to reimburse us for the hotel  Luckily Airbnb is handling this for us      the property is filthy  Crumbs on counter tops  sticky floors and hand railings  hair on rugs  stains on towels etc  even trash left on the rooftop patio    the property is run down  The clothes dryer doesn t work  the toilets run  the outdoor furniture is moldy  literally     the property stinks  like cigarette smoke and dust   All in all  it is house is a run down dump with worn out trendy furniture that is run by a large company who don t really care about the property  their service  or you   It s better suited as a party house for a beer pong match and not a place any family  especially with younger children should consider   And to the host  shame on you  Your business model puts the end consumer dead last  We were locked out ALL NIGHT because of malfunctioning digital locks and you had no contingency plan for emergencies  What if one of my children had medication  What if we had an infant and needed formula  diapers etc   It disgusts me how little you think about the peoples lives who rent your homes  This is a terrible business model offering fully outsourced services with no real ownership  and one of the reasons AirBnb has a bad name amongst homeowners  You should be thrown off this platform  As discussed  the property was very dirty  the clothes dryer did not work  and the lock malfunctioned and there was no physical key available   you were unable to have anyone help us while locked out
394927800831001657,We spent an hour trying to enter the apartment because the lock was broken  so we just sat outside on hold with all of our luggage after traveling in July  then when we finally got inside  they hasn t clean from the last guests
745585035,We had a great stay at Zencity   The apt was very clean and it s a great location in a fun neighborhood  very close to the Belmont  L  station  Would definitely stay there again  Thanks Ava  we had a great  loved the apt and the convenience to the  L 
407908423635684938,Great place to stay  Use back door on side of building if front gate doesn t work  Very convenient  clean and affordable The code box to access the building is broken and you have to wait for someone to grant you access to the building unless you go to the gate on the side of the building and use the back door  The check in instructions don t notify you if that  The door handle on the apartment door is also damaged and got stuck a few times  The place is extremely clean comfortable and convenient and I would stay again 
394161658425472554,The actual host answered everything great   The operation host  Zencity  was rude and did not take care of problems   Wished I could have talked with the host instead   Location was great  Place looks like it says  The clean company needs to be replaced  I talk to several agents  some acted like they cared  One was down right rude  I sent pictures with the problems of the hair balls  long strands of black hair in every room  the one bedroom bed was actual broken on the bottom  bedroom closest to street   By the way my daughters are blond and I have very short grey hair  The dishes and silverware were disgusting  Asked if there could be a discount on the clean  since I then vacuum and picked up and re ran the dishwasher   Was told I had to wait at least a week to see if they would counter   As of today that still has not happened  The one that was rude told me that the cleaners had sent pictures and it WAS clean  I told her that I had sent pictures also   I am not unhappy with the place  just that IT WAS NOT CLEAN and felt very much that Zencity was rude  Thus the rating   Should have seen that coming by the other viewers 
396287401054066887,Good location  convenient access   swift communication  The apartment did not appear entirely clean  the floor  tv and mirrors all were very dirty  Found a left over toothbrush from previous guest in bathroom  Linens were clean and place was tidy  but could use an extra mop vacuum and wipe down  Otherwise pleasant  easy access  friendly doorman  good communication   quiet setting  Parking was slightly a hassle 
438344511771365337,Good value for money and as described  Great location 
396282444519604678,My husband and I took a mini vacation to St Louis and stayed here  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay  We were minutes from Busch Stadium  the zoo   and city museum  The only thing we wished could have been different was a free parking spot but we always had a meter available close to the apartment  We will definitely be back 
745552250,if it wasnt for how dirty the place was    it was a close location to university chicago medical center and walking distance to the lake    to bad the place was filthy bed was full of hair  fridge was gross  definitely not covid    clean
745485758,Close to downtown
745466347,Nice places but very poor communication  They have no thermostat so hopefully they get this worked out  I would love a return phone call  And some customer service to deal with these issues   I ve been trying to reach someone about my stay for   days  Supposedly booked two studios bc they didn t have anything to sleep two people   Even was told they couldn t offer one w a couch  One place ended up being a full apartment w couch and bedroom and could have slept    Also had no thermostat in hmeither room and the place was insanely hot over a warm Chicago weekend  Also no lights in master bedroom  Key pad code did not work  Got a return call hours later w a new code Absolutely impossible to reach  Miscommunication about the rooms  Very unhappy  Still have yet to get a return phone call  I paid for two rooms when I didn t need to  Was told both were studios and one was a full apartment that could have accommodated   people
745436565,The location was perfect  And the beds were heaven  I wish there were more comforts  like nicer shampoo or soap  paper towels etc     and please trash the rug that was there     The intercom at the front door didn t work as described  but once I got on   it was fine The apartment was really comfortable  although a bit smaller than what it seemed in the pictures   but no big deal  The bad thing was the rug  which she d like an old dog   the entire apartment was full of lint  if you sat down anywhere  you d be covered in it  I d definitely suggest trashing it  and maybe getting a new rug
410791457117186910,Not too loud at all  comfortable and spacious for the price  Fair warning  the bathrooms don t look exactly the same as the picture  we got a significantly smaller one than the one posted above  Other than that  the place was perfect  Thank you Zencity  The place was fantastic asides from a few minor things  Part of the reason I picked this spot over others was for the double mirror in the bathroom  and our space came with only one  Although the world wasn t ending  it was a little annoying just because it was four females staying in one space so getting ready took a lot longer than we d planned it to  Also  we d had a scary experience where we d heard some loud bangs outside and decided to call the police to check it out just in case  I cannot confirm what it was  but it definitely made us feel a little unsafe  That s definitely not something you can control though  so I get it  Other than that  everything was perfect  Thanks so much for allowing us to stay here and have such a fun trip   
434756858804490533,Great place in downtown  Loved staying here and we had a wonderful weekend  Thanks for the stay  Had a great weekend
431085288341040838,lovely place  clean  great view   we love the place  no parking but we always found a spot  Great location  thank you so much for allowing us to book your place  we were super happy with our stay 
448548307616684190,Designed beautifully  but expect to hear a lot of sirens and possibly gun shots from the surrounding area 
745074287,The condo was grossly misrepresented  The condo was not professionally clean  carpet was not vacuumed and kitchen floors were not mopped   stove and vent for the stove was dorty  dead bugs on the floor  bug trap with a lot of dead bugs inside of it  horrible smell of smoke and other orders  extra pillow had blood stains  stains on comforter  urine stains on the bed skirt that looked like a small animal urinated on it  and more  I have pics and video to prove  The claims show up much better in the video  The location was great but the place was too nasty to stay  It was my first airbnb stay and it was horrible  Left and stayed at a Marriott hotel instead  The location was grossly misrepresented  I have video evidence to prove and I want to share with you  Could you please provide an email so I can do so 
745040993,Good location near Whole Foods  Apartment was clean but there was an empty cigar box under the radiator and mint box on the counter  so not clean well enough because there was still some garbage  Host was communicative when I locked myself out of the apartment  but did not respond to my inquiry on how to find the washer advertised on the listing  I found an empty cigar box under the radiator and an empty mint box on the kitchen counter when I entered in the apartment the first time  Its clear someone clean and vacuumed  but they missed some spots  I never got a response from the host regarding the washer advertised on the listing  Not all amenities listed were present 
395633728237992161,Good spot for our short stay  Parking on street worked for us since we weren t there very long  Only issue was WiFi didn t stay connected
745006920,Great view and so much in walking distance Bathroom tube drain clogged
409386172074902882,This Airbnb was amazing  The location was perfect  we checked out the park  market  brew pub and coffee shops near by  We enjoyed the short drive to Souldar where we found some yummy restaurants and fun bars  Ballpark village was a blast and not too far either  We loved the rooftop with the hot tubs  Thank you for a wonderful stay 
445586200193083109,Bad experience  The reviews are      accurate  the walls in this unit are made of paper  You can hear water flushing and feet stomping like they are inches away from you  The entire unit was so poorly constructed we thought the door was going to come off during our stay  Absolutely not worth the price we paid for it  Would not recommend  I am blown away by what we paid for this unit  Over      a night for this unit was outrageous  You need to have someone check out the door frame on the entrance  because it is about to come off the hinges  Will not be recommending this unit or your company to anyone 
471696772897175256,Great place in the Center of St Louis  MO   Alot of eating places with in walking distance Very clean place highly recommended 
744953225,Location was excellent  Best part was the balcony and the amazing views of the downtown especially during sunset  Overall the space is stylish and clean  It was a bit expensive though and parking was extra but that s just how downtown Chicago is  I would definitey stay here again  Bed sheets were stained
744664919,Thank you  It was great
452898024052704201,We enjoyed our stay    Plenty of space and very comfy accommodations  Great location  however parking can be a nightmare 
504397749212794597,The good  Check in was smooth and the space was in a good location to get around Chicago  It s wonderfully quiet for a city block  beds are comfy  shower was great  and finding parking was not too difficult  The bad  The dryer was broken  there were dirty spots on floors  bathrooms needed clean  there are only two spots for people to sit in living room  no dining table  and very little cutlery  Fine for two people but three was a stretch in terms of supplies   Thanks for the accommodations  Dryer broken  Response time slow  Not enough cutlery  Dirty rugs  tripping hazard  Privacy not good since blinds are a mess 
452891153416024402,Nice
411572538274685857,be very quiet if you stay here 
431095478786509611,This was a quick last minute get away for me  I envisioned a quiet place to read by the pool   and for PART of the time it was  Note  this apartment is a building of mostly college aged and young adult renters  Its a neat use of space and there are lots of public areas  including a great courtyard pool layout  When I arrived Sunday afternoon however  it was an all out pool party    or more accurately    different pool parties each attended by     people  It was a rocking place and would be fun if thats your scene  Not quite what I was looking for    On Monday morning however  when I went down to the pool at  am it was empty with the exception of the buildings clean crew and until about  pm was  mostly then quiet poolside retreat Id hope for   Some notes     theres only one elevator for the whole building and theres no freight elevator  Because I happened to be there on a  move in  type weekend there were lots of long waits for the elevator     this is a very secure building and the fob youll find at checkin is required even to leave the pool area and go back into the building  Theres only one FOB    keep it with you and know that this means if more than one person is staying youll need to figure out whos holding it and coordinate schedules because you are practically trapped without it    Ive never been in an AirBnB that doesnt have plates  silverware  etc    kitchen appliances are there and cabinetry is beautiful  but almost entirely empty  Eating in the apartment will require that you bring quite a bit in with you   even the basics   Having access to a washer dryer is fantastic  shower is great   but again  no extras  no hair dryer  etc   Some AirBnB go all out on quality linens  high thread count sheets  etc     this is not one of those places plates and silverware would be a nice addition  also perhaps a warning about the Sunday night and weekend pool crowd
391983610570008561,Great location in the Hyde Park area  Place was not properly clean as I found several stains on the bed sheets and bathing towels  Not much items left behind for your use such as toiletries  Difficulties connecting to WiFi Great location in the Hyde Park area  Place was not properly clean as I found several stains on the bed sheets and bathing towels  Not much items left behind for your use such as toiletries  Difficulties connecting to WiFi
431070807766456444,Awesome location for a St  Louis Trip we did where we spent a lot of time around Forest Park  Being directly across the street from Whole Foods was a life saver  and there are plenty of restaurants near by as well  Property was clean and well stocked  would stay at again  I could see parking being an issue but we got lucky every night and had free street parking right next to the property  Thanks for everything  loved the stay 
744638464,Awesome place  Nice size place  and has everything you could need  Also placed really well  took us about       minutes to drive to the everything in the city or Uber  Will definitely be staying again  Thank you so much for the awesome stay  I will most likely be back again this summer    Nothing to do with the Host  they gave very clear instructions  However  the front desk people had no idea who we were  and it took us over    minutes to check in  We were sent to over   different places to get our key 
744418663,Great space   plenty of room  Three good sized bedrooms  plus a good sized kitchen  living room  and an additional room with a desk  The location is great  Right by plenty of cool restaurants  the Belmont L stop  plus you can easily walk to Wrigley  We had a great stay  Thanks so much  We had a great stay  The bedding and towels were clean  which is most important  but you can tell there hasn t been a deep clean there in a while  A lot of areas throughout were pretty dusty  It didn t bother me much  but it s pretty noticeable 
744417854,Amazing view    out of    the only thing was the parking  parking
744371708,I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone  The fob wasnt given to me  I was given the wrong access code to enter the building  I had to stand outside for a while to wait for someone to enter  exit the building so I can get in  I couldnt use the gym because I didnt have the fob   The shower was disgusting  The water wasnt going down the drain and it kept getting higher and higher  I contacted the host and they wanted maintenance to come fix it but I didnt sign up for This  The sheets were dirty with black hair on them     My hair isnt black        stars  Still waiting for my refund I would like a refund The photos are a little different I didnt get the key  I was locked outside and had to wait for someone to enter exit the building for me to enter  The bed was dirty with black hair on the sheets  The water in the shower wouldnt go down 
538386156158045231,Great location
434783548467406335,This was a great place to stay  It was super convenient for everywhere that we needed to be  The front desk staff was helpful as we were bringing our stuff in and out  This place felt super safe with the need to use a key fob to enter the lobby and then the elevator  Hello    Thank you very much  We had an enjoyable stay at the AirBNB  A couple of suggestions that wouldve improved our overall good experience      We wish that there would have been more towels instead of just   towel per person     The couch was quite low to the ground and was a bit challenging for   of the   of us to easily get up from     Also  we werent sure if the floor was dirty or had some sort of lacquer on it but it turned the soles of our bare feet black as soot    Otherwise  this was a great stay  The front desk staff were quite helpful and the location was perfect for our needs 
397790160530730256,super close to bjh and forest park  parking is half a block away  about     day  stayed there with   little kids and it was fine  super easy  thank you 
744356730,The place is great  larger than pictured  However transportation for getting into the main point of Chicago was a bit expensive  The space was open and clean and it was very comfy  Also the Sip and Savor coffeehouse is absolutely amazing  We appreciate the stay  we enjoyed every moment of it and would plan to come back again some time  Transportation was far more expensive outside of the main side of Chicago 
471040149339167755,Place was clean  Bed was comfy  My car was safe in a very well lit parking garage  Streets were well lit  yet kinda had sketchy vibes  I arrived late though  like around midnight  All In all  it was as advertised  
412953399244726294,Never disappoints  Never disappoints 
431124064888094698,Cute apartment  Right in downtown 
489881759037818361,Considering this is a Hyde Park location  everything was perfect  The place is larger than photos show  bed was comfortable  and lots of storage  The check in process was also fairly easy Thank you for the stay  Everything was perfect  hopefully I ll be booking again 
744350738,Great place and location   Easy check in  very clean and updated  I wish there was a more comfortable lounging chair to sit in to watch TV and the water pressure was low in the shower 
470944062740186382,Great location  Would stay again 
744329601,This place is in a pretty building near the lake   Our price was great compared to a decent hotel in the area   Definitely more space and options than a hotel   BUT  kitchen was not nearly  fully stocked  and Im not talking about food  theres not an actual coffee maker  hodge podge of utensils and a couple of goodwill pots   four plates and four bowls and some mismatched glasses   Threshhold between the kitchen and living area had nailheads sticking up and was not secured to the floor   The odd shaped bathroom toilet is awkward to use as it looks    There was insufficient heating control and it was very hot without opening windows   Poor responsiveness when asked questions about local TV and temp control   There was one tiny tube of shower gel for   people   Solid  reliable wifi   Dont expect vacation level amenities   Some details need to be looked after better   Once stay begins responsiveness wasnt what it needed to be   IF its a great price  its better than a hotel for a basic stay  Nice location   Nice price   Almost great clean  but there were icky crumbs in cabinets and a piece of cereal in the living area  otherwise well done    but price varies throughout the year so sometimes  not as competitive against hotels   Temp control was really bad   Some radiator controls were laying on the floor  broken  One bed was completely unacceptable it was so hard   Almost no comfortable place to sit  Kitchen was kind of a joke when called FULLY STOCKED   No soap for shower   WHoever staffs  Zencity  does not know enough about the unit and does not give quick  helpful advice   TV heating questions were answered flippantly  Solid  reliable wifi  appreciated Kitchen is not  fully stocked   virtually not dishes  Junk pots and pans   Only a press coffee maker   Apartment temperature control was terrible  Some of the maintenance was BAD   threshhold between kitchen and living area was not secured and DANGEROUS  We were only given ONE Key for   people Kitchen   I have photos   Crumbs and debris in empty cabinet PRE Stay it was fine   By e mail messaging  sometimes host did not respond for several hours AND was unhelpful Excellent compared to the COST of a hotel   HOWEVER  Amenities were substandard   Only ONE tiny tube of bath gel  i e   SHOWER SOAP  in the entire unit   Some of the radiator controls were broken it was HOT and we had to open windows even though it was about    degrees outside   Ktichen was barely operable virtually no pots and pans no cooking oil  maybe not salt and pepper no coffee maker  but billed as FULLY STOCKED   No advice on how to access any local programming  NEW WEATHER  on Television   Just a kindle fire TV box full of pay apps   Threshhold between kitchen and living area had sharp edges of nails sticking up  toilet in angles bathroom is almost unusable to sit down for anyone taller than       At least one bed was awful   hard as a rock   Never slept on anything that terrible that wasnt a floor 
744328105,We were headed to Chicago to visit colleges with my daughter  The location was perfect  The place looked too good to be true   and it was  The bathroom shower was clogged so we stood in dirty shower water  I notified them right away and there was no response until late the next day  We went out and bought Liquid Plumber and prayed it would work  It sort of did  but still wasnt draining properly  There was a yippy dog that barked most of the daytime that we were there  Luckily  it stopped at night  Then while we were trying to sleep  water pipes were ticking all night long followed by swooshes of water  We were supposed to be there for   nights  but couldnt stand it  The lack of sleep was getting to us all  We ended up leaving a day early and spending the night at a hotel  Unfortunately  this place only had   review when we booked  so I trusted that itd be a great place  Do yourself a favor and book somewhere else    Unless you plan on getting wasted and passing out at this place so you dont mind any of the noises  On the upside  the appliances and kitchen were nice and clean  and the place had a cute deck out back to hang out  The location is awesome  but parking was hard  We ended up doing SpotHero which worked out better  If you stay in this area or downtown  dont bring a car  The public transportation is awesome  You can take the L almost anywhere  still waiting for reimbursement for inconvenience and the liquid plumber we bought  Really disappointed in the delay and lack of response from your company  overall  the place was clean  but the bathroom shower was not  It was clogged and left us standing in a pool of dirty water when we showered  I emailed and called about the clogged shower and there was no response until the next day  It was so gross that we had to go out and buy Liquid Plumber and pray that it worked  The clogged shower  a barking dog all day  creaking floors from the person above us  and loud pipe noises all night long  Wasnt worth it  We even left a day early because we couldnt take it 
438363358661238677,Apartment looks like the pictures Nice furniture and very well equipment  Doormen is very nice and helpful Apartment has a soft bad smell and the bathroom tiles needs an extra clean  The apartment in general was good  Very good equipped and nice furniture  Great location People at the front desk are amazing
392713923370032756,The property was in a great central location  however the parking was horrible  Checking in was a nightmare  I had to reach out to receive check in information as it was not provide it before hand  Then after    hours on the road get to the property and the code does not work  After calling customer service I was on hold for    minutes just to be told they would call me back in    After    minutes I called them back just to be told to download an app to enter the property  The app did not work as the last person was still connected to it and no way to disconnect them  So for another    to    minutes we were given code after code to try entry none of which worked  The final code which was    digits long finally worked  Once inside all of the blinds were broken and the shower did not work properly  I had to call customer service several times during my stay  the only rep that tried to resolve any issues was Mariano  I hope I spelled that right  This property is listed as an apartment but it really feels like a college dorm  I would not recommend if you are looking for an apartment 
518887944536571711,Two bedroom room in the middle of Hyde Park  Great views of the city  Great place  Thanks for letting us host one of our authors here     Tyndale 
467343138270091211,nice convenient location to restaurants  I walked a lot 
523239058549006304,Loved it  
523203053547931852,Zencity is my go to host for Chicago trips  This building is super nice and conveniently located near a lot of attractions  This unit is awesome and the bed is extremely comfortable 
412991068248290100,Great stay
435526068062287281,The location for this rental is PERFECT for this price   Its literally   ft from the Paulina Train stop  which takes you right to any major location downtown  Its only a    minute walk to the Cubs  Wifi and AC work perfectly  which are the two most important things  The living room and bedroom on the right are SUPER SQUEAKY  so if you move around a lot  use the bedroom connected to the kitchen  When I come back  Im likely going to stay here again  Hey  Thanks for a great weekend  Location and cleanliness was perfect  Was really glad for the washer and dryer  My only suggestion would be to ask the renter to leave the key in the lock box after checkout  Have a great day 
435469625434765239,Ok  so I am going to start with the biggest issue  On the day I was leaving  I found a dead bed bug in my clothes that I picked up off the floor  I immediately messaged Zencity to tell them about this and to ask if they had previously had a bed bug issue or what the deal was  I messaged them on      and it is now     and they still have not replied  This is terrible customer service  Please READ ALL THE REVIEWS  I wish I did  If you read them all  the complaints that people have are valid and      true      Communication is non existent  They send you form messages and there is not a human to check the inbox apparently      The place is dirty  Both beds had hair in them  And it reeks of cigarette smoke  All my clothes and luggage smelled like it after returning home it was that bad     The photos online are either photoshopped or very old  The walls are filthy and covered in patches and different colored paint  It looks really run down for the price you are paying      The stairwell is super dirty and sketchy  Multiple steps creek and sound like they may fall in at any minute      The neighborhood is the only nice thing about this place  HOWEVER  please note that it is not convenient to get downtown and to the major tourist destinations  Maybe it was pre Covid when an Uber Lyft didnt cost     each way  but now it is not  Like I just said  Ubers Lyfts were very expensive to get downtown and the subway is a    minute walk  Plus  once you get to the subway many popular places require you to transfer trains and then walk about    minutes after you get off the train  So in short  it took us       minutes to get anywhere which used up a lot of time and was also just really frustrating      Oh and this one didnt really matter  but it is principle  They sent a message saying to  enjoy the snacks they provided us  but there were no snacks lol     So again  read all the reviews  the things people are saying that are negative are true  I would not stay here and would not rent from Zencity  Those that had a positive experience must have very low standards  I messaged you about finding a bed bug over a week ago and you still havent answered  Luckily  as of right now it seems like it was just a dead one and there wasnt any live ones that left any eggs   but it is still really bad business that you never answered me  I gave ample time for a reply before resorting to leaving you a bad review  I would never stay at one of your places again 
744317898,First off  the location was perfect  We were walking distance from a lot of landmarks  restaurants  stores and bars and a short Uber ride away from surrounding neighborhoods so you definitely dont need a car when staying here  The pictures represent the space well  but it was a little smaller than expected  The views from the balcony are great   The one  and very important thing  we didnt like was the level of cleanliness of the apartment  With COVID  I expected the space to be spotless with the advertised thorough clean they provide but it wasnt  Upon arrival  we saw hair from the previous occupant was all over the shower and sink in the bathroom  The floor was also dusty  This made me call into question the cleanliness of everything else in the apartment  which left me and my partner uneasy    Also  the walls are thin and we could hear the banging of our neighbors door every time they walked in and out of the apartment    Overall  if the cleanliness issue is resolved  I would consider staying again because the location was great  Definitely suggest a deep clean of the apartment  The bathroom was not clean and still hard hair of the previous occupant all over the shower and sink  The floor was also dusty  During these times  cleanliness is very important and expected 
744107375,Beautiful views and GREAT location  near John Hancock and Water Tower    However  cleanliness is an issue  An easy resolution to this would have been responding to me after you knew no one came to clean as you said they would   The apartment was beautiful and we would have loved to book it again  but obviously we will not return to this property  The view was amazing and so was the location   My daughter and I were able to walk pretty much anywhere we wanted to go as the apartment is about three blocks from the John Hancock Building  The sheets on the sofa bed were stained in multiple places and there was a used pillow on the floor under the sofa   I sent multiple messages regarding this and the rug in the living room needing to be vacuumed   Zencity replied saying they would send someone out that day   IF someone showed up   the sheets were not changed and the rug was not vacuumed   That evening when I emailed back I received no response   I emailed two more times and still received no response  Communication was great until I put in a second request to have the apartment clean properly   After that  I received no additional responses   It is really disappointing because the view and location would have brought us back repeatedly 
744080451,A few things to note if youre renting this stay   Hosts are very responsive and helpful  Check in was very easy  The walls are very thin  You can hear the people above you pretty clearly and when the toilet flushes or shower runs in unit above its pretty loud  Location is awesome  close to Chicago Ave and shops restaurants  Recommend bringing your own pillows as the ones provided are pretty thin  Hi  I know i texted this  but the bathroom cleanliness was a bit disappointing since the last two reviews mentioned the bathroom was not thoroughly clean  Also  the fridge smells odd and inside of the oven needs to be clean   Pillows were also pretty thin uncomfortable  Would recommend replacing the couch as it smelled of smoke and there was a moderate hole in it  not in photos   Lastly the listing stays there was digital keyless entry I believe  but thats not the case  All in all  had a good visit but think a few minor updates could have made it great 
407944592506244733,Just as advertised   Beautiful room  clean and stylish   Close to everything we could possibly need  a lovely staycation in the CWE Forest Park area  We had a fabulous stay  just as advertised   Just a heads up  the outlet in the bathroom didn t work while we were there  possibly a fuse breaker issue   We just used the outlet in the hall  so no big deal  
743859306,Zencity s gorgeous space looks exactly like the photos  Lock box self check in was quick and easy  We did enjoy using the chalk board wall as well     Things that are not so good  there is no spices and basic cooking essentials  Some of the windows do not prop up  and has to use books to keep them lifted  Host was very sparing with towels  and advise to pack your own 
743857141,Enjoyed my stay  Nice views  friendly front desk staff 
394825415741408924,Clean apartment and convenient location  Maybe include a blender and toaster for the apartment 
395552138858240915,Beautiful loft style apartment in a great city  Walking distance to bars and restaurants  Thank you for letting us stay at your great place in St  Louis  And thank you for your responsiveness with the door issue 
394198768634024671,The location was great  Could walk or scooter all over downtown  BUT  we couldnt get into the apartment twice   Really bad lock issues  Also  because they couldnt get a code to work we had one Bluetooth opener and   separate people staying so had to coordinate when we could all get in   We spent over     hours being locked out   So  if theres other places in the area I would probably go there instead of this  but it works if youre not picky and just want a great location   It wasnt super clean either  Not being able to get in twice and have to wait for over       hours was awful   Getting in touch with someone was hard too   It was a little dirty in the bathrooms but the location was perfect  
407226404722915627,the places is perfect  everything was better than we expected thanks everything was better than we expected
465172532537781042,Great  clean place to stay in an awesome location  Highly recommend   The stay was great  clean and the perfect location  The only issue we had was the key fab  it didn t work for the door to the condo   it worked for every other door  We used the code to enter each time  which worked well but was a little inconvenient   Thanks for a great place to stay 
391279729440209049,This is a clean  wonderfully located apartment   It was quiet and comfortable   We d stay here again anytime   The price seemed a value for what we got and that s made us very happy     I  have nothing negative to say     As advice to those staying  you will want to note the parking  The apartment has no dedicated lot   That means you have to be comfortable parking on the street   There were spaces the entire time  but it did sometimes require a short walk   We once lived in the same neighborhood which made us more than comfortable     Also  entry is by code through three doors each with its own code   If you have trouble hanging on to things like door codes  entry could get tough     But once inside  you ll have great space and a quiet stay   Thanks to Zen City   Perfect for our needs  Thank you  
395615855783336042,simple  nice place close to wicker park  enjoyed our stay  the kitchen area smelled unpleasant from the garbage disposal and trash can  otherwise great stay  thank you 
395597678232404998,smaller than picture but overall is clean and okay for the price  Also right above the train station  Refused to help me with any problems 
743814750,Great location  easy access to all that Hyde Park has to offer  Thank you for the special accommodations and easygoing responses to my requests  It was a lovely stay and I will return
498585737140157679,great stay Thank you for the stay  Probably the apt need a little more clean as we found hairs in the carpet and also the shower curtain is a little dirty
743649550,Wonderful space  amazing location  balcony a HUGE plus  Thanks for being so accommodating with check out and fixing the sink  We GREATLY appreciate it  Couch was dirty
431072930355560536,I loved my stay  It was clean  great area and the host was all around excellent  Definitely booking again   I absolutely loved it 
392214637291954530,The unit was absolutely filthy  When we checked in there was hair in the shower  a filthy stove  shockingly dirty glasses  dish ware and cutlery  dusty vents  and a pungent smell of cat litter  There is also a neighbor who smokes on the deck and you can smell the cigarette smoke in the kitchen  The entrance foyer is filthy as well    We reported the issues to Zencity but they were not very helpful in resolving these issues  When we decided to cancel the reservation and request a refund  Zencity was not helpful at all and we have taken the matter up with Airbnb    Avoid this place and the management company    Do not book with Zencity  They will take your money and not refund you  The unit was absolutely filthy  The stove had grease marks  the was hair in the shower and on the sink  the neighbors smoke and the smell infiltrates into the unit  the carpets were stained  the walls were stained  the building entrance was filthy  I wouldnt recommend the unit or Zencity to any one 
431152092928240313,Great location  Good apt and building 
434689206478044304,This place is as fabulous as it looks in the pics   Walking distance of all kinds of places in Soulard  The apartment was as expected and so were the grounds excellent   Loved the pool area   The place was pretty clean but not spotless and there was an issue with the rug being dirty and a corner turned up we kept tripping on   We moved the furniture and rotated the rug and it was better   Someone tried to tape it down and that made it worse   Funny to me how easy our fix was    The fees were almost as much as the room and that was not so great   So value was not excellent  fees made me lower the stars   More should be shared up front on that  Overall great stay and look forward to Airbnb again 
395652376952522089,This is a really nice place to stay  Finding the key was a little rough but communication w them was great and helped us through it 
743626673,Was exactly as expected  Quick responses  Nice looking Airbnb  Thank you for the nice stay
394191218910189439,The location was great  We had wifi issues and found what we think could be a bed bug on the mattress  The issue with the wifi password was huge  My guest and I needed wifi to work and I constantly told you all that the password was wrong and no one listened  We also found a bed bug when checking the mattress 
743598134,A very clean and stylish place in a great and convenient location of wicker park  Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful  Many places to eat are within the walking distance    The master bathroom is amazing   However the WiFi was extremely slow and they only had streaming Tv options so watching anything or trying to do any work was very difficult  I also found the memory foam mattresses very uncomfortable and hot  I realize this is personal preference    Overall I would stay here again  Some basic supplies to make coffee and tea would have been nice  I ve never been to an Airbnb that hasn t had those    The lighting in the master bedroom is terrible  The light on the ceiling fan is highly inadequate    The curtains are a mess  Coming unhooked  In the living room it doesn t have a proper   bar setup so you can t even close them fully  In the master bedroom there isn t enough panels to cover the full windows    Also photos in the listing showed a couch but when I checked in there is a dining table there   The WiFi speed was terrible  Watching any kind of streaming was not a great experience    For me the mattresses were terribly uncomfortable and were really hot  I realize this is a personal preference  It was often many hours to get a reply  Beds were uncomfortable  WiFi was very slow and no basics to make coffee 
743585965,Great   BR loft located on a quiet street in Chicago   Very clean and had everything we needed   Beds were very comfortable   Couch was a little small but we didnt spend much time there so it didnt matter much   Thanks Zencity for everything  Thank you all for the great hospitality   we enjoyed our time in chicago 
410051143619896528,What a beautifully appointed apartment  Great location  and despite being right next to the train  really soundproof  There was really subtle shaking when the pain would pass but nothing that noticeable  Thank you 
420246859480497167,This was a good location and place for us   Kitchenette was functioning and worth it   If you need a hotel room but want a little more room and kitchen  this is perfect   The building staff was great  Those rugs were disgusting   The washing machine sounds broken   very loud when using it   Everything else was good 
420288513444454951,Very nice place  Loved my stay  Very good communication and very helpful  Thank you  Thank you so much 
412981446310841748,Great location  Tastefully decorated but a little worn  for example the carpet has a lot of stains  Decent value for being in a very walkable area near the action in wicker park  apartment could be cleaner especially carpet and drapes
399997609643660638,Great location in a central part of town  Easy check in and nice and clean 
395608819972342234,Great location and easy check in  checkout 
743180613,I would give this place a        but since the reviews can only be left in full numbers  I am giving what is a VERY GENEROUS     stars  If this listing was more properly advertised  I would not have as many problems  but it is not  Under the amenities of this listing  it lists there is free street parking available which is not the case  Once I had already made our booking  I received a message from the staff informing me how to purchase street parking which was limited to   hour sessions  I had not been planning to use my car during the stay once we arrived  so being limited to   hour sessions was incredibly inconvenient  Fortunately  I was able to get a paid space in a lot that was a    minute walk away  however  if I had known this was going to be an issue in the first place  I would have chosen to stay elsewhere  Additionally  upon arrival at the apartment  we were quite off put by the state of cleanliness  The floors were notably dirty    I was sure to always wear socks during the stay  The walls in the bedroom area were also quite dusty  Also  the staff was not aware of the correct name of their wifi network  so there was no internet until day   when I finally figured out the network MYSELF through the process of elimination and plugging the given password into random networks  I will say this is not the worst experience I have had with Airbnb  however  I was overall incredibly dissatisfied with this stay especially when comparing it to the expectations I had based on the original listing and the listings reviews  The cleanliness of the apartment is pretty concerning  There is noticeable dust on the walls and the floor is clearly not swept well   Also  you need to update the listing itself because it says the street parking on the premises is free which it is not  The wifi name you have on file for providing to guests is incorrect as well  The staff kept providing the network name as everywhere wireless  but the actual name was EWfiber com  ghz The photos made the cleanliness of the apartment quite misleading  Responsive  but did not know correct answers to questions at times  Would have been a good value if experience had been what was expected 
743111338,Very clean  great amenities  and good location  It was a pleasure staying here  Wonderful place to stay at and great location  Accommodation was very clean   Ill make sure to book my next stay with Zencity   
742643829,Thank for for providing an amazing location  well decorated and clean apartment   Everything worked   We were impressed  Great location to enjoy Hyde Park with walking access to everything we needed   The apartment staff were all very pleasant and helpful  Very well done  Thank for for providing an amazing location  well decorated and relatively clean apartment   My wife was pleasantly surprised and informed me when in Chicago this will be our regular boarding location    Well done  The left side of the counter was dirty on visible after I wiped it down as part of my own personal COVID clean   The right side was spotless 
742190684,The airbnb was very stylish and in a nice convenient location
742190516,Lovely apartment  nice kitchen accommodations and the bed was super comfy  Also remarkably quiet for how central it is  Definitely a nice play to stay for a short or extended visit  Thanks for a lovely stay 
742152727,Good for a single person or a couples stay  My fianc  and I stayed for two nights and enjoyed it  Thanks again for the stay  Will definitely come back for a stay   
434750213198412092,So I really thought this was going to be a great stay  and if Zencity has responded to me I think it would have been  Starting with check in  they should tell you to park out front with your hazards on while you get the key and ask for a cart to load your things  I never figured out how to use the parking pass  so every time I went in the garage I used the call button and told them I didn t understand  and the garage let me out  Check out is also confusing  so I would again park out front with your hazards    Next  the smell  I failed to read other reviews and only looked at the star rating when I booked  but this place smells like rotten egg  I m not sure if it s a gas leak or just smells like that  but looking at other reviews  it s a persistent problem  That alone really didn t bother me  after a few minutes you get used to it  and the place is so nice  It looks super clean  has a cute view  nice people in the halls  and the location is just amazing    But  then I went to bed  And as soon as I laid down  it smelled like pee  So of course I finally message Zencity  They said they would send some one in to check if I allowed  I agreed if they let me know when because I have my dog with me  and they didn t reply for over    hours  I told them that was ridiculous  so they never responded and never came to look at it  I stayed here for   nights in a pee bed and never heard back from them OR AIRBNB    If they had come and made things right I really wouldn t care or be writing this review  because mistakes happen  But the lack of care on there part and on Airbnb s blows my mind  So yeah  I would highly advise not staying with Zencity  It s confusing  gross  and they won t respond to your problems 
413007107085301791,Very  clean  convenient  downtown location  Check in a bit confusing with the two doors  But thanks for the quick turn around     Howard
394936820800471662,Great location  close to the Power and Light district  Residents were very respectful and nice  Would recommend  Check in code did not work to enter building through the intercom  We had to wait for a resident to come down to let us in 
498533999292446695,Great place in great location Thanks for everything 
412958690927915696,This was a good great find on such a short notice  Everything would have been   stars except for a few things  Bring paper towels  buy an extra roll   cooking spices  condiments etc  because they are not provided  The lighting is also very low  There was a slight smell to the building as a whole but not to this particular apartment  There were a few strands of hair on items in the living room  Also the communication was good  it just took a little time for them to respond  Other than these few things  this stay was an            This did not effect the review for me personally but be aware that this is street parking  parallel parking   Thank you for providing this stay  I only have a few suggestions Please advise visitors to bring cooking essentials and extra paper towels  toilet paper   Please advise visitors to bring extra towels wash cloths   Please advise visitors that the lighting is a little low  I may have missed this in the description   Also there were a few blonde hair strands found on furniture Overall  my stay was an       
392705783628359889,It was a cute little place  The only problem was it was very loud in the middle of the night  From plumbing and other guests coming in and out of the complex  I would recommend using a sound machine if you are staying here 
410154686534955315,This host is VERY unprofessional    This place was very dirty  no clean service what so ever  I sent in pictures  spoke with   different people  they emailed and said they started a refund but ever contacted me or Airbnb  it has been weeks   I have yet to receive a refund  I called Airbnb and they told me that this host didn t even create a case to be refund  I have NEVER left a review on anything before that s how horrible my experience has been  Cleaning service horrible
449939310201031082,n a Check in and using the system to get into the building was challenging  would recommend tweaking if possible  The apartment was also not a nice clean as the pictures made it look   they could have been a bit outdated but the apartment was pretty worn 
742118402,If it is not spring   warm out yet  the umbrella won t be up on the patio so you won t have any cover if it s raining  The neighbors called in a noise complaint at     pm even though quiet hours are listed as   pm and we were simply talking at normal level and playing uno  Otherwise  the place was very nice and had a great location and the stay was good overall  We were disappointed upon arrival to see that the back porch  which in the pictures is represented as having a large covered umbrella area  is actually completely uncovered as the umbrella wasn t there  It rained one night  so we couldn t enjoy the patio at all  and that was what we were most looking forward to  Additionally  the air b b listing lists   pm as the quiet hours time  but we received an automated noise complaint at only     pm  while we were sitting around chatting and quietly playing uno  Must be some grumpy neighbors  don t expect to even be able to play music here past  pm  apparently  Otherwise  space was really nice and mostly clean and we enjoyed our stay  Thanks 
393425651274949902,Wonderful place to stay I love this place
394117328500547245,We were very disappointed  The apartment was not clean well  stained bedding  nasty shower curtain   I was not comfortable  but Lysol and Clorox wipes helped    Positives  good rate and walkable location  We did not receive a  welcome packet   only a key  The apartment was not clean  The shower curtain and shower walls had mold mildew and stains  The bedspread had stains  I wish I had not stripped the bed before we left   The couch had stains  There was gunk on surfaces and remote  We went out to buy clean products  Items were in disrepair  the shower handle came off in my hand  the iron was busted  discovered after it leaked all over   the bathroom exhaust fan was caked with dust   The wifi did not work for our devices  We did email and received a prompt response with alternatives    Positives  it was a place to stay at a lower rate for a last minute trip  the door staff were friendly  the apartment was in a walkable location 
439078485842327033,Awesome value  
413007408100319277,Great stay 
413004242274297283,I will say before getting into things that the apartment itself was not bad  It had decent space  a nice kitchen area  and a good sized closet  The neighborhood as well is a decent area all things considered  Thats basically where the positives stop  Getting into the apartment was frustrating and stressful  I received an email with basic instructions on how to get into the building  but took me several minutes to even find the apartment as the instructions on how to get there are clear as mud  Once I get there  there is an electronic keypad to get into the apartment  The code I was sent didnt work  I had to call up support who gave me a code to let me once  and then emailed me a code to use going forward  Once in I grab the FOB and placard to park in the lot  keep in mind you have to park on the street during this time  which you arent supposed to do   I get into the parking lot  and notice there are numbers on the spaces in the lot  and a number on the placard  but not a matching space number to the placard number  I call up support again  who after going back and forth told me that all they could do was suggest I call the parking lot attendant  there isnt one and it was nearly midnight   Eventually I just parked in a spot and walked around looking at other peoples placards to verify whether there was assigned parking or not  Once I parked I got back to get into the room  new code doesnt work  Call up again to get a new code  and the rep just gives me another new code  Next day  same issue  Im told eventually I need to download an app  which I really didnt want to do  but was basically told it would be the only way to ensure Id be able to consistently get access to the apartment  As far as the apartment itself  it was far from perfect  You can tell that the apartment has seen better days  There are several spots where the wall has been damaged and paint worn off  Multiple towels have stains in them  and when the AC kicks on you can smell cigarette smoke  Overall I dont think Ill ever get an airbnb from this company again  I will say before getting into things that the apartment itself was not bad  It had decent space  a nice kitchen area  and a good sized closet  The neighborhood as well is a decent area all things considered  Thats basically where the positives stop  Getting into the apartment was frustrating and stressful  I received an email with basic instructions on how to get into the building  but took me several minutes to even find the apartment as the instructions on how to get there are clear as mud  Once I get there  there is an electronic keypad to get into the apartment  The code I was sent didnt work  I had to call up support who gave me a code to let me once  and then emailed me a code to use going forward  Once in I grab the FOB and placard to park in the lot  keep in mind you have to park on the street during this time  which you arent supposed to do   I get into the parking lot  and notice there are numbers on the spaces in the lot  and a number on the placard  but not a matching space number to the placard number  I call up support again  who after going back and forth told me that all they could do was suggest I call the parking lot attendant  there isnt one and it was nearly midnight   Eventually I just parked in a spot and walked around looking at other peoples placards to verify whether there was assigned parking or not  Once I parked I got back to get into the room  new code doesnt work  Call up again to get a new code  and the rep just gives me another new code  Next day  same issue  Im told eventually I need to download an app  which I really didnt want to do  but was basically told it would be the only way to ensure Id be able to consistently get access to the apartment  As far as the apartment itself  it was far from perfect  You can tell that the apartment has seen better days  There are several spots where the wall has been damaged and paint worn off  Multiple towels have stains in them  and when the AC kicks on you can smell cigarette smoke  Overall I dont think Ill ever get an airbnb from this company again 
413003939423823649,Great location and plenty of space for a nice long stay  Walking distance to most attractions and restaurants downtown 
494924543399064041,Pros   good location  park nearby is really great  property overall as described in the pictures Cons  check in was a nightmare  we had to wait      hours until some person would come and let us in to the building  no available free parking nearby  not possible to turn off heating of the apartments  so if its warm outside   inside might be really hot
741968565,Nice location Carpet was full of hair  Stove was dirty and the kitchen floor was nasty  You can tell the carpet had not been  vacuumed  Kitchen stove and floor was not clean
435496284780663152,Clean  no issues  Very nice vibe located by everything will be booking again when I come back  Clean  no issues  Very nice vibe located by everything will be booking again when I come back 
392667104967601398,Clean and spacious  Great location  We enjoyed the amenities  Had a great time  Would have been stellar if a toaster and blender had been available for us  It was tough with young kids because none of the cups or plates were plastic and the sinks were too high for them to reach 
741966639,Spacious place  good location  Thanks for the easy instructions to get into the place 
741776720,Awesome view  Plenty of things to do within walking distance  Clean and comfortable 
741755073,Pros   The location is the best attribute in my opinion  The neighborhood is quiet and seems safe  There are a lot of restaurants  bars  stores  etc  within walking distance  The townhouse itself is nice  as depicted in photos   Plenty of towels and spare sheets  etc  Washer and dryer are a nice amenity to have  The patio and grill are a nice feature  charcoal grill  you will need to buy your own charcoal to use   Check in and check out is super easy  Parking situation was easy to figure out and I had no issues  or tickets     Cons  Communication feels template and or computer generated sometimes  I asked a question that didnt get answered  I personally had no issues but if you suddenly have a specific question for the host during your stay  you may not get an answer  The comforter in the master bedroom smelled like body odor in some spots  I wonder if the bed sheets were ever washed  The other guests did not complain about their sheets  however  The WiFi connection was spotty    Overall  The location is great and I enjoyed my stay  Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance  I was generally comfortable  Generally  the temperature defaults to warm   If youre a stickler for cleanliness then this may not meet your standards  The pictures are mostly accurate except for the patio roof deck  The patio furniture and the patio itself are worn dirty from natural weather  The wood is a little warped  It seems neglected  The WiFi was real slow and sometimes not working  Bed sheet in master bedroom didnt seem washed  Everything else is as advertised  The comforter in the master bedroom smelled like someone slept on it before  body odor  and it hadnt been washed since  The other sheets are suspect  in regards to being washed   None of the other guests complained about their sheets though  Communication is clear but they seem like template and or computer generated responses  I asked about what we need to do before check out  like what to do with the towels  sheets  etc   but I didnt get a response  Instead  I got a template response    min before checkout  It was basically a reminder to checkout by   am and dont leave anything behind  Its not a big deal   but if you have a specific question  it may not get answered  Overall it was a good stay  My rating is based on the relationship between the price and the feedback I provided above  cleanliness  location  communication  etc   
741749256,Very nice location and view of the lake  Watching the sunrise from my bed was definitely a highlight of my stay  Thank you for allowing me to stay in your space  The building  staff  location  view  and bed were amazing  And it was awesome to have Hulu without commercials  I believe cleanliness could be an area of improvement  especially in the kitchen and living room  It would also be helpful to have a more complete kitchen set  The lack of stovetop pans and oven mitts made it hard for me to cook  Also  air fresheners would help increase the appeal of the place upon entry  But overall  it was a nice stay  It went to be renewed and get away from life  and thats what I got from your space so thank you  The kitchen countertops and handles were sticky and not clean which lead me to reclean all the surfaces over myself  The pillows on the couch should be replaced or clean  The couch had a lot of  hair  on it  which I later realized was from the rug  However  the cleaners should do their best to try to remove all the hair from the couch because upon entry I didnt recognize it was from the rug which made me not feel comfortable sitting on the couch  Also there is a smell in the apartment  Air fresheners could possibly be helpful  Also  the throw blanket on the bed is turning brown  For the final price that I paid including the clean service charge  I wish the place would have been a lot cleaner  It would have made my stay a lot more comfortable  But I loved the location  the building  the view  and the bed was very comfortable  Also the host responded very fast 
412994268822507325,Had a great experience  Will definitely book here again in the future 
439766693183481269,Nice place   I wish I got partial refund for having me check in late
741577684,Great location  Big open space  Perfect  Peeling paint needs updated 
394833385624110088,Very cute with great views and in a good location  would return Thanks so much  we had a lovely stay 
394864674306375907,Was a great place to stay for a weekend  Close to a lot of different things to do or eat at  Staff is super friendly and very responsive too  Is a block from the hospital  so ambulances are heard often  Would stay here again tho  Thank you  You were very responsive to me and I appreciate that  The area rug does need a good clean  and the comforter too  Otherwise we were very satisfied with our stay  The front desk staff was also very nice and helpful 
741552684,Great place to stay  would recommend to anyone  It might make sense to replace the dining room table with a couch  There s already enough seating with the barstools  but nowhere to watch TV from besides the bed 
741508769,This might be the nicest air bnb I ve ever stayed in  Everything was very clean  the apartment is spacious  the beds are comfortable  and it s all located in the perfect spot by the blue line which has access to both downtown and the airport  Next time I come to Chicago I m definitely going to see if this place is available first  Thank you so much for hosting us  We really enjoyed our stay 
741502612,Beautiful view and stylish place  Parking was a little tricky  but that was mentioned before so we expected it  The place was tidy  the extra towels were awesome  Will definitely be staying again 
395595053921992307,Honestly the place is not as nice as it looks in the pictures  The location is great  and its spacious  but thats about all it has going for it  The rugs were filthy  and several parts of the wall molding were broken  The kitchen had a funny smell  we ended up buying an apartment spray because it smelled strange every time we came back  and when we opened windows the windowsills were covered in dust  soot  If it wasnt as pricey Id say its a good deal  but for whats basically the same price as a hotel room  youre better off with the hotel  Itll be much cleaner  The rug in the living room needs to be thrown out  It was filthy  The bedroom rug was also dirty  Several walls were dirty as well  The kitchen smelled strange  not sure if it was the washer dryer  or a sink issue  The back door also had a broken hinge  and there were several broken pieces in the apartment  The window sills were also very dirty  The code to the building was also wrong so we had to wait several days before getting the correct code  we had to enter through a different building and use the garage entrance  
435524706373332636,Great place at a great location in Pilsen  Could had been cleaner but nothing that ruined our stay  Wished it would it had coffee  
410813559670423429,Great location  The living room space is bigger than the pictures show it could use another love seat for additional seating  We had   adults in our group and o lay a couch  The street parking can be a bit of a challenge but we always ended up finding a spot  Also  don t plan to do any cooking with the supplies provided  Need to add some cookies sheets a d a real coffee pot  Overall great place  just would bring a few different things for next time  Curtains in the back bedroom to cover the street lamp
394934424250866490,I would not recommend renting this property  It was not clean  The tub and sink in the bathroom were slow draining   There was no coffee pot and very sparse kitchen utensils  It was a very nice large space but very poorly maintained  There was a large living room and dining room but no dining room furniture  Our check in process was very disconcerting  There was no key in the primary box and no key in the back up box  The key finally found was in the clean service box  This whole process took     hours  The check in process was very difficult  You have that info in your records  The unit was not clean  The bathroom sink and tub were slow draining  There was no coffee pot in the kitchen and there were very sparse other kitchen utensils  no hot pads and more  The dining room had a very small cafe table and   very small chairs  There was no dining room furniture  The most worrisome thing however was the condition of the door lock  It was a dead bolt but the space the dead bolt went into was larger than the bolt  The bolt did lock deeper into the door but the door was very loose and we believe it could have been kicked in easily 
439779430423011040,Out stay was well  The loft is as shown in the picture  Just letting you know that your shower head is leaking and the water shooting out is hitting the vanity lights 
409403221118368537,This place was great for me and my girlfriend  The location is great and the building amenities are too  I will say though that if you love to cook  then be prepared to bring a few more utensils  tools  since the kitchen is a little empty  Overall we were very pleased with our stay and would definitely recommend and book again  Thank you  We enjoyed our stay  Was very comfortable and homey  My only suggestion would be  to the amenities up a notch by supplying few more cooking utensils  knives  measuring cups  etc   Everything about our stay was wonderful 
409319873601659158,This place is stunning  It s spacious  clean  modern  and cozy  The amenities in the building are top notch  Also can t beat the location  walking distance from the Plaza  We had a great time   would definitely return  We had trouble using the call box for check in  It didn t work  Luckily someone let us in   but it would be helpful to have a plan B in case the box didn t work 
439776899214029522,Perfect place to stay will come again
436241897635399937,Nice roomy apartment in a great neighborhood  Parking can be a little tough sometimes but we always managed to find a spot  You are within walking distance to some good restaurants  Pi pizzeria and Jenis ice cream  as well as a Whole Foods  Thank you  We had a nice stay  Parking was a little rough but we managed to find a spot  The apartment building smelled like weed on the first floor and entry way but not in our individual apartment  There are a few things in the apartment that should be addressed  The ceiling fan in one of the back bedrooms has a screw loose and it rattles pretty loudy when turned on  In the smaller bathroom   without the washer and dryer  the sink is clogged and drains really slowly  Two screws also popped out of the chairs in the tv room  The apartment was nice and big and suited our needs  The beds were comfortable and overall the apartment was clean  Thank you
406536579927609372,Location is great  Restaurant in walking distance  Lake no far  Bike rentals available  Transporttion commute easily to downtown  Museum of Science Industry very close Include what s stated in the ad 
424632764463175868,Very nice  quiet apartment  fantastic location that is walking distance to several wonderful restaurants  We had a wonderful weekend in St Louis  We loved our time in St Louis and the apartment was perfect for us   the location  in particular  was wonderful  Our only frustration was the AC  which was not on when we arrived  and required a pin that wasnt available to us  We spent the first night and day with the thermostat at    degrees  which was very warm given the outside temps  We sent a message immediately upon check in but did not get a response  A gentleman came to our door Saturday afternoon to verify that we had checked in and ultimately he was able to reach someone to assist with getting the air turned on 
394927004073526566,Cozy little apartment in a nice location 
741312577,This place was filthy   Whoever clean it prior to our arrive did an awful job  Had to demand a refund from Airbnb  because the owners stopped answering my calls after I requested a refund  which lead to several other issues   There is only one tv in the entire apartment  The bedrooms were small and crammed   Parking was horrible   Not the best location  Dogs were barking non stop 
741246610,This apartment is in a great location for the University of Chicago  in a very beautiful building  Great restaurant next door  looked over a park and the Museum of Science and Industry  Th apartment was well furnished  lots of space  kitchen was very nice as was the bathroom  The bed is very comfortable 
395667004517403836,The apartment is in a nice location near Barnes Jewish Hospital  the Central West End  a walkable neighbor with lots of coffee shops and restaurants  and the great Forest Park  one if not the largest city park in the US  The building is the Moncler  one of the first high rise of the CWE that has been partially renovated  The apartment is spacious and well kept  The bathroom needs some updating  The main issue was that this apartment came up on the website when I requested   adult guests  While it was clear that there was only   bedroom  it was not clear from the website that the sofa was not a sofabed  The sofa in the living romm was not in any way a substitute for a third bed  Moreover  there were no sheets  pillow  nor comforter even for the sofa  When I called to ask how come there was no third bed  requesting either a change or a roller bed  the answer was that I had not read the website accurately  I guess that would imply that when I asked for an apartment for   adult guests one is going to sleep on the floor  Initially  they seemed to be favorable either to a change of apartment or to a roller bed  then they said that management had approved only to deliver a comforter and sheets for the sofa  My point is that this apartment is not in ANY way appropriate for   adult guests  Overall I would recommend not showing this apartment for   guests  only for   
741197898,Great place and location  Would definitely stay here again 
741127641,Great place to stay  The space was fantastic 
741038582,It was great  Awesome location  Thank you again for all of your help  It couldn t have been anymore perfect 
397045690415138179,The only real issue here is the lack of free parking but if youre willing to pay a few bucks a day or not needing to park most of the day  its a decent walkable area to be in  Unit itself was fine as a place to sleep  Better off just getting a hotel probably The lack of free parking should have been highlighted more up front in my opinion and the front door code for the building didnt always work   The space was fine generally  Mostly just issues with parking and getting in a few times along with a  broken dryer
394916770875347326,Great location  Space was clean and comfortable  We enjoyed the location and the space 
393415661681088897,Great apartment in a great neighborhood  The apartment was comfortable and well appointed  we appreciated use of the fitness center and roof top deck  Teeler was an amazing help and we loved exploring the neighborhood for shopping and dining  Thanks for the great accommodations  Would have LOVED to have had some coffee  
740655929,Great place  Clean and comfy
740643818,This apartment is much more spacious than it appears in the photos  The two full baths have extra long tubs that are great for soaking  Id mentioned finding the trash and items in the living room and under the bed 
740570977,Great location  Clean  Perfect for the weekend 
394937427473892736,Me and   other guests just completed our stay here and felt very mixed in our review    Pros  The location is awesome and the apartment complex is quite secure  If you don t have a key fob you can t access anything within the complex  We felt safe within the apartment  It also had a parking spot which was very helpful  It was within walking distance of the power and light district as well as many cafes and restaurants  The beds were quite comfy    Cons  Unfortunately we had a lot of issues with Zen city  We quickly realized they are a large company that are in it for the money and not to help guests  When we arrived the access code for the key didn t work  After calling they were able to quickly help us get a spare  Once we were inside we found that there were only   towels for   guests for   nights  This was obviously an issue  I reached out asking if they d bring towels and while they responded quickly and assured us they would be bringing towels ASAP and it was a priority we never got towels despite asking and hearing the same response each day  This was very upsetting as we felt they were just dragging us along when we would have been understanding if they had just said they were unable to provide more towels  We had guests using hand towels and paper towels to dry off and zen city never made an attempt to help fix this  We felt that the service  the apartment  and the cleanliness were not worth the high price that we paid to stay here  It did not seem very clean  the bedding had stains on it  there were dust bunnies everywhere  and the apartment was not very homey and incredibly empty except bare basics  We tried to be very understanding guests  When we arrived the code we received to access our key didn t work  it said there was no key with that code  Upon calling we were able to get the spare key  no big deal  However  when we entered the unit we only had   towels for   guests for   nights  I contacted zen city Friday at   to ask for more towels and we were told they would be delivered to us ASAP  However  they were not  I contacted again on Saturday and on Sunday and each time we were told that the towels would be delivered to us ASAP and it would be a priority and it was not  We had to use hand towels and paper towels to dry off because only two guests had towels  It would have been one thing if we were just told that you could not provide more towels but you kept jerking us around saying you were bringing towels  It became very very frustrating especially for the ridiculous price that we were paying for the unit  The unit also did not appear as though it had been vacuumed and appeared as thought it was minimally clean  The bedding also had stains on it  Overall we are very displeased with the service of Zencity  While communication was quick  it was all empty words and nothing was ever done or completed 
435410734908603491,The place was great  A nice place to relax and freshen up while you visit the city and or surrounding area  The apartment was clean and cozy  Checking in was incredibly easy and fast  Thank you  Just a heads up that the washer or dryer does give off an off smell when being used  Idk what the source was  Just that it persisted when they were in use  Besides that everything was incredible and clean 
409436508649123182,Great apartment in a great location  We walked all around Hyde Park and had a relaxing little place to come back to when we needed some down time  Will definitely book again  Hello  Thanks for a great stay  It was a super cute apartment in a great location  The only thing item we wished was different was the tv remote  We found the remote to control the tv apps  but there didn t seem to be a way to control the TV volume so we ended up having to stand at the tv and use the button at the bottom to adjust ehe volume    Other than that we really enjoyed our stay and hope to book again in the future  Thanks 
740069052,We really enjoyed our stay  A very spacious place  clean  comfortable bed  and a record player  It was a quiet building in a great location  We had tickets to the museum and it was right across the street  Short walk to the lake as well  I would definitely stay there again  The wifi was very weak daring our stay  Not sure if thats something you have had mentioned already  i had to work and if it wasnt for my boyfriends hotspot I dont think I would have been able to work   A small TV in the bedroom wouldve been nice as well  after a long day and drive we just wanted tolay down and watch something 
740068818,Solid place to stay  Has everything you need and the location was perfect  Right near the highway  Street parking was not too bad unless its already late night  Whole foods was located right near this location and there is a gas station right outside the apartment  Amazing value 
393477292237451858,Great location for a great price     minute ubers to everywhere downtown St  Louis  Great Location  confusing apartment structure but overall a great place   Only thing to call out was the floors were pretty sticky  everything else was great 
413736143501139329,Fine place Thank you
396325874504395078,Nice easy check in good location
396355199746839480,Very nice apartment  We really enjoyed our stay  The only downside is parking  Other than that the place was beautiful and equipped with everything we needed 
396338559509505990,Not accommodating I know you are a big company and it would have been really appreciated had you helped us out with our incident and at least considered a partial refund 
410005905448481302,Arrived and the unit had not been clean after previous guests  It threw a massive wrench in our vacation plans as they would not respond for hours  We had to get a last minute hotel  cancel our reservation and seek a refund through Airbnb because they just left me hanging for over five hours saying they were  looking into it     Im sure the experience would have been smooth if the place was clean  And it probably is     of the time  But in a pinch  they are not on site and their support communication was absolutely horrible 
425264745742039598,Worse air bnb ever  Location was horrible  customer service was even worse  Could not talk to anyone for a while  room and gate key fob was lost  Will never come back again    Worse customer service ever  
536209708102472638,Nous avons pass  un agr able s jour dans cette appartement  nous  tions pr s de l h pital c est ce qu il nous fallait  L appartement tr s confortable  tr s bien chauff  avec une bonne literie Quelques  petits commerces   proximit   Sinon pour du shopping faut une voiture Merci Zencity  notre s jour chez vous c est tr s bien pass   l appartement tr s agr able nous avions le confort qu il fallait 
465191725736570960,Great location and building  The floors and bathroom could of been cleaner    Check in was a hassle but staff was very helpful    Apartment was near and beds were very comfortable     Will stay again The stay at Zencity started off rough due to communication issues with check in  After speaking to a representative who was very helpful I was able to check in  The place was smaller than I expected but very nice  The floors was not the cleanliness  Everything else was fine  The bathroom should be cleaner  Beds was super comfortable  WiFi was not working
439068524388946658,Very good for family  Very good for family 
410827481757861464,Decent overall stay  We got a good value during the week  Were rushed out at checkout  Was told    and someone knocked and walked in at  am and came back   more times before     We had an   am check out  We had someone WALK INTO our room at around  am and then come back knocking two more times before   am  When they came back again a  th time around    we just grabbed our stuff and left  We were overall pleased with the space  found hairs in the pillow  but cleanliness was okay  Checking out in such a sour manner just kind of ruined the experience for us  It was our first Airbnb experience and we didn t love it because we have never been rushed from a hotel  They know the checkout times and generally leave you alone until then 
425322271290865799,Enjoyed our stay  Very convenient to downtown with good parking  The place was simple and very clean  It had everything we needed and was very quiet  Maybe throw in a couple extra bath towels for guests who stay several nights 
431882935889991667,Lots of spiders    in the corners and spider webs   Definitely need to dust   The shower liner is so nasty    like brown at the bottom  When checking in   I walked in circles for about an hour looking for building      and there wasn t a building like that    it s actually        hour and a half before I was due to checkout   I was locked out for    mins bc you disconnected the door thing   Overall wouldn t recommend to anyone who doesn t like to walk far and or an unclean house 
443486753174144628,The place is in a good location   clean  but parking on the streets be careful with out of town plates they may try to break into your car  I had a bit of a hard time checking in  I went to the key fab had the wrong code it took    min to get a hold of someone because in at   pm  I had an extra day booked to work forgot to check out thought I had an extra day  but when they called saying I couldnt have that unit for an extra day I hurried back to get my stuff out I was out by      I apologized and they said the clean crew was   min behind me it was fine 
391957275191139805,The location and view are amazing  Located a   minute walk from the Hancock building and the Magnificent Mile  everything you could need is in walking distance  The view from the balcony on the   th floor was incredible  The stay was extremely comfortable and convenient  I would definitely recommend staying here  There we certain ammenties missing like soap ans shampoo  also the check in process wasnt as smooth as it couldve been because there was no fob in our room when we arrived  Other than those a details  the stay was amazing  The view and location were phenomenal  We would definitely love to stay there again 
431119668586420397,Great spot right off of I     Delicious coffee shop on the corner  Spacious and clean  Check in was confusing at the intercom to access the building  Thankfully  a tenant of the building let me in and on the elevator  The intercom step of accessing the lobby was not clear  Wondering if your check in directions included more guidance of the keypad  Pics maybe 
396281684845773843,Nice stay for a night  Felt safe for a solo female traveler
410078445332045085,Nice location
396373026297930325,Great stay I really enjoyed Thanks fir everything
413774736244229283,       decent spot  good eats around the area  nice people everywhere u meet  the tenants of the building seem to be a little unwelcoming but other than that good all in all
468767106532339202,I had few issue during my stay  The internet was not working  This was my second time staying at Zencity  The first time it was pleasant experience but this time I was not happy  The place has bad smell and the place look older and smaller that the pictures  Also the internet was not working and I wasntable to work 
439760282626857397,The apartment fit the description  location was great  decorated very nicely  Check in was all digital  However  it was incredibly dirty with sticky floors  hair  and generally dirty shower  We did not feel comfortable using the shower at all  Generally I am not picky about such cleanliness  but this was excusable  We could not get in contact with Zencity during our time  The apartment was incredibly dirty  There was calcium build up and hair in the shower and sticky floors  It was disgusting  We could not get in contact with you the entire time 
396370896810069511,Great for a quick stay 
502939086780913444,You will not leave disappointed     The space is huge  The beds are amazing    The lighting during the day that shines through the window  I could go on      Space was lively  and the bed was sooooo comfortable 
411519019287523803,This apartment condo is in a good location  However  they need to have a better relationship with the front desk  No one was there for check in for at least    minutes when me and   other couples arrived  We were eventually let up by a random tenant that asked if we wanted to use her key fob to go upstairs  The instructions are slightly incorrect on how to get into the room as well  While there for my short stay I saw one roach and one waterbug in the space  They need to do a pest control check in before new persons occupy the space in the future   Overall nice space  but need to update procedural check in standards and cleanliness checks  Please review cleanliness standards in the apartment for pest control reasons 
485526235041436828,This was my first AirBNB experience  I was really unsatisfied with the service  The code they gave me to get in the building did not work  The second one did  That issue was solved fairly quickly  The second day the sink in the kitchen backed up from the drain  I didnt even use the sink  Nasty water was spilling all over the floor  I called them and maintenance came the next day but did nothing to fix it while I was staying there  He said he did not have the correct tools and they would be sending someone else  I never saw them  The last night of my stay the keypad on my door to the room stopped working  This was the real mess of this trip  First  I had to walk to a convenience store to buy a  V battery to try and get it to work in case the batteries were low  This was after midnight  so it was tough to find one open  My phone was running low because I had no access to my charger in the room  The guy on the phone had me download an app to try and work the keypad over Blue Tooth  This did not work either   He told me to go down to the front desk and ask for a key  but there is no front desk  After an hour and a half of trying to get in  I asked it there was anyone he could call that had a key to the second door in the unit that just had a key lock  I guess there wasnt because no one ever came  He said he would try and contact someone but never did  Four hours later he called to see if I had gotten in  I felt like he just left me with no room  bathroom  or my belongings  I would not stay at another ZenCity location  Here are a few suggestions  On check in  make sure you send the correct Front Door code  This one did not take too long to fix  so that was good  Two  make sure maintenance is kept up on in the apartment  The kitchen sink backed up through the drain twice while I was there  Maintenance came but did nothing about it during my stay  Nasty water was pouring all over the floor with no way to stop it  Maybe if you provided an emergency maintenance number or something  Third  make sure the door key pad works to the room  I saw a couple of reviews that said they had an issue and the person I called for my issue also mentioned that it had happened  If it is already a known issue  why hasnt this been fixed  I got back from a concert and the door would not open  The person I called did try to help me at first  We tried downloading an app for Blutooth access and I had to walk a mile to a store to buy a battery to try to make the pad work  Both did not work  The person I called eventually stopped taking my calls for hours and left me waiting in the lobby without my things  a room to stay in  or a bathroom  He was supposed to be trying to contact someone who could come with a key but he did not  My phone was running out of battery because my charger was in the apartment  If that had happed  I dont know what I would have done   I was eventually able to get the door open after physically moving the pad on the door   Four hours later he called me back and asked if I had gotten in  I said I finally did but no one ever came to help  I had to be at the train station early to come back home and if I had waited on him I would not have made it  I did not get to use my last night in the room because of this mess 
411579499437125152,Great quite area with parking included  Not big truck or trailer friendly  The entry when we asked that there not be entry was a big deal with us  We even called to say we did not want entry tell we had returned  The parking pass was not a big deal since we had already stayed a day and half with out it  If it is required it should be in the room upon check in 
435432074683781569,The best neighborhood in Chicago to stay  So easy to walk up and down the neighborhood streets to find delicious food and people watch  The apartment is beautiful and has a beautiful view overlooking the neighborhood  It is on the third floor  with no elevator  so would suggest luggage that can be easily carried up stairs  Although there is a white board detailing that someone has clean the apartment  plus the date that they clean it  there was no ones name on the white board or date implying that the apartment had been clean  Obviously the sheets were turned down and there was clean bedding  but one of the trash cans wasnt clean out at all  completely full with last persons trash   For the amount of money charged for the stay  I also wish there would have been an extra touch of including soap conditioner shampoo  Overall  a beautiful space  though 
423124312589061612,I would recommend  It s in the perfect location  cozy  Thank you  Noticed a couple of roaches  Other than that very good stay 
411563991230356612,My wife and I stayed in an awesome studio on the Central West Side at Euclid Pine  The neighborhood was great and not far from the freeways connecting you to the rest of the city  Very clean and easy to get in and out  Thank you for letting us enjoy our trip in that awesome studio 
436918145200729836,This is really good apartment if you need to visit Childrens Clinic or Barnes Jewish Hospital regularly  There is huge Park nearby so its very easy to make up plans when you have free time  Quick access to shops cafe restaurants   Once stopped at that place  I didnt want to consider other options
413695121072126918,Great amenities  location  and price  Check in was awful    Suggestion  tell people they need to go to the room first to get the fob to get into the parking garage instead of beginning with parking in the garage   There is no elevator in the garage  so you should revise instructions to tell guest to use the fob to get into one of the doors with a keypad  to go into the building  and then locate an elevator   Why is there a tv if it essentially cannot be used by guests 
410067783993087145,A very nice and spacious studio apartment  It was bigger than we expected and very close to the power and light district  Street parking was fairly easy to find as long as you read the signs for when the car needs to be moved  Access to appliances and cookware was great even though we didnt use much  I would suggest making sure you have bathroom toiletries as they were used up rather quickly  by the two of us with one shower   Very nice temp control and a standing fan in the closet of you want the white noise  Our biggest concern was access into the building  Follow the instructions carefully and arrive as early as possible in case the call box doesnt work  We got it with some help from other AirBnB guests who happened to see us unable to access the building  Overall  a comfortable stay and a good bargain for the cost and location  I would stay again and recommend to fellow bargain travelers  Enjoyed our quick stay on your property overall  We loved how spacious it was and the overall set up of the room  The instructions were good but quite lengthy  I wonder if they could be made more succinct  We also appreciated the fan in the closet as it provided the perfect white noise  Also  unfortunately we had trouble getting into the building because the call box was not functioning the way it was supposed to  We did reach out but we actually were let in by other Air Bnb guests who saw us having problems  I hope this is fixed soon because we were nervous about getting in before it was too late out 
435446998194042174,Very nice and comfortable  It was perfect for the four of us  I would definitely stay there again  The building is very secure  and the rooftop was awesome  The check in process was very easy  Its within walking distance of Busch Stadium  although I would recommend renting scooters  We had a blast  We had an amazing time  The apartment was perfect 
431153516408191860,Very Clean  Cute and comfortable  The beds were very comfortable  Spacious for a small apartment  The top balcony has a great sitting area to eat dinner at during the sunset    Over all we enjoyed our stay   Kitchen is bare so bring utensils if needed and no coffee maker   If you want  need  to stay next to the hospital this is the place  Walking distance  But with that you will hear all the noises the hospital has to offer all through the night  Helicopter  ambulance  traffic    An average sleeper would be fine but a light sleeper may not appreciate it  Overall our stay was great and we enjoyed the apartment  However when we walked in it smelled like someone had been cooking or eating Mexican food in the actual apartment  not the hall  The smell lingered most of the stay  One night the neighbors had a party and their guest were drunk and knocking on everyone s doors as a joke  We had a toddler sleeping so it was slightly annoying 
409402249137439199,Came into town for a weekend with friends and this place was perfect  It is walking distance from lots of places and even to downtown if you re willing to walk  If not it is very close to the train  It was very clean and met all of our needs  Thank you so much for the stay  We had a great time and this for everything we needed
434769508476365639,Cute place  clean  great location  Parking was a little hard to find but other than that highly recommend  Thank you so much for hosting our trip  We had a great time 
439832983619738266,This was such a cute stay  The apartment buildings seemed a tiny bit sketchy especially since it was super quiet  we hardly saw anyone   But we felt safe after night one of our stay  Thanks for making this such a fun and easy stay 
768690917,Our stay here was great  The house was perfect for what we needed  Very clean  check in was easy  and Slawik was a fantastic host  Great location walking distance from the main area of Independence  Highly recommend staying here if you are planning a trip to the KC area Thanks so much for your hospitality  Slawik  Our stay was great and we very much appreciated your responsiveness anytime we had a question  Thanks again for everything 
425360865520031518,Lovely 
425355845905982001,Gorgeous though not a great area Need to say it s by the peabodys
399896087685962040,My family had a great holiday weekend in Wicker Park staying at this apartment  The unit was spacious and beautiful  Its situated in an ideal location on a quiet street  Would stay again when visiting Chicago  Hi  thanks for a good stay  I just wanted to let you know a few things about the unit       The floors were pretty dirty  I didnt go barefoot because the bottom of my feet turned black after a few minutes walking around      The bed in the master bedroom had multiple broken slats causing the mattress to sag  I would suggest replacing these for future guests      The dryer in the unit was basically non functional  Took many cycles to get a small load of clothing dry  I ended up hanging them over the raining on the exterior balcony  Also  after a few minutes into the drying cycle  the dryer made some extremely loud noises  I made sure it was not overloaded       The keypad to enter the unit was non functional  We had to call the number on the booking to get access to the key box adjacent to the door    Otherwise  we had a very nice time in this beautiful apartment in an ideal location  Thank you 
413719495617975526,The apartment was fine  although our experience was less than satisfactory due to misinformation in the Airbnb description of the property and a complete lack of communication from the Host  First  we specifically booked this unit because it was listed as having a washer and dryer so we could clean some clothes in the middle of a long trip  It did not have a washer and dryer  and our communications asking the host about this during our stay were completely ignored  I made multiple attempts to communicate with the host  starting immediately after we arrived for our two night stay  and other than a non substantive  we re looking into it  I heard nothing  Second  the unit was listed as being three blocks from public transit  It was much further than that  and it was a hike and took nearly an hour to get to the Loop on transit  If you want a decent unit close to the University of Chicago and don t need anything from the host  this is a fine unit  But the listing was inaccurate on several points that were critical to our experience 
421687856268366245,Overall I would say this is a nice place to stay  Only cons are parking and the cleanliness of the unit which the latter can be addressed and improved upon  The unit had an unpleasant smell kind of like feet  and there was hair all over the bathroom and in the tub  Also there was a note tht said it was deep clean by Bee on July   st  Not sure if that s the last time it was rented but I stayed there August  rd  The parking by the building is terrible and they may benefit to have a dedicated spot 
392740872041947364,Great location  Near a lot of food places  Parking isn t bad at all  The ceiling light in the bedroom didn t turn on  there were a few bugs  but overall nice apartment 
409350564063458061,Had a fantastic time staying here 
391235901327285969,Great place to stay  I was able to find free parking on street within a block and I was allowed to place our bikes in the Bike room inside the building  I suggest a better wifi extender or connect a router to the extender which is already in place via Cat E cable so that guests will have a better experience  I was not able to use provided Wifi info because the signal was to weak  Thankfully I had seen someone mention WiFi connection problems at this property so I brought a router which allowed me to have decent internet throughout unit  Other than that the stay was great 
410051597030890851,Great place and location  Great stay in a great location  We loved the contemporary feel and the raw architecture  Our only feedback would be the ease of use of the bedroom light and fan controls  We got the lights to work  but the fan did not seem operational 
392702763982248106,My stay was great as far as the location  The parking was horrible  I spent most of my trip finding somewhere to park at the building I stay in  The apartment was nice on the inside  and the check in check out process was easy 
431091640920064420,Great place to stay  Very clean and great location  Would recommend  Thank you for everything  Place was great 
400007322248313522,Great stay   short drive to downtown and main highways  Pictures really doesn t do this Airbnb justice       would recommend Thanks a lot for the stay  it was way more than we imagined  Definitely will be returning   
752024570,We ve stayed here twice now and loved each time  Very conveniently located for doing things in different parts of KC  very clean and has everything you need plus some  Definitely would book again for future weekends in KC  Thanks again for stopping by to help out with the Roku  Your place is a such a great price for a weekend in KC 
391311110773726355,My girlfriend and I had a great time at this lovely place  It was very clean  had lots of amenities and was an overall great stay  Thank you 
414456237574138053,Very understanding and great responsiveness
430365528654950784,If you like going out and night life  this is the spot for you   I cant account for anything that may take place during the week as we were only there from Friday to Monday   But this place was SOOOOOOO DOPE   Right above the Hook   Ladder bar  I would suggest to get cool with the bouncer  Renzo   We immediately befriended him and he told us the ins and outs of the area that helped us keep from paying a dime in parking the entire time   REALLY good guy   Also  the bouncers at Halligans were also chill   If there is a line at either location  just let the bouncers know you stay upstairs and you can skip the lines   As for this location  theres everything you need to have a great time  enjoying the city   The nearby Mexican  Allende  and Indian  Curry   Pizza  spots were where I lived     Im pretty social  so I spent some time getting to know the owners and staff  just for familiaritys sake     Ok  I keep talking about whats around and not the apartment itself   So its a great space   Youve got   bedrooms  with doors  and the softest couch you ever have taken a nap on  I took      The balcony welcomes you to the city every morning and the huge windows quietly hide you at night with the shades   Personally  I love the sun  so those shades got ZERO usage   I spent every morning on that balcony  just taking in the city as the shops below prepared for the day   You may have a dusty rug under the coffee table  so I wouldnt suggest being barefoot for long    just like cat hair or something a good shake could fix   Thats what we did    at night shook out the rug and swept the floor    perfecto     We did this at night to avoid getting any debris on anyone below    The Zencity people were instrumental in making this visit immaculate   They were very attentive and helpful while staying out of the way   I loved it   The only drawback  if there is one  was that the bathroom sink drain is EXTREMELY slow   I told the owners if this is all I had to deal with to get this type of reception from the city and the relaxation I felt  then drown me   lol   Im so serious     Caution  I accidentally put my key into the wrong door  this space has   doors   but thankfully after quite a bit of wiggling  I was able to get it out   DO NOT DO AS I DID     Only use the Front Door with the key   Have fun   I cant wait to come back and YES  Ill be looking for THIS location    All this is on a scale of       with    being GREAT    Location     Cleanliness    Access to shops     Management     Beds       sleep like a fn baby  Chill Factor     People      its still Chicago  they aint all perfect   lol Food     You guys were GREAT   THANKS for making our first Airbnb stay a DEFINITE memorable one     The weather was amazing  the bars downstairs and surround were so great and offered some very active crowds  and the FOOD       You all have a location that I cannot WAIT to return to   Im hopeful in the very near future to come up with my fiancee and show her the city before we move   This place had everything   The only small issue was with the sink in the bathroom as it didnt drain well   If a slow drain is all I have to deal with to see the city in such a beautiful display    drown me   lol   Ill take it EVERYDAY    I wish we could have negotiated somehow on that beautiful piece of art  so I can have a bit of the city with me  but I definitely understand   And thanks for your help with the keys  check in  information  and just being available   You guys ROCK   
397037328907480228,Very good and convenient location  the only issues i had were there were stray hairs in the bath tub and I think they couldve clean a little better  But thats just me being nitpicky  otherwise zero complaints    Super nice and the bed was very soft Thank you for all the amenities  
436882592072882032,Great stay  Highly recommend their multiple units  As a creator  the photography books and work space were my favorites  The view is amazing too 
436239078973617366,A dream place  A modern and luxurious living space with all the amenities we needed and check in was very easy  Located in a nice and quiet neighbourhood  The communication with Zencity was very efficient and accomodating to all our questions  Would highly recommend this place 
424622077606924132,Nice apartment not a lot of parking options  We found mold underneath the sink which had made the appointment have a smell luckily the smell  wasn t on the sheets or couch
391997737013091703,This third floor apartment in an older building has a few issues  but is in a great location  On the positive side  this is a great location  roomy space and comfortable beds  The biggest issue during our stay was that the lock on the door to the outside of the building was broken and not repaired when we reported it  We received a response immediately  but it was not repaired  The second most important issue is that the electricity seems to be shorting throughout the apartment  overhead lights flicker and lamps go off than come back on   could be a fire hazard  Additional issues included not being told that this space was on the third floor and there was no elevator  a very strong order of marijuana smoke in the apartment throughout our entire stay   an air purifier would help  This is a busy street  very noisy at night and the windows are in poor repair so they dont close all the way making it difficult to sleep   Basic amenities like coffee would be really appreciated 
414439151040626376,Easy check in  Had everything we needed and was comfortable  The train is nearby  but it wasn t noisy  This place was great  It had everything we needed and was a comfortable place to stay  Thank you 
745496861,Nice place in a great location  very secure  comfortable  excellent kitchen  thanks so much  We had a great week
396322885394929662,Pros   Location Newly finished Check in was super easy  Cons  Shower wasnt clean  used bottles from the previous stay and hair in the drain  I sent pictures but there was no response  Wi fi didnt work  I notified the company of the issues above and sent more pictures  They sent alternative WiFi logins  none of them worked  notified them again  and they only said they would  let someone on the team know   Nothing was ever resolved 
394141437812812323,Good  bit smaller than expected but the location was great to the park and easy walk to other restaurants  Parking was rough to find  but it is stated in the listing that the place doesn t provide parking  The staff there was wonderful though Overall the stay was good  there were some things that weren t provided in the listing  The place was a bit smaller than we originally thought but overall the location and view from our room was great  Thank you for having us 
394881744221459174,Check in was listed for  am  When I arrived at      am was told I couldnt check in until  pm  Wasted my day waiting around in a thunderstorm  Customer support was useless didnt have the ability to check me in or fix any problems its all automated  Others had the same issue  Stay somewhere else avoid Zencity properties  booking was listed for  am check in I showed up at      am was told couldnt check in until  pm  Waited   hours when Zencity called me back said I could check in it didnt work they finally canceled the reservation after I wasted my day hanging out in a thunderstorm  I will never use a Zencity property again  Their support staff is useless  They didnt have the ability or knowledge to fix the problem 
394834799993718150,This place was great  Other than a few small things that I think everyone should know about  The apartment looked exactly like the pictures which was awesome and very beautiful  However  it should be noted that it is on the ground floor meaning people from outside can see into the apt  I think that s important for people to know  Also the bedroom does not have any windows meaning even at   am it will be pitch black in the bedroom  unless you want to keep the door open and then people can see you sleeping from the outside  This made our sleep not the best and something I wish I was aware of prior to booking  Other than that  the location is in a great neighborhood but very residential  Not much walking distance  Everything else is a car ride away  Thanks for the stay 
397023949080970331,This is a wonderful place to stay  It has tall ceilings  lots of room  a huge kitchen area  the rooms are on opposite sides so that you can have some privacy away from the other guests  Has a laundry room with a great washer and dryer  It s a beautiful apartment that has easy access to get in and out of  The pool is beautiful too  And if you drive they have assigned parking in the parking garage so your vehicle won t be left outside  Easiest check out ever too  And if I had any questions they were quick to answer  I will absolutely stay again   It was an amazing place  just a couple of things  The instructions said to say a code and you don t have to do that and then it said take the elevator to the right bit you don t need an elevator and the apartment is to the left  The last thing is that there was only one fork lol  Plenty of knives and spoons but just one fork lol  But it was a great place and I will definitely stay there again   Thank you sooo much 
394900868829102414,The building is only secure in the front  any joe could walk in the back door without a fob  The entire building smelled of dog urine  Dog urine found in elevator and in hallways  The apartment was clean but that was the only thing that was clean  Parking was too far away and not convenient for a family with lots of luggage  The trashcan in the parking garage on the first floor hadn t  been emptied in probably a month  Wasn t       sure there wasn t a body in it because it about made us vomit when we got out of the car and that was on the third floor  One of the bedrooms had a busted window and they put  tape and a plastic bag to cover the hole  Well it rained  so we couldn t sleep in the room because it was hot and humid  The tv sound was awful had to turn it up loud to hear which wasn t all bad because it drowned out the dogs barking in the hallway  I have never been happier to leave my vacation and would have if there would have been other vacancies in town  Zen city and Airbnb should take this place off there bookings list  I will never use them again  Changed my dates and zen city said it was fine and Airbnb dropped the ball  Then we had to stay an hour away from the city because everything was booked up  I did get a refund but thats besides the point 
440495579027824859,Great Location  easy check in  and most importantly  comfy bed   Thank you for the fast response  Bed was so comfy   
548546524552026267,Nice
428920427299984795,Loved staying here  Great location and the amenities are amazing  The building staff are friendly and super helpful 
414418902420017235,Everything was great about this apartment   Great location  Easy check in  Air gets really  cold  Spacious  Great view of downtown from the apartment and rooftop    Cant wait to book again    The apartment was everything   The bed in the master room rails need to be set in the  queen slot  Felt like  we were falling off the bed  Thanks for having us 
393386475256623429,Fantastic location  Central to everything  WiFi is solid  The grocery store downstairs is great  My family of   had an amazing week here  Zen city was extremely prompt answering any questions or concerns  Would definitely stay again  Hi  Everything was great  We will write a very nice review  However just for your eyes     Kitchen needs a few more supplies like baking trays  Tupperware  more coffee cups  more cutlery  some type of small handheld mixer      The rug in the living room is terrible  It sheds  It s impossible to vacuum  In fact it clogs up the vacuum in the apartment even if you try      The place could use a deep clean  there were some small spiderwebs by the dining area  and the walls look pretty scruffy    Having said that  we had a great time and none of it would stop us from renting again  Thanks very much 
414504837371015812,Great Place with a beautiful outdoor space  
394112093215174106,Great location  Parking on the street was convenient  for us  Roof top had a great view  Room was nice and simple  The bed sits low to the ground  but comfortable  The room was nice  The bathroom had hair in it  and the shower curtain liner was filthy  The bathroom needs to be touched up  Paint peeling and a small chunk of the wall is missing  Middle light above the counter top was out too 
395647276104276906,I think it s in a great spot   Easy access to a lot of places   The stay wasn t the best and communication wasn t the best either  I would just say make sure it s more clean next time  Very homey though  
440489182999272330,Great location and great place to stay  We had a small problem during our check in due to the room change but everything was resolved quick and easy  Thank you for the place to stay it was amazing 
428173395429952124,The view is amazing    great space to just check out and relax  You guys are amazing I m so happy I was able to experience your space  Thank you for having me   
410778548841716759,It was an ok stay  the kitchen was nice and the WiFi was service decent the bathroom was very much my esthetic as well
423904127806481655,Disappointing  To start with  their  parking options  are expensive  Finding the key was like something out of an Indiana Jones movie  Once we finally figured out how to even get in  the apartment is lack luster  The bedrooms have no TV  the living room has a small TV  WiFi is spotty  the shower faucet in the small room was nearly falling out of the wall  the light switch in that same small room was cracked  the chair in the living room had a broken leg    To finish off my stay  the host accused myself and my guest  both    year old sober men  off  peeing the bed  and claimed after our stay a  noise sensor  was missing  It was like they put lipstick on a pig  Do not recommend 
431108874528265278,This place was so convenient in the perfect location to get pretty much everywhere around the city The rooftop topped everything off
412224857651781824,Buyer beware   My airbnb had no hotwater and I had no response from ZenCity  There was never any hot water and no response from ZenCity on the issue 
424558444400783968,Great stay in a decent location  If you want a quiet night  definitely find somewhere else  The unit was as described and very clean  Thanks for a great stay  Ended up having a pretty bad migraine the entire time though  so the location was not ideal 
409320816344409873,It was in a safe area  the place was very clean and the view was amazing 
397074121601689536,Great price and great apartment in Hyde Park  Definitely best for   people max  getting in was easy and the apartment was very clean well stocked with everything we could need  Ava s communication for checking in and out was great as well  Thank you so much for the stay 
448507491730113543,Great location  good communication  nice kitchen and amenities  and lots of comfortable space    There was a bit of a smoke smell in a few areas  which I wouldnt normally mind  but with a high clean fee and a  no smoking  spot  I was a bit surprised  The only other downside was that the parking garage was a bit of a walk  so it may not be great for certain folks    Other than that though  I greatly enjoyed my stay and would happily recommend it to anyone who is comfortable with these few minor things  I greatly enjoyed staying at your place and the communication and location were very much appreciated  My only minor issue was a smell of cigarette or cannabis smoke  which I wouldnt have minded if not for the high priced clean fee  Other than that  I had no issues  Thanks again 
453533336551619299,Dirty shower and bathroom  Temperamental door lock and wrong main door code  Charged me twice so I suggest you check your bank statement  Got locked out in the rain when code didnt work  The shower was scary dirty  And got locked out of room  tricky lock  Only good thing was the person on the phone who tried to fix things 
407936265913089979,The space is nice  although one room has no AC so it is significantly hotter in the summer  The kitchen is nice but has so little in the way of equipment that is is nearly impossible to cook anything  no knives for instance   The wifi password was not working and it took them till the next day to get me a new one  which caused me some trouble   but they provided a small refund so I consider this resolved  Overall  a nice space that is a bit barebones  and has the marks of being run by a company and not a single  interested party 
424647468076448075,Very clean and modern  could use extra towels and kitchen utensils to cook with 
410812416415243772,The place looked great  Had a bit of a stench but nothing terrible  One thing though is we got there around  pm not knowing check in was at    We went back and read through and I gave them a quick text asking about checking in early and they never responded  I walked into the building and there were people still in the apartment when check out was at     Now that Im thinking about it  it was probably the host clean the room before our stay  but I would have liked to receive an answer to my question  We just left our suitcase in our car and did our activities for the day  Once we came back it was as if no one was there which was a relief  The question was never answered though and all of their messages were auto generated  It would be nice to have an actual person in charge of the account in case of questions and emergencies  I would have liked to have a non generated answer when i had a genuine question
393416742902348683,We loved this apartment unit  Everything was as expected and the directions for access were accurate  The apartment is simple and moderately decorated  but had everything a traveler needs  The price during our visit was much better than nearby hotels and provided much more private space  Walking distance to shops and restaurants was a major highlight for us  The shower pressure was amazing   makes me want to figure out how to remove the limiters in my home shower heads  This was a terrific rental and we would revisit this location again  Very clean  simple and everything a traveler could need  Much better prices than the nearby hotels and much more spacious  Directions for property access were accurate and understandable 
440600198977244229,This is my first and only bad review I ve written on Airbnb   The AC did not work  which on its own isn t the end of the world  What happened next though is unacceptable   I called on night   and was told someone would be out the next morning  They also said they would call me with updates  Neither happened   Called on night    exact same conversation on the phone  They said they would call me back with updates and that someone would be out that afternoon  No call  and no one came   Same thing the third night     I m pretty sure every person I spoke to was informed not to call me back since it was   different people and they all seemed sincere  so very likely the owner manager told them to leave me hanging for whatever reason   It was pushing    degrees outside and I was sweating the entire stay    A part of traveling is feel safe and secure and I don t think these owners take their tenants security seriously  If you say you are going to call someone back  then call them back   You ignored me on   occasions
414507479429724354,Close to the lake 
440550069804847053,Such a beautiful place  wonderful location    the rooftop is amazing  I ll be staying again for sure  Such a beautiful place  wonderful location    the rooftop is amazing  I ll be staying again for sure 
395429878561905968,They double booked and never notified about it  I couldn t get inside the apt bucause somebody else was in there already They double booked the apartment and i had to find out while trying to open the door while the other renters were in the property
394929001982983971,The location is perfect  There are groceries  coffee shops  Forest park  and many restaurants around the area  Inside the studio  they provided everything you need  Id stay there again anytime  Thanks for hosting me  Everything was great  If I might suggest something  it will be nice to have a Brita or any filtered water system 
489777697481889201,Great spot 
440589354111739794,Would not recommend
465142336078517162,Excellent rental close to everything STL has to offer  Super clean   Super safe   Super comfy  Thanks   Great stay 
493505517830985973,We had a great time in Chicago  The apartment was lovely   it met our needs  was comfortable  and was in a good location to visit my sister who lived close by  We had a great time in Chicago  The apartment was lovely   it met our needs  was comfortable  and was in a good location to visit my sister who lived close by 
453560380841205518,Great location  Very quiet  Could use some touch ups to the unit 
397807194807684722,Very good location  Nice layout and perfect size for our family  Great stay and solid location   Thank you 
453560073220997320,We had a wonderful stay at Zencity s place  Location was perfect and safe  communication was prompt  and it was very clean  We had an issue with the lock on the door but they were able to send someone out to fix it the next morning  Would highly recommend 
397722094058779567,Good location
523199504595354171,  
437596556652922132,This is a very comfortable place in a GREAT location   There is a big bathroom with a roomy shower  extra towels  blankets  etc   and had everything I needed to cook meals for myself  I stayed in the apartment by myself  but with the second bedroom  it would work well for my husband  daughter  and me or if I was traveling with a close friend  Stay was great 
411580559077134562,This apartment is beautiful  I stayed here while my husband had an overnight stay at Barnes hospital  It is located within a safe walking distance from the hospital  The doorman was helpful and friendly  I left my car parked at the hospital parking lot and walked the     mile distance  It smelled amazing when I walked in  it was fairly quiet aside from ambulance sirens occasionally  The only reason I give this place   stars is because communication with the host is difficult  It took hours to get answers to simple questions and at one point they never responded to a question at all  The apartment itself is a   star stay  just make sure you dont have any questions or have plenty of time to wait for replies from the host  Overall I had a great stay and would stay again  Would be   stars but the communication is lacking  I needed another night if at all possible and no one ever got back to me to let me know if it was possible  Took hours to get simple questions answered  The apartment is beautiful but there were some cleanliness issues  the sinks didnt look like they had been wiped since the last person  Also the bathtub was dirty looking  the baseboards in the bathroom were not clean  Everywhere else was beautiful 
398489002619774140,Not what I expected Dryer broken  Among other things
394907427761978112,This place is in a great neighborhood   Super safe and walkable   On street parking was pretty easy to find    The place is good not great   The beds are good   However  it is just missing that little extra to make it feel like home  The addition of some decor would be good   Dressers would be awesome   In the kitchen a baking sheet  measuring cups and measuring spoons would be amazing  One of the soap pumps in the bathrooms was broken  Also the paint spots and splatters just look like someone did a bad job 
428236466122537523,Great location for a reasonable price but not terribly clean or updated  We found hairs and stains  I would expect better given the hefty clean fee  Poor communication as I had to prompt entry info  This seemed like a corporate renter doing a job and not a welcoming individual owner  Great location for a reasonable price  Poor communication 
421663772531230348,Perfect location  spacious  and clean  We really enjoyed our stay Thanks again for the great stay  My family really enjoyed it and it was close to all of the attractions we were interested in
413727143435950676,Great stay  Little confusing finding the apartment   Once we did everything was great   Was a great trip would rent again  Only complaint was the bathroom sink   It s positioned so far back water tends to get everywhere   Not a big deal but noticeable 
403609811726599044,The apartment itself was pretty okay  great location as everywhere we went was within a    minute drive  The dishwasher does not work though so prepare to do the dishes by hand as there was not much silverware  The apartment building though was disgusting  there was dog pee right by the elevator for the last   days we were there and general trash and wet stains all around the floor  There appeared to be no reception people or workers there at all  a garbage man let us in without any identification so anybody could walk into the building and the passcode needed to get in didnt work at all and the building could only be accessed by the key fob inside  Zencity didnt reply with any helpful information when I messaged them about it except for the same info as the previous before you come message  Also the parking garage is a bit of a walk from the building which was a bummer  This wouldve seemed more like a     a night apartment if it wasnt for the central location  the apartment building was disgusting and i wish we wouldve known about that before booking  As far as the apartment itself  the dishwasher didnt work and very quickly we found other peoples hair just around the floor as well as broken glass by the boarded window  Also the dishes there already did not seem clean  some even had food still on them 
402794691005281512,We stayed at Zencity for a total of   nights   This place is an old building  like all of the buildings in this area  and the management converted this into an Air BnB    It is a safe place and we love the neighborhood with walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores   Parking is a little tricky but we had no problem with finding a parking space at it is on the street and required parallel parking    There seemed to be a bit of confusion with the offer for a late check out   First  we were told that we had to check  out at    a m  when we asked if it is possible to have a late checkout   We were told no because there was someone checking in to the place on the same day   Later  we received an email that offers a late check out for an extra       We sent a request but didnt hear from management so we called  was on hold for a long time   We were approved for a late check out after   phone calls and a long hold time  Our only complaint is the awful smell in the stairway coming up to the third floor where the apartment is   There is also smoking fumes  not only from cigarette smoking but also from strong marijuana smoke coming from other apartments through the vents or chimney   I have asthma so it was making it difficult to breathe   I called the management and they offered to clean the apartment with ozone  I am not sure what it is  and it would take   hours to clean   I bought an air freshener to mask the smell on my last night there and didnt bother with the clean   Other than that  I love the area and the place is spacious for   people   I wouldnt recommend this place to someone that couldnt handle the secondhand smoke from cigarettes and marijuana   Your clothes  bath towels will smell like that too  Thank you for responding to my request regarding the apartment with the smell of cigarettes and marijuana   There seemed to be a bit of confusion with the offer for a late check out   First  we were told that we had to check  out at    a m  when we asked if it is possible to have a late checkout   We were told no because there was someone checking in to the place on the same day   Later  we received an email that offers a late check out for an extra       We sent a request but didnt hear from management so we called  was on hold for a long time   We were approved for a late check out after   phone calls and a long hold time 
402184230204706699,The front lock on the building was faulty  Luckily a resident let me in  I did inform Zencity of the issue
440523281431427211,Location is great  Airbnb wasn t has clean as expected  leftover garbage from previous guest  didn t seem to be vacuumed  bathroom was dirty  sink covers for bathroom were covered in hair from previous visitors  Maybe we just had an off clean before our arrival  but I was not impressed and when I communicated there was no response  This Airbnb is a nice location  Unfortunately the cleanliness of the Airbnb was not good and the communication pertaining to this was nonexistent  Rooms had garbage left underneath bed from previous visitors and crumbs on the floor  bathroom was dirty  a significant amount of hair was left on the sink cover  There was no coffee pot as indicated  there was a French press  which was fine  but something to be noted  Also  you have no control over the temp in the Airbnb it was    degrees and fairly warm  Overall the best part was the location 
428204058177386213,Only issue I really had was check in was a little difficult  but that is because the building has pretty decent security  Everything else was as described  Great value 
396372999836896478,Great location  and check in was very easy but we had some issues during our stay  The clean job wasnt the best  The appliances  microwave   dishwasher  did not work for over half of our month long stay  The team at Zencity is quick to respond but they say theyll get back to you and then often dont ever follow up until you reach out again    The space is cute but should note that its a little smaller than it looks in pictures   the couch   tv are so low to the ground so the room looks bigger 
537025542646517878,Accurately described  Very clean  Very enjoyable 
489836766327573519,Great location and space to stay  Thanks
436228571810564971,Great location anda plenty of options in the neighborhood    Great location  the only recommendation from the ladies that travel with us was to have a mirror on each room 
438336131887217660,always clean and prompt
463752504819191194,This place is absolutely beautiful  and the perfect location  The train is right outside the window but very quiet  It s like a hotel room   The door when you first get there is behind two gates  and you have to walk with purpose in order to get to that door in time   Perfect for one or two people  Hi  I totally loved my stay  It was perfect besides these two things     When I first came in I didn t realize how I the gate worked  it didn t seem to open until after    seconds and then by the time I got to the third door it had locked so I had to restart  I had read the check in instructions where that was mentioned but I still had to go back out and try again     The washing machine didn t drain until the third time I ran it   Otherwise absolutely beautiful 
398554998563513015,The unit itself was fine   Communication with and assistance from Zencity was extremely poor  The unit itself was fine   My only complaints about the unit are as follows   One  initially entering the building with the access code provided was nearly impossible   I was only able to gain access when another resident let me in   This is the second time I have stayed at a Zencity location and had difficulty with the building access code  although in both cases the elevator code and door code for the individual unit worked     Two  the bed in the unit was very uncomfortable   It was the same type of bed as we had in the last Zencity unit we rented in KC  we knew from that experience how uncomfortable these beds are    Because we were staying for a full month  we had to purchase a foam topper  at significant additional expense  to make the bed acceptable   Third  the unit was equipped with a sound sensor and we received  alerts  when we were allegedly being too noisy   We received  alerts  when we were doing nothing more than running the washing machine or watching TV at a normal level   In fact  we received an  alert  once when no one was in the unit   We received no complaints from our neighbors   Clearly  the sensor was set at too sensitive a level   The repeat  alerts  were frustrating     Our biggest complaint related to communication with and the ability to get assistance from Zencity staff   Because we had a month long rental  it was necessary for my son to have a prescription  which he receives by mail   delivered to the unit we were renting at the Cambria apartment complex in KC   The tracker indicated that the package had been delivered to the units mailbox and when he tried to retrieve it we discovered that he had no key to the mailbox and no way to access it   On Friday June     I reached out to Zencity using the phone number provided on email communications   The woman I spoke to said she would work on getting us access to the mailbox but that they might not have the situation resolved until the following week   When I had not heard anything by the next Tuesday  I called again and spoke with Mariano   He seemed responsive and said that they were aggressively trying to resolve the problem   I spoke to Mariano throughout the week and while he was always nice  no progress was made   At the beginning of the following week  when we had not yet been provided a key     days later   I began pushing for a clearer explanation of the problem   It seemed to me that either the Zencity property manager in KC was unwilling to come to the site or that Zencity did not have a key   I was never able to get a straight answer as to why this problem could not be resolved   I pointed out that we were nearing the end of our rental period and thus the problem needed to be resolved promptly   I was promised that the area manager would deliver the mailbox key to the apartment by July    which did not happen    When I tried to call and find out why this promise had not been fulfilled I could no longer get anyone to answer my call   I assume that the call center had caller ID and had grown tired of dealing with me 
394138285899956307,This place was great  The apt was huge and we loved the space  Great walking distance to so many bars and restaurants  Would reccomend staying here
415142287600623543,Same as last time   robo company that only gives robot responses  You did nothing to help my experience
398549371232809447,Great place for our group to stay for one night 
419479370023456499,Although I typically don t like dealing with holding pm companies  this was surprisingly pleasant  They were very communicative and gave us step by step instructions for the whole stay    Two cons       it s RIGHT over the  L   I mean  on top of it  The building is obviously built for it  but there was still a sliiiiight annoyance lingering  Also  people can see you  and you can see them  so  keep those blinds shut       the door code was too damn long  Like   numbers   Way too much  lol    Otherwise the stay was pleasant  the place was in a PERFECT location and it was all around a solid experience  Thanks so much  You guys were great  Thank you 
472442881574853138,Clean and peaceful Very nice place to relax and great location 
397021827836731190,It was in walking distance of a coffee shop and Lafayette park  It was about    minutes away from the zoo and the Arch  It was a fun little apartment in a great area  Pots and pans were available 
396271285375455157,If youre looking for a convenient spot in a walkable area of St  Louis  this is your place  Nothing too fancy  but perfect for   or   people swinging by the city  Everything as great  A bottle of water or two would be a nice touch in the fridge  but other than that it was just what I needed 
435422000572100794,Perfect spot for Airbnb  Zencity was a great host and communication was easy and pretty fast  Great stay Thank you for allowing us to stay at your beautiful home 
439766389751375735,Awesome house  and awesome host   very easy to communicate with and house was clean  Definitely will check out again when Im in Kansas city 
412988574336014388,Beautiful apartment and great location  Walking distance from restaurants  bars  groceries  and forest park  Loved the style of the space  Had everything we needed  Would highly recommend  Thanks for a great stay  We only had a slight issue with plugging in the address for our Lyft  We had a hard time figuring out if it was    N or    S  I later realized it was in your message  Haha 
412968444270069472,Unit itself is not bad  We received a message    minutes before our  pm check in that the unit would not be available until       after we had already paid for transportation for a  pm arrival  They claimed it was due to a late check out  but the clean crew didnt even arrive until        Wifi information is not accurate  We had to contact the property multiple times  attempted   different wifi network password combinations before they finally sent us the correct information    It was a frustrating stay  but would have been much better if Zencity was better at communication 
521792201182108758,Could not get into the building the whole stay  Had to have tenants let us in every time we went out  which made leaving a chore  Tenants stated that this issue was known and nothing is ever done to remedy the problem  Upon arriving to check in  was also unable to get the key out of the key box  Had to call and have somone open it remotely  Pictures online are deceiving  What looks like a upscale loft is actually an subpar apartment  Hardly any furniture  and what was available was very uncomfortable  suggested parking options were deplorable  Somone backed into my brand new vehicle  Parked in an alternative lot with no issues afterwards  Silver lining was a decent location  and a clean decently stocked apartment  Could not get into the building the whole stay  Had to have tenants let us in every time we went out  which made leaving a chore  Tenants stated that this issue was known and nothing is ever done to remedy the problem  Upon arriving to check in  was also unable to get the key out of the key box  Had to call and have somone open it remotely  Pictures online are deceiving  What looks like a upscale loft is actually an subpar apartment  Hardly any furniture  and what was available was very uncomfortable  suggested parking options were deplorable  Somone backed into my brand new vehicle  Parked in an alternative lot with no issues afterwards  Silver lining was a decent location  and a clean decently stocked apartment 
748539949,A very nice and affordable place Id suggest a cutting board for the kitchen
415135431421405218,Clean and quiet  Nice balcony  Great location   Will stay here again  We enjoyed our stay   A trash can is needed in the bathroom 
397819561048671556,Good value  but the hallways tend to smell bad Mini Blinds were very old and broken
548552747638210600,Great place for a great price  Perfect for one or a couple  Parking was also easy to find outside  Would definitely recommend 
397757570611714948,Awesome place  will stay here again if in STL Wifi either doesn t work or is confusing  Everything else was excellent 
396301378271140422,If I would have listened to the bad review  I would have missed out  This is a true experience The minalmist space was perfect  Location   right in heart of St Louis  Great choice  with so many in the      Definitely would book again  Awesome staying in such an historic location    Great    minalmist space
431872943207635719,Great space  location was outstanding  as described  Thank you  great space perfect for what we needed
451386875094441141,The apartment was clean and had plenty of space  We appreciated that they included an electric kettle and French Press  and that there was a washer and dryer in the apartment  The location was great too  Easy to walk to nearby Schnucks grocery as well as Euclid St for restaurants  We d definitely stay here again  The only suggestion we have is including instructions on where to put the trash when the van gets full  as well as a little bit more timely communications  We didn t receive check in details until like       pm the night before  Those are small things though  Overall  the place was great  clean  and a convenient location  Thank you 
397086945539813664,Great   clean   and very spacious
398539194385343855,To start off  this is a long post but the place itself is decent  The check in process was complicated because our access code wouldn t work to get our keys so we had to call Zencity  They only give one parking permit and one key fob  The key fob is used for the entrance  elevator and studio  Upon arrival  our bed had a broken leg and had been zip tied together previously  If you sat on the bed  it would pop the broken leg out and the mattress would fall to the ground  We work nights so it didn t affect us until the next day  We called and needed a place to stay to sleep and the bed fixed  They gave us a place to stay after some arguing  They said to stay until our bed was fixed  We went there and slept  I woke up at  pm to someone entering our apartment  I then called and they said we had to leave immediately or we would be charged for the night  They hadn t fixed our bed and they didn t until  pm  After the bed was fixed with replacing some missing bolts  it was a decent stay  I wouldn t recommend the company to anyone  Every place we have stayed at under zencity has been poorly cared for and something is always wrong 
397575384860744807,great place
453559924642542968,Great view of the city and comparable costs to other lodging options  but with way more amenities than standard travel lodging  I will rebook if Im ever back in the area 
441281933324279270,This was one of the worst experiences Ive had on airbnb    For the past year  me and a group of friends have been traveling around the US and staying in various airbnbs  This was probably the   th airbnb we stayed at and weve never had as many issues as we did in this one    This airbnb is managed by a management company that is impossible to communicate with  When we arrived on our first day  the wifi was not working  We emailed Zencity about this immediately  They did not respond for hours and then told us to  restart our devices  even though we had left a detailed description of the wifi issues  including the fact that it was occurring across multiple devices and we had restarted the router     This back and forth went on for an entire week  We had no internet and were unable to work from home for that whole week   Every time I messaged or called Zencity  there was a new person responding who had no context on the situation and was completely unable to help  We asked them to reach out to the ISP and it took them   days for them to finally do that   just to tell us again to  restart our devices   They told us they would send a technician over on   separate occasions  Each time  we had to leave the location we were working from  because the airbnb had no wifi  only for the technician not to show up    For an entire week  I was email  calling  and messaging Zencity to try and get our wifi fixed  They responded to messages once every couple hours at best and again  it was a new person each time    The apartment itself was fine  Some of the furniture was broken and wobbly  There was also a lot of dust which aggravated one of our guests allergies  It didnt look like they had clean in a while  It was incredibly minimal  There were also many lights that were out or flickering    Overall  I would not recommend staying here unless you plan to be mostly outside of the apartment for your entire stay 
394130249825770565,If your looking for cleanliness DON T stay here  While staying at this location we had issues with the wireless lock and needless to say the whole time we stayed Friday   Sunday we couldn t lock the door which caused a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety    When we contacted Zencity regarding the issue they could of cared less and never sent out a maintenance team to get the problem fixed  I spent   hours of my vacation dealing with this issue along with the cleanliness of the place  Missed out on a group tour because of it as well    In my opinion not worth the stress or headache  Pictures don t represent the property in its current state  Make sure all your equipment is working properly  Locks  washer and dryer if advertised are useable  Have a maintenance team on call in case any issues come up  Very disappointed that we could t lock our door during our stay and no one came to fix it
441207942051187712,great place
441256717319476779,Clean and neat APT   Good and easy communication with the host Thank you for hosting me  I wished there was a late check out but I appreciate my stay 
394908924973071467,The location and layout of this apartment was great  We flew into Midway and it was about    minutes from the airport  but a straight shot  The apartment comfortably fit   people and had adequate amenities  The space was clean and welcoming  We did have difficulty accessing the building  but the support staff communicated with us constantly until it was resolved  We also had problems with wifi in the apartment which unfortunately was not resolved during our   day stay  There was adequate parking near the building and it was close to many eateries and community events  I was in frequent contact with the support team about the wifi problem  The router required rebooting and this needed to occur remotely  Unfortunately  we did not have wifi during the entire stay  We had to use hotspots on our phones  Myself and my sister are students and this affected our ability to submit assignments and meet deadlines  Also  there was no building key available  Mariano worked tirelessly to support us on this issue and we were eventually provided an access code  Prior to this  we were unable to all travel out of the building due to concerns with entering again  I suggest having staff follow up on these two things for future guests 
425348811183704835,Good place Thanks grateful
397826169222041242,Our overall stay was okay  once we were inside of the apartment  While we understand that the area outside of the apartment cannot be controlled by the host  we think it s important for others to know what they should expect    On our second day in the apartment  we arrived back at the apartment at the end of the day to find someone had been in the apartment and left a parking pass that had not been there prior to then  We were very unhappy that we were not contacted prior to someone entering our room and we were not even notified afterwards that they had done so  Upon contacting the host  they confirmed that this happened and apologized  Having no prior notification of this made us feel uneasy the rest of the trip  knowing someone could easily walk in without notice    The other concerns that we had were that when we walked into the apartment building  the first thing that hit us was the smell of marijuana  We hoped this was a one time occurrence  but unfortunately  it was every single time we went in and out of the building  The hallway on the   th floor where the apartment is located was dirty  with trash on the floors that stayed in the hall for the duration of our stay  It also smelled like garbage  The elevator we rode up in on our first day had visible vomit on the floor and as a result  smelled disgusting  That smell remained in that elevator for the duration of our stay    Inside the apartment  when a neighbor would apparently smoke  the cigarette or marijuana smell  depending on the moment  came through the vent in the bathroom and remained    We certainly understand that the neighbors cannot be controlled  but it definitely hindered our stay and made us extremely uncomfortable    The apartment itself was older  but had been updated nicely for the condition of the building  The linens were clean  but for three days and two people we would have preferred more towels for the stay  We made do  however  The apartment was very clean and the kitchen was well stocked with matching and clean dishes  and it appeared that there was care taken in renovating the apartment  The bed was comfortable enough  The view out the window was very nice  and we could see a part of the arch    The host was quick to respond to our questions and concerns  until we left the apartment  Once our reservation ended  we no longer got a response from them  Check in was easy  with very specific information with access codes and having free garage parking down the street was helpful  We sent you a private message of our review but have not heard anything back on it so we are going ahead and submitting our full review 
424652578554714025,Very close to the Kansas city attractions  clean and quick response  thank you for all your accommodations  we really appreciate it
453644136905538446,Great place and location 
441273632819315003,Inaccurate listing  Unclean shower  No pool  No parking  No front staff   All floors had the trash overflowing  Apartment looked nothing like the pictures  Construction was going on in the neighboring apartments and it felt as off they were hammering for    hours of the day  I ve stayed in about    Airbnb s in my life  friends or mine  and this was by far the worst I have had  No thank you
397818099889805645,Great place  great location 
423141707559644227,Literally one of the best places you can stay  For starters the security is modern  organized  and user friendly  Then the space  so refreshing  You walk in and you are like  woah  I need some tips from this designer   There is a functioning record player and the layout was perfect for my sister and I  To top it off the complex has a roof garden with a stunning view of the city and plenty of lounging options to take it in from  Such a great choice if you are in St  Louis   Thank you so much for having us at your apartment  Its a beautiful  inviting space and very well decorated  my sister and I had a great experience 
409389942983916254,Pros  Perfect location  easy check in  square footage  and bed quality    Cons  lack of amenities that were supposed to be included like a hair dryer or coffee maker  as well as a general lack of amenities   e g   only two forks and very few kitchen items   The noise monitor in the living room tracks your sound level and makes it virtually impossible to use the space at all   While talking in normal voices with the TV on in the background we received multiple calls messages  all before the stated   quiet time  began at    PM  saying we needed to quiet down  It felt like we were unable to use the space we paid for for anything other than sleep  so we ended up having to spend more time out of the rental than we would have liked to   Overall  an okay experience  Would be a great option if you re only looking to sleep in the rental and not use it s kitchen or living spaces  Pros  Perfect location  easy check in  square footage  bed quality   Cons  lack of amenities that were supposed to be included  e g   hair dryer  coffee maker  causing us unforeseen expenses  and the noise monitor being in the living room makes it virtually impossible to use the space at all   While talking in normal voices with the TV on in the background we received multiple calls messages  all before the stated   quiet time  began at    PM  saying we needed to quiet down  It felt like we were unable to use the space we paid for for anything other than sleep  so we ended up having to spend more time out of the rental than we would have liked to 
397047252897692266,free parking on the street and a cozy  spacious apartment keypad to enter building was broken  an alternate entrance was needed 
396350898046880872,Beautiful place  Would definitely recommend staying here
519531437345339381,I love everything about this place it was very clean and not too far from downtown I will definitely book for my next vacation I love everything about this place   it was very clean  and not to far from downtown  I will definitely book here for my next trip 
441300736381000746,This is a great place  Very spacious  great area  Well worth it  Would definitely stay again 
413040943293413397,This stay was so perfect I can t even gather words to say anything else other than that  The view from the living area was phenomenal and everything was super clean  Instructions were super clear and this stay was a dream 
426076008413753060,Great
523220426893750272,the best place I have stayed  without a doubt I will return      recommended Thanks for the stay  sorry for not writing a review  Before I had a problem with my cell phone  it would help me a lot if you write me a review too 
426056827779063557,Great location  great experience  a tad bit more communication needed   however this was a top stay  Quite   pretty much all the necessities  Never got my parking pass though because the previous tenants took it   they said they would issue a new one out   never  But awesome zencity rocks    Great location  great experience  a tad bit more communication though   however this was a top stay 
495712143604994630,Great location  bed was comfy  I would recommend that you bring everything you need  toiletries  etc   Communication was great     Many of the amenities in the listing were not there   including shampoo and a coffee maker  Also there was something beeping in the hallway all   days I was there
395581538751071169,This apartment was pretty much as described  Good location  easy street parking but not good communication with management when things went wrong  Good WiFi  a nice TV  comfy beds  but some items  blinds were broken  carpet had stains  could have been better  In all  a fine   bedroom place to stay  The carpeting was quite dirty and stained  We contacted Zencity because a light fell out of the wall and the garbage disposal did not work   we couldn t wash dishes  We spoke to a woman who told us to send photos which we did  and someone would come out  That never happened  The bathtub faucet is broken and was quite hard to turn on and regulate temperature  Great location  other amenities were good  as described except the coffee  pot  was a French press  Maybe say that 
390528063446598160,Our son loves it  We had a dinner picnic at the roof top  The apartment is clean  neat and close to the places we went 
426052579037562288,Great location and a nice little place near Lincoln square  Had all the basics that we needed during the stay and communication was quick and easy  Check in and check out process was also super easy and straightforward  Would definitely stay again Great stay  great amenities
397786923317378230,Solid
420195457411830317,The apartment is nice and in a great location  Thank you for allowing us to stay  The apartment was clean but not deep clean  the walls and floors are dirty  even a book had food droppings on one  the only oven mitt had food on it  the blinds were broken   Its over priced for the clean fees that was charged 
436923729354215640,We were already in KC and we decided to stay one extra night last minute around   pm  This was one of the cheapest options so we decided to stay here   Check in was easy for us  There was a tenant already going into the building so he let us in so I m not sure how easy hard it would have been getting into the building  Getting the key to our unit was easy  Don t use the first elevator in the lobby  The tenants told us it takes a long time and sometimes gets stuck so use the elevator past the desk area where you get the keys    When we got to the room the door was already unlocked so I don t know how well the key fob works    The space looks exactly like the pictures  What you see is what you get  It was clean for the most part  Some sticky stuff on the kitchen floor  There was no trash bag in the bathroom trash bin and they didn t have any extras under the sink  The bed was clean  We checked for bed bugs and no sign of those  This unit is nice if you need a place to sleep and you don t plan on spending any time in the unit  No extra amenities or extra effort  Just a simple plain unit with basic towels  hand soap  and the kitchen has pots and pans  No coffee maker  no tv in the bedroom  no unit guide guide to recommendations in the area    The living room is nice and cold but the bedroom gets hot  We kept the bedroom door open so air could circulate but that didn t really help  My boyfriend had to sleep on the couch because he was so hot  Bed isn t very comfortable    Overall  this is good for a last minute stay  Felt like a hotel  Remember it is an apartment complex so you will hear noise from the other units  I would stay here again as a last minute booking but if I m planning my trip in advance I would book elsewhere  Perfect for a last minute stay  Only thing is that it wasn t extremely clean  There was something sticky on the floor leading to the kitchen  No trash bag in the bathroom trash bin and I didn t see any extras under the sink  Found a small clear wrapper in the living room by the couch  Nothing major  Bedding was clean and no bed bugs so that s what matters the most  Thanks for the stay 
530482308638212189,Great location  Host was very easy to communicate with
424605836121162327,The location was amazing and close to everything  There is no designated parking but there is cheap street parking  The place itself was overall clean given our level of OCD  We did experience issues with the tub stopping up whenever showering but it was not a grand issue  Whenever I visit St  Louis  I would certainly choose to stay here again  The place was amazing and we both agreed we would choose to stay at this spot again if we ever decided to visit St  Louis again  Our only concerns were the bathroom  The tub seemed to always stop up when taking a shower and there is a delay in flushing the toilet back to back  Also  the instructions for entry into the building after business hours were slightly difficult  It stated to call the Zencity and say the code  it did not work no matter how clear we spoke   however  we had a key fob that allowed us easy access and we didn t need to call for entry  Overall  we loved the stay  Thank you 
415138348085048727,Huge space  Older building  Walls a bit beat up and could use a deep clean but for what we paid and location would stay again  Beds were comfy and clean  Highly suggest a deep clean and paint touchup  Especially on bathroom ceiling mirror 
434719203483280986,great location  great place  wonderful stay   highly recommended great location  great place  wonderful stay   highly recommended
440517837931866550,Could ve been a bit cleaner but a good place to sleep   go about your day  Would stay again  Could ve been a bit cleaner but a good place to sleep   go about your day  Bathroom near the W D had other people s hair in the tub   around the area  Nothing too crazy  Would stay again 
424563724746788442,Great place  would definitely go back  Safe part of town and the inside is very nice and up to date   Besides checking in  everything went really smooth  Comfy beds and a beautiful shower  Thank you for your stay  
413676046101827637,It was great right downtown you can see the arch and everything is      away Everything was perfect thank you   
399214111520463670,i will never stay with Zencity again 
398518966184805427,Great little spot in STL  Needed a spot to study for some training I was in the city for and this was perfect  Room was clean and spot had a very modern feel  Also some great restaurants are quite close by 
399233479072139791,Clean beautiful place  Thank you  Once again we had a wonderful stay in a Zencity property 
450692444694052861,The good  It was walking distance from City Museum  Busch Stadium  and Union Station  and the bed was comfortable   The bad  WiFi information was wrong  and I had to find the router to connect to the WiFi because it took hours for them to reply to my message  There were several little shards of glass in the shower  And this is out of their control  but the elevators were filthy  think vomit  
415194344337416028,Not bad for price Cleaners were in my room when I arrived  Rush clean  and left    minutes later  Happy with the stay generally 
547875872750906421,Great place to stay
747470672,This is our second time staying here and it s such a great space  A quiet street  minutes from the Plaza or Westport and not too long of a drive to downtown either  Slawik has put a lot of effort into eco friendly touches  you can read about them in the welcome manual    He s super fast in responding to questions  Everything worked perfectly and the layout of the space is nice for families  While I didn t have a baby with me  I would say this place was very kid friendly I saw a high chair and there is open space for playing  Beautiful front yard with lovely flowers blooming  too  Some Airbnb spaces are really  clinical  feeling but this space feels like a home away from home  Thank you again for a great visit 
747120491,This is a spacious  comfortable house    The kitchen and baths have been remodeled  while the original floors  moldings  china cabinet  fireplace  etc  have been refinished to retain original elegance    Lots of bedrooms and baths   Extra well equipped kitchen  and super soft towels   The historical neighborhood is walkable   This would be a great house for a multi generational family or group of friends    Not difficult to get to all the KC attractions   Eat at Vivilore   Hi Slawik  I really appreciate you immediately answering my phone call when I had the entry code messed up   Thanks for that  We three octogenarian ladies were very happy with the house   It was a thrill to look out the window and see Harry Trumans home   We all remember him   We made a list of pros and cons that we would like to share with you  Pros  Location Clean  Spacious Super soft bath towels Generous toiletries and TP Kitchen extra well equipped Safe neighborhood  Cons   Need safety grab bars in showers and tub  for the seniors who accompany the family  Fix the hinges on  nd floor bath room door There were no kitchen towels Robe hooks in baths would be nice  You can see these are not big problems   And I recommend this property to all my friends  even though the stairs can be deal killers for some     So  Thanks so much for letting us enjoy this property   A three generation family could really have a great time there  old house hard to make sparkling    Windows could have been cleaner  but not a bit deal 
431899797695775099,Do it  Great
413057149314509278,The place was really nice  just as expected from the pictures  The rooftop is really pretty and offers a great view  The wifi worked great as well  as I had to do some work during my stay  I also loved that they had a blue tooth speaker I could use   It looks like some others have complained about it smelling of cigarettes  although that is not the case now  it smelled normal  And it appears people have mentioned the directions to check in werent correct  which if they werent before  they were easy to follow and accurate now  No issues with either of those  The only issue I had was some of the other people staying in the building started blasting music on the roof  which is right above this unit  from about  am  am on a Friday morning  Luckily I had earplugs so easily blocked them out  But overall the place was great  Thanks for letting me stay in your place  For private feedback  the bathroom sink drains very slowly and needs to be fixed  Also the smoke alarm battery went low and started chirping  of course in the middle of the night lol  in the bedroom  I changed the battery  although was barely able to do so with how tall the ceilings are  So it may be worth changing the others if that hasn t been done recently 
431847582376697658,Great location  Clean and easy  Thank you for an easy stay 
414417996713726753,Overall i would not recommend   the place was not sufficiently clean  internet and television were not working  trip hazzards leading into the kitchen  drywall falling apart    However the location was great with some good restaurants in walking distance  Salt and smoke was the highlight of our stay We appreciated your hospitality     However  the television would not work  leading into the kitchen is a MAJOR trip Hazzard the place was not sufficiently clean pubic hairs in the shower  and a mound of dust on the vent right at front door   we absolutely loved the location  Salt and smoke was a   star    But overall from the drywall being cracked and falling apart to the floors being uneven and seperating and the trip hazzards  Unfortunately we would not stay again and would respectfully not recommend it to other travelers  With it being      for two nights we at least expected a clean environment and the internet to work so we could enjoy movies once we were done exploring the city 
547895929754217096,Nice basic place   Clean  comfortable  good WiFi  comfortable bed  affordable  and in a nice location     I would rent again  Everything was great   Thank you 
547871449033212348,If you re looking to truly get the St Louis feel  this is the Airbnb to choose  The view is amazing  the check in process is simple  the space is beautiful  Absolutely wonderful Airbnb  Everything couldn t have been more perfect 
394187719555535940,We needed a space at the last minute and this fit the bill with sale price and location which I felt were worth the value  The location is amazing  especially for a weekend in boys town and there are lots of amenities and transportation within steps of the space  We needed a space at the last minute and this fit the bill with price and location which I felt were worth the value  The location and space are great  but there could be more attention paid to detail  We were disappointed that the sheets did not fit the bed  which caused the sheets to come up while sleeping  We were given new sheets  but were in and out constantly and had no time to deal with completely changing the sheets  Upon arrival  it was difficult to get in and we had no direct contact info  Another airbnb er who had trouble as well when they got there  ended up helping us in  The outside balcony furniture was soaked and not waterproof 
397762610376669080,Definitely would recommend the stay Great place to stay  Thanks for the help with the watch 
397783155469148554,Location  Location  Location  Within walking distance of Everything  Very comfortable beds  Lots of space  Plenty of room for   couples  Also  beautiful views  Hi  thank you for stay   Parking was not great  but I understand its a big city  Please ensure someone will answer the phone  We were at the wrong bldg  tired and overwhelmed  Called for     hour    First B and B with no coffee 
431815363336356130,Solid place  Doors get stuck and could use a deep clean but definitley was not bad  The bar downstairs wasnt that loud to us  Would recommend  Thanks for letting us stay  The only concern I had was with the doors  They tend to get stuck 
423109714545926492,Great location   Clean and comfortable  This was a great location for our visit as we have family in the area   There are two L stations very close  so even if you are just exploring Chicago the location works   Access was easy   The view was awesome   We didnt use the kitchen much  but found the lack of a coffee maker made mornings a bit complicated   We look forward to using this Zencity location again 
394183680651302047,This was a beautiful apartment  central to all we wanted  Very clean   My only complaint was that we were not able to get two sets of keys as we had been promised  The management company seems to be remote and unable to address issues such as this in a timely fashion  seem to be generic responses when texting to them about the keys   Finally called and talked to the and they said they were very busy and would try to send someone to unlock the spare lockbox  That never happened  Overall a nice place to stay  but a bit annoying having to coordinate coming and going with our other group Was a bit disappointed that we were not able to get two sets of keys for the apartment as was promised
547110087230354360,Very spacious  great location  easy check in and check out  Clean  like the photos There are some broken blinds   master bedroom and living room   consider fixing those  Even sheers or something to block some street light filtering through  Inexpensive at Walmart   I know this is goofy  but the paper towel in the kitchen had very little left on the roll  I think a new roll should be placed for every stay  The bathroom needs repainting  It was freezing in the apt when we got there  Temp set at    degrees  Needed a code to adjust  I called y all on Saturday and y all fixed it remotely  very cool   but that was frustrating   if you don t have a guest that knows to call  they would not have a pleasant stay  Also  someone in the building smokes weed  The smell on arrival Friday night was staggeringly strong  I don t care what people do  but it was somewhat off putting 
415215405746283725,Really nice place  Good location Everything was good  The smell and gnats was a problem  Also the rugs had not been vaccumed since the previous guests because there were chips and crumbs left on them when we arrived 
399991461459564821,Operated by a large company remotely so any changes to your plans  such as early check in  may result in significant confusion at the actual location  Awesome location but parking IS a challenge  Staff at this location were friendly  The check in process was unnecessarily difficult due to it being handled remotely  Better communication between Zencity and the actual location would make this smoother 
409423297110927508,Great space to come back to  Plenty of room to put down a yoga mat or just move around  Convenient location as well  Hi  Great space to come back to after a long day of training  You might want to have the roof checked though  On the last day of heavy rain during our stay  water was leaking from the ceiling in the bathroom and in the room right off of the kitchen  the middle room   Another thing that would have been helpful for me would be to have a picture of all of the kitchenware cooking supplies that are included  I would have brought my own water filter had known there was none  Otherwise  great 
396327473627960383,The place is nice besides the   flights of stairs  The lock on the door is antiquated and stubborn  the keys want to stick in the lock  The bottom lock is the only one that works from the outside  Checking in was difficult and I had to call the host to get fully checked in    That being said the room was quiet  clean and inviting  There is A C and WIFI available  I would stay here again assuming they fix the check in issues  Change the check in directions and remove the second key info because there wasnt one provided for us  If passcode for door was provided at initial check in that would have been great  I called   times before someone answered even if I used the emergency line  Overall it was pretty nice 
440538009693993398,Great location and nice unit  Would stay again and enjoyed our time there  For this private note I would mention that the couch is in need of replacement  well overdue   also  the mattress was overused on one side and unpleasant for me  my partner was fine with her side  It s a nice place  and so the really cheap couch and mattress is a bit sad 
426056953825374822,Great
421670185825105485,The pictures dont do this place justice  The unit and building are amazing  The included parking made our stay easier  The refrigerator was leaking and didnt work during our stay  I reached out   times but the responses were hours later  we didnt need a refrigerator but I would recommend faster message responses 
395665839511464614,Overall great place to stay    Few comments   Only one shower towel was provided so maybe bring an extra towel or two   We couldnt figure out how to lock the front door  It was supposed to lock automatically but it never did   The bed frame is extremely squeeky  Any rolling around caused a lot of squeeking    Other than that  everything else was great  The apartment is beautiful and I would absolutely stay here again 
418117404916367636,Great place with lots of room at a good price but there were a lot of bugs  Didn t feel comfortable leaving cups uncovered because a fly or gnat would always get in my drink  It didn t bother me too much and I d stay here again  tho  There were a lot of bugs  made me feel uncomfortable leaving glasses uncovered  Everything else was great 
392753545543977280,Cockroaches  filthy stained couch  wobbly furniture  shower in first floor leaks  gnats insects were present daily in the basement bathroom  code was changed twice by Zencity without notice to me and I got locked out twice   One of the two washing machines was  not operational and both dryers were out of order during my one week stay   I reported everything to Zencity and they offered me a partial refund of the clean fee for all my troubles  I paid over        for one week    Ridiculous and worst experience Ive ever had with an AirBNB rental   In the grand scheme of things  the fact that there is no coffeemaker is not a huge deal  but pointing it out in case  any of you consider that an important part of a rental   It was more of an annoyance that there wasnt a coffee maker given all my family and I dealt with  but some people are serious about their coffee so throwing this in for good measure   Other than the location of this rental  this was really the worst apartment rental ever  and I never give bad reviews  I just dont return to products or services that Ive not been happy with but this one seriously needed to be reported   Please review the many messages I sent during my stay regarding all the issues I reported   getting locked out because the code was changed more than once without telling me  cockroaches in the apartment that I reported and no one sent to address until the day before my departure  broken  wobbly  filthy furniture  etc   Its all in my messages and in the refund request I submitted along with a detailed explanation of what I reported during my stay 
396343487468239685,Beautiful place my favorite spot was the window in the bedroom    I hope someone figures that record player out I actually enjoyed staying at this location  The only problem I had was trying to work the record player because I wanted to jam while I was cooking  But couldn t figure out how   Other then that this was the perfect stay   I forgot to take the pot off the stove And I do apologize    
434689750063584065,This apartment is located in a good area  the parking was a little tough to figure out but once we found we could park on the street behind all day that worked  Just a heads up the apartment smelled heavily of cigarettes and there is no mattress pad  The price is reasonable BUT bring a candle       Also the company absolutely cut communication once we were checked in  was definitely frustrating  After we checked in all communication was cut off between us and you  The place smelled heavily of cigarettes and there was no mattress pad  Also a little dirty
434791285825146910,The condo is very well laid out and bright  Furnishings are very nice  Bed is comfortable  Location is downtown and close to great restaurants  One grocery store downtown a few blocks away  Parkade is across the street  Gym is very good  Pool area very nice   We had several issues though     Poor communication with management  Messages sent were answered much later or not at all  If there was a crisis we would have been left in the dark      One fob provided  Needed for elevator and room of course  Very hard to plan around one fob and   people  I asked for another and they replied much later that it s not possible      Fob for parkade was fine  But a strip with barcode is provided to enter and exit parkade  Instructions only say to use at entrance and exit  Could NOT find scanner  Asked management via message  Was told to use at entrance or exit   Had to ask another vehicle leaving parkade  You in fact have to hold barcode up onto windshield  Scanner is on ceiling by exit  Impossible to see or know without being told      Bed was sloppily made  Toilet was not clean  No cleaner or brush to clean it  Floors dirty  Walls had several foot prints  hand prints  Paintings missing on walls  Lamp not working      No coffee maker or kettle in a beautiful kitchen  Asked about this and was told to feel free to use anything else in kitchen  Coffee maker would be a great plus  A toaster would be great too      Limited towels  Only one in kitchen      Huge walk in closet    hangers      Dryer sensor is not working  Dryer kept turning off and on  Condo is a great space  Here are the issues     poor communication  and delayed replies     fob with scanner was not explained as seen in text to you  Have you actually gone into parkade to see how it operates  We had to ask another vehicle for assistance  It is NOT clear      cleanliness  bed was not made well  Floors and toilet were dirty  No toilet brush or cleaner to keep it clean  Walls were covered with hand prints  Foot prints as well  Paintings or pictures missing on walls  Lamp not working      kitchen is advertised but not equipped with a kettle or coffee maker  This would have been great to have  Toaster would also be great  Why offer a kitchen      carpet was not clean or vacuumed enough      not enough kitchen cloths or towels to dry dishes      one fob for a couple   We had to plan our departures and arrivals around   fob  Not convenient at all      no hangers in closet      something wrong with dryer  possibly the sensor

415858454748237837,Great Value
397764876220943899,It was a cool space to stay overall  A couple things prevent me from giving it a higher rating      The worst part of the experience was getting into the place  The code for the keypad did not work  so we had to call the host  He tried giving us a new code  which also didnt work  We ended up having to download and register for the Igloo Home app through which we were able to use a bluetooth connection to open the lock  It was a big hassle that took half an hour to resolve  which is not something we were in the mood for after driving all day and having plans for later that evening       Air conditioning was mediocre at best  You can only turn the thermostat down to     but the apartment never reached that temperature  It was a little sticky all the time  If you like to sleep in cooler temps  you might not like this place       Some of the furniture and appliances were worn out or broken  dont expect to be able to sleep on the couch   Not a big deal  but the worst part of this is they tried to charge us for a tear in one of the duvets  The tear was already there prior to us using it  It could have been worse since there were many things there that need repair that they could have tried to blame on us 
532591835594492521,Great location and a very large space but it lacked a few things  The internet was not turned on when we arrived  the French Press had broken glass so we couldn t make coffee  we couldn t use the fireplace  and only   towels were provided  Overall the unit was okay and worth it for the location 
423132106243756441,Awesome stay   Perfect location and BEST outdoor area we have ever stayed in   Awesome stay 
450650517824039281,Exactly as advertised  clean  good location  Definitely would recommend  Thank you   We enjoyed our stay

412314167392544183,Great location for Hyde Park  Close to everything  The check in check out process was very easy and the room is clean and comfortable  Great studio space  The only problem I had is there was no blanket for the bed  only a throw  A full blanket would have been nice   Otherwise it was a great stay  Thanks
424585901090057116,Safe  Clean with views of the Arch in a beautiful historic neighborhood    Gated parking  rooftop with   hot tubs  grills  hammock and a beautiful view of the city    The neighborhood was full of historic homes  with Lafayette Park just   blocks away    Great Local restaurants within walking distance  Also  a Walgreens  and a grocery store less than   minutes away    The bed was very comfortable  and low for short people like me to get in and out of    The washer and dryer were very helpful    You will not regret staying here  We loved our stay
423875169609195172,Apartment was well located and properly stocked  There were some issues with the wifi the first couple days  but we resolved them  We had a lot of issues with the wifi  We tried resetting it multiple times with no avail  We realized the network name on the router is different than the one on the chalk board  Once we switched to that  everything was fine 
530431518001247544,Easy check in  Clean apartment  Good communication  Great location  Not much more that my family and I could ask for  Thank you for a lovely stay in your wonderful apartment 
486893499312681210,Wonderful stay Nice stay
397061465581638552,Nice place overall would suggest lyft and uber as parking is difficult
397000323617898597,If you re looking for a vibey place within walking distance  to amazing restaurants and night life this is it    The space is incredible and instantly you ll see that with the exposed brick and modern decor  The rooms were large and living room perfect for hanging out  The courtyard in front of the building was great for a morning coffee and relaxing hang    Forest Park is just    mile away so I ran every morning around the park and surrounding streets  There are fountains  trails and creeks within a mile from the Airbnb   You won t regret booking with Zencity  We loved our stay  Thanks again for everything 
438179178008529325,Sehr freundlich  hilfsbereit und eine super Unterkunft  Danke f r alles
399960529803450473,It was worth it plus great communication
464963391778048606,I could not gain door buzzer access to the apartment building to even check in to my Airbnb this company rented out  They then told me They refunded my money  But it s currently being investigated by the Airbnb resolution center as a scam  I have course have yet to see my       I have yet to get the refund for the room that I could not gain access to  The resolution center with Airbnb is currently investigating it as a scam 
423203679214939295,it was okay for a last minute stay  the blinds are broken in the living room  the window sill in the hall needs some work  the bathroom door doesnt shut right  the front door didnt lock right  their towels looked dirty glad I brought my own  and the oven looked as if it hadnt been clean in months
752875253,Great place   very cute and compact  perfect for a short stay   Easy walking distance to the little strip mall a couple blocks away which includes a Walgreens  Trader Joes  and local coffee shop   Walk a little further in the opposite direction and youre right in the heart of the UChgo campus  Go a little further north and youre close to   rd Street and Harper Court  They place was great  clean and super cute  It was a last minute rental for a friend of mine who found herself in a tight spot   The only thing she mentioned was that the toilet never flushed completely  I dont know if she had to hold the lever down longer but I do know its an older building so that could be part of it  Otherwise  she thought it was perfect
490621937306157898,Very responsive and helpful  Allow yourself extra time to find the facility when you re checking in 
429629381662184192,FOR WHEELCHAIR USERS AND THOSE WITH LIMITED MOBILITY   DO NOT STAY HERE  The elevator is not reliable  It was acting strange for the first day of our stay  running very slowly and sending us up when we had pushed to go down to the lobby  Then it broke and we could not get up to our loft when we returned the second night of our stay  After    minutes of waiting another guest was able to get ahold of someone who told us to go around the building to the back stairs  The stair access next to the elevator was not accessible  the doors in front had been chained and locked   The elevator was still broken at    am the next day when we checked out  I do not recommend for those who would have trouble using multiple flights of stairs to come and go from their airbnb 
428909576474329750,There as no hot water in the shower and they did not send anyone to check until mid afternoon the day before I checked out  There was someone else s hair smeared on the side of the shower  I had to call them to get the door passwords because they didn t email me anything in a conformation  Literally a borderline scam  Don t go here
490527119020924710,Lovely area  right by a restaurant  bar  and corner store with great wine beer selection
415945014145345918,Great  quiet and peaceful location
412282555518586891,Great location in Lincoln Park  We stayed to do DePaul college visit  Was a good way to experience a place with a college apartment feel  Was easy to get into with lock box  Everything was as expected  Good value for the area  This worked great for our visit to DePaul   We had what we needed  I will say that the pics were somewhat deceiving as the bathrooms and kitchen were more dated and weathered than the living room  Also the place could have been a bit cleaner  But it worked and we arent that picky so it was fine  I will ask to pass along to the owners that if they allowed me to stay in the place for a week for free  I would repaint the kitchen  hall  and bathrooms  as well as clean up touch up the baseboards trim for free  Im a good painter  Anyway  if they wanted a trade  Im up for it 
399906488465793565,We had an amazing time  The location was so convenient to the Plaza and everything from parking to check in were easy  Thanks for having us  it was conveniently located near the Plaza and the amenities were great  The only suggestion I have is to move the wifi closer to the middle of the apartment  we couldnt get any service in the bedroom which was inconvenient  Also recommend putting a small trashcan in the bathroom 
547166553620997671,Outside of the tv  this place is amazing  Year round I can see this a great place to be in Chicago  The view is absolutely amazing   The bedroom didn t have a tv  Kinda thru me off  Then the tv that was there did the bare minimum  At the very least add a smart tv in there so people can AirPlay off of there phone  But outside of the tv situation I d be more than happy to come back 
415899531654534857,The apartment is in a safe building with front desk services during work hours  Self check in was smooth  The apartment is clean and spacious  Furniture is sparse but largely suffices  Not too many comfortable places to sit beside the beds  theres a coach that sinks down deeply  plus two bar stools and two dining chairs   The main downside is street noise  The ambulances can get very load at odd hours  We could not sleep much in the first night  but then got adapted to the noise and werent bothered by it as much in subsequent nights  They do provide a device that generates white noise  rain sound  etc   that might drown out the street noise  We had an uneventful stay and did what we planned at St  Louis  We are grateful for having this apartment and would stay there again for vacation  Thank you for hosting us  Zencity  Thank you for hosting us  It was a smooth experience for us to stay there  A couple of minor things you might want to improve for your next guests      Upon arrival  we found that the shower tub in the master room was quite jammed up  Water would accumulate during a shower  The shower curtain in that room is very pink dirty and should be replaced  We ended up not using that bathroom      The couch seats sink down very deeply  making it quite uncomfortable to sit on  The other chairs are also uncomfortable to sit on  We ended up sitting on our beds for the most part  Consider enhancing the sitting places   These are minor issues  Street noise is a real downside  We probably would not have stayed there if we had known that it was going to be this noisy  and I did ask about the noise level before reserving the place but did not receive a straightforward answer from Zencity   This was an important factor because we were there for a serious competition event that required long hours of extreme focus concentration during the day   We would not have minded the street noise as much if we were there for vacation  but bad sleep due to street noise did cost us on a couple of competition days  If we are to return to this competition event again  we will not choose this place due to the street noise  But if we are to visit St  Louis for vacation  well definitely choose to stay there again  Thank you for hosting us 
396329590335243496,We had long stay in Zencitys apartment   The location is very good  Visitors can easily find restaurants  coffee cafe   transportation  etc  This area is also a historical district of Chicago with so many beautiful and stylish buildings over a hundred years old  People living here enjoy the peaceful and comfortable environment around   Zencitys apartment is just a kind of dwelling located in such environment   All Zencitys staffs were very positive  responsive and friendly to each inquiry  They picked up phone calls and gave feedback in short time  even in the late night   You may talk to different staff for one subject  As they had good internal communication  each of them could pick up and handle it very quickly   For next trip in Chicago  for sure  we would like to come back to Zencity again  Hi Zencity  Thanks so much to let us stay in your apartment in  R      W Division   I would suggest Zencity to provide a more detail usage guideline besides access code to guest  For instance  there are two remote controllers on the coffee table  Youd better to let the guest to know which one is to be used   Regard  Lisa
426616785531471045,Im not sure if this was just an anomaly  but my reservation was delayed an hour for clean  so I dragged my bag to a museum to kill time  When I returned  the intercom system did not work as detailed by Zen  I could not get into the building without looking like a suspicious person  and I certainly could not leave after that because I would have to rely on strangers going in and out  So I talked to Zen on the phone and the guy was very helpful  but there was only so much he could do  apparently  So I dragged my bag to a local restaurant and waited another   hours while a repair crew was supposed to remedy the problem  Nothing was changed when I returned  so I asked for a full refund and canceled the trip  Before canceling  I was supposed to have contacted AirBnB directly  which I honestly thought I had  So when I got home  I did receive a refund from Zen  but not from AirBnB  So another hour on the phone was spent with a different helpful person  but you could sense they didnt want to give me anything for all of my trouble  After persisting  I did get a full refund and a small credit toward another AirBnB in the future  Im not sure my time was worth all of this trouble  I appreciated the support I received on the phone  but ultimately I had to cancel the trip because it was far too long to wait to even get in to the building  which never happened 
434802526201771087,Very good communication and assistance
415840712069069915,awesome place key Cafe didnt work but the host were great in resolving the problem
441973090966685516,Great setup and location  You can tell that this is purely a rental property that doesnt have a devoted caretaker  There are some things that need attention  The couch is quite used and looks unclean  There are clean surfaces but underneath beds is dusty  The sink in the bathroom had a broken plug  The first check in box  to access the lobby area also took   times of me relaying the entry code to actually work  I thought I was going to get stuck in the foyer at  am  I would appreciate my clean fee back considering the state of the living areas  Pictures were sent but I received no further communication 
431851468587449196,Nice clean place  lots of movies to watch with Netflix and other apps on the T V   When I wasn t inside is was fun area downtown with many things to do  I enjoyed my time there  and would stay again     just wish parking was closer  Everything was fine 
399973998379977938,Location was great  apartment was large but sparse  Couch is broken  Disappointed that the unit wasnt that clean  used towel was left in the bathroom  couch was dirty and broken 
396998872833988746,response time was great
399895827288412005,You can expect to walk Everything was good only problem was i didnt like how far the garage was and the hallways smell like old wood
413010774728283481,This apartment was really nice and clean  Perfect for a   week stay for work  I would definitely stay again 
436934744418829221,This trip was uncomfortable and the accomodations were disappointing  The unit looked nice but still had cheap leaning furniture  The air unit needs to be fixed it blows hot air and the wifi barely works  I didnt appreciate the way the company handled the communication with us either  I would suggest renting another property  its not worth the hassle  It takes almost an hour to connect to the host  Maybe the worst rental Ive stayed at and Ive been all over with Airbnb This trip was uncomfortable and the accomodations were disappointing  The air unit needs to be fixed and the wifi barely works  I didnt appreciate the way your company handled the communication
399202222401088303,Overall  great location and great apartment to stay at  Had an issue and the host was able to fix it 
398547368157611556,Great location  Very clear instructions for check in  Clean  adorable apartment  Only downside is the parking is a few blocks away  I only have two comments  First is that the apartment smelled like smoke the whole time  either like someone had smoked in it previously or units around it were smoking  Second  in your instructions for check in  I would maybe change your wording for  when prompted  say      into the call box  to maybe  after the tone  because I was expecting a voice prompt and it took me several tries to realize there was a tone that prompted the code  Especially because it was hard to hear the tone as well   Otherwise  everything was fantastic  
442667113590963106,Could have been cleaner when we first came in but over all it was a good place to stay 
397022111505613223,Alright so I booked this a few days before moving in  Couple of key issues that prevent me from giving this spot a higher score     First  and most importantly  be warned that the bedroom does not have an AC unit  Considering that AC as listed as an amenity  this was really strange for me  Communication with the host did ensue and after A LOT of back and forths I did finally manage to get a fan for the bedroom  but it still wasnt enough for the hot Chicago summer days  So I cant really recommend this spot for the summer     The floor is pretty gross  I would probably not walk around in the apt barefoot if I were you and instead purchase sandals or slipper like I did     The kitchen doesnt really have much in it  I was there for    days so I did want to cook a few times and there were no pans large enough to cook say a decent   serving of pasta  Had to bring my own stockpot and pan from my old place  Not bad if you are just doing the basics however   frying eggs  cereal etc     Laundry is NOT in unit  you need to pay for it and to do that you need a laundry card  I personally did not get a laundry card during check in and hence had to communicate with the host once again over   days to get my hands on one  When I did  there was only   bucks in the card and no way to recharge it   I will say though this apartment has its benefits   the security is pretty solid  nice lobby and great location  plenty of closet and storage space too and a lot of living space for   to   people  you could probably fit       in here if you really wanted   Would recommend this if it wasnt spring summer and you were only staying for like     days please add an AC unit to the bedroom for future tenants
449226838853409266,Zencity had incredible customer service when I needed help with the code for the lock  An absolutely wonderful location and space  My only issue was cleanliness  seemed dusty and a little dirty but not bad  Otherwise a great stay  Would definitely recommend for the location alone  Thank you for excellent customer service   Some suggestions   Maybe a better clean service  it felt dirty when I arrived  Trash was also a hassle  but out of your control  And the carpet  blankets felt old and dirty  Otherwise a great stay 
412997150443573098,Overall  our stay was pretty good  The room was clean and was within walking distance of PNL  The only problem we had was getting access to the elevator upon arrival  The intercom system wasn t working and the only way up the elevator was to find someone in the building that had access  Once we got to the room and got the key card there were no further issues  We enjoyed our stay at your apartment  The only struggle we had was getting access to the building upon arrival  The only way to get to our room was to find someone in the lobby to let us up  Once we got into the room and got the fob  there were no further issues
439760199387659154,I was very disappointed  A couple days before checking in I had contacted the host for any possibility of checking in earlier  check in is at  pm   they didn t get back to me  So the day of check in we ended up arriving       assuming everything would be ready for us to check in  Unfortunately that wasn t the case  the receptionist informed us that she didn t have the key to the apartment  since they were still clean it inside  We received the key       mins later  Once we went inside the airbnb we expected it to be clean However   we took a look inside   it was very dusty   shower did not look clean  I would recommend if cleanliness is not top priority but location is  Also communication with the host sucks 
439778850506774876,Great home and great host Key fob for front door entrance to building did not work and also to the dumpster 
467415019118577624,Well designed  great location  Cleaning can be improved  Seems to be a consistent thing for your properties to not be as clean as described which is disappointing and concerning during COVID  We arrived two hours after check in and the cleaner had just went up to clean which delayed us even more  Compared to my first stay at one of your properties I m highly disappointed at what I ve experienced lately  Don t get me wrong they are always well designed and in a great location but the cleanliness needs improvement 
414479599700528994,City life  crowds  burnouts  first responders  Everything was good except that it was dirty  Ended up having to go to Walmart for a mop and other clean supplies  If you re not okay with the downtown life  stay away  I love the noises of the city so area was fine 
397068103111519851,OK Quit dumpster diving
397093362575612359,Good location  even though a lot of the businesses where closed  Im guessing because of Covid  Good space for the little time we actually spent inside the studio  Hi there  the studio was ok  it was accurate to what the pictures show on Airbnb but the bed was very uncomfortable  it was like a ditch in the center  Also we found some weird insects crawling in it and my girlfriend got a rash in her back and we think it was because of it  The room definitely needs to be fumigated specially since its in an old building and a lot pest tends to grow  Other than that the space was perfect for the trip since we didnt spend much time in there other than sleep 
518091794417928333,The home was beautiful and spacious  Great location in a safe neighborhood  My only recommendations are possibly to clean the rugs  We had to buy slippers cause we didn t feel comfortable walking on the rugs with our bare feet  Also maybe getting a bigger more comfortable couch  It was small and awkward to sit in  Thank you  We enjoyed your home 
439086227763761950,Our check in was terrible  the code we got to unlock the door didn t work which left us strained for    mins outside of the door  We called the host for help multiple times  no answer  I had to call Airbnb and they helped  The apartment was in a nice location and nice inside however the temp for the place was locked at     and it was above     and miserable to sleep in this summer  The tall ceilings make it extremely loud and with little conversation we still got a ridiculous noise complaint at      at night  The lack of help we got for check in  the lock not working and the building being      was not ok  The temp being set and locked at     is ridiculous especially with the big windows 
413745641378271435,Quick and easy check in and out  Cute space  Great central location   Plenty of cooking utensils in the kitchen   The hallway smoke detector is quite sensitive to the steam from the shower so if the aircon is running  keep the bathroom door closed  Otherwise  lovely space   Parking is simple enough via the parking app as long as you wake up early to set it every morning and every two hours after that   Would definitely stay here again  Thanks   It might be worth it to move the smoke detector from right in front of the bathroom door  I set it off twice by just the steam after taking a shower   Especially with the air conditioner going  the steam from the shower room is such a drastic difference that the sensor went off very quickly
467408049972170474,Nice and clean and very central  Would certainly stay there again  Everything worked just out just fine  Extending the stay and then further requesting a late checkout with the need to update access codes etc  was a challenge  We had a feeling that folks were not fully trained on the software    A nice stay   thank you 
398456253703559918,Great location  safe  clean and quiet  We will recommend to friends who travel to the area a lot for volleyball  Thank you  We loved it  Thank you so much  We will recommend  travel a lot for volleyball  Thank you   
436224164867299321,Beautiful place to stay for both short and extended trips 
426716950014785634,This was a nice space and area  the only thing is that parking is difficult I enjoyed my stay
439143165853831573,The condo had a spectacular view  the decor was very simple and modern  I plan on staying here again next time I m in Kansas City  The condo had a spectacular view  the decor was very simple and modern  I plan on staying here again next time I m in Kansas City 
395580335603637763,Apt is clean and just like pictures  Check in process was terrible and there was no communication  Apt is clean and just like pictures  Check in process was terrible and there was no communication  The instructions for getting into the apartment did not work  We had to wait at the door until a security guard walked by and let us in  There needs to be a revision of your instructions of how to get in specifically for what to enter at the intercom screen 
426073857671563145,Great nice clean place  Would recommend to anyone
397050633636888559,Location was great for a baseball trip   Building security was good    The ability to get a late check out was appreciated  Three problem areas were      Furnishings were cheap and poorly laid out   Pictures of unit  even on this e mail requesting a review  were misleading in that they show a full size sofa in living area when it really is just a small two person love seat   Unit could have easily slept six but furnishings and layout in living room did not allow   Only two people could view TV without moving furniture to accommodate   No TVs in the bedrooms      Prox card to enter and leave parking garage  did not work      The small  vacuum sweeper provided was broken and we were unable to clean up after eating in the unit     Overall the stay was good and we will consider the location again on our next visit  Location was great for a baseball trip   Building security was good    The ability to get a late check out was appreciated  Three problem areas were      Furnishings were cheap and poorly laid out   Pictures of unit  even on this e mail requesting a review  were misleading in that they show a full size sofa in living area when it really is just a small two person love seat   Unit could have easily slept six but furnishings and layout in living room did not allow   Only two people could view TV without moving furniture to accommodate   No TVs in the bedrooms      Prox card to enter and leave parking garage  did not work      The small  vacuum sweeper provided was broken and we were unable to clean up after eating in the unit     Overall the stay was good and we will consider the location again on our next visit 
454356758634030972,Wifi in the apartment needs some work  Overall it s an okay experience  Great location tho  Please consider working on your wifi  Overall it s a pleasant stay  Great location 
399269034794213762,Easy walking access to the Central West End   Off street parking was available without much of a hunt  The shower drain backed up really bad and the shower curtain was gross 
399235654801726938,This was the perfect place to stay while visiting St  Louis for the weekend  Great location  very clean  and beds were comfortable  The apartment was modern and the views of the city from the windows and rooftop area were very nice  I would definitely stay here again  The host was very accommodating and gave great instructions for checking in and out  This was the perfect place to stay while visiting St  Louis for the weekend  Great location  very clean  and beds were comfortable  I would definitely stay here again  The host was very accommodating and gave great instructions for checking in and out 
443398046798856333,Good place to stay    
454389446662874766,I would not stay with zen city if given another choice  As other reviewers noted  it s impossible to get into the building without asking for help from a resident  When we finally made it to the unit  there was no fob  We cancelled the stay at that point since we couldn t leave and reenter the building or unit easily  The check In system makes it impossible to have a relaxing stay 
422442218393374202,This place has all the basics you need for a very comfortable stay in a great neighborhood   Exceptionally clean   Easy check in   Walking distance to great restaurants and shops both in West Town Chicago Ave and Wicker Park Division   Great value 
409425912685710434,Incredibly convenient location with many opportunities for exploration  The entire apartment was clean and welcoming and a fantastic experience Zencity  thank you for an incredible stay at this location  The ease of getting there and the central location of it provided me with many opportunities for exploring 
410874141476138726,Clean living space  The check in and out process was very easy  I appreciated that there were clean supplies within the apartment to clean up after ourselves  Location is close to restaurants and tourists attractions if you don t mind      minute walks  There were many scooters as well within the area that can be used  A big plus having the parking spot as well  Had issues with the wifi  but luckily we did not need it too much  Thank you for letting us stay with you   I know the wifi issue was out of your control  but would have appreciated communication with just one person to help resolve the issue  Also there seem to have been some problems with some tenants in the building  there was some screaming and banging on doors during our stay  Thankfully things did not escalate and we were still able to enjoy our trip in St  Louis  Thank you  
400012826620599730,Really nice and conveniently located    Really nice and conveniently located   
426745430500326247,We enjoyed our stay  We enjoyed our stay 
416568466640983398,Most important parts  we really  really loved the place overall  Fantastic setting with all kinds of food nearby  lovely building  super convenient parking  And an available pool  I dont think that the pool gets nearly enough play in the review  In all honesty  I think that the listing underplays how nice the building and the location is  Very clean  very comfortable  highly recommended   That said  I want to call out the check in process  The process sent for getting in the building the first time did not work  It might have been user error  might not have been  the problem is that on a Sunday afternoon I couldnt get anyone to respond to my messages or my phone calls  We eventually managed to resolve the problem on our own  no details to protect the innocent   but this was exceedingly disappointing and needed to be remedied  we never even received an acknowledgement of our concerns   All in all  I would certainly still recommend staying there and would stay there again  but I am making this aspect of my review public in order to make sure that the owner makes the necessary changes in the future  They do so much else right that Im sure theyll work it out  There are a couple of things Im not mentioning in the main review  one garbage can was still full in the bathroom and you could probably use as many towels as you have beds  Im sure those could be remedied otherwise  and the rest of is was largely good  
415886058807333435,Awesome place  super clean  penthouse views  great game room and outdoor deck  Nice having laundry in room  Close to everything  went to Royals game  Street parking was easy during the week  Great walking spot and using the bird scooters  Great   I don t care but others may the dishwasher is broken and there was no soap shampoo  The place is awesome  Thanks for the great deal 
454258654691386875,Unique Place to stay in St Louis 
443432967843891078,Super clean with accurate check in details and fast response  I will most likely be back
416581327961207990,  Great place and people were very nice to deal with  
426714393308299006,Great value for the price point  The apartment was clean and spacious  its not the same as the one in the photos but better in my opinion  The local area felt a bit shady but easily walkable to downtown St Louis  Great to have parking too  We had a great stay  Just to let you know the key fob didnt work for building access and the instructions that were sent for building access also didnt work  We were able to use the back door  which didnt lock  but just in case that is fixed in the future 
416655351934654123,I came out for a week long trip to celebrate my birthday  The value you get is amazinng  As of July of      the amentities are open  Right off the red line where you can head to any part of the city  Amazing views  Will never forget this place 
416635764269373878,Great area and amazing
416576733433616010,Awesome place
415908939694279924,Nice space   Gated lot for parking is great   I stayed for about two weeks and really enjoyed the place and the neighborhood  Really convenient for my needs  I would recommend to others and will consider repeating my stay when in st Louis   Thanks 
490527742980248695,Good space for a minimalist  Stayed for a couple days and had all the basics 
443482267964795872,I loved this place it was really spacious Really great host easy access Great place   Really nice neighborhood 
414433681471829324,Cool place just needed some clean towels however the room was nice and clean Thanks for letting us stay   Needed clean towels
399985901218395095,We had a good stay  L train station few blocks away  groceries and bars around too and it was easy to find parking  They really need to improve the clean  floor had a lot of dust and both bathrooms had a very dirty sink  we clean before using it 
427456548384361407,Great stay  The overall stay was great  The first step of the check in process is a bit confusing as it asks you to find a code for the apartment number  but the apartment number is not on the list in the call box  I saw   other guests checking in while I was here who had the same issue  so a bit more clarity on that would be helpful  The apartment itself was great
400258213703610011,I was never able to access the unit  The kiosk that dispensed the key  was malfunctioning or the battery was low  Either way I couldn t get in  And according to the receptionist  it s common occurrence  so for ZenCity not to have a backup key with the receptionist is poor planning at best  There was no offer to compensate me for future stays although they had me in limbo until midnight  Just a horrible experience overall  I will say I ve stayed with them on previous occasions and those stays were pleasant  This was extremely inconvenient  And I believe you guys should have offered me a free stay for the inconvenience  But hey      
396389720826695251,Unless they fix what they are saying  Don t trust this company  Place was dirty  no pillow cases  just not a place or company I would use again      Coming from someone who was born in       raised in Hyde Park  Father a huge professor head of the foreign language department at U High laboratory schools  I have the email from zen city showing I was to leave the keys on the table  Since there were only Two tables in the entire  what use to be a one bedroom turned two  Normal logic would say put keys on coffee table  Which was what we did  Until that is resolved  I will not give a good  or bad review 
439837010158153200,Great location  great room  great facility  Super comfy digs  we will for sure be back next time we are in KC  Thanks for the beautiful last minute stay  We enjoyed it more than we even expected  Great location  We will def be back 
399931397756966119,This was an amazing stay  Very clean place and we had everything we needed  I would definitely stay here again 
439832218664166498,A nice little space for some time away or for a trip  Hi  Thank you so much  I do think I left my earrings on the right bedside table in the room  Is there any way I could get those  Otherwise  this was a great stay and I am so thankful   
400659522955631200,Shower drain did not work as well as toilet flushing  Brought it up with the owner and they ignored me  Also window AC couldn t keep up with the heat
400645052877102264,Great Location
423157471331079154,The unit is nice and the area is decent  some nice restaurants within walking distance    Please do not rent this unit  Our unit had   bath towel per bathroom  no shampoo soap and a dirty rag hanging in the shower     Zencity is an awful  awful management company  I requested early check in for noon  it was accepted  I got to the unit at        There was no fob in the lockbox  instructions followed perfectly  I called Zencity and messaged on the app and sent an email to their email address on their website  I spoke with a woman and she said she d call me back in five minutes  I waited   hr and    minutes and called back  A man answered  He told me he was also going to call me back in   to    minutes  Nothing  I waited until      as maybe they forgot about the early check in  Still no fob  I tried calling  and Zencity blocked my number from getting through    I used my brothers phone and got through and eventually after   hours of waiting  someone helped me    Everything negative about the unit posted in the reviews is true  The kitchen dining table chairs are not safe  they collapse if you lean back too far  The couch is ripped    These are all easily fixable things but Zencity is horrendous and doesnt care 
421641194252583850,I am writing in regards to the condition of the AirBnB that i checked into on August  rd  It has not been a good night so far   First  when i checked in they are doing construction on this floor and the smell of paint and lacquer have kept me up all night and giving me a constant headache  Second  I can send you a photo but the air conditioning is not working in this apartment   The only thing that works is the fan on the air conditioning system  Also there is a leak in the hallway pantry which is causing water to get on the floor   I want to reserve the room for a second night  but theres no way in the world I can deal with the smell I havent been able to fall asleep its just really annoying  Oh  and when i sat on the edge of the bed  the slats would come loose and i would fall through  So o wrote to see if it Is possible to extend my reservation for another night and go to a different building or unit  I then asked if it was possible to get a discount because of the inconvenience  As soon as I ask that question Ive never heard a single word back  I wrote three times asking about that and asked if it was possible to get a late check out  I got no response  And when I would try to call the customer service number I would get what sounded like a home answering machine  I called a total of    times  Every time I got the answering machine  Then when I left a message and somebody called me back and asked me to call them back  I ended up calling another twenty two times getting the answering every single time  Im sorry but this is stupid    Thank You I am writing in regards to the condition of the AirBnB that i checked into on August  rd  It has not been a good night so far   First  when i checked in they are doing construction on this floor and the smell of paint and lacquer have kept me up all night and giving me a constant headache  Second  I can send you a photo but the air conditioning is not working in this apartment   The only thing that works is the fan on the air conditioning system  Also there is a leak in the hallway pantry which is causing water to get on the floor   I want to reserve the room for a second night  but theres no way in the world I can deal with the smell I havent been able to fall asleep its just really annoying  Oh  and when i sat on the edge of the bed  the slats would come loose and i would fall through  So o wrote to see if it Is possible to extend my reservation for another night and go to a different building or unit  I then asked if it was possible to get a discount because of the inconvenience  As soon as I ask that question Ive never heard a single word back  I wrote three times asking about that and asked if it was possible to get a late check out  I got no response  And when I would try to call the customer service number I would get what sounded like a home answering machine  I called a total of    times  Every time I got the answering machine  Then when I left a message and somebody called me back and asked me to call them back  I ended up calling another twenty two times getting the answering every single time  Im sorry but this is stupid    Thank You
399939315780114074,My family came to Chicago to visit  and they had a great time at the Winchester apartments  Thank you  Zencity  for a lovely stay  Many thanks for a great stay 
416662090363689792,Thank you
412301164001711972,Our experience was consistent with the other reviews with noisy neighbors  thin walls  and not clean  It was a nice and convenient location and we felt safe in the area  The place was not ready for us when we arrived  Also the place was not clean  It was tidy  but definitely not clean  The upstairs neighbors were very nice  but crazy loud as the preschooler stomped around all day long running all over their home that loudly echoed in our space  The front door to the apartment was difficult to close and didnt lock well  The deadbolt needs fixing  The furniture quality wasnt very good nor comfortable  Other than those few things  we had a great trip 
400647400831704275,Great place to stay for a getaway close to everything It was a great Airbnb great place to stay you things need to work on the hot water in the shower and more clean Otherwise great place to stay close to everything
397840082504281121,Really great little spot not too far from downtown   Comfortable apartment and bed  Free parking is a great perk too  Would gladly stay here again if in the area  Thank you  Great spot 
423923128425323437,great communication   
488340619364288663,Good location  nice building  good furnishings  Communication tends to be a little delayed but is courteous  The building s hallways have scents pumped in which is not the host s fault  Your check out process has a flaw   in order to get out of the apartment into garage  you need the key card that is left on the counter during check out  Then you need to buzz the front desk to ask them to let you out of garage    Also  the hallway scent is too strong and seeps into the apartment  It caused a major headache 
486247050175651910,Great location and amenities  The apartment was just as pictured  The apartment was wonderful  Thanks for a great stay 
400669361732048761,N A I m writing to you regarding our recent visit to your property at     W Belmont on          Although the room was clean and as expected upon arrival  we were very quickly disappointed and upset for the remainder of our stay  We ran into a huge issue when we realized that the AC was broken  No matter what approach we took to turn it on  it remained completely shut off  This made our nights virtually unbearable  It was in the   s in Chicago and we had to try and sleep in an     degree room throughout the evening  Opening windows only made the problem worse as it didn t cool anything down and the train noises woke us up just as we were able to fall asleep    I reached out to your company to come and check out the AC unit on     in preparation for our second night  I received a response asking if someone was allowed to come in and take a look  I responded that we d be out of the room for most of the day and we re expecting someone to come take a look while we were out  However  after returning home we realized no one had been in the room and it was just as we left it  AC unit still broken   We were most upset that we were told someone would come fix the issue and no one did    This situation is unacceptable and we are planning to write about our experiences in an online review  We would consider not posting anything if you can give us some sort of refund for our stay  It s not fair for us to pay      for a room where we were only able to sleep   hours each night at the properties expense    I look forward to hearing back 
400657460028704766,The apartment was amazing  It was very clean and everything went very smoothly  I would recommend staying here when visiting Chicago  The apartment was amazing  The only issue was that it seemed the water in shower drained very slowly  Im not sure if there is a blockage but this could be an issue with multiple people staying and showering one after the other 
428012400397561187,sehr sch n eingerichtete Wohnung im Dachgeschoss mit Aufzug  Am besten  ber den Innenhof entladen  ist deutlich entspannter als auf der F hrstra e hatte ich ja schon geschrieben 
394882814839516507,This was such a great stay  Check in and out was a breeze  Zencity communicated instructions very well  Very clean and a perfect space for two  Location was amazing  everywhere we went was no more than    minutes  Lots of food  coffee  and shops nearby  Overall  very happy with everything and would absolutely stay again 
423945244996413243,Not the best check in procedure and they were not able to find a solution  It took them over   hrs to try and get us in  We were never able to check in because the keys were not in the location we were told  It took them over   hrs to figure out a solution and by then we had already made arrangements to stay elsewhere 
398489313248706311,Very nice   Looks just like listing   It was in a horrible spot in the cwe other than that it was very CLEAN   and BEAUTIFUL  Id recommend if you aren t going anywhere  I loved everything but the location  
397790279546754970,Great value  great location   Close to city and access to interstates to get anywhere   Once you figure out the electronic door codes  the apartment is great  Neighborhood is real quaint with brewery restaurant and ice cream parlor within walking distance   Safe place to park  Great place and value  Thank you
465204643969738405,Perfectly fine  Good location 
412495207845666813,Fuck this place they will still your money  They will purposely leave you in pending status for review  the minute you book another airbnb   pay for it  they will ignore your withdraw or cancellation request for booking   charge your account then send you checkin instructions   the address to the property  Key word the host here will do this directly after you cancel withdraw your booking request also   I believe airbnb helps them because there waz no withdrawal option for this host but I was able to withdraw with no problem with another host who took to long to respond    leaving me with no other option but the cancellation request   I sent a message because I thought it was odd that the withdraw request was not available   note this was all done before any acceptance  address of property   check  in information  They still took my money told me I dont get a dime back  so I paid      for two airbnb   only stayed in one of them for two days  I could have stayed home   paid my mortgage for that amount  my husband   I just had left his step dads funeral   we were sad   flustered   decided to get a airbnb for a couple of nights because we didnt want to bring that energy home to our kids  this host will fuck you with no vaselune   airbnb will help them In order to leave a review I had to enter atleast   star bur this airbnb did not deserve that  I never stayed at this property didnt go nowhere near it  They left me in pending approval status   waited until I booked   paid for another airbnb   withdrew   canceled my request to book with them to accept me   send me checkin instructions and stole my money out of my account  Airbnb helped them steal the money   the said a host has    hrs to respond to a request   thats fine but if a customer cancels or withdraws before a location or checkin instructions is provided   airbnb   the host knows that another airbnb has accepted   you are using their airbnb instead  A FULL REFUND IS A NO BRAINER   So fuck this host   airbnb the fraudulently scheme to still potential customers money   they refuse to give it back  I know I am not the only person this has happened to I can see a class action suit coming for Airbnb in the near future   I promise to be the first in line
548560127709997176,Great hotel like room located in a perfect location near everything within downtown KC  Will definitely request this place again for the future 
426790844217863241,The checkin instructions are not valid for this unit   Ava sent me a message with the instructions  but things fail on the first instruction   I immediately messaged Ava Zencity  and never got a reply   After about an hour  a clean lady in the building took mercy on me and walked me up to the unit to try the  rd instruction   That worked   Once I had the key  I could come and go as desired   The unit itself is very boutique ish   In most cases  it was very clean sterile   However  there was some kind of padding or tissue that was very wet on the nightstand   It also looks like someone kicked in the bottom of the bedroom door     Ultimately  I would stay here again if the entry instructions were updated and accurate  The checkin instructions are not valid for this unit   I messaged Ava yesterday when I tried to get in   She still hasnt replied   It took me almost an hour to get past the front door  and that was just because a clean lady decided to help me   None of the tenants were willing to assist   That hour was critical  causing me NOT to be able to attend the Negro League Museum before it closed at     The cleanliness comment   There is some kind of wet pad or tissue or something on the night stand  and there was a little bit of other clutter that looked like it had been left aside   The card key is on a lanyard  but has tore away from the lanyard and is a lost card waiting to happen   Lastly  it appears that somebody kicked in the bottom of the bedroom door 
399913968270329079,Beautiful place  The decor was gorgeous  They had amazing communication  The neighborhood was GORGEOUS  Hi  I had a really great time and loved the stay  You guys were great and the home was gorgeous  Wanted to let you know though the place was not very clean and had a really strong smell of cigarette smoke  Again  really appreciate the place and the ease of the trip 
394200795499370422,This place was so nice and cute and close to the city   Loved the stay  The only reason why I gave this stay   stars is because the intercom box was not working so we had difficulty getting in  When I tried to message the host to let them know there was no response  Also the place could have been a tad cleaner  There were stains on the rug and some of the appliances were not so clean  Other than that the beds were AMAZING BEST SLEEP OF MY LIFE  I would stay again for sure   Thanks again   Thank you so much for offering your home to us we had a great time 
399898336008164265,The apartment was nice and clean  No tv s In the bedrooms  No telephone  The host was hard to get contact with  Other that I had a peaceful stay  The Apartment was nice and clean  They didn t have no tv s in the rooms  No telephone  When it was time to check in I was having trouble the host didn t respond until hours later  For the amount of money I payed I could of got a room  Over all the stay was peaceful 
405708469591465032,Great place to stay with amazing views of the city  The check in and out were easy  The parking is sorta tricky but if you can find parking on the side of the street you are good 
402117699355986741,We absolutely loved the space and the location of the building 
423190378533633468,The apartment is very nice located in a secured complex  It s very nice with friendly staff  However if you plan on doing a lot downtown I wouldn t recommend staying here  It s about a         Uber anywhere you want to go downtown  Thank you the place and staff were wonderful 
399977018268639716,The space decor was trendy  however the overall apartment was below our expectations  The location was convenient to the train station and walking distance to plenty of coffee shops   restaurants 
454997113838977688,Great area  Rooftop is beautiful 
400650210405825045,Very clean and accommodated all of our needs while staying a week in KC  Close to all amenities and had a great pizza   Beer spot connected  I would definitely stay again or recommend a friend  The stay was excellent  Very clean and great location for our work trip  I would recommend to anyone 
413006435361978594,Great location   Comfortable apartment   Washer   dryer coin operated and wouldn t completely drain after the cycle was completed  None of the range top units were level   None of the brackets holding the heating coils didn t fit right on the drip pans  and one unit did have a support bracket at all   Had a hard time cooking as a result   The washer wasn t totally fixed   If you washed two loads the second load wouldn t drain all the water out as the tubes were half full of dirty water from the previous wash 
392674799982847237,There properties are clean  well stocked  well designed  affordable  and in great areas of the city  The staff is very responsive and professional  I will definitely stay with Zencity again 
454982640503514417,Great stay  We really enjoyed our stay  This will be my go to if available if im in town 
540610377359932149,The place was in a great spot and the people in the building were helpful with directions  I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the unit  It wasn t disgusting but definitely noticeable  Overall it was good  not great  If someone had taken the time to ensure the counters were wiped off throughly and crumbs weren t left in the drawers i would have no complaints  Really great view  The unit was not very cleanly  I there was trash left on the floor by the bed and obvious stains   mess on the counter tops  The silverware drawer has crumbs in it and there window sills also could use a wiping down  I expect a lot more especially with how high the clean fees are  These are not things i had to look hard to notice  I would highly suggest you review the process for how your cleaners are  clean  because it seems like someone came and picked up  not clean 
541329751183136283,This place was very nice  I loved the updates to the unit and that bed is heaven  I will be using Zencity going forward  Your place was very nice  I loved the updates to the unit and that bed is heaven  I will be using Zencity going forward 
421718551558078651,The location is what did it for me  it s in a neighborhood   Bed is a little noisy but that didn t bother me  Nothing luxurious but there s so much to do in Chicago why would you want to sit in your air bnb

395645893702887245,No room number posted outside of door  hard to find room  Also  the code to get in the building didn t work  Security guard had to let me in  Code to get into building didn t work  Called and messaged about issue with no communication  Security guard had to let me in  Also  room didn t have room number listed outside of door so it was hard to find 
490535574862857474,This was a great apartment and we really enjoyed our stay  There was good communication with the host and we didn t have any issues  Overall a great place to stay  Highly recommend  We loved the location and the apartment  The only issue we had was the temperature when we got there was a little warm  Otherwise we had a great stay 
439875237412618126,Such a relaxing space  Check in out was easy  the space is clean and looks just like the pictures  The bed and couch were cozy and comfy  The kitchen is pretty big and has great kitchenware  We had no issues with A C and the lighting is everything I wanted   The parking was a breeze and we felt our car was very secure  Area was on border of a nice neighborhood and felt relatively safe  The location has easy access to highways    It was a very nice stay  A suggestion I have for the kitchen is an ice cream scooper  We ended up getting pints of ice cream but had no scooper  We loved the space     
399233435954225862,We had a really nice stay  The place is beautiful  Very spacious and clean  It s also close to a lot of cool shops restaurants  within walking distance   The hosts were really good at communicating all of the pertinent information  Overall  it was an easy and pleasant exchange  Would recommend  thank you

402840000529580882,Great place to stay at  In a convenient location 
439786017508797482,Nice space  good location  comfy beds  easy parking on street  Thank you   A couple of small things that you should know   the washing machine is a bit moldy around the door seal  there is no corkscrew in the kitchen  and there were bits of trash on the floor in one bedroom and just outside the door to the apartment   Otherwise a nice stay   thank you 
412220000051434906,Enjoyed our stay and would stay again and recommend to others    Couple of things that you need to know if you re staying  Parking garage   you will come up to the  th floor of parking garage  but it is the  th floor of the apartment complex   Once in apartment complex  there are NO signs on walls explaining what room numbers are where  Took some exploring but finally found elevator and figured out we had to go down one floor and eventually found our room   Towels  there are only two full size bath towels so you will need to wash and dry the ones they provide or bring your own if you have more than two people staying   Overall  good experience and if back in STL would definitely stay here 
400731467030343198,DON T DO IT  We booked an apartment with Zencity for our    year anniversary  When we checked in  there was no fob left in the unit which allows access to the building enables the elevator  After messaging through the app  calling and waiting on hold and messaging calling through Instagram  We finally got someone to answer and we re told they would call us back  Got no call back when we were supposed to and we re forced to get a hotel room for the first night  We were told the second day at around noon that a fob was left at the front desk but when we asked the front desk  no one had been given anything  After that Zencity refused to communicate with us despite multiple phone calls and messages  The apartment was what we expected but if your trip is important  don t book with Zencity  I can t believe after leaving us without a place to stay the first night that you would continue to ignore communication attempts until after the trip was over  Terrible customer service and really surprised that you conduct business this way 
399959948292050763,This apartment is not only gorgeous  but it is also perfectly placed near The Plaza   We walked everywhere except to the Power and Light district  and to a bookstore bar that we found   The apartment complex is upscale and well maintained   There was a lot of thought put into the construction as well as the apartment itself  Tom and I had a fantastic stay in Kansas City   The apartment was beautiful and well maintained   A few things we lacked were  seating on the porch  especially for the evening time   some extra decorative useful blankets in the living room  Tom likes a colder temp than I do  and a blanket would have been perfect   a wine bottle opener  we did bring ours   and some tips suggestions for places to eat  visit  etc   Although we have been to KC many times  having a locals insight would be helpful     One question  where did you get the pillows   We absolutely loved them   Thank you for hosting us 
446961481308115528,This apartment needed a lot of repair  I d call it a fixer upper   It was very disappointing and we did not stay  not even one night   The cleanliness of this apt was very bad  Grime on doors and shelving  hair along the hall floor and baseboards  crumbs and dirt on the kitchen floor  fingerprints and smudges on the mirrored side table and glass coffee table  The large rug looked worn and stained and the venting in the bedroom was thick with dust  lint and sticky grime   No pride in this apartment   The walls showed wear and tear  ceiling was damaged  had stress cracks and the paint was sloppy  thick  gunky  caked on and chipped in places   Ceiling  light over table had three of  five working bulbs  Entrance way and another light fixture also had missing or non working bulbs  Electric light switch in hall did not completely covered the hole housing the electrical wiring   a gap between plaster and hole   The inside front door knob and lock also was ill fitted  and did not make one feel secure  In addition  there were three different doors gate to enter the apt  This was very cumbersome and would require two hands  The directions to entry gate did not include the first code at all   The instructions also directed guest to walk  up  the steps which was on east side of building  when they should have said walk  down  the steps   the west side of the building    The balcony looked appealing but the doors to access were so heavy making it difficult to open  Also there was a bad smell ruminating from below the pool looked to be the color green   algae   I sent many pictures to the the host in hopes of receiving a total refund  To this date I have only received about a third of it   My husband would have preferred to sleep in our car rather than to stay at this Airbnb  We checked into a holiday inn and the next day found another Airbnb  Very disappointing  Unable to stay at this Airbnb   The apt needed a lot of attention  Cleanliness was very poor  grime  hair along floor and baseboards  crumbs on kitchen floor  stains on surfaces  dust  noticeable finger marks and prints on side and coffee table  soiled carpet  venting in bedroom  thick with dust  lint  sticky grime   This apt needed a lot of repair  No pride in this apt  Walls were damaged  ceiling had stress cracks  paint was gunky and sloppy   many places were marred and chipped   Ceiling lights had missing bulbs or light bulbs were burned out    Three codes for three different doors gate required to get into this apt  Very cumbersome  Host had to troubleshoot problems over the phone to guide us into entry  Instructions to access apt were not accurate  no code for gate  directions to first gate were incorrect   The balcony looked appealing but the patio door was heavy and difficult to push open  There was a bad smell from the pool directly under the balcony and the pool looked to be green  maybe algae   I sent many pictures to the host in hopes to obtain a total refund   We simply could not stay at this Airbnb  My husband and would have preferred to have slept in our car  instead  we found a hotel room and then another Airbnb  This place needs a lot of attention and repair 
414437336579951050,Plenty of space  simple but tasteful interior design  comfortable couch and TV area  plenty of natural sunlight 
423188199130559957,The place was very nice   clean  Beds were comfortable  But the customer service part was horrible  We got locked out multiple times  had to wait outside for over   hours to wait for someone to bring up a keypad to back into the building  Other then that everything was great  Please work on communication with customers  we waited for   plus hours  to hear something back from Someone  Also we were locked out of our Airbnb multiple times   had to set outside with our children   had to wait over an hour for someone to drop off a key pad to get in the building 
426745038575969516,We stayed for a week and appreciated the ease of entry  the air conditioning  and the location    The kitchen was clean  although we did not cook while we were there    We had the following issues with the place     Bed broke when we sat on it   wifi went out for two days  meaning we could not work there  it was a work trip    when I sent several notes asking for wifi to be restored  they were ignored     Overhead Lights flickered in bedrooms and kitchens  and light switches in bathroom worked only sporadically   When someone came to fix  they said theyd need to send someone else  no one else came   Lights were never fixed     The coffee table was completely broken   the shower curtain in the bathroom is filthy  there is grime on the walls in the bathroom  I notified them about all these things   The bed was fixed quickly but no other items were addressed  Hi there   We stayed for a week and appreciated the ease of entry  the air conditioning  and the location    We had the following issues with the place     Bed broke when we sat on it   wifi went out for two days    when I sent several notes asking for wifi to be restored  they were left unread     Overhead Lights flickered in bedrooms and kitchens  and light switches in bathroom worked only sporadically   When someone came to fix  they said theyd need to send someone else  no one else came   Lights were never fixed     The coffee table was completely broken   the shower curtain in the bathroom is filthy  there is grime on the walls in the bathroom  I notified you about all these things   The bed was fixed quickly but no other items were addressed

467367584614116938,Very nice and updated Conveniently located  The washer does not work correctly and the bed is squeaky  other than that it was a very nice stay 
473175746462350992,The location of the property is ideal but it is in an old building that needs a lot of maintenance  If you are someone to whom cleanliness is important  this is NOT an option for you  The attention and communication with the hosts was bad and slow  The attention and service was not as desired and an important message was never answered  The property was not clean  the kitchen and living room floors were sticky the day we arrived and some of the windows  including the main bathroom  had cobwebs on them 
745045617,Great host  very good communication  and great location
455033539154498642,Great little studio to rent and spend time in   Lots of natural light   We had a small problem with the check in code and the hosts responded to our call after   pm and had it resolved in no time 
544192110680301193,I love it hereeeee can t wait to be back  Thank you  It was one my favorite stays of all time  The only issues I had were getting locked out by the code expiring and then it taking an hour for someone to respond but it wasn t so bad  I had good company to wait with  Other than that y all were very responsive and kind and welcoming and I love the space    thank you  
399964036620214821,Fantastic location with great views and amenities  We really enjoyed sitting on the balcony having coffee in the morning and enjoying all the nearby neighborhood shopping restaurants  The only suggestion we would have is to clean the floors better  Thanks for a great weekend get away  I tried to fix the sink in the bathroom  You need a new aerator to fix it  The bathroom sink also didn t drain well  You are missing salt and pepper  The floors were dirty and and the bed comforter had a large crusty stain on it  The unit top to bottom needs a few clean  Other than that we really like the unit and it s location 
401365928517326924,BJC TRAVEL NURSES PERFECTION   perfect studio  comfy bed  and location is just perfect to walk to the hospital  host was responsive and place had everything i needed  THANK you for the stay    i gave   STARS   would def recommend a closer look when clean between guest  toenail clipping were between bed and side table  hair in the sink  WAS an enjoyable stay and i loved it  thanks for allowing me to stay

422442816112062100,Everything was perfect except the keypad for entry was malfunctioning and I had to wait for someone to let me in who lived in the building  Everything else was spectacular  The unit was gorgeous  modern  and clean  It was very upscale  Your directions for check in on the keypad did not include having to hit the button with a bell on it  And the keypad was malfunctioning in general 
440595079790199512,We enjoyed a full week at this location  It is a beautiful apartment in a lovely residential neighborhood with nearby bar  restaurants  and wine shop   The shared living spaces have large windows with lots of natural light  The beds are so cozy and comfortable  There is a generous supply of bed sheets and towels  We really appreciated having use of a washer dryer  as well   The internet worked great  Please note  the apartment is located above a busy restaurant that is open every evening  The closest L train stop is about a    minute walk from the apartment  Hi Zencity  we enjoyed our week at the Wrightwood location  Its a lovely space with beautiful windows and natural light  The beds are super comfortable  Great neighborhood    A few suggestions     the listing description does not state it is above a busy restaurant  It was noisy with restaurant patrons and music till about          pm every day      All of the ceiling fans have broken or unreachable chains in order to control the light or fan speed  The ceiling fan in the living room has no obvious power source  it can not be turned off at all      Stove  the   right burners do not light      The description states  work space  but the table is so small it can only hold one laptop  It doesnt have space for anything else  The dining room is so spacious and it could easily accommodate a   top dining table  Please consider providing a slightly larger dining table  Its a   bdrm apartment but there are only   chairs for the dining table      Please consider adding one full length mirror in one of the rooms  There is only one small bathroom mirror in the whole place 
755586979,Slawik was an outstanding host with an spectacular home  I highly recommend this place  This place has so much history  you will love it   Thanks again Slawik  Thank you so much Slawik  My team and I fell in love with your house  We all had a great time   Just one side note  we ran the dishwasher again the night after we advice you  and it leaked water again  I would hate the water to ruin those beautiful floors   Thanks again  Moises
490530066485791228,Location was good  Check in was good  Place was so dirty and gross  But honestly was an easy stay 
400703294609988322,Great location for exploring St  Louis for a short trip  Cute little place for a couple or a set of friends 
443404215284026783,Great little place to stay  Only downfall I had was no available onsite parking 
455076435098328725,Very clean and bright apartment  Check in was very easy and the apartment was exactly as pictured  We were able to find super close free parking everyday 
439822503039570453,My husband and I loved our stay here  The apartment was cute and clean and had everything we needed for our   night stay  The rooftop was incredible  What a view and such a relaxing place to hang out  Also  we felt super safe with the gated parking  lots of security cameras and key fob entry to the building and code entry to the apartment  We were so close to everything we wanted to do in the city  Maybe a    minute drive  tops  And only    minutes to Six Flags  It couldn t have been easier to find just off I     There was a neighborhood grocery store and a Walgreens just around the corner  and we walked to Square One Brewery  which also had amazing food  nachos  spinach dip  crab cake sliders  steak   frites  which was only a block away a couple of times  We also walked to SqWires for breakfast one morning  They had awesome breakfast sandwiches and the breakfast potatoes were heaven  There was also a cute date night restaurant a couple blocks away that we walked to called Polite Society  It was delicious  All in all we had a wonderful trip and I would totally recommend staying here  Thank you for a wonderful stay in St Louis  The only issue we had was the key fob did not unlock the front door to the main building  That wasn t a problem though because we just came in from the side parking lot door instead  We loved our stay and would absolutely return again and recommend you to everyone 
399943378813863789,The location of the apartment is fantastic  Forest Park  the jewel of the city  is across the street and the neighborhood has great places to eat or have coffee  Also there is a Whole Foods about     feet away  The Central West End  is fabulous  The apartment is simple but clean  The building has wonderful security and everyone was very nice and helpful  Thank you very much  The stay was very comfortable and the location was ideal  My only complaint was the repair man who was let in to the apartment without any prior and while I was not there  I walked in to the complex and doorman told me there was a repair man fixing something from a prior guest request  Also the outlet in the bedroom was dangerously loose  Other than that everything was great
401385574621527100,Overall a truly great space and we would stay here again   A good value and just a few minutes walk from the historic Lafayette Square   Very modern and sleek design to the interior   Check in was keyless and very efficient   Communication with the company was very quick   The area and the building feel quite safe   Our only critiques were quite small and easily remedied   The signage in the hallway can be improved   Also  we were surprised to find no dish soap in the kitchen nor any body soap body wash in the bathroom   I suspect that these are usually provided but that they simply forgot to restock or something  Overall we truly enjoyed the space but there were a few small recommendations that are easily fixed by you   First  the signage on the ground floor could be improved   We got quite lost when first arriving and took a couple of false turns   Some of those small hallway turns are unlabelled  requiring one to have to backtrack once youve discovered that you made a wrong turn   Also  there was no dish soap in the sink nor body wash body soap of any kind in the bathroom   Also  while we were very happy to find a French press in the kitchen  we were surprised to find that there was no coffee provided  Lastly  the design of the bathroom sink is quite bad and truly needs to be fixed   It is somewhat hard to describe without a photo  but basically the actual spout itself is so short that when you use the water to wash your hands  large amounts of water spill all over the counter   Most of these recommendations are all easy fixes but the last one would of course require an actual changing of the sink hardware 
404288193811678458,Expect to be amazed This was a great place to stay had everything you could ask for  I would stay here again when I come visit again
404257521184000286,Good stay for us  but I  immediately noticed crumbs on the floor and couch  makes me question the clean standards Overall good stay for us  but I  immediately noticed crumbs on the floor and couch  makes me question the clean standards
401459322736006025,This was by far the worst experience I have ever had when trying to book a property  I have actually booked with Zencity several times and have had great experiences  There properties are normally in great areas  clean  well designed  and the staff is normally nice  professional  and responsive  But this time was nothing like that  I can t say much about the property itself except that the parking situation is horrible  I can t speak about the unit because I never saw it  I booked the property the same morning as check in  I requested an early check in  This request was ignored  Around   o clock when I still had not heard anything about my booking  I called them  I spoke with Andrea  she should honestly find a different profession because hospitality is not her thing  she advised that my booking was just then being reviewed and approved my stay  I received a confirmation email  my card was charged  Upon reviewing the confrontation email I found that there was not any check in instructions  I called back and spoke with Andrea again and she advised that check in instructions are computer generated and that I would have to just wait until that happened  Mind you it is after   o clock  When I expressed my displeasure with having to wait and not being provided a proper time expectation  she told me that the delay was my fault for waiting so late to book  as tho the booking I made that morning never happened  not one time during my interaction with her did I get an apology for anything  I then wait an hr in     degree weather with no response or check in instructions  I then call back and I m advised that the property has been double booked and there were no other properties available for me  I then tell Andra that this posses a huge problem for me because I used my last bit of available money to book this property and did not have the means to book another property while waiting on a refund from them  She offers no solution other than assuring that I will get a full refund  At this point communication between her and I completely breaks down  Which is then followed up with a note from her expressing how upset she was by my word choice and tone during our last conversation  Again  no empathy  apology  or real solution to my problem  I get a lecture  Fortunately  I was able to speak with Airbnb and they provided excellent service  I was issued a coupon to cover that nights stay at a different property  So around   that evening I was able to check in  relax  and forget about the anything but Zen experience  Andrea needs better training  She lacks empathy and comes across as robotic

449962003973810698,The location is perfect  walkable bars  restaurants  shops  Nice inside  Did have difficulty getting in  as we weren t sent the code ahead of time and couldn t get ahold of anyone for over an hour  Aside from that all was great  FYI there is a home monitoring device  Place was great  Just FYI  one bathroom sink doesn t drain  We also felt like the home monitoring device should be disclosed 
487636564892545568,This place was amazing  The cleanliness and proximity to everything was beyond of expectations  Thank you for everything Thank you for an amazing stay  We very much enjoyed the proximity to everything and the readiness of the apartment 
427454081251080479,I will never book w  Zencity again after this TERRIBLE experience  FIRST OFF  was given wrong check in instructions so I was not able to gain access to the building  Called customer support which then they told me to ask someone nearby to let us in   already looking sketch  The man who let us in was a  maintenance man  with no badge or uniform  This same  maintenance man  was ironically going to OUR room   His purpose was unclear b c we were told the room would be accessible after   and this was after       He said it was  just to checkout the room  and his English was hard to understand   Meanwhile he was speaking Spanish on the phone with someone else the entire time  We approached the room to find that it was NOT Securely locked and cracked open      We knocked  I closed it and then put in our code to make sure this was our right room     It was and when we entered  IT WAS NOT EVEN THE ROOM PICTURED  the soap was knocked over on the island  sunglasses on the table  NO KEY FOB for building and garage access  The  maintenance man  just did a lap  flushed the toilet    and asked us if we were good with it all while still speaking Spanish and what seemed to be reporting to someone on the phone  I was not okay with what was going on and my girlfriend and I were pretty sketched out at the whole situation  We went back to the lobby   played phone message tag with a Zencity rep for about    min and they had no explanation for really anything  The concierge at the front office of the apartment was not surprised that we were having such trouble w  Zencity   their building  After being told that they had no other rooms available  AKA the room we originally booked  and after I figured out the room lock malfunction that was causing the door to not completely lock unless held tightly while lock was automatically locking  I felt safe enough to stay here but later regretted this choice after discovering how dirty the place actually was   Hair   debris all over the carpet and dirty surfaces   BUT WAIT THERE S MORE   Next day they also tried to charge me     for a WASHCLOTH that WE left behind because it had makeup stains on it       this whole company is a joke and everyone who had anything to do with our room should be fired 
404301777760039531,Great host  Amazing communication and beautiful space Thank you for the amazing stay
404272289987139269,Highly recommend staying here  very clean and owner responds to inquiries in a timely manner  Friendly and approachable  Enjoyed the hospitality  Wonderful place to have spent in STL

530417886358370819,Really nice place and view  Great location  Would recommend 
455074113056979035,This Airbnb is a pretty good value for what you re paying  It is situated in a beautiful neighborhood which was also super close to a bunch of little shops  restaurants  and bars which we walked to each night we stayed    The kitchen also comes equipped with basic cooking utensils  so you don t necessarily have to eat out every night so long as you bring food  The curtains in the bedroom could be done a little better  One was too long and dragged the ground it also looked cheap and portly secured to the wall  As well  the closet door in the bedroom had immediately come off of it s tracks  because they were extremely old and shoddy  which we had to fit back into the frame    In the bathroom  there was only one shower curtain to use meaning it had to be tucked within the bathtub to prevent a massive amount of water from pooling in the bathroom while showering  It could benefit from having another curtain fixed in place with the existing one so the inside layer can stay within the tub and the outside can still appear neat and orderly    The air conditioner was set so you couldn t put it lower than     The bedroom ended up being a few degrees hotter during the night than the rest of the house which made the sleep a little restless    Overall  we really enjoyed the Airbnb given that we were really in St  Louis to see the city  not judge the housing  However  that s not to say the housing shouldn t be good too 
394171449702693995,Very cute studio apartment and very clean with updated fixtures  Great location and on street parking was free and wasn t much a hassle to find a spot  The building was very secure and quiet  There is a very cute restaurant downstairs in the building that is great for a nightcap  We enjoyed our stay at Zencity  The unit was very clean and we loved the security of the building   The only problem was the Trash room that was right next door to the suite  The smell was really bad and we were able to smell it in the suite which was a little frustrating  Not sure if that was something others have noticed but the smell was in the whole hallway 
417317806232408571,This is great you  just have to pay for parking
452367761874978508,I wish I could leave   stars  You can t get into the building without someone walking out  The place wasn t clean when I got there and it honestly looked like someone else was staying there  Dirty tampons in the trash can  beds very recently slept in  wet dirty towels on the floor  there was even a knife out on the counter  The host didn t keep in touch with me and was very unhelpful with my problems  Do not book here   If I could leave   stars I would  Instructions to get into the building weren t accurate  The place was a mess and disgusting  And the communication with the host was terrible  Thanks for making it a terrible experience
439853358833202486,the place is really clean and accurate to the post  it would have been perfect  But  they have a fob you need to easily get in and out of the building and to use the pool  gym  and parking lot  For my stay I couldnt find the fob anywhere in the apartment  I texted and when that got no response  I called to let them know  Zencity said they would bring me one and never did  So  its nice but you may or may not be able to use the amenadies you pay for 
417340681801336324,Beautiful  and so close to everything  We absolutely LOVED the place  We do want to recommend the you get some of the lightbulbs changed that have gone out  Also  it could use pot holders and or kitchen towels  we had to use the bathroom towels  and a rug in the bathroom for getting out of the tub  Otherwise  the place was perfect  Well be back 
490620791844942825,Great location for the price  Would recommend  Great experience  thank you 
417336270836930299,Great unit and service as always   Zen City has the most comfortable bed and sheets Ive ever slept on 
468079111313575892,Amazing stay Amazing
467340145227224643,Almost perfect  just the building door code from the instructions was wrong  so we had to ask other people going in and out  thanks for the stay  just the building door code was wrong and we had to ask other people going in and out
399768053679975236,The location of the apartment is great  but because the apartment is right next to the street  it was very noisy at night  which is why we didn t sleep well  The apartment is good  The only thing we are not satisfied with  a red flag  is the noise  Two of the three bedrooms are facing the street and there was the loud noise of vehicles for the whole night  so we didn t sleep well 
427440576657881523,Great stay  Thanks 
756641864,Close to downtown Independence and only    minutes from KC   This place is perfect for a large group and has plenty of space for people to have their own space but also plenty of milling spaces outdoor and indoor  Lovely lovely place  Only thing that could be improved was more art  The empty nails on the walls were useful for my decorating purposes but otherwise are a missed opportunity to be the icing on the cake   oh also the bathtub on the top floor only seemed to get hot water to the tap 
424615595413076909,Great location  Nice accommodations  Would definitely stay there again  Coffee pot had coffee in it and oven pad was dirty otherwise house was clean  Supplies were well stocked  Could have used a trash can in the bathroom  Maybe a couple more chairs for the kitchen table  We had a great stay  Very close to my daughter who we were visiting  Bed was comfortable and neighbors were nice  Would stay here again in future trips 
417306791712396508,Perfect location  Quiet evenings even being next to the train  Easy check in and check out 
416589545654306252,Rooms were clean  but no daylight coming in from outside  Below ground level  Lots of noise from upstairs neighbors especially when they do wash and walk around  Kitchen nice  The rooms were nice   but the noise from upstairs neighbors was loud  especially in morning  Very loud when they did wash  Wish space was not on ground level because no light coming in  Lock box was very difficult to open 
402039578505757413,awesome place
397795003897127846,Nice place to stay will be coming back Thanks I will be coming back beautiful place
528317262428449015,The best thing about this listing is its location  there is a Starbucks right downstairs and several good restaurants within walking distance  the apartment itself is pretty nice  though the furniture is bare minimum and the floor squeaks but we didnt mind that  this one serves as a perfect base camp to explore Chicago  the main problem with this listing is the inaccurate checkin instructions  the photo they send with the instructions do not match the actual listing  as such  even through we reached the correct location as per Google maps  we were left to walk around the block several times searching for any building matching the photo  Eventually  I called the host and after several minutes  we were able to figure out the right apartment   note to others  it is a glass door with the number            not a metal door as shown in the photo  and has a lockbox on the right side of that door  there is a nail protruding from the floor in one of the bedroom  this can lead to nasty injuries 
414488845096480414,A true disappointment     First off  the building staff were absolutely wonderful  The ladies at the front desk were so kind and delightful  truly wonderful people  I do not believe they are associated with Zencity   I really dont like writing bad reviews  Ive had Airbnbs in several countries  as well as having stayed in Chicago a handful of times  and Ive never had a bad experience enough to warrant a negative review  That being said     Check in was not smooth at all  We were told a  PM check in  and by      the place was still unavailable due to being clean  The place is tiny so I cant imagine it took that long to do     The apartment was missing toiletries and basic kitchen items  where was the salt or pepper    No body wash or shampoo outside of liquid hand soap  Yes  we should have packed our own  that one is on me  BUT still kind of took us by surprise    We found a porn DVD between the couch cushions  Im not a prude by any means  but come on guys    if this place was  being clean  for an hour and a half  Id imagine the couch should have at least been looked at   The  what I assume used to be  white rugs in the living and bed room were stained  as were the decorative pillows on the sofa  The shower had hair on the walls before we got in  It just did not feel clean at all  especially considering the high clean fee Im paying     Parking was a nightmare during the weekend  but once you found a spot it wasnt too bad of a walk  Expect to pay      day if you stay at the lot to the south east  and know you wont be able to take the car out from   PM  AM   At the end of the day  this apartment had all the charm of a lousy hotel room  but without the amenities like getting more than   towels  access to toiletries  or coffee  and costing much more  Just did not feel cozy or particularly well looked after   The view was nice  Check in was a mess  the upholstery around the apartment was filthy and in need of urgent clean or replacing  and we were caught off guard by the lack of basic kitchen ingredients or toiletries  It was a real disappointment 
417324769094986680,Good stay
398486305384305542,Awesome place  great locale right on the streetcar line  Your place is great  Loved the location  the view  super comfy beds  loved that you have Netflix and Disney   and your place is just lovely in general  Great amenities too   Only thing you may want to know about  but idk that it would deter us from staying from you again is that your rugs need to be vacuumed  lots of hair and debris on them  And the double sinks in the bathroom are extremely slow to drain and one is leaky  Thank you for a great stay   
395601899326181447,Amazing apartment in a great location  We can t wait to come back Thank you so much for everything  Your apartment is beautiful and we can t wait to come back  Only issue we had was the lockbox getting stuck when get got there to check in  but the lady at the front desk was very helpful and got it open for us  Everything else was perfect
432624707111812560,Great trip 
547796632309778362,Arrived at  pm and unit wasn t clean had to wait until     pm until housekeeping was done asked for a late check out at   pm instead of   am and was asked for     more dollars when I was inconvenienced at check in time   Kinda unfair in my opinion the place was kinda cold with the AC unit in the window being for heat as well  unit was clean and building was secure but I wouldn t stay here again though  I don t think it was fair I was asked for     for an extra hour at check out when housekeeping didn t finish clean until      on check in day and the unit was very cold 
432602209755742039,it was great
415133868696229190,Great downtown place to stay  Walking distance to just about anything you could think to do  The river market on Saturday s is fantastic and there are great places to eat  Also plenty of night life activities close by that are within walking distance so you don t have to drive  Everything was great  Thank you for the nice place to stay while I was showing a friend the city 
429636322940460099,Wonderful views   The apartment was awesome but we were never able to use the parking garage  The fob wouldnt work for us   FYI  But  there was plenty of street parking  Wonderful place 
417362899097294112,Great location  Bed was super comfy and host was amazing with fast responses  Will definitely book again  Thank you my stay was amazing  
417348368050152266,Great
401400623530607571,The studio was great for my business trip and the parking space will come in handy if you travel around KC  The weather played havoc on my travel  Thank you for the understanding  When my pass code was faulty the remedy was quick after a phone call 
452805811701115151,Great  clean place  Recommend to anybody  it s a super cute space 
399233961911101251,Beautiful and easy spot to shop  Loved staying here and getting a feel for KC  will definitely be working with Zencity again  
401416630651037598,A nice  clean apartment with good space and comfortable beds   The kitchen is VERY sparsely equipped but  if you dont need to use a kitchen  this would be a good place to stay and far preferable to a hotel  The unit was decent and as advertised  however there were several problems        The kitchen was woefully under equipped   There was no coffee maker  there was a coffee grinder   dont know what to do with that   there were   forks  a few knives and a handful of spoons  most of which were demi tasse spoons  not particularly useful    There were three of us staying there   We wouldnt have been able to make a meal there  or serve it  with the equipment provided   We also had to go out and buy a sponge and towel to wash the few dishes we did use   Interestingly enough  we were provided with a mitten shaped cookie cutter and an offset spatula   Flatware would have been far preferable       The bathroom tub was treacherously slippery   I think that might be a real problem for someone and a potential lawsuit in the making       The only other complaint is a small one   the floors were unbelievably creaky   Yes  I know  it is an old building and they are old floors   They were  wake one from a dead sleep  loud though   Once again  that is just a small complaint and one that probably has no solution    We did find the apartment clean  the beds comfortable  and the space easy to use   The directions for entry were confusing to read  there were several different codes for the main door  but we had no trouble getting in   In spite of the complaints  I would stay there again   I would just be prepared to know that the kitchen was fairly unusable 
399957204863189338,Not many complaints but if you leave anything here  don t expect them to be able to find it  It ll most likely get stolen by someone lmao
415884928544804641,Place is nice  just double check all check in info is actuate and updated  Couple times I have check in delay  Check in process and respond could be better
468119478339329183,Great location Thank you for giving me somewhere to be close to my daughter when she needed it 
445614021858764340,Cool spot in the perfect location 
427442244074897881,The location is excellent 
473145430756853232,The place was in a good location and the surrounding units were quiet  Overall a great visit  The place was exactly what we needed  thanks 
415845679485628490,I am really disappointed with my experience at this place  From a quick glance  everything seems updated and modern in the building and unit but when looking closer this place is definitely having some serious issues  I have listed some of my concerns below      The overwhelming smell of sewage was present in our unit as well as in other parts of the building  It seemed to be coming from either the bathroom or laundry room or even both  There is something seriously wrong with it  We tried closing two of the doors to the laundry unit and it didnt help  This was definitely the worst part of our stay      The communication regarding the sewage issue wasnt the best  We wrote in to notify them of this and they offered to have the clean crew come again but it wasnt an issue of clean but of the piping and drains in the unit  They didnt accept any responsibility for this and said it was the building maintenances responsibility  However  if you are renting out a unit I believe its YOUR responsibility to ensure that the standards are acceptable   We stayed there from Friday to Tuesday and the awful smell never went away      The keypad on the door to the suite was a little difficult  The code was pretty long and even when entering the code correctly and pressing the lock icon sometimes the door wouldnt open    From a positive perspective  I really liked the location of the building its only a few minutes away from some great restaurants such as Vin de Set and Little Fox  The key fob made it really convenient to access the parking lot and entry into the building  The unit had some stylish touches and was updated 
420291229815867062,Great place  clean and in an awesome location  All that the posting said it was  The location was awesome  in the same building the daughter I was visiting lives in total luck    The only  things I had a problem with were that the blinds were in bad shape and were all a lot of the windows had  so not being able to close them all the way was a bummer   The other thing was that the toilet seat was detached on one side so it slid around on the top of the bowl a lot  DOH       Finally  it was a bit pricey for what it was compared to other places I was looking at  or had stayed at in the Chicago area  But then again  the same building as my daughter 
424601872786871448,Lovely little apartment   We had a bit of trouble finding the key to check in but the folks at Zencity were very responsive   I would definitely stay here again   I ll note though that it is best for four or fewer people  not     the couch is really uncomfortable and not suitable for sleeping    Also walls are THIN   We heard everything from the upstairs neighbors pipes  walking  etc   And likewise received noise complaints when we were talking at a conversational volume and playing music at a low level   So I would stay here again as a home base  but not if I actually needed somewhere to hang out for awhile with friends 
452815089270963123,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE   NO AIR CONDITION    Unfortunately  I would have rated this apt   stars  but I had no AC from day one   the apt stayed at     I called and messaged Zencity for all   days  but nothing was ever done  They would always tell me they would message or call me back with info about someone coming to fix the air  but never did  Beautiful home and amazing location   but very risky to stay here with how their customer service is  Beautiful home  but with no AC   poor communication on how to get the AC fixed was very frustrating  I worked most of the days  but coming home to sleep in a hot apt was horrible  I called multiple times and left multiple messages from day one but never got a response  I hope I can be refunded something for this experience
427477402132020319,The  WiFi didn t work The  WiFi didn t work
421664724128159652,The bad first  in case you dont read all of it   A parking pass was left in the room  to be used in the garage across the street  We were advised to scan the pass to enter and exit the garage  We looked carefully upon entering  and did not see a place to scan  so we took the ticket and parked  We looked at the machine which takes payment on exiting and saw no where to scan anything  We then reached out the Zencity and Airbnb at least seven times over the next three days to help us understand before we checked out  They did not answer text  answered e mail once with no help  and answered a call once but were unable to help   We paid     to exit the garage   Floors were not super clean  toilet seat was about to fall off  potential safety problem   and a floor lamp in the living room began flashing on and off  safety problem also  we unplugged it   Good   Very good location  two blocks from streetcar and one and a half blocks from Power and Light district    Small pool and nice seating area on rooftop   Roomy  bed was comfortable enough  nice bathroom and large closet  useable kitchen area with very few kitchen items   no coffee maker  no toaster     The view wasnt excellent  but the building was very quiet  After reaching out to you at least seven times to understand how to use the parking pass in the garage  we paid     to exit the garage on the last day of our stay   The parking pass was a small  laminated rectangular piece of paper  and there was no place to scan it on the machine entering or exiting the garage   So  maybe you should not call it free parking   And  maybe you should offer better customer service   Though the location was excellent and the apartment worked well for us  my husband was so upset about the parking that he does not want to stay there again   Hopefully  we will be reimbursed the     
425344106344659575,Great location  easy check in  The space is totally fine for a couple of nights  Hey guys so everything was clean except for the floors  There was quite a bit of hair and dirt etc immediately When we walked in  It made us want to keep our shoes on for most of the time 
411559749134034584,We decided to take a quick trip to Chicago and wanted a nice place to stay with a balcony close to the L train   This hit all of those  It was very convenient to get on the L and there a lot of bars and shops just down the street  We had a great time staying at this location   I had already mentioned that the rug was still wet for some reason and the blinds for the balcony door were broken when we got there   Thank you for letting us use your space  We had a great time in Chicago 
399223463014689760,This was a diamond in the rough place  several great eateries  wine bars  breweries within walking distance  Lafayette park is beautiful and has a great playground for kids  Very convenient location from I     Would stay again  Your rental was overall great  We found the local area very charming  some great restaurants and bars to hang out  fabulous park with a   year old  and all within walking distance  The only thing we noticed  and I suspect it has more to do with the ventilation in the building  but walking into the apartment there was an intense scent of pot smoke 
402176615997613192,Great unit very clean nice area very secured great communication Loved the unit
445671704315744033,Id like to first say that the inside of the apartment itself is great  very clean  and minimalist  We enjoyed the stay no matter what  and this was my partner and I s first solo vacation  so take this review with a grain of salt  I do however have a few things about it that I feel others should know BEFORE booking     PARKING   For some reason you arent allowed to park in the parking lot  despite several slightly confusing signs saying there are specific spots you can in the parking lot itself  You basically must try and get a spot on the street right behind  theres a bar in the building so good luck  OR park a block or two away across a busy intersection  The walk from those blocks to the place isnt exactly a walk in a park  but we didnt die or get broken into  so it wasnt terrible     OVERALL LOCATION   Yes  the location in terms of vacation hotspots is great  You re   minutes from the Plaza and      minutes from anywhere else in the KCMO area you d want to go to  plus you re    minutes away from Overland Park  Unfortunately  you still have to drive       minutes to the nearest grocery store  and you re on Main St where there must be a Fire Station nearby  If you re not used to first responders howling by right outside  this can be jarring every    minutes at night  The location of the building is smack dab in the middle of hefty construction and run down buildings  so it s a little scary for two    year old women walking a few blocks in the dark  but again  we didn t die  OVERALL  we had a great time in KCMO and the parking and location were the only things we had issues with  but for the price  we got we probably wouldn t have gotten anything much better  I feel like anyone looking at this place should know about the parking situation before booking as I would have heavily appreciated this  but we still had a good time  I think people would appreciate knowing about the parking situation before booking the space 
441239158425887579,The loft was stunning  Very comfortable and quiet  I tried contacting someone upon checkin and no one got back with me  The check in process was difficult  The garage was closed and locked as well as the front and side doors to the building 
466655531739603527,Good location and nice apartment  Concierge staff is friendly and they give great suggestions 
416616522793812409,This stay was one of the more straightforward and easiest Air BnBs Ive ever had  Great option for a quick stay where you may arrive at a weird hour and dont need to check in with a human  This place was great  Only a few small suggestions  there was a pink throw pillow on the bed when we arrived that had some schmutz on it  looked like food or something that dripped so maybe add that to a clean checklist if its not on one  And this would just be A  primo  if theres a way to put a shorter blackout curtain on the window that has the AC  then you dont have to decide between the full force of the A C or having full darkness in the morning  Otherwise  this was so slick and easy and convenient 
428937601593178516,Great unit  Loved the size  the location on Main St  right by a free tram stop and the large windows in the kitchen dining area  Very quiet  comfortable beds  Check in instructions were detailed and accurate  included assigned parking spot was easy to find and access  Had a wonderful stay but a couple of things in unit were below par  No spare toilet paper  only the roll in the holder   TV remote did not work due to batteries being low  we put fresh ones in temporarily to be able to use it and took them out when we left  Pedal operated trash bin in the kitchen has broken lid mount so pedal operation did not work 
446286369454926098,The house is very charming and roomy and in a great location  We were there for a baseball game  but Harry Truman s hometown was a big hit  Would recommend this rental for any travelers to the KC metro area 
468135431189029880,Nice loft  everything we needed for a stay I St Louis 
451391562651146023,Very nice accomodations  The rooms were comfortable and decorated nicely  The neighborhood looks dicey but actually was very safe  Its a great use of a historic building  The stay was comfortable  The amenities offered in the apartment were adequate  You should probably add tvs to each bedroom and offer streaming platforms listed on the tv  I couldnt access NBC nor FOX which caused us to miss out on live sporting events 
432541165535423616,This was another wonderful stay with Zencity 
399998476543481133,Cozy place in a good location  Very clean and shower is great  Highly recommended  Thank you for letting me enjoy my stay at your place  I would highly recommend 
399957344373184687,This apartment was extremely spacious and very clean  It is located in a great part of town  a highly walkable neighborhood  It was a       min walk to the STL Arch and only    mins from Ballpark Village  Many cuisine options in the surrounding blocks  Parking was easily accessible on the other side of the building for     day  We had a minor problem checking in because our code did not work  However  the issue was resolved within    minutes with friendly and helpful staff  I highly recommend Zencity and would absolutely stay here again  Other than problems with the check in process that was resolved relatively quickly  our stay was great  The customer service agent that assisted me with the check in was extremely friendly and helpful  Thank you 
441949388397067924,The people that work for Zencity were nice  but a couple the perks to staying weren t well outlined    Washer  dryer is in the basement of the apartment complex where you pay for it separately    The WiFi didn t work the entire time we were there  We talked to   separate people and gave them permission to stop by while we were gone on day excursions    It wouldn t have been a huge deal if I didn t have work to do that required it 
438376660616368630,We enjoyed our stay in St  Louis  We had to do some juggling due to the timing with parking every morning and evening since we were traveling during the week  but we eventually figured things out   We wish there were more forks in the silverware drawer  We made breakfast each morning so we had to wash them each day    PS there is a wine opener in the utensils holder  It wasn t obvious since the utensils were kept in the cabinet above eye level  We noticed there was damage to the blinds in the kitchen when we rolled them down at night to go to sleep
415854932272187243,The apartment is the same as it looks  on the photos but the couch is old and uncomfortable  But the location is good  The apartment was looking tidy but it was not clean  There is a construction going on in the building and it ia not convenient for people who need to rest 
414443935291773310,Great place  close to everything  restaurants  supermarkets  pharmacy  Very clean  loved the beds Great place  close to everything  restaurants  supermarkets  pharmacy  Very clean  loved the beds
402125166120364249,The place is just as nice as it looks  I suggest bringing a fire stick or Apple TV however as the TV channel set up in the living room doesn t work properly  My co worker who has stayed there a few times warned me in advance so I was prepared    Everything else is pretty good  Bed was very comfortable It was a lovely place to stay  Everything is very clean and super close to plaza    The only negative feedback I have is the TV is not a smart TV and whatever system they use to get channels does not properly work  It cuts out and freezes  Plus the channels themselves are pretty lame   Thankfully I brought my Apple TV so it was ok for me    The couch is getting pretty worn and sags in the middle  It s pretty uncomfortable  I would upgrade it soon   The other comment I ll make is that you can hear everything happening around you  Cars  people etc  the cars racing at night kept me up a few times but I got used to it so it didn t bother me  That s not a slight on the house itself but it s good to know in advance for some people    But the rest of the house is really amazing and comfortable  They do a good job trying to make you comfortable  Would stay there again
403561726636964480,Great place to stay in a very nice neighborhood  parking is a little difficult to find at times but otherwise no complaints at all  Thank you for a great stay  My friend and I had a nice time at the apartment and in the neighborhood
396372145021500877,Apartment was dirty with a stained dirty rug and furniture covered with stains  It was a good location on Division  but I would not recommend this place  Your place needs a good clean  The couch and chair and rug are dirty and spotted    We were delayed check in by   hours and then had no hot water for over    hours  We received a     refund for the late check in  That amount seems ridiculously low    You need to get some silverware in the kitchen  There is one butter knife and only large serving spoons 
441312114400761334,Beautiful area  beautiful apartment  the only thing that was hard was finding Parking  It the location and the apartment itself was comfortable and very worth it   Thanks for the perfect hospitality  This has been one of my favorite Airbnb locations so far  
402856855819493922,I ve never given a bad review for an Airbnb as I ve always had great experiences   until this one   I rented this place only because it was the closest one that I could find to where I needed to be for my dates  When I arrived  the lockbox didn t have a key for the unit I was staying in and the  back up  lockbox was completely empty   I messaged the host but didn t get an immediate response   After finding a phone number  I was told to go ahead and use another key   Once inside  and starting to unpack  it became obvious the place wasn t too clean   The floors hadn t been vacuumed and the carpet in both bedrooms was badly stained   The worst part was the pre programmed Nest thermostat   It was     in the unit when I arrived   I turned it down to     hoping to get a good night s sleep   It took until   am before the unit finally cooled down enough to quit running  but as the temperature quickly began to rise again  it soon became apparent that Zencity had programmed it to shut off once the initial temp was met   To override the programming  you need to have a   digit pin number which Zencity wouldn t give me    They assured me they could re program it remotely to max out at       When I arrived back to the unit later that night  same story   back up in the high    s   The next morning  I decided to cut my losses  pack up and stay elsewhere   I messaged Zencity about the uncleanliness early on  and no one responded at all   Finding a parking was nearly impossible each night   I will credit Zencity with having comfortable beds and the linens were clean   The wifi and TV seemed to work fine  but I didn t stay long enough to use either much 
399960962619682306,Good location  walking distance from Boystown  Good communication  A bit overpriced for the size quality of the place  Noisy  A bit overpriced for size quality  Please clean the carpet  it s very dirty  and it would be beneficial to have a small table outside  and maybe two matching chairs   same height   You should warn people about the noise  train  
432572182755165600,it was very nice and very clean the space was bigger than I thought thank u everything was great
432572044228596585,Beautiful place   Easy checkin and very clean  Highly recommend Beautiful place   Easy checkin and very clean  Highly recommend
451416394645184467,The apartment was simple  clean  and just as described  Located in a safe and secure building in a very convenient location in cwe  with    hour doorman  Across the street from forest park and walkable to the hospital and all things in the cwe  Great views  Great apartment and perfect for my brief stay for work  The only suggestion is the instructions for how to get in say to hit  lock  after typing in code but you need to hit   not lock button to unlock the door  Also I m not sure the AC in the main living area is working 
399219139476103590,The unit was beautiful and close to everything  It was super clean and decorated nicely  The view was stunning and the outdoor patio was perfect fir early morning coffee and viewing the beautiful sunset  It is a very safe neighborhood and walking distance to the red line subway  The only hiccup was our checkout  We requested a late checkout and paid the extra money but the door code changed and we were locked out of the unit land almost missed our flight trying to get in touch with zencity to get back in  Everything else was perfect  We almost missed our flight because of bad communication  We extended our check out time but was locked out of the unit when the code changed and it took us two hours of sending messages and finally getting your number from the doorman before we could even reach you and then it took you    more minutes to call us back with the new code  We would not have paid the extra     if this was going to be the case  The place was great but this check out was a total disaster  We would love to have that     back
415167871568601015,Wonderful clean home  Great area to be in walking distance of a lot of fun things and get to ride the birds        recommended  Check In is kind of confusing other than that it was great 
445652908381924892,Great stay and cool neighborhood Great stay   thank you 
445569245525507856,Good stay overall  disappointed with couple things that I brought to their attention that needs to be updated or fixed but they were great communicating back and seemed like they were going to look into the issues 
402116163456460301,Lovely stay  I am so lucky to have stayed there  The right bedside wall mounted light is broken
429650390649930529,The apartment is OK  As per the pictures  The place is run by a big company so it has a hotel vibe  Low quality furniture bed  ok for a few days  good for the price  The location is great and parking is very convenient  I forgot to give back the paper sign that is used as parking permit and got charged       While the company warns you that up to a      could be charged for not giving back the electronic fob or the paper permit  it seems abusive to me that one hundred dollars are charged for a piece of paper  If I had los the fob or had caused any damage I would have immediately paid with no comments  Again a     for a piece of paper is just what happens when you are dealing with a big company and not an actual  host 
486936551918363385,I was truthfully disappointed by my stay here  I had a feeling this might happen given the mixed reviews  I stayed for a little over a month at this apartment  Starting with the positives  the location is pretty good  Youre at the edge of Hyde Park  but close to a bus stop  Youre also walking distance from food options and Trader Joes  and the lakefront  Theres a doorman       The apartment was larger than I expected with two large bathrooms  I only used the shower in the bedroom and it worked fine   Building is relatively quiet and lots of natural light too  Bed is decently comfortable  Unfortunately the apartment was not clean upon my arrival hair was still in the shower  hair was found in sheets  I had to pay to wash the sheets again   dishes had stains  etc  Apartment needs major maintenance  its unacceptable to have tenants stay in an apartment where the walls and the ceiling have cracks  This needs to be fixed  Additionally  the pots and pans were entirely scratched up  There were also no simple cooking necessities such as olive oil or S P  so I bought some and left it there for future tenants  Lastly  there was NO WiFi for my entire stay  I reached out to Zencity numerous times regarding this issue from the first day I arrived  A representative did get back to me each time  but nothing was actually followed through  For example  the first representative asked ME to reach out to the network company for a technician to come fix the issue  I did and no one followed through  I reached out to Zencity a few more times  I cant tell you how many times I was asked to turn the WiFi off and on again LOL  One time they asked for a friend stay at the apt while I was at work until a tech could come by  and no one showed up all day  I followed up with Zencity only for someone to tell me no one ended up coming  obviously   Nevertheless  the WiFi was never resolved  For the price I paid  which was a lot   this was unacceptable  I hope all of these are fixed for the next guests  Really disappointed by this stay  The apartment was not clean upon my arrival hair was still in the shower  hair was found in sheets  I had to pay to clean the sheets again   couch had crumbs  coffee table had stains  dishes had stains  I rewashed all the dishes I used   etc  Apartment needs major maintenance  Its unacceptable to have tenants stay in an apartment where the walls are cracking in the ceiling and the sides  this needs to be fixed  Additionally  there needs to be more utensils  the pots and pans were entirely scratched up  this is carcinogenic  Last but not least there was no WiFi for the entire month I was present  Each time I reached out to fix this issue  sometimes attempted to talk to me and act like they were going to resolve the issue only for another representative to message me about something else and the topic to change  Nevertheless  this was never resolved  I am planning to let Airbnb know about my experience here  It wasnt terrible  but its not acceptable for the price I paid 
401465269479019052,Timely responses and communication with any issues that arises  Good location of rental for downtown access  Top floor with beautiful view  My messages I sent earlier but overall a good visit with good location
526825193878766486,Cozy studio  Love that it had a washer n dryer  Plenty of parking  Close to restaurants and shops  Really enjoyed that the tv had Prime and Hulu  Comfortable bed  Very nice and still affordable  Appreciate that the host was available to assist with short notice accommodations  Will stay here again  The toilet would not flush  The thermostat is set to heat and it s too hot  Everything else was great 
399982871458711910,To surprise my wife I booked a last minute trip to Chicago that absolutely could not have happened without zencity  The apartment was exactly what we needed
486947980139451674,Very clean   great host   Definitely will book again Thank you so much for the clean space
418086355664915232,Great location and nice apartment
402155113644125072,Good location but terrible communication
402816776800152010,Great neighborhood  Thank you
445653945418481815,awesome location Thanks for the Stay  loved the location   There was a minor issue with flickering lights  but overall great
400660653949453809,Room was clean  and everything was as listed  We ll be back  Everything was great thanks
416646855924926777,Minutes away from Power   Light District  Nice for a weekend get away     mins from Worlds of Fun Had trouble getting into the building  Had to wait for another tenant to come through    Had trouble finding       on the   th street side  The door said     that we went in on the south side of the building 
486207315332087695,Great stay   Clean  roomy  great location with views of the arch   Had everything we needed   Beds were super comfy   Highly recommend and would stay again    Only mention is that walls are pretty thin and neighbors kids were a bit loud  Thanks for everything   Stay was perfect   Was not able to get in the building with the provided code   a resident let us in 
398476411297611519,Great stay  Great stay 
464444069641912325,Very nice and cozy space   Couch is not comfortable but the beds are   I easily found overnight parking for free on the street one block north that runs parallel   Front door wasnt super secure  as the deadbolt kind of rattled out of the door frame and into a piece of drywall   Found some peanuts on teh floor from the previous guest  but otehrwise the place was clean and welcoming   Residents upstairs are VERY loud  and have kids that run around and wake up at like  am  Hi  thanks for giving me a home away from home for a couple of days    Wanted to flag something Im sure youre already aware of  but the front door isnt secure at all   The deadbolt latch is broken through the door frame and sitting in drywall  That was my one gripe w  the stay 
464433883806290870,The apartment is close to everything so the location is prime  Parking is a bit difficult as street parking is always full unless you are back before   p m  everyday  We love the location of our stay and the convenience and security that comes with it  The only suggestion i have is to change the bed in the second bedroom  The metal springs made noises whenever i made a turn or shift my position while sleeping and it kept me up most nights  therefore  i wasnt able to get a good nights sleep at all 
402833451635948883,The apartment is clean and organized  Kitchen is well equipped and the location is great if you are looking for something close to Washu or the forest park    Downside is there are no central air conditioning instead there is a loud one in the sleep room and living room but they dose the job  WiFi is not working well and I had to spend long time sitting in coffee shop to work on some stuff    Overall I had a good stay at the apartment 
412266402925090470,Convenient  Thanks for a convenient and seamless stay  Our only notes would be that the bed is pretty uncomfortable swapping the mattress would be a huge improvement   Thanks again  Lili Adam
417309164434771296,Great location  directly next to a bus stop and a dunkin    very clean but minimal listing  Great for vacation when you re mostly out of apartment  Great communication  clean  quiet  Only one star down because the actual space itself is very minimal plain
440546051011634982,Very clean  Make sure you read the parking signs and check in instructions  The hallways leading to the apartment had a very foul odor but the apartment itself had no odor  I ve stayed at a lot of Airbnb s  I recommend more clarity with the check out instructions and send them at the time of check in bc some ppl leave very early  I recommend nailing     shelves to the bathroom wall for ppl to put their clothes etc so I don t have to keep them on the floor  I recommend keeping the apartment at a more comfortable temperature  it was    degrees on arrival   It s summer and I was very cold for the first   hours  I recommend adding a kitchen towel for drying dishes  The kitchen sponge didn t really work 
438389679837676158,Cool clean room  Comfy bed  modern decor  A pleasant place to stay  Everything was great  but the code to get in the door is so long   Just makes it a chore to come in and out  Also when I was there  the shower was draining really slow  Something to look into 
418129957450858071,Nice and spacious   Be careful with street parking   would recommend car staying in a parking deck 
412996821470639732,My family and I enjoyed our stay  We had plenty of room for our family of four  We loved the location as we could walk to the Cardinals game  the gateway arch and the City Museum   We definitely stay here again  Everything was good  Only issue was checking it took awhile because the front desk didn t have the key so I had to wait awhile for them to track it down 
404316342368935497,Perfect location for college families near everything
455717887986568068,Great value and location  Host responded quickly to a question I had when I arrived and was very helpful 
468116236861926811,Clean and convenient to all things downtown KC  Excellent service and response  Communication and help was excellent  I had a couple minor challenges   one was my fault   but the service when I needed help was exceptional  And when something goes wrong  that s all that matters  Checkin didn t match the experience which was slightly confusing  and there wasn t coffee or water in the room  Those touches make a difference but aren t critical 
445601114864919653,first and last time I will ever stay at any Air BnB  To be   we couldnt even have dinner and have a conversation in our unit with out getting a noise complaint   mind you  we didnt even have the T V on nor the Radio     cant have guest come up to the unit   What kind of rules is that  what are we kids 
445617362598044250,Wish parking was available   I didnt like having to feed the meter or paying to park a block away   More toiletries were needed   only one sample bottle each of shampoo  condit  body wash and lotion were provided for a two guests for a   night stay   The people working the front desk were always lovely and helpful   The deck upstairs could use some sprucing up   everything was worn and weathered   Its an old building w o central air   But the window units were good for drowning out sounds  Please add more toiletries   One sample bottle each of shampoo  condit  body wash isnt enough for   ladies staying   nights   Also  some bar soap would be nice 
432517244582641015,This was overall a fantastic stay  Clean  Comfortable  Excellent location and affordable  I would stay again  I was confused when checking in initially  I tried using the atm style machine in the mailroom and didnt even see the small lockbox in the back of the mail room  Maybe just explain that its in the back corner of the mailroom and not the actual mailbox  The attendant in the building was very helpful  Overall a great stay 
545612167391553910,This property is perfect for any downtown St  Louis even stay  The views of the city are amazing and most things are within walking distance of the unit  We loved how secure it was from the parking garage to entering the building and the unit itself   The communication with the host company was always a response within the hour and checking was a breeze because of all their detailed instructions   The beds were so comfy and amazing   We were able to cook basic meals and store groceries no problem  The sink in the master bathroom was draining super slowly and the hardwood floor hallway was pretty dirty so clean it with my own wipes  Other than that no complaints   Anytime I need to be downtown again I am definitely staying here  Thank you zencity  This property is perfect for any downtown St  Louis even stay  The views of the city are amazing and most things are within walking distance of the unit  We loved how secure it was from the parking garage to entering the building and the unit itself   The communication with the host company was always a response within the hour and checking was a breeze because of all their detailed instructions   The beds were so comfy and amazing   We were able to cook basic meals and store groceries no problem  The sink in the master bathroom was draining super slowly and the hardwood floor hallway was pretty dirty so clean it with my own wipes  Other than that no complaints   Anytime I need to be downtown again I am definitely staying here  Thank you zencity 
416597793340176516,great location  nice to have a kitchen and lovely bedroom  tho the air does not circulate too well in bedroom    a ceiling fan would help  
495660900859556037,Where shall I begin    I would first like to thank Zen For all they do in maintaining a clean and fully equipped apartment within the Hyde Park district   Three times out of three I have had the pleasure of staying in Zen residents  I will say that I have every time been fully satisfied with this host and what they offer    Thank you again for establishing such a great home for my family and I    Thank you   Jordan Thank you 
415228617332445076,Nice place to relax  Found parking every night on the street too  Thank you for a clean reasonably priced place near family  Please have maintenance check the toilet   it seemed  wobbly and the seat was loose  
494879535018370816,Easy check in  lovely place  AMAZING view  great location in a great city  I would stay here again  It was a wonderful place to stay  thank you  What a beautiful view of the city  Just to note  the handle in the shower in the ensuite bathroom fell off when we touched it  It needs to be repaired  Also  there were a couple of cockroaches in the bathroom that I killed  You might want to make use of some cockroach killer  Thank you 
754148160,We had an absolutely delightful time and had everything we needed for the weekend  Everything was comfortable and clean and we had plenty of space to spread out  We would definitely like to come back sometime  We had a great time and are hoping to come back 
402137245627075653,Great location and super clean 
441271798531504837,Do not recommend this company for anyone  The customer service is absolutely AWFUL  We were locked out of our Airbnb for two days without given any alternate to access the building  When trying to reach out to the host  it took several phone calls which led to being told I would get a call back which never happened  When requested a refund  I was ignored  No surprise since I was also ignored while I was locked out of the Airbnb building during a thunderstorm  Terrible customer service  Terrible communication with guests  Terrible all around and will never use as a host again 
400687404765979453,This Airbnb was exactly as described  Very clean and the bed was very comfortable  Just what I needed for a quick overnight stay  Thank you for a great stay 
417343313945511249,Nice Nice
468093052246903517,Enjoyed my get away  However   there are a few minor issues that need work at this specific unit 
434743334588736629,Great place  great people Great stay clean and whatever we needed was taken care of quickly
445603810287300020,Thin walls Everything was amazing  The price  the view  the location  However  the Wi Fi sucked  Horrible  Thin walls  Neighbors complained about the volume  It never was over     Plus  we couldnt really watch tv cause the Wi Fi 
443417281589717231,efficient check in and out  location etc as advertised  host communication was good   good value for money   overall satisfactory but I would point out the rating would rise much more if some of the dated furniture and the bathroom was cleansed  it was as advertised   but the cleanliness is an issue   the apt needs a proper deep clean    especially the bathroom floor and the living room sofa
401459500146417227,Very nice view and an impressive rooftop  Central West End is a great area and we enjoyed our stay    The personnel working at the lobby were very friendly and accommodating  Hi   there was no key fob when we checked in  The doorman  believe his name was Pat  was great though and gave us a new one after checking into it 
399282369970137466,Great space and you cant be the location  directly across the street from Forest Park    The space was perfect for me   And it looked exactly as pictured   There is no parking included though   You have to pay to park on the street or nearby garage   This was the only downside  Great space and excellent location   The rate was good as well  Didnt like there was no parking included   The garage was a bit far away especially when parking late at night   Was not impressed that the tub was not clean  It made me wonder what else had not been clean   I would suggest some time release airfreshner for the space or some fabreeze during clean  Their was a slight musty order as if the unit hadnt been opened in a while   And i was not able to access cold water in the shower 
530457002209117018,Heads up for those looking for a long term stay  Do not rent from Zencity  More suited for short term stays  This is my honest review    Cons    The building is very old and was not clean very well  The hallways constantly smell like sewage  and the walls are thin  so you can everyone around you     The washer and dryer listed is actually in the basement  and is for all residents in the building   They do not have reserved parking for Airbnb guests here  It s     night for      month for the closest garage       minutes walk  and street parking is rarely available    Their is no central heating and cooling  just a window unit that doesn t have heating capabilities   The host did not provide a space heater  so it got very cold in the apartment     The microwave did not work and they never sent anyone to fix it    Communication was poor  and they would always say  we ll send someone to fix it    There are two very yappy dogs next door  which I know they can t do anything about    The gym was also under construction  They recommended another building that was a   minute walk    Pros    The location is about a       minute walk to Barnes    The view from the apartment was great   The guys at the front desk were awesome    I was supposed to stay for   months  but left after    days due to my experience 
429687322061824745,Excelente ubicaci n  comunicaci n fluida y amable  Personal de recepci n servicial y dispuesto para brindarte cualquier tipo de sugerencias  restaurante  supermercados o diversi n   El apartamento funciona excelente para   personas con un tama o considerable  Excelente ubicaci n  comunicaci n fluida y amable  Personal de recepci n servicial y dispuesto para brindarte cualquier tipo de sugerencias  restaurante  supermercados o diversi n   El apartamento funciona excelente para   personas con un tama o considerable  Una oportunidad de mejorar es la limpieza dentro del apartamento y los aires condicionados que son muy ruidosos  En general es a n estancias a sugerir y ideal para aquellos que gusten la combinaci n de peque os restaurantes y parque para caminar 
548557720839730075,Great stay     Communication was exceptional and quick  Loft was spacious and tidy  Equipped with everything we needed  Definitely would book again  Stay was wonderful  Communication was easy and loft was so comfy 
400003030097578667,TV instruction Air conditioning and heating instructions No coffee maker just a French press Few things we disliked    It was clean but the smell of pine sol was very strong  The area rug and sofas were very dirty  old stain  the upstairs coffee table was broken and very dangerous  Really bad  A garbage bag was at the back door which was very unpleasant   In  the main  bathroom  the towel bracket was loose   The bathroom downstairs has a leak I m not sure from the shower or the roof  Also a description on how to turn the TV on would be nice and there was no knife  even for butter  My intention is not to be negative but you need to fix these things  
446305030054345880,Great location  Lots to do in the immediate area 
505797739159547762,Do not recommend booking with Zencity    if you need anything from them  they will not help you  We    couples  booked this place for a Friendsgiving trip  We arrived in the evening  and the next morning  I immediately notified Zencity of an issue in the kitchen  clogged insinkerator and rotting fish smell from the sink  presumably from a previous guest that cooked fish and tried to put it down the insinkerator   Zencity said they would send out a technician to fix the issue  but never did  They then  escalated  the issue  but again there was no resolution  Nevermind the fact that they never fixed the issue in the first place which negatively affected our stay  now that weve checked out they try to charge us for  unexpected clean  in the kitchen    A  How is it  unexpected  given that I alerted you immediately  we corresponded about it B  How is it our fault that your team failed to come and fix the issue promptly  when I clearly stated in my messages  have all the screenshots to prove it  that  you should send someone out ASAP to avoid further damage   I am beyond angry and frustrated  I have been a stellar airbnb guest throughout my   years of joining Airbnb  go read the    positive reviews that other hosts have left about my stay   and have never had trouble with hosts  Zencity  I am sorely disappointed by our stay  The morning after our check in  I immediately notified you of an issue in the kitchen  clogged insinkerator and rotting fish smell from the sink  presumably from a previous guest that cooked fish and tried to put it down the insinkerator   You said you would send out a technician to fix the issue  but never did  You then  escalated  the issue  but again there was no resolution  Nevermind the fact that you never fixed the issue in the first place which negatively affected our stay  now that weve checked out you try you try to charge us for  unexpected clean  in the kitchen    I am beyond angry and frustrated 
401417255841258355,Nice place good convenient location
429675241985245157,This apartment is a great size and in the perfect location for exploring St  Louis and the Central West End where its located  Walkable to Forest Park  restaurants  stores  grocery  anything your heart desires  Well equipped and charm for days  The kids enjoyed the apartment  They did run into a few issues with maintenance  For the most part we were able to reach you to resolve  but at times it was a bit difficult   Overall great apartment   great location  great experience 
416585186677315440,love the place and location but couch was very uncomfortable and there were ants all over the bathroom and in the kitchen    also wifi is pretty terrible so i had to connect my phone hotspot to watch anything on the tv  
418015736146321315,Nice location  clean and nice room  Easy to check in and street parking didn t give me any hard time FYI  you only pay from  am to  pm and I used the app so I didn t have to get out and pay back and forth   gonna come bck and stay again  It was good to stay at the apartment  Thank you 
446281928609366282,We loved the neighborhood  cute spot with clean accommodations  Heads up that the blow dryer was not for American outlets so it didn t work
440336482599655252,Gut gelegen  sauber
430339516025826032,This was far and away the worst experience I have ever had with an AirBNB  Zencity provided us with an incorrect code to get into the building  We proceeded to have to stand in the rain for    minutes while they got us another code  Once that was resolved  we went to the room to find that there was no fob for us to access the amenities in the building including the pool and parking garage  We called to ask that we get one so we could access these things and we were told it would be delivered to the front desk in the morning  They proceeded to not have one delivered and subsequently told us they would not be able to provide one  We were staying for four days and that is unacceptable  We filed a complaint and they did not respond within the    hour window  They had every opportunity to make it right and they told us they would not even make the effort to deliver on the things promised in the listing  We will not be staying with them again  You should resolve the issue with the fob  We should not have to stay for   days with no access to the amenities in the building  You also need to review your email being sent to ensure it is correct  We stood out front in the rain for    minutes because the entry code for the building we received was incorrect 
452857586502996136,Kool Spot Thank you for the nice stay it s hard to share one key for grown adults  Maybe have couple extra available 
441312726140126047,yay thanks there was several things broken and also there wasnt any laundry soap or shower or bath stuff lamp was broken   I wasnt very satisfied this stay  also the fact the code to get into the building didnt work and I didnt hear back from zencity about anything to really assist with the problem which was extremely upsetting for me because I had my children with me there 
432629557036144359,Super cute  The internet was terribly slow though  The internet is really slow
446387603267548600,Nice place
446379957648451091,Great Place to stay   Very Clean  and Quiet  The stay was Great  Place was very Clean and Convenient  Only issue that I encountered which was out of control of the owner  were the neighbor smoking aromas coming through the bathroom vents  It was an awful smell 
415224701158091154,Great place to stay for the weekend  clean  great location  Easy check in
489154277803784397,Great space  Everything is new  nice building  Overall cool   comfortable vibe  Was able to get a lot of work done here  Will be definitely be staying with Zencity again  Thank you  I loved this place  There would be times where the internet would come and go  but nothing unbearable 
402117425071898022,Everything was great  The people at the front desk were awesome and made us feel like we were regular tenants  The location was also awesome   We will definitely be back Everything was great  The people at the front desk were awesome and made us feel like we were regular tenants  The location was also awesome   We will definitely be back 
399995658513854617,Good place  nice views Thank you  Zencity for hosting  Our stay was for the most part  cozy and comfortable  Kitchen was nice  Views nice  Great location  Loved our windows  I didnt like the bed  It sits way too low  AC units could be better  I found them annoying at times because they make a loud noise when its on  The biggest complaint I have deals with clean  Thank you for providing us with dishes soap and everything else in between  but the carpet needed a good vacuum and some of the silverware put up had smears and food pieces left on them  Other than that  my friend and I really enjoyed our stay

442025314007916413,This unit is beautifully furnished with all the necessities one may need  The location and views are fantastic  The master bedroom and closet are both incredibly spacious  We truly enjoyed our stay  We absolutely loved the building  location and decor of the unit  The unit could have used a little more clean  We wiped down all the vents clearing the heavy dust accumulation  wiped down appliances and countertops as well  The dishes were put back in cabinet wet and some still had paper towel stuck to them  We just loaded them all in dishwasher and ran them all again  We really appreciated the laundry pods  trash bags and additional toilet paper 
486157634827850347,The worst Airbnb experience I have ever had from start the finish  DO NOT BOOK WITH ZENACITY  We had issues with every part of the check in process which caused us to miss reservations and added stress to the entire trip  When we arrived  the voice box wasn t working but luckily a postal worker was able to let us into the building  We didn t have the key fob to get into the elevator  and zenacity wasn t responding to help so we were able to find a random person to let us up to our floor  THEN the key pad into our unit wasn t working  which took zenacity over an hour to figure out until we could finally get in  Our problems were supposed to end here  as there was supposed to be a key fob in our unit which would allow us to get back into the building  but low and behold no key fob  I contacted zenacity several times throughout the weekend but we were never provided with a key fob so we had to rely on other people coming and going to get us into the building and up to our floor  Following the stay  we had reached out to zenacity to give a chance for them to rightfully compensate for the entire experience  but they have stopped responding altogether now that they have our money  I will never book with zenacity again and you shouldn t either 
411569440906904045,It s a pretty noice place but getting in might be difficult cause the keypad didn t work  for me at least         Make sure all towels are clean next time cause there was a used one hanging on the bathroom door  And I thought the Airbnb would be bigger according the to pictures at least but that s me   And you guys need to check out the keypad and make sure it works  codes and password    And last thin  in my opion you should get bigger pillows for the couch  Besides that the stay was pretty comfy and I love the fact that Hulu was logged in already 
425382164553096093,  flights of stairs to get to the rental  It s very small  You hear sirens all night to where it s hard to sleep  Not the best area to stay in 
522493208244801311,It was a very last minute stay for me  The location was nice  close to everything  safe  Easy instructions to access the building and room  The water pressure was good and hot  It was very nice having a washer and dryer in the unit to wash clothes  The building was quiet  Had a smart tv with Netflix and Hulu on it  The only complaints I have is that the window blinds don t block much light at all so it was very bright in the room  This was an issue for me since I work nights at the hospital  The other complaint is that it was very dirty on the floors  lots of dust bunnies and debris that needed vacuumed  and the vacuum didn t work so I couldn t vacuum it myself  Everything was also rather dusty  Cleanliness just needs worked on but the rest was as described and helpful  I know it was a last minute stay but I did expect the place to be cleaner  when getting there the floor was dirty with dust and debris all over  everything was dusty  And the vacuum didn t work so I couldn t vacuum and mop it myself either  It is also very bright in that room  I d recommend some curtains to help with the light  Everything else was good for the price and it being last minute  The building was quiet  The water was hot and had good pressure  It was easy to get in and out  the location was safe and close  You were helpful in providing areas to park  My only complaints were the cleanliness and the brightness  Thank you again 
403580395060648265,The apartment was the same as advertised and I had a pleasant stay Thanks 
455820881165377907,Location was great  communication was clear  My husband and I had a blast and loved the apartment
526097163453175305,The sliding door locks you out when closed 
468079934799043280,Great spot  Location was very awesome  your above a bar so the possibilities are endless  Very kickass spot  Location was awesome for exploring and the bar under the air bnb was quite an experience  Would recommend 
447032169229920357,Great location  The apartment is very spacious and clean  I would recommend this place to anyone  The free parking is also a great plus  Everything was great  One thing I d suggest is having some basics in the kitchen  like salt  pepper  and butter 
419486932258928421,Beautiful apartment   great location  Thanks for a great stay  The location was perfect for us and the place felt like home away from home 
424546214837995692,The location was great upon arrival first impressions of the apartment was great until night fall there was no air of course I communicated this to the host and they reassured me they would set the air to cool off the unit  Well day two still no air also we noticed the washer and dryer set washing working only because there was a smell in the kitchen and that came from water sitting in the washer for a while which caused it to stink and I communicated this with the host as well and they sent a bogus nose complaint automated email which did make sense because at the time they sent it everyone was trying to sleep so the whole stay just became a headache the air didn t work at all not did the washer and dryer and we got no help with any of our issues so I don t not recommend anyone booking this location communication is horrible  Well it s horrible when you have complaints  Communication is key I was being communicated with up until I had issues
402166955390305907,Great location  perfect spot for just stopping through  Being that it is a downtown building  there were a lot of steps in entering and parking  and Zencity did a nice job of itemizing and delivering all the instructions as easy  to follow steps  Thanks for the easy customer service 
468088891246690148,Excellent location  room was nice and clean  the only issue was     initially they did not mention the street parking was metered parking and secondly the main entrance door code did not work  everytime we entered the building had to wait for someone entering the building  Everything was good  Centrally located  only issue was the main entrance code that did not work   Also it was not mentioned initially the street parking was paid and the time we can park and move the car for free 
415160090038464144,Great stay  Very simple but nice apartment  The area around was beautiful  Only downside was the smell in the lobby  The smell in the bottom floor of the building was quite repulsive 
414494803233982952,Beautiful apartment and walkable distance to tons of different restaurants pubs  The staff at the apartment was super friendly  The apartment was clean and we had what we needed  Bring your coffee mug downstairs for free Starbucks in the morning from the machine in the lobby    Wonderful stay at a wonderful place 
428186601000665127,Nice location and secured parking lot
401424310788823265,Charming apartment in St Louiss Central West End   Very close to lots of fun restaurants and bars  as well as a great bookstore   Also close to Washington University and Forest Park  This apartment is in a charming building in a charming St  Louis neighborhood  within walking distance of lots of fun restaurants  bars  etc   The apartment was clean  but there were a few things which should probably be repaired  such as the faucet in the bathroom off the kitchen   Also  the wood around the front door is rotting away    The kitchen was nice enough  but there was not place to sit for a proper meal  Extremely close to my daughters apartment   I will probably recommend this facility to my sister 
428188798112766571,Great little place in a good area
439759833516246984,Simply put   great location   Extremely clean   updated   Supermarket   eatery s in walking distance   Very nice vibe in the community   A few minutes from downtown   Will highly recommend   Thanks Zencity Great location   Awesome unit   Thank you kindly
402899707164979154,Definitely was worth it  It s very peaceful and the roof has a beautiful view and layout  I will definitely book this again  I definitely loved it  Only recommendation I would suggest is a tv in the bedroom 
468132031471209197,Great place to stay    Beautiful Place    
416589934843952774,No private or safe parking was offered  Street parking in the area is very sketchy and I had my car broken into twice including busted out windows  When I raised the concern responses took a few days each time and they weren t too concerned with the lack of safety and my car getting busted into  Not offering safe parking is a huge mistake  In my stay  my car was broken into twice because you don t offer a parking spot on site  Had to park on street and had my windows busted out in two separate occasions  When I raised the concern no communication back was received other than a  tough luck  message  Not happy with that 
404259227689354248,Horrible experience  After driving a whole   hours  we arrived and our entrance code didn t work  We messaged and after a whole   hours we ended up having to get a hotel room  When we messaged this company for a refund they didn t even bother to reply  DO NOT BOOK HERE  We arrived and our entrance code did not work  We drove over   hours and we didn t receive a response till a whole   hours after we messaged y all  We were tired and had already had to get a hotel for us to rest  Horrible experience experience and we requested a refund and no response was made 
412310708079296146,The house is charming and in a quiet neighborhood which I loved for our family  The porch is a fantastic place to sit and drink coffee  Close to downtown and all the sites  And Slawik was helpful is giving us a place to park our   ft camper too  Would recommend for a city visit  Hey Slawik  Your place was wonderful  I meant to text this to you but in the directions it said to while counter with blue sponge and there weren t any sponges  So you may need to refill  And ants are all around the kitchen sink  Nothing that bothered me but maybe things to know  Thanks for having us and giving all the advise 
455806907067233772,This experience was the worst   From accessing the building  Instructions are not clear and confusing   I was let in by guest s    Having    seconds to make it to the elevator  because you don t have the fob yet in room     To arriving to your room only to finding out that your suite doesn t have a fob key   Because of all of this  I was left in a building where fob keys are used to operate the elevator and even the stairwell if you needed to move from floor to floor    I called and called all three days to not only receive little to no help but I was offered     off my stay  UNACCEPTABLE     Day    Friday    I arrived late in the evening and didn t make a call to Zencity  The next day  I did   Day     Saturday    I made   calls to Zencity about this issue  I was told the same thing over and over  They ll call management to get this resolved  When I had to leave the building  I could take the elevator to the  rd floor but couldn t come back up to my suite  Which  was on the  th floor  I had to either ask strangers to let me in  Or  ask the security that was his post to help me  I eventually had to cancel all my plans  I called additional   more times from the lack of call backs to only receive a message saying  we re moving you to the third floor  However  without a key fob  that was impossible  No staff  no random people were moving around the building in the late evening  I was then told to stay where I was   th floor  until staff arrived in the morning    Day    Sunday    I called multiple times  The issue was still not resolved  I could not move up and down the building with the fob key   Check out day  Monday    I was told there s no staff over the weekend so there was nothing they could do about it  My issue was basically brushed off by everyone the entire weekend stating the same thing   I ll call upper management to get this resolved   At the time I was ready to depart  I went to their  staff office  to find out that because this company is based out of California they had to call in and report issues  There was nothing I could request on site  They would have to approve it  At this point  I ve talked to   reps on this day and I would think they should ve placed a call immediately   The ONLY reason why I had so much communication with them is because I KEPT CALLING    The company AirBnb stated that after I was having issues  I should ve called them directly for a refund  I never seen this posted anyway  Supposedly  guests that experiences issues only have    hours to report directly with them  Or  you stuck only requesting a refund with the host    Out of       they decided to refund me     from an issue that caused me anxiety  lack of movement  no accessible to my suite  and prepaid cancellations of plans    Do not book this lockbox    With having no staff to assist guest that arrives to a room with no fob key is a NIGHTMARE    The worst experience ever 
404271092842503132,good for shopping and tourist sites   easy check in and out   stylish decor   nice balcony  clean date on sticker said       seems like it was clean  but that was confusing   sticker was off putting because it made it seem like unit had not been clean in   weeks
442679497700604115,This was a terrible experience  honestly  My friends and I had to stand outside and wait for someone else to walk out so that we were able to get in  There was no key fob in the apartment  the woman said we wouldn t need one  We went out to a club  came back and were stranded outside for   hours because we DID in fact need a fob  The intercom was broken  They had to place us in another home for the night  forcing us to leave our belongings in the other apartment for the night  Aside from that  the man I spoke to on the phone BLOCKED MY NUMBER and I had to call from another phone  I ll be requesting for a full partial refund  However  the places were beautiful and clean  Just very unprofessional       
452099144807078434,The apartment is in a great location  centrally located  The parking was not bad  I think there was once we had to walk a few blocks  The bed was super cozy  I got such a good sleep and the place was very clean  Not a lot of personal touches it definitely had a hotel vibe    My suggestion is the kitchen  It severely lacked in essentials  There are absolutely no spices  no salt  no pepper and no oil  Pans are limited and the French press was only half functional  The inside piece was broken so some of the grinds escaped in the coffee    You really can t beat the price for the location  We had a really good stay but I would suggest adding more kitchen accessories  A huge part people rent air bnbs is for the kitchen 
549314214127558308,Very easy stay and perfect for a single overnighter Thanks 
419568852784170605,Great accommodations 
429637603332486128,We definitely loved the place and its location  Space was huge and very secured  Nevertheless  we did have some issues  nothing major  For future prospects please ask for proper instructions regarding parking  enter and exit  and also regarding the checkout procedure  Happy staying  Hey Zencity   First of all thanks for hosting us  We definitely loved the place and its location  Space was huge and very secured  Nevertheless  we did have some issues  nothing major but if addressed definitely everyone will love you guys even more   High Priority items     To begin with  the bed was not completely clean  I mean to say there was a lot of fallen hair found on both beds  luckily we carried our own comforters  Others would have felt bad and might have called you to get that addressed immediately     We were not given any instructions with regards to exiting the garage  We found it very difficult  even now we arent sure about the procedure  still a mystery     Instructions to check out were not clear  There was no instruction on how to proceed to the garage without an access card  That was really confusing and we had to figure our own way of dealing with that     Few utensils were in an unusable state  for instance spatula was almost burnt     Very cold at night  thermostat control is a requirement   Low priority items     No trash covers were found for the trash cans inside the bathroom     No additional refills for toiletteries     There was no much furniture in the second bedroom  Furniture was damaged  burned on top   If the above items are addressed for sure everyone would love to stay here again    Again thanks for hosting us    Regards
455818825092522181,what you see is what you get   Theres one TV in the living room no local channels  the place seems to ha e an echo so dont talk to loud or youll get tons of noise complaints   and if youre coming with alot of things walk a stroller to carry your things to save you the troubles to get to an from the garage      other than that its OK 
427543008733642594,Great place to stay clean   quite     It felt just like I was at home   Clean   Quite I will definitely be booking with them in the near future 
419483588193120245,Very clean and nice place   Definitely would stay here again   There is appliances available for your convenience as well   Everything was great  the only thing I did have a problem was that one night the code that was given to me was not working and I had to call  Apparently it was a glitch with the door system  A Bluetooth key would ve been convenient  But overall       
444127241490373718,I enjoyed staying in this spacious apartment with lovely to views and pleasant rooftop  the interior of the lobby is also stunning 
530405199983050765,Everything was as described  Great spot to stay in  Stay was cool  just had a small hiccup that was eventually resolved 
433334571154143712,Great place for   people  Just       minutes from Union Station  Busch Stadium  and the Arch  Would definitely stay again  Thank you 
419467988517439532,Our stay was wonderful  The property was extremely convenient to the hospital and restaurants in a very safe part of town  The check in process was seamless and the room was clean upon our arrival 
447007273384324591,The place was nice and convenient   great view from a high rise and there was a park close by  Very nice place overall  Thank you it was great  
418856772583766389,There were pros and cons  Ill start with pros  Pros   onsite gym  full kitchen  lots of channels on tv  furniture decor nicely styled   elevator  Cons   dirty bathroom  tub not draining properly  window a c units very loud and turning on off all night long  right next to hospital so ambulances all night long  no parking  which is stated in description  but REALLY inconvenient for travelers who are driving   Did not get instructions for check in   had to ask twice  Then  message that was sent seemed like a bot automated message without key code several hours after original check in time   It was ok for me because I was on the road and arrived very late  but if you wanted to check in right at    it would be a problem   It was very late when we got in  so I had to call the  host   which is a company with different employees   I got a message from someone different each time I sent a message through airbnb   At first attempt of calling unable to get through or leave a message for anyone  Second attempt reached someone very nice  but he was unable to send key code  He called back right away and was able to unlock key box from his end  which was great  but after a long day of traveling and poor communication from Zencity  it made a bad ending to a long day  After all that  the unit  which was nice looking  was loud and had a hard time sleeping due to ambulances coming to the hospital all night long  Unfortunately  we would not stay here again  The bathroom was not clean  It appeared tidy  but the tub had clearly not been clean out  Bunch of little hairs like someone had shaved prior to us being there  Also  tub not draining well  Even with draining problem  I was able to clean tub before I showered though  This  along with the key card issueis the reason for my review 
471719957840994068,We had a wonderful time  The house was fantastic  Thank you  so much 
415921011973905353,BEWARE  Our check in instructions for the lockbox were inaccurate and we were unable to get in  I sent multiple messages with no response  When we called  we were given a completely different set of instructions to open a lockbox that was supposed to have several key fobs I side  The lockbox was completely empty  When we called a second time  the person we spoke to didnt know how to help us and promised another person would call us right back  We never heard back and had to find and pay for a hotel at       pm 
428270884800414420,I got locked out of the apartment and they were great with helping me get back in 
425295255671624891,Nice place nice view comfortable y all gonna love this place cause I did I would Definitely  stay again for future preference
403627788740833940,Fair stay  needs more cleanliness Pretty fair stay  just need more cleanliness

419527641200773503,Amazing cozy apartment that has good chicago vibes  would definitely come again  recommended for travelers  perfect for   guests  Amazing cozy apartment that has good chicago vibes  would definitely come again  recommended for travelers  perfect for   guests 
416587216224976337,Great location  It was exactly what needed for our family of four  It was very clean and quite spacious  Would definitely recommend   Had a great stay  Thank you 
401449089636132145,my stay at this location was very good and lots to see if you like to venture out in the city  Be cautious about parking at the location  you may have to go around the block a couple of times before an opening becomes available  That would be the only negative thing that this place has going for it otherwise it is a great stay  everything was great for my stay at the airBnB  nice location  the next guest that stays there will enjoy their stay there 
447742061959884279,Nice view and well designed Thank you very much
433268745238270645,Good things   Location  kitchen  This place was not well clean   I didnt see toenails like Ava but certainly plenty of hair  dust   Im honestly not sure if the cow rug was every clean   The shower is abysmal   It has no more pressure than someone gently spitting water at you and it doesnt drain all that well     Although this place is listed as a single level home you should know that it takes   flights to get up there and in classic Chicago fashion they would likely be considered out of date with building code these days   Once you get up there it is great to be above the street but it is no quieter at the top than at the bottom   I lived in Chicago for years and got used to the train  but if someone decides to be loud on the street in the middle of the night you will hear every last thing   The biggest complaint   Got a message from Zencity that we the property manager owner was going to be coming our last day for a tour   I responded and said that was not okay to have anyone in the place while we stayed   Im not hyper crazy about Covid but also not a fan of having someone s  I dont know in the only place I call  home    Got no response so messaged again and got told it was mandatory and they were coming   Contacted Air BnB and they agreed that was not okay   Got a call from zencity and I told them explicitly no to anyone in the place   They repeatedly asked if i would not give permission and said i did not give it   only at the   th hour  about    min before the  visit   did they call me to tell me that they postponed it     I would not stay here again   I would easily choose any of the other locations in the area over this one
419564019111147944,Weekend stay  Somewhat close to powerlight district  However  a long     blocks  The apartment was just like the photos  Pretty basic  We were worried about the check in process and key fob issues based on other reviews  However  once we got in the building and got the key card fob  in the room  all was well  You need that key card to not only get in the building but use the elevator up or down  So checking out and leaving the key card in the apartment was tricky  Value vs amenities was off  Pool hot tub closed  Entertainment  pool table  area in the photos  CLOSED  Many live there with barking dogs    I felt the place was a bit overpriced based on what we observed  EDIT  WE WERE JUST CHARGED      for dirty rags and marks on pillow cases due to womens make up    UNBELIEVABLE    DO NOT STAY HERE    REPEAT   DO NOT STAY HERE  Although there is little you can do about this but the barking dogs in the apartments are far from pleasant for a stay  We were also not aware that the pool and hot tub area were closed  That was a bummer as well   We thought the value of amenities vs cost associated was a bit off  Way too much to pay for a tiny efficiency with barking dogs and no parking with no hot tub  pool and living area was also closed  Should be disclosed   ARE YOU KIDDING ME    I WAS JUST CHARGED      for dirty rags and pillow cases   WHAT A JOKE    Its makeup  Wash the damn things before charging a guest this ridiculous amount        SO INCONSIDERATE    NEVER AGAIN   Review will be changed to reflect 
429664084045689643,The place wasn t as clean as it should ve been according to their clean standards  The pin I was given to get the key didn t work so I had to call and get them to open the key slot  The place wasn t clean to the standard it was made out to have been  There was hair in the shower from the last people that stayed  There was a piece of cat food under the bean bag style chair  There were stains all over the bedding  The window ledges were dirty  It was an okay stay and the place did it s job but it definitely wasn t as nice as it was made out to be on the description 
402832206128003934,This is a great place  Very clean and good proximity to the attractions  This was a great place  Very clean and close to everythingwe wanted to do 
402130430904071635,Great little apartment   very comfortable   Very safe neighborhood   Restaurants an easy walk 
431073048165907414,Overall  the apartment is great for a place to check out  Incredibly soundproof for being next to the train and the Lakeview location is great you can walk or bike anywhere    My husband and I s issue is with ZenCity and communication  The AC went out for   days while we were staying and getting a response or maintenance plan was virtually impossible  We messaged through the app  we got the same cookie cutter response from   different people and after responding  never got a follow up  and calling ZenCity directly  sat on hold for    minutes before giving up   We had to have Airbnb attempt to contact  which got maintenance to our place  but we never received a heads up which would have been appreciated  Fortunately it wasn t as hot as it could ve been  but coming back to an    degree apartment after walking around Chicago all day isn t awesome  Improve communication and response times or ease of contact 
447788967939832021,The place was lovely and such a great value  Certainly some noise at night from the hospital next door but for the location and proximity this is expected  The space was cute and very clean  We felt safe in the building and the location was perfect for what we needed   We did have trouble reaching the host past the first day although originally they were incredibly responsive  Likely  it was due to a busy weekend and people were tied up  We would certainly stay here again regardless  Great value  Hi Zencity   We loved our stay and think the place is lovely  We just felt after we checked in we were unable to hear from anyone from the team  Though chat or through call  We had gotten food poisoning and wanted to call to warn and ask if it was okay for a later leave because physically we could not leave at    but did not hear from anyone  It left anxieties high on an already terrible situation  Other than that  we thought the place was great  Tough with the sirens but obviously nothing you can do about that  Place was perfect for what we needed and we would stay there again if we are back in St  Louis  Thank you so much 
444184441599275558,This is a horrible place to stay  The place smelled like smoke it had cigarette burns on the carpet  the paint was chipping in the window panes   The elevators and hallways were dirty and smelled like pee   It s not a loft it s a community apartment living  This is a horrible place to stay  The place smelled like smoke it had cigarette burns on the carpet  the paint was chipping in the window panes   The elevators and hallways were dirty and smelled like pee   It s not a loft it s a community apartment living 
403523100636843912,Nice apartment at a fair price  Everything was as expected  I had to reserve about half a day before arriving due to having to travel unexpectadely for a family emergency  everything was easy and went really well
428280962284303317,Great place in the perfect location for Kansas City 
748048492,High standards we loved this place would recommend it to anyone   We will Definitely  be back Thank you so much  It made our experience a real pleasure It had a wet mouldy smell may have been the rug    Also could use some blinds in the common area was kind of  Scary that we were all ladies and everyone driving by the main road could see in But other than that we loved the place
419538742534496464,No complaints  Good location  Good price  Clean  Thank you  We enjoyed our stay very much 
424646315950082642,There were no keys to get in as described by the host  We were allowed into the building by a neighbor and the apartment door was unlocked  That is when we found out about the scam and called the police  The host did not respond to any of our messages the day of the arrival  We got scammed  The place was unfurnished  The furniture you see is virtual  We had to find another place to stay and completed a police report  Watch out for scams 
428247450681323190,Very clean and in a great location 
447777504763908159,Sorry  but we cannot recommend this place  As another guest noted  we too were bothered by the constant smell of marijuana in the building  The entryway lobby was filthy  and not totally secure  as anyone could enter the lobby and elevator from the adjacent restaurant  The apartment was dingy and in need of a deep clean and an overall paint job  A large broken window was shockingly  repaired  by simply attaching plexiglass over it  the drapes were falling down  paintings and hardware were missing or missing parts  The kitchen equipment provided was comically cheap and sparse  Altogether  not a welcoming nor comfortable place to retreat to at the end of the day  A great idea  But sorry  this did not at all match what we expected from the listing  what view    nor rise to our expectations of cleanliness or care about the accommodation  To be fair  were not sure what you can do about neighbors use of marijuana  but the odor was pervasive and constant and unpleasant  especially in a non smoking building  And we of course realize that you cant do anything about the streets around the loft being more vibrant   Covid did shut a lot of small shops and restaurants  we clearly see    But we found the apartment to be      Dingy   It really needs a deep clean and a paint job  rugs were dirty and plainly not vacuumed on arrival  the oven was dirty  the hallway is dark  the street entry and lobby are unkempt and filthy  empty flower pots are also really sad    We could not tell that there was any special  covid  clean      In poor repair   The broken window shockingly  fixed  by attaching plexiglass over it  drapes falling down  missing hardware  bath lights out  painting missing from the wall  kitchen sink and toilet missing small but noticeable parts      Cheaply appointed   Silverware comically small and cheap  teakettle   a french press does not equal  coffee maker   a cutting board would have been nice  all the floor lamps were wobbly 
420213915248341760,Excellent service
413753408860162276,A C was out entire stay   Was able to leave last day and get a partial refund   However location is great   recommend having a filling insured vehicle for the area though  
433259575826254500,great stay  near everything  easy to get downtown  on point  
420267957755507171,Good airbnb overall  However  the area wasn t the safest during summer    cars were broken into the night before we checked out 
420249647674924831,Nice and clean place  I enjoyed my stay 
445579588636656519,Zencity was very accommodating for the entire trip  Communication was very quick  checking in was simple  the apartment was clean and comfortable  and the views and the location was amazing  Soulard is close to everything and there was free parking all around the neighborhood  so parking was never an issue  The pool deck area was awesome to sit back and relax  The area is extremely dog friendly as well  Highly recommend staying here 
445575667199077464,Great location with easy access to central west end neighborhood  Large unit with   br and   baths with enough space to stretch out  Also    keys would be preferable as there s only a dead bolt  Great stay  I d fix some of the scuffs on the walls and add some additional decor to help make it have a better ambiance  also maybe a Brita for the fridge   
420274008598356093,Great location  Never had to Uber to get to P L
403580839843147098,Loved this place  Before getting there I was given all the things needed for a smooth check in  I really liked the stay here  Only problem was when I checked in I had to wait    minutes for someone to return to the front desk to get into the building 
530480983447571853,Perfect stay  
420244753514260240,Great apartment and decent location  Free parking on the street is perfect  Metro is a little far 
420237770566511665,Basic  Good value  Go to June Bug for your morning beignets
428194290102345475,  Zencity is always good 
444843716610401044,Very nice place  had some issues with check in  smart lock was not working  and I expected the zencity team to be a lot more responsive
427459850367668297,Great place  Clean and comfortable   bedroom apartment  Great place  Thanks for making it so clean and comfortable for us    I hope we left it in a similar state 
490553005505853315,Great location  cozy studio with a comfy bed  Nice  deep tub and plenty of hot water  A good vacuuming and wiping down walls would make this a   star rating 
399952451731489102,WE DONT RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY  We had several issues with the apartment      The apartment is not kept well  It was dirty mainly in  the kitchen area and the rugs    The racks in the oven can t be pulled out which almost caused a fire in the apartment      The garbage disposal did not work   and the phone number they provided to use during our stay never responded      The kitchen does not have enough utensils and kitchen rags  The pots are old and dirty  the silverware was dirty  They do not provide you with soap in the showers there is only hand soap in the sinks and one of the dispensers did not work   The garbage can was dirty abs broken  The bathroom s trash cans did not have bags to help with hygiene      The  areas in the deck are for private use only and not open for airbandb customers as advertised   We were told to leave the area by upset  residents     A few outlets did not work    The overall feel is of an unkept apartment   it was not a pleasant stay   WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APARTMENT We had several issues with the apartment      It was not clean  mainly the kitchen area and the rugs    The racks in the oven can t be pulled out which caused the gravy of my meat to spill catching the oven in flames    a very dangerous experience      The garbage disposal did not work   we called the number you gave us several times only once someone answered who said somebody from management will call is back but this never happened  We spent the weekend with the sink full of dirty water    One kitchen rag is not enough    You should be embarrassed to have those old pots and pans in a rental apartment    The silverware was dirty      The description of the apartment said that the roof top was available yo is but when we used it a resident came upstairs and said that the area was theirs and was private and we could not use it  You misinformed us     There was no soap to shower 
447832425103989559,Check in was super easy  Super clean Check in was super easy
428193659753155920,Don t reserve an early check in  they will accept it to have your business and once you arrive they will give you the run around until   pm  the normal check in  The place is nice but that s the end of my compliments  The place smelled like smoke after I had to wait   hours into my reservation to even get in  They never gave me a parking pass yet they charged me afterwards for the missing parking pass even though I told them there was none when I showed up  I literally had to write a note and leave it on my dashboard to stop my car from being towed  This is a company not a person and if anything is incorrect don t worry about them fixing it because they respond once or twice per day  and if you call they will get off the phone and say they will call you back and frankly it s       that they call back  Worst   day stay I ve had anywhere in saint louis 
416659688569156506,Great place to stay at if you re looking for a place to rest and sleep at after being out in the city all day  It was difficult to find free parking   just gata be patient and look around surrounding streets  Hii over all our stay was good  Thank you for hosting us on such a late notice  Below are just a few suggestions    parking was very difficult to find  if you could provide at least one parking permit that would be easier or just provide clearer instructions on where to find parking and what streets you suggest   either replace or deep clean the carpet and curtains  it would make the place feel cleaner   need more towels  at least    I think you only provided      maybe have locked perimeters on the thermostat if possible    to prevent it from completely turning off  and returning to a hot Airbnb   Thank you   
404334901198942333,Thank you 
455070972736089607,Very clean  open space        recommend  I left three stars because from the listing it looks like two bedrooms  when it s really a loft  With kids  we really needed separate rooms  Naptime was hard 
447823125226312992,Those who rent from Zencity should definitely realize theyre renting from a large company and not an individual  So when you try to make contact with them youll not be dealing with a person who will greet you to assist you with check in   but an operator on a help desk   The check in procedure was among the most complicated Ive experienced  You have to park somewhere on the street  access the building with a voice code and then go up to get actually enter your unit   then get an electronic fob access the building and parking garage  The parking garage is at the other end of the block   so be sure and take some form of cart to haul your luggage back down the block and then up to the unit   Its also important to know that only ONE fob is provided  One parking spot is sufficient but if you have multiple people out and about going different directions itd be nice to have building access for everyone and not have to worry about   who has the fob   The view is AMAZING  The beds are very comfy and the bedding provided was of high quality and found to be quite clean  smelling    as if theyd been bleached   which was good  Kitchen space was very nice and had all the utensils needed  The bathroom was also clean and had everything needed  but the hot water was a problem  Others have mentioned the hot water difficulties and the experience was similar   but patience is the key  It will take at least   min of the shower running at full hot before hot water actually comes out   and then its quite lovely   Communicating with the big company can be problematic  Offered a late check out via email  which was accepted and then there was no follow up  so we were locked out of the unit with an hour to go   and luggage still inside  Had to contact the help desk who was able to remotely generate a new code so the door could be opened   but it was frustrating that the original offer for late check out was not finished correctly   Would definitely stay again   the location is perfect and the unit spacious and well equipped  Wed just know to bring a cart to haul luggage from the parking garage   and to start that shower running well in advance of actually wanting to use it   The building is an apartment with private residences   most everyone met was very nice   and theres lots of dogs and they were all friendly  Id say one or more of the AC units needs to be serviced   It looked like there was some fuzzy stuff on the floor and in the vent louvers   The check in process was extremely complicated  Itd be cool if there were two fobs   there were two of us and sometimes wed leave and go different directions   having to coordinate who had the fob was a hassle   You might also consider amending the parking description to include the distance the parking garage is from the building  Didnt mind the walk but wed have brought a cart 
441273997774173874,My husband and I absolutely loved the space  It was cozy and clean  a great view was included  We felt very safe in the area and the gated parking was great  ZenCity was always in contact and their instructions were very clear and accurate  I would not hesitate to stay with them again  Thank you so much  We loved the space so much 
418044161134584165,I would stay here again   Maybe a rug or two in the bath room and living room
404975663539093953,Stay was great and peaceful  Place was exactly as pictured and was very clean  Was a little hard to find once entering the building but once we figured it out it was great would definitely stay at this location again  Thanks for letting me stay in your place and providing something the same as pictured
447763190953818209,Great place 
404982099626561666,ok place
399990158798032246,Great stay   located in a hip area with easy access to a major train stop and lots of things to do within walking distance  Great stay   only advice is to have some bathroom products  Other than that  all good 
420243314458534558,Had a very easy stay here  great location  Very safe and conveniently located   Right next to the CTA train but noise was not a problem  not very noticeable   Very simple apartment  but great place to stay if you are planning to spend most of your time out and about  would be really helpful to have a small dresser or something for clothing  or even the ability to hang up clothes by the washer dryer 
453567301736406910,So Id deff book here again  The location was ideal  The check in directions confused me a bit   but I got in fine  The hot water did take a long time to kick in the first night  but was much better the next morning  It can smell of smoke in the hallway  The apartment was clean and stylish  There are no curtains so it does get really bright  but the view is nice  The parking garage is like     blocks away  PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR PARKING PASS NUMBER  I had an issue with this  but they rectified it  W D in basement  but its not free  All in all  i had a comfortable  quiet stay 
405008410943743399,Great price  great location  and dependable service  I recommend  Thanks so much  I was very pleased with my stay 
433323428027926444,Very spacious with comfy beds   Poor parking  but this place was available when I had no other options and i m forever grateful  Thanks for being available when no one else could accommodate me
414499859040497312,The condo is lovely  the location is the best  I felt very at home  The amenities of the building are fabulous  I recommend it highly  I cave a review yesterday  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay  the condo is lovely  the location is primo  I would love to stay there again on my next visit to Chicago I mentioned in my last review they only had three Forks  We didn t eat in really ever  I was very pleased with the whole two weeks 
416802803247894691,Host doesn t respond when there are issues   the patio is not usable Since you had to refund me because host didn t respond to Air not working   patio can t be use with garbage   lawn not kept up  Directions to get in were not easy to follow
440536601910484779,Very cute apartment  I traveled alone so it was perfect  The elevators were a little complicated but everyone that was near me were a great help  You have to use the fob to get in the building  to use elevator  definitely a pain but its ok  i felt safe and everyone was nice  Loved the lobby furniture  Loved that there was a washer  dryer and ice maker  I didn t cook but there was enough dishes if you wanted to  Netflix worked good  Loved the huge windows  Bed was comfortable and pillows were so soft  slept like a baby  There were extra towels  pillows  blanket  iron  dish detergent  spare bath condiments which i used my own  Apt was clean and defiantly affordable  Wish there was a pool but thats ok   Im a travler so definitely would stay here again  Thqnk you Definitely nothing bad to say r any concerns  Im a traveler so I definitely would stay here again  Thank you
402865151513240410,Amazing place  perfect location couldn t ask for anything better 
745654642,Nice place to stay Took while before giving me the code
420207831767978996,I ll start with the good and say that this is indeed an overall nice apartment in a beautiful little neighborhood   However  I m pretty disappointed in how the place is equipped  The internet did not function whatsoever after day    I spoke with another tenant of the building and she said her internet was down and the landlord did not respond    The kitchen had   sets of silverware  no cutting board  no kitchen shears etc  The coffee table was broken and you could barely set anything on it  There were no curtains on any of the windows  only blinds which made it difficult to sleep past daybreak  Overall it was the most Ive ever spent on an airbnb and they lacked basic necessities 
572508583807211577,This Airbnb checks a lot of boxes easy  friendly check in  nice apartment with comfortable beds  great location in Hyde Park with short walk to lake  parks  and museum   Roku offers many TV options  Would definitely stay again  Thank you  We found the apartment to be quite comfortable and accommodating with clean bathrooms  bedrooms  kitchen living area  including floors  And the location is great  Just one suggestion  a  spring clean  might eliminate some distractions  specifically along the baseboards where a lot of dust dirt hairs have accumulated as well as the area near the kitchen garbage can where spills remain splashed on the wall   Otherwise  we appreciated the attention to cleanliness 
433965869242783082,Great place to stay  Great stay 
448507064434401917,   out of     we had a great stay  I was a bit nervous reading some of the other reviews  but this place was PERFECT  Only a couple blocks from Union Station and a super short walk to the arch  we were able to go everywhere we wanted on foot  The room itself was SUPER clean  well furnished  and comfortable  A couple of blinds were bent broken  but that was literally the only flaw and I cant imagine really caring about that anyways  I saw a review that mentioned bedbugs  so when I first got there I stripped everything and did a super thorough search  We searched behind artwork  in the outlets  you name it  My partner used to work in pest control and I have helped rid numerous homes of them  There were absolutely NO signs of bedbugs whatsoever  Not only were there no fresh signs of bedbug activity  there werent any signs to indicate there had ever been an infestation there in the past  Rest assured  it IS bug free  We stayed for   nights  and it was extremely comfy  Good water pressure  a full kitchen that was stocked with plates cups silverware pots   pans  etc  and a whole closet stocked with extra toiletries and things  iron  ironing board  vaccume  etc    I also saw a lot of folks complaining about there being no chairs on the balcony  but there are literally three small chairs provided for you in the room that you can move out there to sit on  Another common complaint I saw was about the place smelling like smoke  which I also just did not notice  I quit smoking   years ago and have a super keen sense of smell for it  and the only time I smelled cigarettes was once at  am in an elevator  You dont smell cigarettes or weed from the room  at all  The walk from the parking garage to the room was nothing  the garage is right next to the apartments  so people complaining about it being a   min trek are full of it  You have to use an electronic key fob to even get into the parking garage  so random people cant come and mess with your things  Our car was perfectly safe for the duration of our trip  There is also metered parking right in front of the building that was almost always wide open  so you can park right in front and unload your things before going to the parking garage  The neighborhood wasnt even bad like a lot of folks claimed either  It was clean  and quiet  and touristy  Straight up  most of the complaints I saw in these reviews was just flat out wrong   Check in and parking pass and all that were seamless  We had literally no issues with our stay  and would      stay again  Loved the room  thank you 
402092297703172241,Overall we had an okay stay in our unit but it is not a place we will book again  I don t recommend because of the lack of simple things  things that were expected but not provided  In the pictures it shows the roof top but the four sections of the roof with seating was for other apartments  They did not correspond to this unit  There were many problems  The sheets did not fit the bed so they constantly slid off to reveal a plastic over the mattress through the night  The bed sheets and pillow cases and comforter were not clean  They smelled musty  We had to wash them ourselves  no laundry soap included and no toiletries  Dish soap was placed in the shower as shampoo   The disposal in the kitchen was broken  they came to fix that but did not fix the other issues   The kitchen trash was broken  the stove was very dirty  floors were dirty with particles and hair  They messaged saying we needed to turn down the noise because there was a complaint but there was no loud noises from us because my baby was sleeping in the room with the door open during that time  There was also no good check out instructions so we didn t know where to place our trash  Some suggestions  Sheets that fit the beds  include toiletries and not dish soap in the shower  add trash bags to bathrooms  include directions for check out and where to throw out the trash  clean linens  kitchen  and floors better  All were dirty in all rooms 
415160550388306341,Great location  AMAZING views    Wonderful stay  Thanks 
404336068490274531,Great
448513565141867213,It was a very clean and comfortable place to stay  I couldn t at all figure out the call box  Thankfully someone was there to open the door 
405029071229424249,Nice place Thanks
416678615944887820,Place was beautiful  perfect location and great price  Check in was a nightmare though  I wasn t too mad it was just really bizarre  kind of creepy and actually hilarious  The whole place was empty and our code did not work to get in the building  because of the lack of anyone around we had to wait a while for someone to let us in and wait for someone to let us up the elevator  We ran into several other people who were in the same predicament and the whole ordeal felt like a twilight zone episode  Other than that  it was nice though  Check in was kind of crazy  maybe figure out a way to make it easier 
570336761265037620,This nice little apartment was perfect for our staycation while waiting on some plumbing issues to be resolved  Location is quiet and with good lighting but still easily accessed public transportation  This great space was clean and perfect for staying in the city for a reasonable price  Thank you again for the stay  Only suggestion is to maybe change the bedroom in the first bedroom  closer to the kitchen  to a warmer more comfortable feeling lightbulb  Otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
455076881606029766,Great place and location  Best rooftop view I ve seen in St  Louis  Thx for the stay 
402092163141954099,Apt itself was nice size and layout  Very close   convenient to be able to walk to the Union Station  sculpture garden  Blues Museum  City Museum  and all places downtown   Washer and dryer worked well  Plenty of paper products    A few cautions       Rooftop pool is NOT a pool  It s an oversized hot tub  We would have left had we been able to because this was a prime reason we chose this place       Only one key is provided   We really needed two sets of keys for our larger party  This was a huge inconvenience  It was also a safety issue when it came to being evacuated for a possible fire on the last night we stayed       The swipe card never worked for the garage  We had to push the button and wait to be buzzed out everytime  sometimes backing up     cars behind us with ppl honking at us because we couldn t get out       Upon arrival the range did not work  We didn t find this out until we bought frozen food to cook for dinner later the first night  No range meant we had to order in food       which is not we expected to do nor what we d expect from a highly rated  AirBNB  Range was repaired the next day  to their credit  Rooftop pool is NOT a pool  It s an oversized hot tub  We would have left had we been able to because this was a prime reason we chose this place    Apt itself was nice size and layout    Chairs at the table are terrible   feel like they re going to break   Need two sets of keys for larger party  This was a huge inconvenience  It was also a safety issue when it came to being evacuated for a possible fire on Weds night    The swipe card never worked for the garage  We had to push the button and wait to be buzzed out everytime  sometimes backing up     cars behind us with ppl honking at us because we couldn t get out    Upon arrival the range did not work  We didn t find this out until we bought frozen food to cook for dinner later the first night  No range meant we had yo irder in food       which is not we expected to do nor what we d expect from a highly rated  AirBNB    Appreciated having plenty of paper towels and toilet paper as well as the washer and dryer  as expected 
492081260044660421,We had a great two night stay in this rental  It was nice and cozy although it could have been clean a bit more thoroughly    Very nice kitchen and bathroom with decently comfortable beds in the bedrooms  It is located on the  rd floor so be ready to work off that large Chicago deep dish you just smashed    minutes prior    It has a small porch out back that is shared with other building residents who are very friendly  Parking is a bit tough with limited spots but we lucked out finding parking on North Rockwell Street  Overall we are very happy with our stay and would recommend the place to anyone  Thank you again for letting us schedule so late   we enjoyed our stay  I would suggest getting the roof checked as there was a visible leak stain on the ceiling but it didnt bother us 
425366577287856213,This place was nice and clean and the biew of the skyline at night was great This was great place to stay and I would definitely like book with you all again in the future
399259952708611860,The apartment was very nice  clean and cozy   The building had three different entrance  be sure to get right one   I was going to see a volleyball tournament in the Convention Center and it worked very fine  the walk was about    minutes   I recommend the stay  Thanks for everything   The stay was great  however the entrance to the building was confusing   Some one opened the door for me and the lady in the lease office helped me to understand the process   She also gave me the access to the elevator   After that  there were not any problem   The apartment was very nice and clean   Thanks Brenda
445625905103135990,Place was clean and comfortable  In a good location right next to the park  restaurants  and a Whole Foods down the street  Since there are pots and pans in the kitchen  itd be nice to have a small bottle or spray bottle of cooking oil 
417376453935894848,This is a really good location spaced in between places like the City Museum and the Arch  Theres a grocery store a block away  and several restaurants within a block or so as well  It didnt appear that the floor was swept vacuumed  but other than that everything was great 
404346929424552810,Couch is disgusting
428263912737011025,Beautiful space with many great features  The location was superb with many restaurants within walking distance  This is a great space to host a few people for a relaxing stay  The space was very nice and had lots of room to spread out  The master bathroom was incredible  The kitchen space was perfect for cooking in too  I had a couple areas of critique though  The check in process did not go smoothly due to issues with the smart lock system and trying to get in touch with your service center  Instead of being able to check in at   when I arrived I wasnt able to get in until   pm  The second bedroom bed was missing some of the slats and it wasnt stable due to that  The kitchen didnt have salt  The cutting knife was very dull and had a big dent in the blade  The coffee grinder didnt work  The deck furniture was very dirty and I didnt feel like I could sit on it without getting dirty  There is a step going down to the deck that was splintered and broken and would be dangerous if you didnt have shoes on  These are all things that could be easily fixed for future occupancy 
445590494922332389,The positive  the location for this apartment is fantastic and the neighborhood is very walkable with great restaurants and shops    The negatives     the apartment was not sufficiently clean when we checked in which included us having to wash sheets and towels before we used them due to smelling like smoke   the ac went out during our stay   ZenCity is a corporate management entity that owns numerous apartments and they were far less responsive helpful than I ve found individual owners to be  I rarely give less than a     star rating as anytime I ve ever run into an issue owners are always extremely helpful in resolving  I also offer owners a lot of grace because as a previous host I know things sometimes go wrong that are out of their control  ZenCity was horrible and I d recommend staying away from any ZenCity properties  I certainly won t be booking with them again  Did not address issues with us having to wash  clean  sheets and towels because they smelled like smoke  Toilet was not appropriately clean  Bathroom sink had significant mold  AC stopped working on Sunday  Garbage disposal and stove oven were not working due to breakers being flipped  Kitchen floor was sticky  Shower corners and door track dirty  When I called about the apartment not being clean appropriately I was told the clean crew would come back and they never did
465171825310985289,An okay experience  Booked as a long term rental  It was spacious  the beds were comfortable  and it was a good location  However  communication with the hosts proved to be quite the challenge   The water heater was leaking so we notified the hosts the first week of our stay  It did not get fixed until two months later  During this time  maintenance people entered several times without notice or announcing their presence  The hosts asked us once for our permission for maintenance to enter  but they asked this when maintenance was already in our apartment  Toward the end of our stay  we awoke one afternoon to the lock on our front door having been changed from the keypad to a lock and key  however  no key was left  We contacted the hosts about this and didn t find out any information for   days after multiple attempts to contact  Turns out there was an issue with the hosts paying rent  so the building s people changed the lock  But they didn t come to change it back for   two days and we had to contact the hosts multiple times again for any information  Overall  the hosts communication was a bit of a challenge  but it was a fairly nice place to stay  I would recommend communicating with building maintenance to improve getting consent to enter the apartment  I would also write a different check in note for long term stays for tasks like where to take the trash  Additionally  the doors to enter the building each have different codes  This  the one we were given for our door was not correct 
415171084676053985,What a lovely neighborhood with great dining surrounding the unit    Unit itself has character   It was clean  quiet   affordable     My daughter said it was her most favorite AirBnB yet   We would stay again    Thanks for hosting us  I was unable to adjust the thermostat in the unit  I understand this as tenants can really run up the electric bill   However  I run hot at night   needed the ceiling fan   Unfortunately  the ceiling fan makes a very loud noise when running  bedroom at the end of the hall on the right     Otherwise  it was a great stay    Thank you for hosting us 
570277084870196112,Great place 
489866381103582691,unclean bed sheets  thin pillows  low quality mattress  promised three times to send cleaners fix problems and nothing  dirty stove  no trims in kitchen or bath  basic unit that feels like a mattress on the floor of an abandoned unit  you all are a scam 
418017324780671990,Great building  so close to the lake and the museum of science and industry  Also super close to trader joes walgreens and the great restaurants of hyde park  The furniture is not the most comfortable if yours is a prolonged stay  but the apartment is quite spacious  Thank you  I really enjoyed my month there  The only thing I could suggest is to have the maid clean the floor a little bit better 
420245250882015962,It s not this unit but the people outside of it have no respect for the building and it s people
417403655594064998,The place was super clean and the local neighborhood was amazing  The building was very quiet at night  the structure blocks out the noise very well  The bed was super comfy too  A few more items in the kitchen  salt  pepper  olive oil  would have helped  Otherwise  Everything was great    Clean  plenty of towels  etc  Quiet place at night too 
443457097762548255,Very creepy building  Pretty sure it s haunted  And I didn t even think I believed in that kind of stuff 
424627139802255385,When we arrived at the Airbnb for our   night stay the check in was a nightmare  The code to get in using the front intercom system didnt work  We stood out there for a while trying to get in until someone let us into the building  Luckily the apartment code worked and we were able to get into the apartment  The apartment was very basic  and it was average for cleanliness  After looking around at the Airbnb  we looked for the building FOB that was supposed to be in the apartment  but it was also missing  After talking to the customer service reps we found out that we wouldnt get the FOB till the next day at an unknown time  So while I stayed inside the building my partner was on the phone with the CSR to try to reset the front intercom system code so we could go out to do things with family  But the reset didnt work  So we had to cancel our evening and morning plans and had to make adjustments to the rest of the next day to make sure we would be able to get back before the office closed to pick up the FOB from them   Then when I reached out to the host to get a partial refund for travel issues that made me have to cancel my important family plans  they never responded back  I will never book with this company again  I had high expectations for this company because they had several properties and they were a business  But my experience and response from hosts that directly rent out their property have been far better than this one  Please make sure the front door to this building is accessible by the guests or put in the info that they need to arrive before the office closes so they can get in  Also  the apartment door auto lock is very finicky  getting it fixed so guests dont accidentally walk away before it locks would be a good idea too 
444201988306916251,The area did not feel safe  and the apartment smelled like weed  I was unable to stay  Unfortunately I was unable to stay here due to the smell of weed and having a history of lung issues  The place really needed vacuumed  the window was open   broken  and I was stopped by two people in the dark just trying to get into the building  I ended up having to pay for a hotel for my stay and am hoping this money will be refunded to me  Thank you 
425990957306156673,Great place  Great location  Close to bars and restaurants in the West End neighborhood  Would definitely stay again 
448573539435198568,Great unit  Parking was very easy as well as checking in  The host was communicated very well   I would definitely stay again  Thanks for allowing me to stay  everything was so easy great
445626180430063684,A clean  spacious and welcoming space right next to Lafayette Square    Definitely plan to stay here for my next visit to St Louis  FYI   the WiFi  G   wasn t showing as available    I just used the same password for  G   and it worked  so it wasn t a problem at all  just thought you should know   Other than that  everything was great 
442042024830002547,Inside the place was nice and neat   Place is in good location as well   It was great    Nice place and neat   Thanks Zencity
539848063835417695,The unit is amazing  Incredibly spacious  pictures don t do it justice  It served our needs well  and was extremely convenient to have   bathrooms  Host was phenomenal and responded quickly no matter the hour  Would recommend       and will look to rent again when I m in the area  Thanks for the stay  wish we could had kept it for the remainder of our time out here as it was extremely comfortable  but I will definitely look to rent again when I m back in the area next month 
418020730013239880,Very nice apartment and building  Very nice apartment and building 
428236239312502849,I like this place  and I would like to return again  The bed wasn t  clean and I waited long time to unlock the door because the battery ran out  Otherwise everything was great
420998211748510644,The blinds were torn up  There s holes in the door lol  The shower is so loud in the larger bathroom  The wall behind the sink seems to be falling apart   The microwave didn t work at all  Had to use the stove to warm up food   Other than that the place is comfortable and updated  When I arrived there was no key in the key box and it took    mins to enter the unit but other than that the location is perfect and again the place is comfortable  Cheaply put together but it s still comfortable  You guys should fix the minor cosmetic issues  And replace the broken appliances  The blinds were torn up  There s holes in the door lol  The shower is so loud in the larger bathroom  The wall behind the sink seems to be falling apart   Other than that the place is comfortable and updated  When I arrived there was no key in the key box and it took    mins to enter the unit but other than that the location is perfect and again the place is comfortable  Cheaply put together but it s still comfortable  You guys should fix the minor cosmetic issues  Other than that thanks for having me 
420967216735300908,Nice place
567466693638725651,Great host with excellent communication and a clean stay  Highly recommend if you are looking for something in this area of Chicago  Great hosts with clear information 
567454664245310565,GREAT location  Got anyone visiting Chicago  I can t reccomend this location enough  Room was adequate  Some pieces that weren t repaired properly and showers did not have shampoo but other than that  a great stay Thanks for the stay 
414486240550508289,RUN   Not only is this listing not COVID clean  it s not even a half step above  enter at your own risk   There were hair clippings in the toilet  yep  those hairs   some sort of dried crust on the kitchen countertop  a dirty towel on the bathroom floor  HAIRS AND STAINS on the bedsheets  used tissue in the bathroom trashcan  and a filthy area rug in the living room  After hustling for a different rental  I left the same night as I checked in  I immediately communicated with Zencity   They offered a  touch up clean  and     off future stays  Bless their hearts   I ve been an Airbnb guest since       staying in a variety of rental types   extra bedrooms  basement  apartments   guest houses with multiple private bedrooms but shared bathrooms  This is the first time I ve straight up vacated and requested a refund   I also sought support from Airbnb but they ve got zero cares   If it were possible  I d post photos in my review because there are plenty and they are gross   At this point   I m out       and for real  Airbnb has provided nothing but ghosting   Maybe they own Zencity  Zencity has made it clear that accountability and veracity are at the bottom of their priority list   The  review  that some unknown respondent stated my refund request was currently under has lasted much longer than the promised  we will update you as soon as possible   That was sent to me on July      If someone that hasn t communicated with me is reading this and would like photos  I m happy to send them   Refund my fee  I did not stay in the apt 
567400678014872446,Nice condo  I loved the place  Would definitely book again I loved the spot   Was perfect for me and my friend weekend in Chicago     Such a nice condo
405759525971424854,Great location   very clean easy access Some noise from bed room window
415174447565449444,Needed a very last minute stay while in Kansas City  and this place was perfect  Super friendly and communicative host  great location  felt very safe  Loved our stay  would definitely recommend  Hi there  The stay was fantastic  the place was pristine  great location and great communication  The only thing I want to suggest is to consider purchasing a new mattress  That was really the only downside to our stay it felt like we were sleeping on a hot air mattress  Other than that the stay was wonderful and thank you for working with us on such short notice 
402832716712631535,Location is great  Perfect neighborhood with lots to do  Even though they can t guarantee parking  we parked for free right in front of the Airbnb the entire stay  Definitely don t be concerned about finding a spot nearby    We did not have soap in our bathroom so make sure to bring your own shower needs  Other than that everything is great  Thank you so much for accommodating our stay 
566719963676427978,Great stay overall Bedding could be a bit nicer
400776904164588975,This is my first and last attempt with an air BNB  I had to waste nearly four hours of my time and skip out on plans due to the fact I was trapped in the building  No intercoms systems worked and a tenant was nice enough to get us in and to the room where a key fob was supposed to be  When we arrived there was no key fob and when I called the for the second time about issues getting in and not having a key fob I was argued with u til I provided a picture showing no fob  Without having the fob I couldnt leave the building because I wouldnt be able to get back in  I was told I would relieve a call back and instead waited an hour and had to call back myself  I restated the issues as we had no key fob and was told that someone would be working on it again  After another hour of wasting my time I have asked for a full refund 
402074291873483490,This place is a GEM    Super cute and modern private loft suite located on the top floor of the building  There is no other room on the floor besides this one  The same floor does  however  provide the entrance to the roof top  So people will occasionally pass by the suite to enter the roof top    The suite was very clean with modern appliances  Small bottles of shampoo conditioner  soap  and lotion provided  There was one or each  and luckily we didn t run out during our   day stay  So maybe and extra of each would have been nice    There was an issue with the bed our first night  One side kept sinking in and was super uncomfortable  Woke up with major back issues  We lifted the mattress to check things out and found the mattress stand broken without slats and a cinder block holding it up  I contacted Zencity right away about the issue  They apologized and had someone bring in set up a brand new bed frame within just a couple of hours  We really appreciated that  We do however recommend they get just a bit of a firmer bed or a box spring    There is no dedicated parking but we found street parking so easily  And felt safe  The area is just minutes away from downtown KC and the plaza area    Another thing that we enjoyed was the cool pizza restaurant attached to building  So  if you don t feel like going out you can grab dinner and drinks one the first floor  We did that and it was great    I would absolutely stay here again  and would recommend it  I just hope they upgrade the mattress  I would suggest a firmer bed  The bed sinks in while sleeping  which is uncomfortable    Also  I would double check your outlets  Some didn t seem to have enough power for plugging in a charger to a phone  One of the lamps plugged into the outlets would turn off and on while plugged into one of the outlets  So  I would recommend looking into that    Oh  it would be great to provide laundry detergent for the washer and dryer 
449215723794986724,I had a little trouble getting into the building the first time  but once I got in and to the apartment it was great   The location was perfect and the kitchen had just enough cooking utensil to make a dinner for two 
420925693313875449,Nice spot
405768647902218216,It was great  Perfect location
405697887201500486,  Not clean Couldn t get in room code did note work   Dirty towels Dirty bathroom  Dirty bed
566643160196104292,Great place location and space can t beat it  Thanks for a great stay
420925985155845235,Ummm    Let me start with the positives   The location is great  the morning sunrise view is beautiful  finding food  as long as you arent  looking for late night bites  is not hard  there is a gym in the building and when I need help with the internet acting wonky the host was responsive  Now for the BS  the couch NEEDS TO GO  Not only is it worn out  it is uncomfortable to sit on  The microwave  was dirty and so was the refrigerator  The air conditioner barely cools the apartment  so beware  Due to the fact that the kitchen was filthy upon arrival  Im  almost certain the rest of the apartment received a half way tidy up  although the description of the unit stated that the apartment gets an enhanced and thorough clean  Especially because its COVID pandemic time  you would think they actually clean the place thoroughly  The are no basic commodities like  soap  shampoo  lotion  band aids  body wash  an iron  a mop  a broom  clean supplies  extra toilet paper  extra paper towels  pots   pans and sponges  When I complained about the uncleanness I  was NOT met with an apology  nor a returned portion of what I paid to stay there  As a matter of fact  I didnt get a response at all about my concerns  I am still trying to figure out where do I complain to further escalate the matter because  this was a huge issue  Especially because when I asked if I can check in about an hour or   earlier to decorate the apartment for my mate because the trip was a special trip  I was told I couldnt  because the clean service had to clean the apartment as another guest was checking out earlier that day  Also  the ceiling  in the bathroom and bedroom  a badly cracked and the plaster and paint are hanging  Im probably missing other details but this pretty much covers how unsatisfactory this unit is  Zencity is not where you will find your zen  as areas of zen are usually clean  This is apartment isnt  as welcoming  as the description details  Might I suggest actually  having a clean  service clean the apartment before renting it out to guests  Also  youight want to get a new couch that couch has ran its course There was no pool and if we had access to one itt wasnt  in the building  we checked  Also  when your guest is inquiring  about the cleanliness of property  it would be much obliged if the host actually responded instead of ignoring the inquiry altogether  Lastly  there is absolutely no good reason why any unit should be rented unclean to any patron 
420967958051361291,Amazing   Amazing   
420961749938014583,Very clean  Rooftop was awesome  Would recommend staying here 
445649123101972244,Great location and a super modern studio space  Glad we chose to stay here  Thanks for the stay  I would suggest maybe some thicker blinds to block more light and a curved shower rod to add a little more room in the shower  but regardless we had a great stay 
566016870485731805,The only decent thing about this place was that it was warm  had a decent location and had a roof over it  The check in process was HORRIBLE  arrived at night to find several lock boxes to try because they gave us the wrong code in the instructions  luckily in one of their pictures the correct code was there  The instructions that were sent suggested that there should be more than two keys  so while looking for the second key  the first one was tried on the door which it DID NOT OPEN after trying several times our fingers became frozen and we sat back in the car to regain warmth  After trying to call message the host and support until almost  am to which no response was given  I re read the reviews to see another stayer left a helpful tip  the door sticks and to jiggle the door knob while trying to get in  Luckily this worked  I messaged the host letting them know we got in  The host messaged back later the next day nonchalantly saying they re glad we got in  Not offering to do anything for the inconvenience   Then after getting inside and being beyond exhausted seeing that there was dirt all over the shower  walls and ceiling  As well as floor boards coming up and stains on the floor we felt beyond cheated and wanted to leave right away  Support began messaging me on behalf of zencity to which I thought it was zencity so when I reported everything to them they said they couldn t do anything because I didn t report it to zencity on the first day  KEEP YOUR MONEY AND STAY ELSEWHERE    Your place needs updated  needs to be clean thoroughly and needs better check in instructions 
565263557674122195,highly recommend as it was clean  comfortable  and remodeled nicely  very convenient location close to michigan ave and i used their gym twice which was very nice to use  place was clean and it looked exactly as advertised  convenient  highly recommend
417344624321116538,The security guard was pleasant with helping me find the box in garage  Parking garage is     dollar max  The loft looks exactly like pictures  The view is amazing  day   night   I will book again   The price was fair during the week  Didn t seem like I was on the   st floor  Very clean and sexy ambiance feel to it  The loft is just like the pictures and the view was amazing  day   night  I will book again  Very nice 
565194110832365724,Great location easy check in  Thank you for the stay
565186947322591715,Definitely recommended
401437126999072098,This is an excellent location for shopping and heading to sporting events  I enjoyed it very much  Thanks for giving me the opportunity to stay at your place   it was a great location   the only star I took off of was cleanliness   there seemed to be a huge stain mark on one of the couch cushions 
564555710788942967,Good place to stay  has everything you need  Thanks  it was pretty good 
400735879329493919,Great place to stay  just make sure your garage key works  we had a hard time we try to exit Other then our key to the garage coming out not working  and lack of towels  not a very bad place to stay
488588797676240420,Room was ok  Beware of area  This part of town can be rough  Someone on the street came at me  took at wild swing at me  while I was walking to pickup chinese food in the middle of the day   Just be vigilante in this area and keep distance from people on street  I haven t had this problem in any other area or city  The area is just not ideal  the room is nice enough  except the blinds could be replaced with a curtain to blackout street lights  Room did have a particular odor  Not sure if it was bad just not fresh 
449213621563497668,I would recommend Zencity if you are staying in Chicago  Definitely more value than the rate  Thank you for ensuring a wonderful stay in Chicago  The pictures were accurate and the location was awesome 
405764530821970557,Check in was off to a rocky start  the key box was empty and the key was locked inside on the armoire  I waited   hours until someone finally answered the phone  He told me it was  no problem   It was     degrees out  I begged to differ   Room was okay  could use some TLC with stains and rust  The TV has no sound  The kitchen is minimally stocked and tiny  my dreams of cooking at  home  weren t possible to realize  The neighborhood was well located  the street felt pretty safe  parking was easy and they let me extend my stay which was cool 
404992134391637066,Great place  Very clean apartment The place was great  Thank you for the lovely apartment  The only issue we faced was that the bathtub was extremely slippery  There seemed to be soap left all over the floor of the tub  Else  it was a wonderful stay 
465858454796038469,Apartment building is nice and residential  The area is nice and quick    minute walk to the Arch  It was a    minute walk from the Metro and easy to access  The space is just as shown and has a nice balcony view with lots of natural light  Kitchen is fully stocked with basic cooking and eating utensils  I would recommend and visit again  HI zencity team  Lovely time staying with you  Communication could have been better  Upon arrival  when I entered in the code  no one answered after multiple calls  A nice neighbor let me in  or else I wouldve been downstairs waiting for a while  I reached out to your team via airbnb to confirm I arrived and no oe responded  Everything in the space was as expected and the pre cooled room was very nice to arrive to  Everything was nice 
433295812400584585,Great stay  The place was spacious and clean  The area was amazing  Did have a little issue getting the keys to the door  Called zencity service line who helped out  Enjoyed the stay  Thanks for letting us stay 
401439174436207317,This seems to be a hit or miss as far as whether you are going to get a clean place to stay I have read several reviews that were positive and several that were negative  I enjoyed the location however the floors were sticky  and the shower had mildew all around the bottom  The building smelled of weed every time you walked in  The apartment had sticky floors  the shower had mildew all over it 
399949119321317903,Great location in between lively Country Club and Westport area s with lots of restaurants and night life  The  bd   bath apartment was very clean and perfect for   couples  The check in process was easy and convenient  Could use more silverware  Only   forks for   people  Otherwise  it s was a great set up and location for us 
406443467944850116,Super clean  great location  Checking in is very difficult at this location 
420915041790665208,Loved this charming historic house   The green porch was my favorite area of the house   I will definitely be back again 
563139826316929312,It was a good place except for few issues with shower faucet  please fix the shower faucet  hot water is not coming from it 
445630373350599797,This place was grossly misrepresented in the photos and description  When we arrived the place looked like it was barely  if at all  clean  The surfaces were dusty and dirty  the couch cushions and pillows were stained  the blankets smelled terrible and musty  and the kitchen counter and floor had multiple fragments of broken glass   not something you expect to deal with when you re spending over      night  We spent the morning of our first full day clean and throwing things in the wash to feel comfortable in what was supposed to be our home for the weekend   thank god there was a laundry setup in the unit     On our second night my partner and I went out to celebrate our anniversary and returned to our hallway floor covered in water and disgusting brown water leaking from the ceiling  right outside of our bathroom  We alerted the host immediately and were told by one of the Zencity reps to take whatever extra towels and sheets we had and place them underneath the leak to absorb the water until it could be fixed  We spent the rest of that night livid because we kept hearing a steady drip of the water from the ceiling and had to pass this mess and have water drip on our heads each time we wanted to use the bathroom    By morning the leaking had stopped thankfully  but our experience was already ruined  I of course requested a refund from Zencity and was told they could only refund the clean fees and     for the ceiling leak  which felt like a major downplay of the issues and a lack of taking responsibility for the state of their unit    I would absolutely NOT RECOMMEND this Airbnb rental based on my personal experience and will avoid the Zencity company at all costs    The only positive to this unit was the location  which was walking distance to food  shopping and public transportation and felt safe at night  Otherwise I would suggest looking elsewhere  The Airbnb unit was grossly misrepresented and quality control was lacking  Management took little responsibility for the fact that the unit was filthy  had broken items  couch cushions  toilet seat  kitchen drawers  broken glass and dish   and sprung a leak halfway through our stay 
407156061920900433,ok k place
457155926758331953,The unit was DISGUSTING and Very Dirty  Not at all like pictured  Very disappointed
421039024998180281,This was my first experience with airbnb and Zencity specifically  Zencity offered great communication prior to the trip  However  when I arrived with my young daughter we were unable to get into the building with the code  After a few attempts  an individual from the building came out to let us in and told me to just push the door hard because the door was broken  I should have left after this incident  but I decided to give it a shot  We traveled up the elevator  that looked like it hadn t been vacuumed in months and smelled like weed  and got to the apartment  Once we got inside  the wear and tear of the apartment was evident  The only lock on the door was not secured and left me feeling unsafe  I called Zencity to cancel the reservation and ended up booking a hotel for our stay  This apartment may be great for singles looking to enjoy St  Louis or a quick getaway  but it did not provide me with the safety and security I needed to travel with my daughter  Please check the security of this location  The outside door to the building and the apartment lock are not secure  This needs to be addressed for security and safety purposes 
457218068595362082,This unit is the entire second floor of a coach house  with a separate AirBnB unit on the first floor  The location cant be beat  The host company was very responsive  We had a good stay  Overall it was a good stay   There are a number of aspects of the place we appreciate  but we have a number of suggestions for improvement     The clean crew did only a mediocre job  particularly around the edges of rooms and on surfaces  the coffee table in the TV room was downright gritty when we arrived      The e mail offer to pay     extra for a mid stay clean came across as just greedy  particularly given     A much better approach wouldve been to just offer one and send an e mail that asks us to opt in or opt out     The stairwell outside the unit stank of smoke  see below   mildew  and other foul things  Not a good first impression  and a little of that came into the unit  It really needs a thorough clean     Put towel hooks or towel racks in the bathroom  Soooo easy to do  You provided nice towels and an ample number of them but very awkward not to be able to hang them in the bathroom to dry between uses     Have nightstands on both sides of the bed  Theres enough space  Couples like us who both wear glasses really appreciate two nightstands     A big problem was something out of your control   the guests in the downstairs unit over the weekend  Both Friday and Saturday night they came in after   am then turned on the TV with the volume high enough to wake us both   and Im a sound sleeper  We think they also smoked either in the stairwell or just outside with the exterior door open so their smoke blew in 
572536251845763701,Fantastic stay    
405018124025134030,Enjoyed our stay and the how easy it was to check in  Location is very central and in a quiet neighborhood  This is a ground level unit so not as private and not a lot of natural light as if it was on a higher floor  The furnishings and decor were nice and would stay here again  Great value  Had a seamless experience and would book with you again  Especially enjoyed how easy it was to check in 
421013662109049397,Great place  Safe  cute neighborhood that is close to the metro line  Very clean and spacious  Highly recommend this stay  Thank you so much for everything  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
426783889075880939,Very nice place in a great location   Would stay again for sure 
425287190072613312,The location of this place was perfect  Security and friendliness was never a problem  The communication with owners was via a system so most often you never spoke to the same agent    People complained of the parking  we stayed for   days and did not pay for parking once in the area    The bed was so cozy my wife requested I ask where to purchase it    We took a three year old with us  I will say this place was not very conducive for children but it wasn t anything that the owners or location could do to add to that experience    Great place to stay  Wonderful city 
527547047315410292,I loved the apt for the price I paid  It was awesome and the Netflix was a plus  The bed was super comfortable  I will definitely be staying here again  The only problem I had was that the code to get into the building wasn t working so someone had to let me in  other than that it was a fantastic stay
426720415305206985,Great apartment  close to everything   easy transaction   as advertised  Great apartment  close to everything   easy transaction   as advertised 
402148936204590236,Entry instructions did not work and assistance never came  Multiple noise complaints for normal TV volume  Great location  As I mentioned I could get into building for    minutes in the hot sun  Multiple sound compliant for TV volume  Unacceptable 
572466118504208411,Great stay on the edge of the park

447796166110493151,So let me start off by saying  the apartment itself is beautiful  But  this was probably my least favorite place Ive ever stayed  I think it would be OK for a short stay  but I definitely wouldnt recommend for a long term stay  The kitchen is minimally stocked in the way of kitchenware  There were absolutely no pot holders oven mitts and only one thin kitchen towel  and no kitchen rags  There was no parking pass when I arrived  I sent multiple messages about it  and Id read the other reviews about the host trying to charge for the missing parking pass  so it wasnt until I sent them a message that they better not try and charge me for it that they brought me over a parking pass  My key fob stopped working to get into the building  and the area with the trash cans  within a week into my stay  and when I messaged the host about it  they didnt even try to solve the problem  So thankfully  someone else who lived in the building gave me the code to access the building from the parking lot door  The apartment is also ground level  and the street is right outside the window  So you can hear cars drive by  and people walking by as well  like  you can clearly hear their conversations as they walk by   Having been to St  Louis before  I didnt necessarily think this was a  bad  neighborhood  but my car did get broken into in the gated parking lot  Ill close this by again saying  the apartment itself is beautiful  but I would not stay here again 
447051506806371227,Place was clean  Only suggestion to add is a coffee maker and to fix the dishwasher  it didnt seem to be secured so it would rock back and forth when open  I was nervous the bottom shelf was going to roll out and the dishes would break    Parking is on the other end of the block with assigned spots   Customer service was fine up until Sunday  which it quickly went downhill  I had extended my stay an extra   days a few days into my stay and because of that the code on my door changed between Sat Sun  I was emailed this Thursday but did not see it until Sunday when I was already locked out  more so  the code expired    hours after it was sent so I couldnt use it regardless  If you plan on extending your stay  make sure you keep an eye out for your new code and use it ASAP so it doesnt expire    I was not able to get into my unit for   hours on Sunday  I called  the number listed for Zencity       times without any answer and unable to leave a voice message  I also left multiple messages with my phone number to please call me ASAP for Zencity via the Airbnb messenger without response  I then reached out to Airbnb directly  who also tried to contact Zencity via phone  email  and messenger and then instructed me to stay at a hotel for the night  Zencity called around   PM  which at that time I was already in my hotel for the night  I was told they were incredibly busy all day and thats why I was  not contacted sooner  which I find difficult to believe that if they are that busy they dont ask for more help or have some sort of emergency line   Furthermore  the days following I asked to speak to a manger multiple times and have not received a phone call or message from them to discuss any type of reimbursement  Im here for work  so the inconveniences on Sunday morning were after having worked night shift  I felt very stranded without anyone to get help from and by the time they called Sunday evening  I had been up for more than    hours  Luckily  I did not have to work that night as well  Very disappointing customer service  would not recommend this place  Place was very clean  Only suggestion to add is a coffee maker and to fix the dishwasher  it didnt seem to be secured so it would rock back and forth when open  The bottom shelf might roll out and cause damage to dishes    Customer service was fine up until Sunday  which it quickly went downhill  I had extended my stay and because of that the code on my door changed between Sat Sun  I was emailed this Thursday but did not see it until Sunday when I was already locked out  moreso  the code expired    hours after it was sent so I couldnt use it regardless   I think if a door code is going to be changed  that should be something that is verified with the tenant to ensure they have access via phone call or ensuring that they respond back to the email   I was not able to get into my unit for   hours on Sunday  I called  the number listed for Zencity       times without any answer and unable to leave a message  I also left multiple messages for Zencity via the Airbnb messenger without response  I then reached out to Airbnb directly  who also tied to contact Zencity via phone  email  and messenger and then instructed me to stay at a hotel for the night  Zencity called around   PM  which at that time I was already in my hotel for the night  I was told they were incredibly busy all day and thats why I was  not contacted sooner  which I find difficult to believe that if they are that busy they dont ask for more help or have some sort of emergency line for those locked out of their unit   Furthermore  the days following I asked to speak to a manger multiple times and have not received a phone call or message from them to discuss any type of reimbursement 
571792786671142141,Clean  spacious and secure building  and truly comfortable  Lots to do in the downtown areas  just blocks away from the apartment  Thank you for being a great host  enjoyed the place  the view was nice as well  Looking forward to staying again soon 
571776043696874740,Loved the place  would definitely recommend 
420933293446507025,Perfect spot right on the edge of West Town close to amazing restaurants and an easy    minute trip on the train into the city  
425316382527856593,Great experience at this property  Even though the train station  is right below the Airbnb it was very quiet  clean  comfortable and extremely convenient to get around the city  Would definitely stay at this property again  I had a great stay  Thanks 
449966164243227530,Good place Good place
406502098910372713,Not the cleanest spot but for the value and location  its worth it 
406480780979108928,Need to change the smoke detector batteries   Overall  nice place to stay   especially location  the check in process was stressful b c I had to call and get the code on a spicy hot day in July I was ready to relax 
417410075841782643,This place was very nice  much larger then I thought it was going to be and it was very very clean  I loved the floor it was on it was like i was on top of the city  Wonderful laundry on site to My second stay with ZENCITY  I had a much better time this go around  I was able to really relax and enjoy my time at this beautiful clean downtown loft 
417348173138970026,youll love this place  great location  modern vibe in the apartment  and very comfy  I love this place  Location  modern feel  My only critique is the floor needs a good mopping  It was swept well  but needs a mop to make it special clean 
571768705981535256,Very spacious  Responsive communication  no issues during our stay 
452182529335378270,The location is great  Bed very comfortable  Nice spot and clean  Had some issues with my arrival  it seems that they gave someone else same instructions apt  They finally offered me a different one with same conditions and everything was good except for the shower that was dripping all day long  I was really upset with the inconvenience on my arrival  and also with the issues I had to deal during my stay    After all  I appreciate you guys solved the issues 
407213049062391824,Very nice place 
571747125881921897,Had a wonderful stay here for the weekend  The apartment was fairly priced and was incredibly nice  clean  and well setup for our visit  The host provided plenty of information and check in was very simple  We definitely enjoyed staying in such a nice apartment for this stay  Thank you very much for hosting us this weekend we had a wonderful visit  The apartment was so clean and nice and check in process was very simple  I appreciate the detail in the communication throughout this trip and would definitely recommend Zencity to other friends looking to stay somewhere in St Louis 
420293560960818490,We loved the place  the staff was incredibly nice  told us places to eat and things we should go do  The only thing is parking is absolutely terrible  just be prepared to add about a    minute walk to get to the building  Parking is very scarce and usually involved street parking where cars block everyone in  Overall the location was only about    minutes from everything and made it very easy to get the day started  We loved our stay but it was absolutely terrible trying the find parking near the place  Each night it took an extra half hour to find parking and even then we usually had to walk about    minutes to get to the building  Which is unfortunate because we will not be wanting to stay in this place again
406444835055058689,Perfect Location   Short and easy walk to the University of Chicago   Also works as a good base to see the city without being right downtown  Thanks again for the stay   the location is absolutely perfect 
418077800760357449,Awesome space   A C worked great   unit was very clean and had everything we needed  We had a great time   Unit was very clean and spacious   Location was perfect for us 
402843363777999137,Awesome place and location  Slightly bummed out i had to pay almost    dollars a day just for parking in the locations parking lot  This may not be the best apartment for people who struggle with directions either  The check in process can be slightly hectic  Otherwise  would definitely comeback  Thank you for the experience  Great location and beautiful apartment  Would be better to try to include paid parking for guest or give a notice to bring extra money for parking 
571736694482410676,This place was perfect  And in the best location  This place was so perfect 
425989633477352239,Great location  clean  comfortable  and good communication with host regarding check in  etc  We would stay there again  The parking situation had us a bit worried at first  but we found street parking at night and moved the vehicle to free Plaza garage parking during no park times  Great location  comfortable  clean  and reasonably priced  We had a great time and would stay there again  Hopefully you got our message about the bathroom off the hallway  sink not draining well and shower only trickling water   We managed fine though and very much enjoyed our stay  We also got messages of noise complaints and think maybe that was maybe coming from an apartment down the hall playing some music  We may have laughed loudly a bit catching up  but we did not have TV or music on  Thanks again for the nice place and no issues 
571722193165413491,Right by public transportation  gorgeous neighborhood  many things to do within the neighborhood  The entry box doesn t function for the building door right by our unit  We had to enter the other door  go to basement   then back up to get to our building 
490578840016212516,Great stay terrible parking
449985344097438012,We arrived late  It was quite frustrating to have to follow a bunch of complicated Steps to get upstairs before you could even Park the car   The room itself was mostly clean  but the building was gross  Ever time we had to use the elevator  there was a different form of either vomit or urine    Probably won t choose this again 
421734728829915458,  thank you
404989916695340078,Perfect Place Thank You For Everything It Was Perfect   
571066075452630701,Hermoso y c modo apartamento  Ideal para ir en pareja  Excelente ubicaci n frente al Forest Park y a corta distancia de muchos locales gastron micos y comercios  El personal de recepci n siempre muy amable  Si volvemos a St  Louis definitivamente volveremos a este airbnb Excelente estad a  Muchas gracias ZenCity  
407245441752289653,This apartment is simple and functional  with great views  an operable window  comfortable bed  and simple kitchen  The management was immediately responsive to two quick repairs we reported  Perfect location for train and cta travel  as well as walking and biking to UChicago  Excellent management and responsiveness   A normal height table for working and eating would have made the place perfect 
571011966628811784,Lovely place  Very clean and cozy  All was wonderful and everything was well supplied  An information packet would be helpful and the Wifi couldnt be found 
447036610146286633,The apartment was okay  pool was closed  has been closed for a longer time   There was lot of construction work going on and therefore noisy  Also the fire alarm went off three times on one day  because of all the construction  A lot of the pans were dirty  There was no dinning table  only a small desk with a single chair  For a fair bit of money you do not get all that much value 
434748279216800267,Great location 
417323080602359259,We really enjoyed our stay  The place was as pictured and it was very beautiful  Perfect for what we needed  Check in was a little rough  but I was able to speak with a staff person multiple times until we got into the unit  There was only one key to access the unit which was inconvenient for two ppl staying  Neighbors were over the top with noise complaints even before quiet hours  but overall I d gladly stay again  We really enjoyed our stay  The place was as pictured and it was very beautiful  Perfect for what we needed  Check in was a little rough  but I was able to speak with a staff person multiple times until we got into the unit  There was only one key to access the unit which was inconvenient for two ppl staying  Neighbors were over the top with noise complaints even before quiet hours  but overall I d gladly stay again 
402905423348790999,The apartment was perfect    It is a great location for food and entertainment  The free Steet Car is only a couple blocks away with transportation to the river market and Union Station   I would definitely stay here again  We had a great time in KC  Thanks 
407176239190882932,Right near attractions in Saint Louis in a safe secure neighborhood I definitely recommend to anyone in the city
401456948073724638,The place is nice   the area was great  but whoever does the clean doesn t properly keep the place up  There was hair in the shower  old urine stains that even I couldn t remove with clean product   The place didn t look properly swept or mopped   Also  upon checkin communication was horrible and the entry code didn t work  Zencity replied with another code that didn t work as well  Once I let them know the issue I never got a reply back until after I was already in the building  I waiting until someone finally walked out and then entered the building   Zencity did offer an extra hour before check out which was appreciated   but I didn t like standing outside with a little one and pregnant late at night  Communication and cleanliness needs to be better   The place needs to be deep clean    the rugs also need to be switched out  The place is nice  but not properly kept up  Whoever is doing the clean isn t doing a good job  Also  Communication should be better for your guest upon checkin  Thanks a lot 
457181086632315277,This is my second time staying with Zencity   very clean  no issues   it was everything I needed for a short trip   I will continue to book with Zencity in the future love it no complaints  
428201026176507433,Beautiful  Clean  Just hate the parking issues  Hated the area  But great priced tho
421642989548411843,Room was as advertised  A little pricey for what it was but worked out well 
465173083594982397,Quite dirty and rather bare bones overall  Probably would not stay here again  For example  there was hair in the tub when I arrived and the shower only gets lukewarm 
465127901584320792,Loved this place  It s in a great area  If you can leave your car at home do so  Parking is kind of bad but transportation by bus and train is super close by  Loved it  Will stay again 
570354570643538233,Great location  small  clean  secure gated parking  and great coffee beans  Perfect stay for me traveling alone on business  Highly recommend  Great coffee   but poured into a glass because not mug   not a problem  just saying
405011488332045770,Solid choice  We appreciate the hospitality at the venue   Everyone in the building was very nice   We had an issue with a fire alarm on night one  which complicated matters a bit for the kids   I think it would be best to highlight the parking scenario up front on the listing  as it was a bit trickier than anticipated   However  we would stay there again   Thank you 
570325799508568597,Good place    Thank you so much for the stay  It was great 
416598284158932783,I travel frequently for work and personal reasons  and nearly always stay in AirBNB s  Often  I will not stay in multi unit properties such as this for various reasons which I will outline   Zen city is unable to control the experience  whatever is happening inside of the unit they can handle  outside of the unit is a different story    This complex is full of young kids smoking weed in the hallways  playing music loudly on the roof and disrupting sleep    Zen city did nothing to correct this and in fact only said  we are sorry     I could go off about this place   but  it served its purpose 
447120679330337506,I love them as usual  This place is like a second home to me I seen a baby roach in the bathroom the day before yesterday just wanted to let you know
405006510983750041,Great place and in a very nice area
570284297118072994,great location in walking distance to many things  the place was very clean and comfortable great location  easy check in  place was clean and comfortable 
400701519174991023,Great location  right by an L stop and in an area with lots of restaurants nearby    Easy check in process    Its a small place but has all you need for   people on a trip    Air conditioning was great  There was some damage in the unit when we arrived  the sliding closet doors are off their tracks and there is water damage near the tub 
427456632951801735,Awesome place  Great views from the rooftop hot tub
416571804255379199,Please make sure the internet works after you check in The internet did not work which was a big deal breaker  I tried to email the company a few times and didnt get a reply it was very frustrating 
447106087974283936,DONT BOOK HERE  They made me feel totally unsafe by cha going the locks in the middle of my reservation and not communicating with me  I came back from the store to a new lock on the door and they never told me they were going to change it and all they offered was an apology  They literally changed the locks in the middle of my reservation  Totally unprofessional
426797369048113249,DO NOT BOOK  For starters  there were NO TOWELS in the entire unit  The closest thing was a single  un absorbent dish towel in the kitchen and a roll of paper towels  Naturally  I messaged Zencity  a company that  hosts  this listing and many others  about this problem  very matter of factly and simply requesting they provide towels  I received no response  The only other message I got after the initial check in was a stock message stating they hope I enjoyed my stay and to leave a positive review  Laughable    To name a few other problems the unit itself smelled bad when we walked in  I sensed mustiness cigarettes and my husband sensed the smell of a dead animal  Take your pick  The rug in the living area was filthy and had visible debris on it  The bathroom sink was chipped  the shower liner had a disgusting brown film  and there was what I can only imagine were dirty linens left in the bedroom hamper  There were half used individual sized bottles of shampoo and body wash left in the shower  It was appalling and by far the worst Airbnb experience we have ever had   Despite the good location by the park  the listing  and presumably any listing hosted by Zencity  is NOT WORTH IT  It is completely unacceptable that there were no towels in the apartment and I did not receive a response from anyone about my inquiry  I will be spreading the word that Zencity is unreliable and awful 
531169234214824814,Great location  a few amenities were broken when we arrived  but host was responsive 
421717499825269873,We stayed   nights while our brother had heart surgery  It was affordable and a short drive to the hospital  Not real fancy  but everything we needed to be comfortable  The neighbors were a bit loud a few times  but we d stay again if the need arose  Thank you so much for allowing us to stay while our brother had heart surgery  We were very thankful for finding an affordable place so close to the hospital   
454324939691845146,Great space  Spacious  quiet  and private  Beautiful surrounding and convenient location   Would highly recommend  Thank you for your understanding from my mistake 
407893544013174015,Perfect location and size for a short or long stay  Perfect spot and size for a quick or long stay
407896718755922124,I can see myself staying here again and recommending it to my family and friends   My   night stay this time was exploratory    to visit Chicago  to test working remotely from here  to see if I might move to Chicago or visit on a regular basis   All impressions were favorable   I pointed out to Zencity that the clothes dryer did not work   I was thanked for pointing that out and I assume they will have it repaired  I pointed out that the patio deck heater was not working   I assume that will be addressed as well   It would be great if there were an awning or umbrella on the back deck    something to take cover under when it is raining   I feel the interior was fairly represented on AirBnB   To any reports about the cleanliness  the interior was clean and maintained well enough for my liking   The hand railing up the second flight of stairs seemed slightly tacky  but I attribute that to the finish of the paint and the humidity    I clean it myself and felt no change to the touch   I enjoyed a stroll around the block   I got the sense this location  apart from it being an AirBnB  was representative of the the rest of the neighborhood   Parking can be a challenge  some evenings   Everything I wanted to see was within   miles  albeit across I      To any reports of noise complaints  I received none   But  I dont think I carry on loudly   My neice visited for a couple days and still no noise complaint   I brought my acoustic guitar   On a few occasions  for no more than    minutes  I sat in the front  a few feet from the front wall and the dinning table as I played and sang   With the hardwood floors and high ceilings  the place sounded beautiful   However  these acoustics may not lend themselves so well to conversations among many people  especially if the television were to be going on in the background  and may have contributed to louder than normal conversations and the reported noise complaints    just a guess  I would recommend this spot to friends and Im considering staying here again    A cover or umbrella on the deck would have been nice  given it rained few days while I was there    the propane heater on the deck needs to be repaired  also 
455083234377495008,I ll definitely be back  Absolutely loved the unit and the building  Beautiful on the inside and on the rooftop terrace  the gym was amazing too  Barely saw anyone in the building so I had it all to myself  I noticed a couple things left behind from the previous guest but it didn t bother me much  Highly recommend  I was locked out of the apartment for a little while until a renter let me in  I messaged asking for help since the touchpad screen is broken
418158986427520885,Upon booking for the Airbnb we reached out to the host from Zencity And we asked was a unit available and was the issue with the door fixed per the reviews we were reading  They replied back yes everything should be good if we wanted to move forward and book  We booked and got ready to head to the space  Wednesday the   th the first night was great no issues no problems we were able to get into the apartment with no issues  Thursday the   th my brother was laying on the couch in the front and looked over to someone trying to get into the apartment  Luckily we have a chain on the door and the guy looked over and saw him on the couch and said he was sorry he didn t realize the unit was being rented out for the weekend  I told him we were only here till that Saturday  He said OK he introduced himself as a realtor and he was actually doing a apartment tour on that specific unit  He had people outside the door to show the unit and ask would it still be OK if he showed the unit  My brother then told him I was still sleeping so Right then wouldn t be the best time  He said thank you and he left  The Host Was notified and they tried to say it was not a realtor when in fact it definitely was  The next day we were greeted by the maintenance people early in the morning they were surprised when my brother opened the door and saw we were there  We informed them that we would be here until that Saturday  They said ok and went upstairs to a different unit  Not anytime was a  Leak  mentioned  A couple hours later another duo of maintenance guys came through and My brother answered the door again and they were shocked as well to see us there I take it the message wasn t passed along that we were there renting till that Saturday  So my brother explained the same thing to those maintenance guys they said cool and they went upstairs to another unit  During this time around when The first set of maintenance guys came through  the host sent an offer and asked if I would be willing to check out a day early and take     refund because there was a  leak  in the building  me and my brother respectfully declined and said we were comfortable in the space that we were in  At no time did the host say this is an urgent emergency and at no time did the maintenance crew that we saw and greeted at the door state that it was a leak in the unit  nor ask could they enter the unit to check and see if it was coming from The unit we were staying in  We replied to every message in a timely manner in which it was sent to us  Around   o clock the maintenance crew showed back up to the unit and when My brother opened up the door The one maintenance man said they were told we were leaving at three and in no way did we ever say that to anyone  The maintenance guy said no problem I m not going to harass you all when you all have proof that you all are allowed to be here  During the time we contacted Airbnb and they stated no one Has been in communication with them to cancel the Airbnb so do not worry about it  During that call I started to receive messages from the host with a bunch of slanderous lies and disrespect  The person messaging at the time  Gary  was extremely rude  disrespectful And sent very threatening via messages as well as phone calls  Gary attempted to lie and say we never opened the door for maintenance  he lied and said we were rude to maintenance and we were smoking weed in the unit  All of thee above were lies but Gary continued to spread the lies via Airbnb messenger  My brother went outside after Gary continued to lie and spoke to the maintenance and both men Kevin and Raul stated we were never rude or disrespectful to them and they didn t know where that lie came from  They also stated we definitely Opened the door for them and no weed was ever smelled  Gary proceeded to threaten us by calling the police from   PM to almost      PM in which we were not worried by any means because we did nothing wrong  Turns out there was never a leak in the building we spoke to other residents in passing  The host never canceled the Airbnb until almost   PM that day AFTER I already contacted Airbnb to have the reservation canceled myself  But they were lying While we were on the phone with Airbnb saying they spoke with them and had already canceled our reservation and we knew it was a lie  All of this could have been avoided if Gary had not lied and been disrespectful  We found out someone rented out the unit and they were not supposed to rent it out on airbnb  they were trying to get the unit make ready for actual residents to move in  So  instead of the host just saying that him being open and honest he tried to lie and then lied more and thought threatening us was going to make him get what he wanted  I do not recommend this unit or any unit this company puts up if this is how they run their business  On top of everything else Gary was standing outside the whole time texting and being disrespectful as if we didn t know who he was with bright red hair  Not once did he come in introduces self or even be brave enough to face us  he of course like most cowards hid behind texting 
457880836767626933,Great spot and super clean  
419554254700739737,This Airbnb is in a perfect location close to Lafayette park  restaurants and it is in a great neighborhood  The rooms were beautiful  and quiet  We would return to the same place for sure  It was the perfect location  The room was beautiful and quiet  We enjoyed it so much and would return again 
568170849407148212,Very Nice Place 
759951030,Everything accurate as posted   This was a clean   quiet  safe place   I definitely look forward to staying here again when i come back into town Thank u for the welcomingservice and stay I definitely look forwardto staying here again when u come back into town
407885842361714627,An ok place to stay 
567391640820919530,This place is really great  It s a little studio and comes with things you can use to cook  The bed is comfortable and the whole space is nice  Travel from this location can be a little difficult as the closest metro station is an    minute walk and the bus that s right outside doesn t go everywhere you d want   but it s still an amazing location  The place was so great  We really enjoyed it  The heater underneath the air conditioning makes a vibrating noise every few minutes and is kind of annoying  Other than that everything was great 
567387800291196952,The place was great    Roomy and very comfortable nice neighborhood   Excellent communication  I will be staying again if available    Thanks Zencity Thanks the place was great    Entrance code just too long   
426106326760015154,Very clean  lovely building  It was in the perfect spot to discover some new favorites in the area  We had a great time  thanks so much for being so responsive and helpful
407901307201576537,Great location   Very stylish  place was great   the only suggestion would be a parking pass  I would have paid more if given the option 
453632418108471913,Lots of small issues with the cleanliness of the space accumulated to a less than ideal stay  I had to call another clean company to clean and the host wasnt responsive  Disappointed  While the cleanliness issues I had were small  the sum of their parts were disappointing  This was exasperated by the lack of responsiveness from the customer service team 
421701686597636252,I will start by saying that because of the price and prior review  we anticipated there would be some kind of issues with the condo  We were right  But while I have complaints about the condition of the place  the price is commiserate  Except the clean fee  that should be refunded    I ll start with the pros  The condo was ideal for my husband and I and another couple  We each had queen beds and separate  full bathrooms  The location is in the business district  and we were able to walk to get coffee  Schnucks grocery store  restaurants  and even a boozy milkshake at the restaurant attached to the building  But that s about where the pros end    For the cons the place just felt dirty and the decor   I use that term liberally  was sparse  Think the hotel rooms from Schitts Creek   It was a good thing the Schnucks was nearby because we immediately needed to purchase clean supplies  Clorox wipes for the win     The walls are full of holes from prior occupants and discolored from who knows what   Ew  The floors  all of them  were covered in crumbs and some type of sticky substance  bring flip flops    We used one of the extra sheets to cover the couch because Clorox wipes are not made for fabric  There is lint literally seeping out of the electrical outlets in the en suite bathroom    Speaking of the bathrooms  there is a reason no bathroom photos are posted   The shower in the en suite bath is tiny and both shower heads needed to be replaced years ago they basically spit water on you  Again bring the flippies   The towels also had a mildew tinge to them which makes sense given the overall lack of cleanliness  I just held my breath when I used them    I think another reviewer mentioned the a c  I can confirm it is not back to       We all sweated during the night and outside was in the low   s when we were there   It wasn t intolerable  but it definitely wasn t replaced or fully fixed    In summary  the bare furnishings and overall lack of style are commiserate with the price  I ll even give on the a c because it wasn t totally broken   But the lack of clean is  inexcusable  particularly in today s Covid environment  You should really consider patching the holes  a fresh coat   look into a new clean service
407948906025814553,Checking in was super easy and the place looked exactly like the photos  I would definitely stay again if I needed to 
450651568714164693,Great location downtown  Cozy place 
572456210734572543,Will definitely visit again
571777256294844263,Such a very nice place to stay  It s very clean and peaceful  Parking isn t far at all  the space in the apartment is perfect plus more  I definitely recommend  Thank you for a peaceful and clean stay Zencity  Such a great stay  Very clean and peaceful  Everything is organized and clean  Smells good too  I definitely recommend and would stay again  Thank you Zencity 
465910496476475955,Matches the pictures exactly  Very clean and smelled great  This is a must stay place not far from Washington ave at all  Will stay here every time I visit  I really loved the place it was clean and matched the pictures  Smelled good and felt homey  I appreciate the thermostat being adjustable and not locked  This is a St  Louis gem  I will stay here every time I come 
419473557951484866,What a great place   Perfect location for exploring the plaza and Westport   The pool was so relaxing   Easy access in and out after we got the key fob   The beds were comfortable  every thing was very clean   Will stay here again   For the reviews about paper thin walls  they must have extremely sensitive ears   Never heard any neighbors  above  below or on the sides      What a great place   Perfect location to the plaza   The pool was so relaxing   Easy entry after we got the key fob   Everything was clean  the bed was comfortable   Will stay here again 
449190623505868010, 
444874346943327126,Unfortunately  the cleanliness of the apartment was a huge disappointment  There was a dead bird on the balcony and cigarette buds all over  The rug and surfaces looked like they hadnt been clean in a while  It was gross 
463054756763533153,Everything was just as expected  Great location  great communication and beautiful space  Everything was just as expected  Thank you 
422369238742759008,Good location  nice place   Bed wasnt great  but overall good stay  Window AC wasnt great   Bed wasnt comfortable   I dont know if it was the sheets or the plastic covering over the mattress  but that was the hottest bed I have ever slept in 
420204247381900494,Good value  I would suggest just doing a few easy things that would make it nicer   New pillows  clean rug  replace cracked coffee press   The place is so great  but I wished it were cleaner 
438386555520815264,This apartment has the solid charm of old school Chicago  Locals mentioned we may hear the lions from the nearby zoo stellar addition   It is a special place to stay and great area 
447769117795916968,The positive  Great location  unit itself was very clean and looked to be recently renovated  Free Netflix  Hulu  etc on the Roku and the in unit washer dryer were really nice perks   The negative  Elevator was broken my entire stay  Unit was on the  th floor so that kind of sucked with no working elevator  I had to ask for check in instructions when I arrived because they didn t send them beforehand  The door code they initially gave me was incorrect so they had to send another code  Needless to say   check in was a bit clunky sloppy  Get the elevator fixed  Why did I have to message you guys to get the check in instructions  Also the door code you guys originally gave me was incorrect  Check in was subpar at best  Unit was clean and pretty nice compared to the rest of the building 
409416831130855962,Wifi didn t work and loads of other things were inaccurate on listing  Agency that handles unit was unprofessional that when we needed help  Also big safety issue  front door to building did not lock half the time   Don t stay here   I have reported all issues in a formal complaint 
571743273632783467,We really enjoyed our stay with Zencity   It was the perfect location for a quick weekend trip to downtown KC   there are tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance   The unit itself was beautiful  and the amenities throughout the building are really nice   Cant wait to come back in the summer when we can use the rooftop pool     Thanks for having us  we really enjoyed our stay at your place   Perfect location for a quick weekend trip to downtown KC 
429623953411118060,It was a great stay  Very cleanly and the response time was fast  Great location too It was a great stay  Very cleanly and the response time was fast  Great location too
409344456927336840,It was a great location
404286484405339986,Great little space   Great location  Just as described  Great little space   Great location  Just as described   Would have been better if the tv worked 
429639436913043307,I would never stay here again  Unit was not in good condition  Shower was unsafe as no handle to hold onto  No deadbolt lock for door so anybody could have copied the keys and entered while I was there or out  Location was excellent but the condition of the unit was poor  Size of the unit was good  Unit two flights of stairs up  The unit is in terrible condition  You should remodel the unit  Location is good  The shower is a serious safety issue as no handle for safety  There is another safety and security issue which is huge  the keys could be easily copied and past customers could have entered when I was sleeping to harm me  or rob me  No dead bolt lock once inside  I feel like you took advantage of me as the condition of the unit was terrible  I would never stay at a zen city unit again 
405048075160404385,being   or   blocks from so many restaurants and bars was great  the Whole Foods being so close made getting things for the week we were there much easier 
750020214,Home was comfortable  spacious  and had all sorts of thoughtful touches  not to mention gorgeous with the older style  Served as an excellent crash pad    The house was lovely  thank you  door was a little tough to unlock  Bed frame was kinda dirty
420307158957636599,Wonderful stay  Will definitely use again  Wonderful stay  Will definitely use again 
417341857847754239,I would probably stay here again  but    As the previous reviews stated check in was not smooth  Another resident allowed me entrance and to use the elevator  The door code did work   Parking was difficult and has to be paid for during the day M F  This is included in the listing  but the only open lot I found was   blocks away  Also  the pictures of the skyline were definitely not from this unit as all you can see are neighboring buildings  And I don t think they met the Airbnb standard of clean this visit perhaps an isolated incident   THE GOOD  the place is in good repair and the bed is comfortable  It s actually a cute little unit  The building is quiet during the day  I work nights so that s important to me   Once checked in entrance is easy peasy  just keep your door code handy  I didn t get to use the amenities during my stay  but they offer quite a few  There was hair in the shower and food on the potholder  Yuck   I paid for two extra days because I work nights and when I went to check in was unable to enter the building as your check in process is not functional  When I messaged about my issue the reply was not timely  which I needed it to be so that I could go to bed for work that night  and impersonal as your representative did not seem to understand that my check in date was actually the day before   This was rather upsetting 
449962262724379052,I arrived around     pm on Thursday only to find that the floors were still filthy  there were clumps of hair and dried blood in the shower and   of the pillow cases had a blood stain and dirt on them  I reached out immediately to Zencity and stated that since it was so late Id stay the night but wouldnt be spending the rest of the trip there and that they needed to refund my money  I used my shirt as a pillow case  I woke up to an an email stating that they were sorry for the inconvenience  I had to reach out numerous times to get a real response instead of a canned one  They still hadnt come uo with any kind of solution by  pm Friday  After    hours they still couldnt come up with a way to make things right  It became very frustrating because the only form of communication with them was email  My guest and i ended up having to clean out the disgusting shower just to be able to use it so we could continue our vacation   There were some emails back and forth and all they could tell me was that my refund request had been sent to manager  Tomorrow will be   week since i sent the inital email and i have yet to hear back from a manager or anyone from Zencity  I wont ever be staying with them again and i think Ill stick with hotels from now on  At least at a hotel there is someone on shift to communicate with  Provide a contact number and not just an email   Dont email canned responses 
409333981267939048,This was the perfect place to stay for our weekend getaway  It felt centrally located and not too far from the things we were interested in  Thank you for the well explained check in instructions 
403592879111663123,The Checkin process was not had described on the procedures received  I would suggest you arrive during office hours so the leasing agent can help you get in  I was told there would be a key fob in the room once we arrived but I had to reach out to Zencity since one could not be found  Zencity was very responsive to this problem and handled it within an hour  Additionally once we arrived there was used  dirty towels in the bathroom separate from the clean towels provided  Luckily there was a CVS near by that we stop to get clean supplies since I felt like the Airbnb was not clean after see the towels 
570320084511741277,It was an amazing environment  I wouldn t mind booking it again
570286736254165306,It was a great place to stay  My stay was great  I have no complaints 
429628050586875892,Very nice place to stay  very clean and excellent area
422417643796368850,Really great place and superb space Very nice   shower needed to be clean better
428901869384891595,For the most part  my stay was good  Zencity was responsive when I had questions  The place was as seen in the photos   its in a nice area  and the bed was really comfortable  The room was pretty clean except for the floor felt a bit sticky everywhere  including the rug under the bed  so I wore socks until I climbed into bed   I had a bit of difficulty checking in  The code I was given to enter the building didnt work for me  but there was a person inside who let me in  I also had a bit of trouble getting the door to the room unlocked   I didnt know how to turn on the screen of the keypad  tap on it a couple times and it lights up    The elevators made me a little nervous  since they bounced a lot  Also initially the button to call them didnt work   One of the times while reentering the building  the fob reader broke down  Luckily there was someone who walked up who lived there and knew what code to press to get in  If that hadnt happened I would have been stuck outside at night   Despite these minor inconveniences  I would recommend this place and stay here again  It was a super easy walk to really good food places and my friends apartment 
427440980404663098,This Airbnb was a great value  The location was within walking distance to all of Hyde Park  The neighborhood felt safe and the people were friendly  The Airbnb was clean and the mattress was comfortable the only thing was the water pressure in the shower wasn t great  The front desk staff was incredible  They were more than willing to offer suggestions   made sure to ask us how it was when we got back  If we are ever back in Chicago we will definitely be staying here again  Thank you 
569595726551460120,I would be worried to rent from them their impossible to deal with over the phone they are also very quick to assess fines for matters with her for an excess of any damage they also have piss poor security and allow people in your room that you don t want Allowed unwanted guests to answer the apartment and cause damage and then try pin me for those damages when I price them of the person and if they were not supposed to be on the premises   Company days is an unlawful merchandising business practices and is due for a good lawsuit
408651296726626862,Very clean and nice space  Location was fantastic 
408615396974480583,It is a very good place to stay cost beneficts
569572954367541883,Everything went amazing beautiful clean room with easy access and everything you could need  It was also close to everything in the city which is great  The parking was a little tricky but definitely worth it 
443414594991903816,everything was fantastic  but the carpet and floor had a lot of hair and dust  which is less than ideal  everything was fantastic  but the carpet and floor had a lot of hair and dust on it  which is less than ideal
429626981255772314,The CUTEST apartment  Walking distance to the Plaza  I will be rebooking this place for our return to KCMO 
445629378775591537,Stay was great  had some troubles getting the key but once I called they answered right away and fixed the issue  Best for a shorter term stay in my opinion  The area directly around and within the building is great  Westport in itself is a little rough around the edges but over all liked the area a lot personally 
569537440773292924,Such a wonderful stay with Zencity   The place is super clean and well maintained  The view on the top floor was so pretty and everything we needed was provided  Thank you 
429639965612919909,Great location and place  Thank you
568861528178811406,A really cool loft in an old  restored factory building  Convenient location to everything we wanted to do    The issue is Zencity  The unit was overall very unclean  floors  dishes  counters   We also didn t have any towels in the unit and it took Zencity over    hours to resolve this 
568814531270990428,Beautiful property and overall great experience   This  like my previous Zencity experience  was a cute little studio apartment in what seemed to be a private residential building   The room itself was beautiful   Opens straight into a kitchenette bedroom   The kitchenette is more than fully stocked with wares  so you can cook if youre a longer stay or snack for a shorter one   Theres a large one compartment sink and a full dishwasher   And the little things like the included craft coffee with grinder and French press shows they dont overlook how important details are   The bathroom was beautiful   Two hand towels  two wash clothes  two bath towels  and a floor towel were all included   They even had little shampoo  conditioner  liquid soap  an lotion  just in case you forgot your own and havent had a moment to pop down to the drugstore   There is a smart t v  with cable and the ability to hook up to subscription services  if you so desire   Overall  very similar to a high quality hotel stay   The only negative is the check in service   It is elf check in  with the first being a callbox outside the building   You have to scroll through dozens of numbers to find Zencitys name or number  but unfortunately it wasnt even there for me   When I got a number to buzz myself in  the buzzer wasnt working   I contacted them  and they quickly addressed it  making a universal number so I could enter   Once I got into the building  it was smooth sailing   Love them   Will likely stay at Zencity locations whenever I visit KC  Be sure that method to get in the building is working  The property was wonderful  but this is the second Zencity location Ive been to that multiple guests have had problems getting into the building 
568813618801747531,Amazing stay  Great location and solid organization  Would definitely stay again  Thank You 
431870498680691805,The listing is accurate  this is an amazing one bedroom in Hyde Park  The location is stellar  with the   being right outside and the lake just steps away  The flat itself met all of our needs  with me favorite details including the walk in closet with luggage rack and the Zencity Netflix   and checking in out was as easy as a hotel    The building amenities  lobby coworking space in particular  take the stay over the top  Although parking in this area can be tricky  we found street parking just fine    Id return for sure  Thanks for the clean apartment  There were a few imperfect details  like the kitchen towel being dirty from both stains and recent residue  the shower rack having residue on it  and some of the cups needing a second wash 
434730562353570406,Great place 
408625345939035810,Perfect location for everything we had on our agenda 
568809818490717125,Great place and wonderful location
491289305786350591,Close to Belmont station and many restaurants  highly recommend  I loved the apartment  It was quiet and extremely comfortable  Where do you get those sheets  
420993082504940697,Was notified a couple of hours before check in that my stay was canceled due to a lost key fob  When asked about my refund they said I had to cancel the reservation myself  So   Iwent to the cancellation page and clicked the tab for host needs to cancel   which a request is sent to the host   I noticed a day later that the request hadnt been taken care of so I messaged them and they said they never got a cancellation   I them what process I used and they said they couldnt cancel I had to    there was no option that wouldnt have taken all of mypayment so I told them I sent another request and they still refused   Air bnb had to be contacted to settle the matter unfortunately with this whole process wasting multiple hours of my time that I should have been operating my business   Shady Practices
419487659501712116,There were some discrepancies in listing and our stay  The apartment smelled like smoke even though it is listed as no smoking  There was no shampoo  conditioner  or body wash in apartment after listing states otherwise   Also some surfaces were sticky  and dirty rags stuffed into corners and furniture  Some other inconveniences were difficult parking  loud neighbors traffic construction  broken elevator  and very poor shower pressure  Check in out was easy and location was close to everything we liked to do  Thanks for letting us stay  there were a few discrepancies between listing and actual stay 
400008042427436241,The location is great and the owners are prompt in their communication  however  the rest of this listing was not as advertised  The owners are not accommodating to any minor check in requests and the furniture and fixtures are broken and dirty  The owners need to invest in this property significantly to bring it back to the standard of when these photos were taken  This listing was not as advertised  The furniture and fixtures are broken and dirty  For example  the bed in the back bedroom broke   times  just by sitting on the edge  The coffee table was old and wobbly  the couch was dirty  the bedframe in the back bedroom was stained  Every single light flickered to a point where the lights were unusable  I am extremely dissatisfied with this listing 
434792619194388570,I had a nice time here  No complaints at all 
428175574862516249,Lovely apartment stocked with everything we needed  Great location a couple blocks away from restaurants  cafes  and shops along Lafayette Square  The rooftop was patio was nice too  Thank you  Beautiful apartment  We never received the parking pass but we were fine parking on the street  The sheets had a very strong cologne smell   I had to wash them because my husband has an allergy sensitivity  Overall  we had a lovely stay 
499317003686691390,Great space  comfortable bed and pretty quiet 
405074576992228214,Really nice apartment with great views  The host did a great job communicating and the people in the building were really friendly  I highly recommend staying at least one night just to experience the views  Great location  and views  Great communication with host
434750107641019651,The apartment is quiet and nice  Thanks      all
568124289687486430,Very clean and good location  There is not a coffee maker  but rather a coffee press  We didn t have one in our condo  but was supposed to be brought one during our stay  The communication wasn t great with the host  but they did respond to our calls and emails  We just weren t able to meet at a time convenient for us both  Also  the tv is streaming only and it did buffer quite a bit  Overall good experience  Definitely need a coffee maker or change description bc it is listed as having one Communication should just be with one host  I feel there was misunderstanding bc emailing and calling different people  We never received the coffee press  Also  I did get your last message but I was tired of dealing with it  Tv was steaming only and buffered alot  Also  I would suggest your host being more flexible and helpful  In the past I have had host provide recommendations when I have had questions about the area  This host just directed me to google apps  Just felt a little unfriendly  If room is available for guests traveling a far distance there should be flexibility on being able to check in  I feel like even if it was available my just could care less about allowing us an early check in  Overall very clean place and good location   However Would likely not rent again from this company due to the lack of communication and hospitality 
430370699145994448,Very pleasant  br apartment where we enjoyed a nice weekend  The location is perfect  transit and many restaurants and   small grocery stores nearby  It was easy to get to and from anywhere we wanted to go around the city  The kitchen was very clean and it was easy to prepare food in there  we even found a french press and coffee grinder  Beds are super comfortable  Check in process with door codes was extremely easy  The building itself was nice and quiet  just the sounds of Division Street filtering in  Central AC worked very well on a hot day   Some supplies are weirdly missing  like theres a drip coffee pot but no coffee filters  and there is a washer and dryer but no laundry detergent  The TV didnt work  The rest of the apartment was reasonably clean although we did find dead insects on the bathroom windowsill and some sunflower seeds and other small items under the coffee table  When we messaged the hosts about the broken TV and then about laundry detergent  they responded very quickly  but they werent able to actually assist us with either issue  The message conversation would just sort of stop until a few hours later when a host with a different name would pick it up again 
420280513260095023,Great  comfortable  clean place   Cant wait to stay here again  change door to a shorter code
493498505104225447,Keep quiet and respect the neighborhood and you ll be just fine it s a amazing neighborhood and city couldn t ask for a better experience Great neighborhood great apartment quiet and quaint would of liked a real coffee pot and I had   shower jets that didn t work and you have to be quiet after    with   people for Chicago first time  which we only had   would have like the whole floor no neighbors lol other than that really nice vacation
426734805145237671,Great spot  Wine bar and restaurant  Starbucks and many other smaller restaurants and business within      ft  Parking situation was tricky at first but I found free spaces no problem  The home was clean  comfortable and under a mile to wrigley field  Hoping to return to Chicago and land this spot again  Loved the place  Thanks for having me 
425283166743807479,Great location  Quiet neighbors   If adjust days from request  include Day and date  Fee is too high for amenities  Provide shampoo and conditioner at minimum  Customer service was slow to respond and not helpful  Adequate and good location  Great location  Quiet neighbors   If adjust days from request  include Day and date  Fee is too high for amenities  Provide shampoo and conditioner at minimum  Customer service was slow to respond and not helpful  Adequate and good location 
428225207506123892,A very clean and spacious place in a super convenient location   We loved the balcony view  comfortable chairs  Fun to watch the midwest thunderstorm roll in while enjoying our morning coffee out there   Both beds were super comfortable  and we couldnt hear a lot of noise from the street  or from the other rooms  Steps from Water Tower  John Hancock  and just a mile walk to Navy Pier  We loved having a Starbucks and grocery market  IN the ground floor of the building   Amazon lockers  too    Theres a hair salon  facial spa  airbrush tan place in the building  too  Lisas Nails  Oak Street   Eataly and Big Bowl are a few favorite nearby spots  Communication was efficient  One note  we got a late check out  and realized the key code stops working promptly      So  almost got locked out when we took the trash out     The doorman saved the day  Heads up  There seemed to be a LOT of dogs in this building  always one or two in the elevators  lobby  hallways  etc  Pro for us  but I know thats not for everyone  Hi  We really enjoyed our stay at   E Delaware in Chicago   A few things at check in    The coffee grinder in the kitchen was broken upon arrival  The folding doors in front of washer dryer unit had been removed and were tucked in the closet area  didnt impact anything during stay  just letting you know    There is a line tear down the entire shade in the back bedroom  Again  didnt impact our stay at all  just a heads up    The last tenant did not leave key fob so we had to pick up next day from office  We had late check out  noon  but key code didnt work past   am  Im guessing its an auto shut down at     though   I bought a bag of laundry detergent pods for place  left on top of washing machine for next guests    Place was really great   THANK YOU     Erin
404330857769987543,This place was a nice quick place to stay and it was in a nice area  but the communication was absolutely TRASH  We couldn t get into the building when we were staying for an hour  they don t communicate back  and there was no key or key fob to enter the build or to use the elevator  The customer service line tries to belittle you when your seeking help due to them not having everything together   They knew they had extra key cards in the P O  Box yet tried to make me wait to the next day for a key to enter the building  The stay space is pretty nice other the a few poorly constructed parts but i find myself wondering was the  cheap convenience stay worth all of the inconvenience   
444945701484218045,The stay was nice the place was in a great location the parking was confusing but overall I enjoyed the space The stay was nice the place was in a great location the parking was confusing but overall I enjoyed the space the WIFi cut in and out
407174074727222331,Wonderful service Thanks for the visit  will be doing my stays in the future with you again 
429655679461831640,Great place to stay for any event planned 
415225684282060224,Great place for my sisters and I to stay during our weekend visit  Check in and out times are pretty firm which is to be expected  but we landed at  am and there was no wiggle room on an early check in  Thanks for the solid communication before and during our stay  My one note   the place was not as clean as I would have liked  the floor needs a good mop  there was hair in the bathroom  and lint catcher in the dryer was full  scary    Overall  great location and neighborhood 
424618408648628161,He view of Lake Michigan is amazing  The kitchen and bath needs an upgrade but is functional  Great location for a visit to university of chicago  Missing one bedside table     It still has drywall mud and a     finished repair where the bedside table was torn from wall  And  The shower and the sink faucets should be replaced  The shower curtain rings should be replaced  Kitchen appliances old but still functional  Unit      in regency should be on a list for a kitchen bath remodel  Otherwise this was a great rental property and can get top dollar 
404295956186774037,Pros  good location  quiet stay  clean and modern  and the rooftop pool was amazing  Bed was super comfy and has a large bathroom   Cons  check In and using the parking pass were a bit confusing for non city folks  The microwave did not work and there is no coffee maker  but a French press with no coffee nor fixings  Luckily I brought coffee grounds and since there wasn t a kettle  I had to boil water in a pot on the stove to make coffee lol  For the money spent  I d at least want a working microwave and make coffee easier    Overall it was a nice place  The apartment was very nice but it only has the very basic items  If you want to cook  bring a knife  scissors  salt and pepper  etc  We had a great stay  The microwave does not work and the check in and parking was pretty confusing so I think even more detailed instructions are needed   For example the lock box to get the key is really easy to miss because it s on a back corner out of view when you enter the mail room  And we didn t know the key fob was needed for the elevator  The garage doesn t show a barcode scanner for the pass so that was confusing as well  Also should have stated there was only a French press for coffee  The kitchen did not include any scissors or knives which would be nice  The floor lamp on and off switch was broken 
567432586660265447,Another great stay with Zencity  Thanks for the stay

429620240441419620,Cozy apartment in a well maintained building with a door person in the lobby   Location is unbeatable with coffee shops  restaurants  Whole Foods within     minute walk   Across the street from the most beautiful park Forest Park  Would rent again on another trip  Apartment is cozy for   people in a GREAT neighborhood     Coffee shops and restaurants within   block as well as Forest Park  Would rent again in this building with excellent security with a person at the entrance 
465884039682633326,The check in process was not good  We never received codes for the two doors and had to be on hold with air bnb for    minutes before we got assistance getting into the building and our unit  The left side window was left open and could not close so we had to shove a blanket in the gap to keep the cool air in  Also only   of the   bathroom lights worked which left us showering and getting ready in a pretty dark bathroom  The whole building smells like marijuana  The unit was overall nice  It had a comfortable bed   dishes and cookware  Roku  the proximity to attractions and the grocery store was great  The unit itself was fine  The check in process was not good  We never received codes for the two doors and had to be on hold with air bnb for    minutes before we got assistance   The left side window was left open and could not close so we had to shove blanket in the gap to keep the cool air in  Also only   of the   bathroom lights worked which left us showering and getting ready in a pretty dark bathroom  The whole building smells like marijuana  The space itself was nice  comfortable bed the location to attractions and the grocery store was great 
567378714857221190,I really enjoyed my stay It was a great place to stay 
453628133493931775,The rooms are not bad and spacious enough  but communication is a bit difficult  My sons toys are forgotten in the house and we hope to get them back   But there is no fellow 
425356137533397923,The location on the check in wasnt very accurate  The doors that we should have entered should have been better marked  When we booked the hotel  we read a lot of the reasons comments about being able to get in  They were mostly true  The first time we couldnt get in unless someone let us in and swiped their badge in the elevator  Once we got to our room  it was easy to get in and then we had the key fob to use for the remainder of the trip   location was great  The pool and workout room was closed because it was under renovation  which not conveyed to us before booking the hotel doll we were very disappointed about that  We could have stayed on other locations that would have been a bit cheaper that didnt have one  Otherwise it was clean and nice  Fix your initial check in process  Fix your listing to say that gym and pool are not available due to renovations 
566729971295261124,This spot is in a perfect location  Close to every place I go to in KC  Just a little maintainance
423114085086342828,Very comfortable and would definitely return Thank you for the stay 
409413247369622278,My girlfriend and I recently went on a trip to KC and decided to try an Air B B  This is something that her and I have done before and have always had positive experiences with  After looking at a few different places  we landed on this posting and decided to book it since it was close to some bars and not far from the venue  The pictures looked amazing of the place and even though there was a review of it smelling like cigarette smoke  we still decided to give it a shot  Let me just say  the pictures were taken at the right angle with the right lighting because it looks NOTHING that in person    As soon as you open the door to the building  you are blasted with a strong odor of cigarette smoke  Once in the apartment  the smell is not as strong  but almost everything is filthy  The floors are stained and look like haven t been clean  The couch is completely stained  and she would not sit on it  There is a very small hallway that leads to the bedroom and doors on both sides  However  both doors are off their hinges and just hanging there  There is also burn marks on the wall next to the stove  I wish I could say that this was the only thing wrong with this listing  but nothing compared to what we found    While looking throughout the apartment  she came across a used needle sitting on top of the trashcan in the bathroom  My girlfriend and I decided to leave the place immediately as we now felt unsafe there  but not before she also found a dead cockroach in the air vent  We ended up finding a nearby hotel and calling the people who run the listing  At first  they promised as a full refund over the phone and that the place was unacceptable  however  the next day they messaged us and asked if they could send a clean company over as recompense  We told them that after only spending about    minutes there and finding everything we did   that there was no way we would stay and had already booked a hotel  They then proceeded to tell us that since we denied the clean company  they would not be able to give us a refund  Thankfully Airbnb customer service was able to help us and we eventually got the refund   My best advice I could give you is to stay clear of this listing  Spend the extra cash on a hotel so you do not have to deal with what we did 
447747254503323355,Thanks for helping us stay in such a fun neighborhood  Clean and spacious apartment was exactly what we needed  Thanks for helping us stay in such a fun neighborhood  Clean and spacious apartment was exactly what we needed 
446351886658533935,Thai Airbnb was great  really close to everything and kept up nicely  If you re visiting for a quick trip I definitely recommend it  The bars are pretty noising when falling asleep but if that doesn t bother you it s great 
428900532860475106,Check in was not fun  The fob did not work  but they did get us a new one  The parking place was small  our vehicle stuck out  but we were thankful it didn t get hit  The room was smaller than expected compared to the photos  There were no small appliances except a coffee pot  The freezer had an ice maker  however it did not work  The location was great  but we weren t very happy with the apartment  The headboard was lopsided due to the fact one side was not connected to the wall  It really needs more appliances  like a toaster  blender  mixer etc 
426079883889817059,Nice place  there was some sound from upstairs one night  maybe thin roof   but besides that it was on a quiet street and clean 
445561849991538562,Not bad  looks better in pictures 
399931250728651764,I have stayed here a twice and really enjoyed stay  The location is great  the building is secure and the hosts are very communicative  I highly recommend this place 
407199848702513416,Place was clean and located in a nice area  Thank you for everything you provided  it was a great stay 
434688603578487702,This is a great stay for Chicago  awesome location in a beautiful area while being affordable  Great place  the apt  was perfect  The gym wasnt open and an elevator was down when we were there but we made it work 
423140600910461465,Great stay  Staff was super friendly and apartment was clean and comfortable  Great stay  Quiet  great location  everyone was very friendly 
404304052734838924,This is a wonderful apartment  great location  When we arrived  around      pm  there was no one at the desk  We were able to find someone after a bit  but you might want to document what to do  Also  your message said that we would get a  welcome packet    what we got was a small hinged box with a key inside  That was sufficient but not exactly what I would call a  welcome packet     The rest of the stay was great   Unrelated     I broke one water glass    my apologies     I may have left some wrap around the back of your head headphones in the apartment  Let me know if anything was found  Thanks 
401403694185843052,Customer service with Zencity was terrible  The listing is the opposite of what the apartment actually is  This apartment is not equipped for long term stays  The kitchen was not a full kitchen  It had a limited amount of cutlery  barely any cooking pots  the dishwasher didnt work  and the bed was immensely uncomfortable   enough to give us back pain for the remainder of our stay  When we first walked in  it smelled like gas in the apartment  The HDMI cable didnt work and kept glitching and popping  When we tried to watch TV shows in the living room  we couldnt sit on the couch for any time because it was so uncomfortable and very disgusting   along with the carpets   Overall   the price does not make it worth the stay here  Hello   a couple of points that we think you can improve on   We felt like you werent very flexible or communicative with us  Initially when we wanted to cancel due to flight issues related to COVID  and there was no flexibility  Later on  we reached out about issues the lock code and never received a response  but luckily that issue was resolved quickly  Lastly  we reached out about forgetting something in the apartment  and we received no word back  even after we suggested going back and grabbing it ourselves   You had listed that it was a full kitchen  comfortable bed  equipped for long term stay  The kitchen was not a full kitchen  It had a limited amount of cutlery  barely any cooking pots  the dishwasher didnt work  and the bed was immensely uncomfortable   enough to give us back pain for the remainder of our stay  When we first walked in  it smelled like gas in the apartment which got us nervous the first few days  The HDMI cable didnt work and kept glitching and popping  When we tried to watch TV shows in the living room  we couldnt sit on the couch for any time because it was so uncomfortable and very disgusting   along with the carpets   We dont think that this airbnb was valued at the     K we paid  We will be reaching out for a refund of some sorts because of how deceptive the listing was 
450630025494810931,  Apartment is fine   Area feels unsafe at night   Not very smooth checkin process   Strong weed smell in building   Lift was filthy like a bathroom   Parking space was far from the building and kinda unsafe   host was responsive though
426741795422152359,I really appreciated the clean and comfy space to rest on my long journey  Everything was accurate to the description and I loved the cool apartment building  Coffee shop right next door  Much needed  thank you 
566654120870059214,It was okay just not really what you would expect to get out of a place to stay  It was not very clean when we got there and they messed up our check in so we had to wait an hour after we were supposed to be able to check in before we could even get in the room  Overall it wasn t the worst place I ve ever stayed but I wouldn t recommend it unless it s like your last option  It wasn t super clean  the bathroom and kitchen were pretty gross when we got there and the blinds are basically all broken 
430339618703945715,Zencity agents were very pleasant and quick to respond to questions before and issues we encountered with appliances after check in  Unit is spacious in side  A great location on a quiet street with on side free parking   Unfortunately  I feel we were victims of false advertising regarding the rooftop deck photos which were an enticement for our booking  What we encountered were an unusable deck with  A peeling deck surface with some rotted boards  A couch with filthy  moldy cushions  No umbrella as in the photo  Dirty plastic chairs  A round orange storage table in the photo that was faded to a salmon shade and filthy inside  Obviously no maintenance had been done in years   The kitchen supplies were sub minimal  The listing is for six people and we had   coffee    forks  spoons  knives and plates  Plus steak knives   We only had four guests so we did not need to share mugs  Whether home or away most people will use more than one utensil or plate on many days   We did move the cushions on the sleeper couch and it Wes full of crumbs and debris  Obviously  not used or vacuumed in some time   Unless these issues are addressed I would not recommend spending the money   Kate Zencity agents were pleasant and quick to respond to my questions and the issues we had with the refrigerator and dishwasher  Unit location was great with plenty of interior space  quiet street with free parking   Unfortunately  we were victims of false advertising regarding the rooftop deck  The lovely photos on the listing of the deck are years old and were an enticement for the booking  What we encountered was an unusable deck with  A peeling deck surface with some rotted sections  A couch with dirty  moldy cushions  No  umbrella as in the photo  Dirty chairs  A storage table originally orange but faded to salmon shade and filthy inside  Obviously no maintenance has been done for years   Additionally  the kitchen supplies were lower than basic  Listing is for   guests and we only had   coffee mugs  six forks  spoons and plates total  Fortunately  we only had   guests so did not need to share mugs  In normal everyday living  whether home or away  most people will use more than one utensil or plate a day   Finally  when we moved the cushions on the sleeper couch to be used if there were   guests they had obviously not been moved or vacuumed under in a long time   Kate Grask
429624402750025750,This place was really cool  It was a little plain as far as apartment design  I felt like a little art work could really spruce the place up  It was mostly clean but I did find several hairs all over the place  probably from the last guest  that freaked me out a little  However it was clean enough for me  I also didn t like the coffee maker was not a regular one  more like a tea steep maker and I didn t know how to use it  I thought it was a little pricey but the location was everything  Many things to do in walking distance and the lake was beautiful  Also the pool in the building was refreshing  My best friend and I had a great time staying there  Would book again 
405019937914008967,Great space  Always pleased
404357670517825263,When we arrived at  pm  the temperature in the apartment was    degrees Fahrenheit  only   of the windows had screens  and Chicago in the summer has tons of flies   mosquitoes  so we couldnt do anything but turn on the AC and wait  at   pm  it was still     we eventually had to restart the furnace to kickstart it     An hour after we arrived  a maintenance person arrived to fix the dishwasher without warning   at  pm  FWIW  the dishwasher mostly did work for us as long as we ran it on normal  not express  but the lower rack was missing some wheels   The back yard shown in the photos as a nice place to hang out was filled with weeds and construction debris and completely impassable  The back stairs hadnt been swept in months or maybe years  there was serious grime on the side of the bathroom sink  cracks and peeling plaster in the walls and ceiling of the bathroom and living room  a tile in the bathroom was held in place with electrical tape  the floor was too dirty to walk barefoot  and when I lifted a couch cushion to retrieve a pen I had dropped  it was clear that it had been a looong time since that was vacuumed   And oh yeah   there was no back to the building  just tyvek paper waiting to have siding replaced   Sheets were thin   dingy polyester and pillows mattress were not even ikea quality   We tried multiple times to contact both Zencity and Airbnb support  The hosts were quick to reply before our stay  but rarely replied before     hours while we were there  even in the middle of the day    I have stayed in Airbnbs around the world and never had an experience like this  On the plus side  the location really is great   close to the      transit and restaurants  We tried several times to report issues during our stay and got only late responses and zero resolution  You need to do some serious work on this apartment before renting it 
420915243985792760,This is a very modern and cool apartment  It s very good for a stay away at St Louis and very close to attractions  Very clean room and new furnitures This is a so cool apartment  Everything was expected  Really enjoy the stay
427448282730772396,Poor communication  no central air conditioning and there are roaches  Great location near the water  Great restaurant nearby  Close to a lot of things  Overall won t be staying at this particular place again but loved the area  Very poor communication  not a great way to end the trip 
425326918902402222,This unit is in a great location  and its walkable to so much   Its on the third floor and is pretty quiet   As other reviewers have stated  the Wifi is very poor borderline unusable   We could not really get anything to load  and we gave up on it after about an hour of being there   The unit is sparsely furnished  so you cant really entertain anybody there  but it works just fine if there are two people who dont need to use the unit for much other than sleeping and getting ready   I would stay there again if the Wifi was fixed  Hello   the Wifi in the unit is very bad borderline unusable   It needs to be changed   We could hardly get anything to load  and we gave up after our first hour of being there   Other guests have also commented on this in their reviews   That is the one thing that would cause me to reconsider staying there again   Other than that  the place was great 
425133951022374189,It is clean and valuable for living here
420992220606559367,Great location  we didnt find the train noise disturbing  Check in   check out were smooth and easy  good instructions  For those with a car  there are some parking spots nearby on SpotHero  most ranging from        night  We found one which was in the alley across the street  very close and well lit  We had a great stay  thanks  Wed recommend replacing the shower liner when possible  it has a fair amount of mold   grime  Otherwise the unit was great 
420256608002734550,this place was really nice  we stayed here for the Lollapalooza festival and it was a good distance away  not too far at all  Parking was a little confusing but i think that was just because we re not from the area  We were super close to so much  Chinatown was super close and so many restaurants  Only complaint i had was that the walls are very very thin  I could hear every step that came from the family upstairs and it became kind of hard to sleep past     am because of the constant  very loud noises  But the place was clean and comfortable    thank u so much for letting us stay in your place  everything was great besides the upstairs noise but that s not really your fault    I think the only thing i would say is parts of the shower seemed a little dirty  but other than that our stay was very nice
419539829548910530,Its okay     stars   Its a place to sleep  thats about it   Couple of things to be aware of    No Access to Rooftop social area  This was an issue because the apartment itself offers limited seating   a couch that barely fits      bar stools  and a small   seat table   Also  the view isnt of Chicago   just a back alley    Could be cleaner  Expect to wear shoes or slippers while inside   The floor was filthy   expect to wash your feet if you walk around barefoot  Showers need scrubbed  you can tell its been awhile   Like I said  its a place to sleep   although a bit pricey   Wouldnt rent again for the price   Check in and check out were simple  Great place for a short weekend getaway   Couple of things of note     The apartment is listed as sleeping as     it clearly only sleeps     The two bedrooms are fine      however the couch is not sleepable and shouldnt be listed as so    Please dont show the rooftop in pics if its not accessible  that was one of the reasons we chose this location  The apartment has limited seating for lounging and socializing  the couch barely fits   grown men  and we were looking forward to hanging out on the rooftop    Apartment needs a deep clean  The floor is filthy   you couldnt walk around barefoot without your feet turning black from dirt  Also  the showers need a good scrubbing   you can see how dirty the grout it    Blinds need fixed  The cent blind in the living area is severely broken   Blinds in the bedrooms are twisted and dont function properly    Ice maker on fridge is broken
407254631062106039,Great place  I would recommend it  I followed the instructions on entering the front gate of the apartment but the intercom was never prompted to say the code  I had to wait for someone from inside to open the door 
427452189132891098,My girlfriend and I arrived at the air bnb around   pm and saw a man carrying a weapon directly outside of the building  After he left we tried to get inside which was very confusing and took us roughly    minutes  We weren t aware that the parking was located off site and was a good      minute drive away from the apartment lined with bars and groups of men  We decided after driving to the parking garage that the safest decision for us  as two woman alone at night  would be to park in front of the building and move it in the morning because of the parking meters  When we got inside it wasn t messy but it wasn t clean  It smelled like weed  there were stains on the couch and bed bugs  We contacted the hostess immediately  who was very professional every time we communicated  and informed them that we would not be staying the two nights that we had previously reserved  They did an inspection on the room and claimed there were no bed bugs despite the bites we had both received  We made it clear that we had already booked a hotel and would not be returning  They refused to give us a refund but told us we were safe to stay there  Essentially we paid      to walk into a building where we felt incredibly unsafe the entire time  use the bathroom once and leave with bed bug bites 
536283069969121872,    bigger  cleaner  comfy bed  great view of arch
423198681275127663,Great place with stunning forest park view 
418050959206821229,The unit is well maintained and in a great location  We plan to stay here again in the future  Important to note that it is on the third floor if stairs are an issue for you  the front door f the building does not lock  this is a serious security issue
409326646353167268,Our stay at the Zencity was perfect  Very clean  perfect location  and easy check in out  We loved it especially for our quick weekend getaway  We loved our stay  We needed a quick weekend away and this was perfect for us  It s in a great location and we were able to have so much fun 
417335410336227993,Best experience stay I ve had thus far with Airbnb  Perfect stay thank you
423181291086538701,Everything was clean and well put together wouldn t mind booking again Thank you so much Well put together and everything was nice and clean my stay was awesome Thanks a lot
434756745771753877,The apartment was clean and well appointed  Great location near the park and hospital    There were coffee shops and restaurants a block away   It was a great apartment for our stay in St  Louis   If we have the opportunity to return to St  Louis  we would look forward to staying in the apartment again 
415222011467830587,The location is good and the apt is livable   For two older adults with bad backs the bed was not comfortable  but a younger person might be fine with it  location is great  place was ok  if a bit tired  Bed was not very comfortable  but we were happy that the air conditioning was good  needs a new shower curtain and a thorough clean
410872206241786777,The place has great windows and views 
409428354778031983,Great apartment and great location
409402429661899391,Good place to stay with close by amenities Good place to stay with lots of close by amenities
501455179176108255,Great host and very clean and well positioned apartment  Had a slight hiccup with check in but they resolved it quickly 
529686492546758415,The apartment was not clean and there was a lot of residue from the previous tenants  Definitely not hygienic and we were upset to have been charged the clean fee  Me and my friend ended up detail clean a lot of the apartment    After we got settled in we enjoyed the apartment very much  Zencity was very communicative and we enjoyed our overall stay  The apartment was not clean  lots of body hair from the previous tenant in the bathroom etc   Definitely not hygienic and upsetting  Me and my friend ended up detail clean a lot of the apartment    After we got settled in we enjoyed the apartment very much  Zencity was very communicative and we enjoyed our overall stay 
564557042837798950,Great place Thanks
413028058999333328,Great location near groceries  restaurants  and the uni  A safe spot  My only complaint was that the apartment wasn t clean  It wasn t bad  but it could ve done with a sweep  Floor wasn t swept and the toilet wasn t flushed  There was a wad of hair on my pillowcase  Great spot  just by the tidiest  It s a simple fix  Thanks again 
446286455166828586,First and foremost  this place is not a luxury studio  You are paying for location only  Check in was super easy  the door staff helped and were super nice    It sucks to complain about something on public reviews  as i worked in the service industry for over a decade and know sometimes they are not true  However  I can t say anything positive about this place  and many issues were stated in previous visits by others  As was said in some other reviews  the place was dirty  The floors were gross  there was dirt hair dust everywhere  The bed frame was either loose or broken  so every move you made was super loud  There are two bedside lamps connected to one switch  and only one of them worked    Additionally  as said in some other reviews  the internet did not work  There was no WiFi connection available or searchable  and the tv also did not work  I tried to reset the router  and I changed the remote batteries but still did not work  After contacting the host about these issues on Friday  I got no response again and no one showed up to address them  With nothing to do while in the place  almost no service  could not use laptop too   I ended up not staying one night and left a night early  I finally got a response from the host about issues when I notified them I had left and checked out a day early  I offered to send videos of issues in addition to the pictures I sent the resolution center as well   This place is in a great location  you can walk just about everywhere downtown  but that s about all the good things I can say about it  For the price of Air BnB s now and the cost of       for a five day stay  it was one of the worst values I could think of  I have asked for a refund  but you definitely find better stays or equal value or with better hosts around the city  Stay away  there are better places and hotels in the area  This place isn t a luxury studio  It was dirty  the floors were disgusting  One of the two bedside lamps worked  the bed frame was either broken or loose as it was super loud  The internet and Tv remote didn t work  so I literally had nothing to do while in the air bnb  I couldn t use my laptop  and barely had phone service  I didn t stay one of my nights and left a night early  After contacting you about the issues with the place on Friday  no one answered until the day I left when I told you I was leaving  For the price of Air BnB s now           Really   and especially this one  this was an absurdly poor stay  I could have stayed at the hotel around the corner instead and had no issues  The location is great yes  but you cannot call this a luxury studio at all  I won t ever use Zen City again  and I asked for a partial refund through the resolution center  but am going to ask for a full one due to lack of communication from a host about issues and I didn t even stay the whole time  As I sent in a message before  I have videos of said issues too  couldn t upload them in the resolution center  
422424072976742296,Great location  view  and building amenities  Have stayed several times and will stay again  Thanks for another great stay  I really appreciate you being so accommodating  I do want to privately note that the bathroom sink has ants and the shower curtain needs a deep clean or to be replaced  Otherwise I enjoyed my time  once again 
439111438558883899,Amazing location  safety and overall value Amazing stay will recommend to friends
434744279510732503,Great location  nice unit  Very centrally located  close to the train   Check in and communication was easy and prompt   Plan to get all your own supplies  spices  oil  coffee  etc  if you re going to do any cooking in the unit  It was slightly less clean than I would like but not horribly so  It was surprisingly bare bones  no laundry detergent  no salt pepper olive oil  Coffee would be nice since there is a French press  The grout mildew in the showers is a bit gross and could be fixed   Also there is no drain plug for the bathtub  hard when you want to give your kid a bath  and the soap dispenser in the master bath didn t help work 
432560938697840829,We really enjoyed our stay here   The location is great and the place had a terrific view   But  as others have noted  there were few amenities  for example  there were not basic items for making coffee and no soap in one of the bathrooms   Also  the apartment was a bit dark and needed more lighting  especially in the bedrooms  Thanks for a great stay   The location is great and the place had a terrific view   There were few amenities  including basic items for making coffee and no soap in one of the bathrooms   We were told that we would be given a key FOB  but that never came   Also  the place is not well lit and felt especially dark in the bedrooms 
431853933850969831,Very clean and efficient space to stay in   Zencity responded quickly to my questions  Check in and check out were easy  Even though it is a studio  there is a lot of room to relax  The shower curtain could use a plastic curtain for inside the shower in addition to the single curtain that is there now    The apartment was nice   Thank you  Harold Southern
431842872679390261,Great apartment  Very convenient to train  restaurants etc  Very secure  The closet door is off it s track  should probably just be removed  Also a regular coffee maker would be nice  But overall a great place to stay 
431792757119163463,It was OK  Nothing special it s an old building remodeled  The place Wasn t clean well  I had some issues in my stay with the noise sensor  I kept getting text messages saying that I was to loud when I didn t even have the TV or the radio on  We were just talking  Location is Good because you re  on the Gold Coast and a lot of things nearby  I had an OK stay  Just upset that kept getting those messages about a noise complaint when there was no music and no TV  We were just talking  Hopefully you guys can fix that because it s unpleasant 
431100955910450335,I would recommend this unit to somebody staying there  its definitely a place to come back to and rest and refuel between adventures in the city  its sleek and attractive and not very homey  but its a beautiful little spot for a great value  and of they have a vacancy its do convenient to arrange a late check out or extra day  would wholly recommend  the blinds are a little older and hard to manage though  so be patient with them or deal w that bright Chicago sun each morning through huge windows  it was a solid stay   nd time w yall and I would come again  the furniture could have been more comfortable but its all a great value 
491360743572381480,Great place and view 
431092695592681587,This is a great Airbnb  but it was really dirty  The couch is grungy and stained  the floors were sticky  there were dead bugs and clumpy dust in the windows  and there was long hairs in the sheets  Convenience and value couldnt be better  but it is not clean well  There were clean supplies in the apartment  so we just clean up ourselves  but if you dont want to do that  Id suggest another Airbnb  This is a great Airbnb  but it was really dirty  The couch is grungy and stained  the floors were sticky  there were dead bugs and dust in the windows  and there was hair in the sheets  I think thats a little ridiculous considering that there are many reviews that said the place is not clean well  and I made a comment about the cleanliness before our stay  If the apartment had been clean  everything wouldve been perfect 
431089373455006700,Nice place overlooking charming  colorful park with a great view of the big lake    Plenty of good eateries close by  Parking a little difficult   One easy way to make the place tremendously better   the charm of the place is the view of the lake  wash the windows   wow what a sunrise can do   one other thing  maybe the floor clean product is off   leaving a sticky residue   I saw this complaint on another review   Or maybe the floor just needed a wash   Thanks  
431084189107696308,unit is good size  no frills unit  moderately stocked  but the view from the balcony is great if you like that whole sunset thing     also I really like the location and check process was smooth  checkin process was efficient  units location was great  you understood the balcony  the view was great  sunset side too   the lights positioning in the bedroom is terrible  good size room though   The negatives was the clogged bathroom drain  dirty dishes in the cabinets I had to wash to use  dusts  sticky platter marks on wall  some I clean off 
429682912964647599,Great space  Great location  Excellent communication and easy access to the apt  The place was very nice  Location couldn t be any better  Same building as my daughter who we were visiting    A couple of things needed clean though  One I mentioned to you while we were there  The other   are the middle frame  where the   panes meet and lock  of the bathroom window was caked with dust  The last one is the cold air return  If you sit on the sectional and look left at it it s gross 
470249460456670904,The property location is good and unit is cute overall  as long as it s clean and maintained   The unit wasn t ready on time  but the company did notify us that they d need additional time to clean  Even when we got in  we found some things that weren t clean  The Zencity employee did what he could to help address things we saw  We later found that the fan light in bedroom was missing a battery so we couldn t use the fan without the light  Also  the AC was set such that it turned off in the middle of the night  There s a setting to fix so we were able to do so for our last night  Lastly  the pool and workout facility were closed which wasn t known until we checked in  Hi  I understand that you had a group prior to us that stayed for a long time and left a mess  I d recommend planning a longer time to do a thorough clean after a party like that including checking to see that everything works as appropriate  Also  the fan light in bedroom needed a battery  You may also include in the property description if the pool and or workout facility are closed 
471708111414102288,I got there  they don t have on site parking which is stated  so parking was interesting  The guard wasn t very helpful on getting upstairs  It isn t clearly stated how to get upstairs  there s multiple elevators but only   for the lofts  which I only found out by a nice bystander  I get upstairs only to be greeted by feces in the toilet  and hair all over the apartment  In the sinks  the counters  on the floor s   and of course when I had to check the beds  it was there  I contacted  Zencity  and they responded quite quickly saying they d send a clean crew  So I left for dinner in hopes by the time I walked back it would be solved  However  this was not the case and when I attempted to contact them  they were not as responsive  No clean crew arrived so I was left to wash the sheets myself after driving     hours  Took me til     pm to finally sleep  They charge     for clean fee and when I asked for a refund they initially declined and then resulted in giving me     wish has not yet been given back    weeks later  Nice location but disgusting attempt to sell an apartment  Highly do not recommend  Maybe under new management  Zencity is terrible 
563804732875967967,This location is exceptional for anything downtown  especially if youre in town for a conference at the KC Convention Center  a show at the Kauffman Performing Arts Center  or an event at the T Mobile Center  Everything downtown was in walking distance  coffee  grocery store  restaurants  bars  and the unit is   blocks from the free KC Street car if you need to get to River Market  Crown Center or Union Station  Very clean too  Though there are a bunch of steps to get in  front door call box  lock box  elevator  door lock  finding the parking garage  getting back    its not too complicated if you just follow the guidance provided  but give yourself       minutes to do it all the first time   Great location and a very clean apartment  I also appreciate the add on day for      The chalk board in the unit has the wrong Wifi network and password  so would suggest updating    otherwise  no complaints here 
523213038531094309,We enjoyed almost everything about our stay  However  there is a loud chirping sound coming from an alarm in the hallway on the floor the room is located  It went off about once a minute for the duration of our stay  which made it hard to totally relax  The building is generally loud  especially in the evening but it quieted down before midnight  The front and back doors  to the outside of the building  were not locked for the duration of our stay  which is perhaps a safety concern    The parking is located about a block away  so I would caution walking to and from the parking garage at night by oneself   Overall  the unit itself was very clean and cozy  The bed is comfortable  and the host stocked the unit with clean towels  paper towels  TP  coffee  and a cute French press  The unit has nice decor  blankets  a comfortable couch  and a TV  We would book this Airbnb again  We enjoyed almost everything about our stay  However  there is a loud chirping sound coming from an alarm in the hallway on the  th floor  It went off about once a minute for the duration of our stay  The front and back doors  to the outside of the building  were not locked for the duration of our stay  which is perhaps a safety concern 
491314687475294345,Solid place to crash while in Kansas city
563724828162137303,Great place to stay  Clean  and great location  Wish there was some more cooking equipment in the kitchen and the wifi speed was pretty slow but usable  The only reason I didnt give   stars was the lack of cooking equipment in the kitchen  and slow internet speeds  Measuring cups and a peeler are a must  Everything else was wonderful thank you for the stay 
470236797537172288,The check in process was easy  there is a box in the lobby with the key and fob that requires a code to open  The fob is required to enter the side door and for the elevator  The location is nice  with a lot of delicious food options nearby  Parking is not included  but there is a parking garage very close by or meter parking on the street    The unit was small  a little dirty  and had a slight musty odor  but was fine for me since I didnt spend much time in it  There is a window ac unit that is loud and you can also hear all the cars and ambulances from the road below    All of the Zencity staff and most of the building staff were incredibly helpful and friendly  Just a heads up  the bathroom sink is slow to drain  the toilet is not sealed to the floor and rocks side to side  the hot water in the shower sometimes took   min to warm up  Also  most of the building workers at the front desk were incredibly friendly  however one questioned what I was doing in the building and didnt think I belonged there even though I had an obvious key fob that I used to call the elevator 
468805413042612267,Place was so much better than a hotel room   Furniture was basic but comfortable   While I would not describe this as luxurious  it was definitively as good as the best hotel in town that I have had  regularly stay at Hilton    The one draw back is location   this is a residential building   there is no restaurant attached to the building  and nothing within short walking distance   Overall   great experience  and will consider this as an option again in the future  Place was so much better than a hotel room   Furniture was basic but comfortable   While I would not describe this as luxurious  it was definitively as good as the best hotel in town that I have had  regularly stay at Hilton    The one draw back is location   this is a residential building   there is no restaurant attached to the building  and nothing within short walking distance   Overall   great experience  and will consider this as an option again in the future 
531221790034969989,Zencity   was the absolute worst experience ever  I have so many complaints where do I begin  My initial   p m  check in  didnt happen until after   p m  due to the fact that I never received instructions as they indicated after two attemptsof contacting  Zencity   they sent the information at      p m  I was charged almost       when found out later that the price was     per night  Guests arent allowed to control the heat  and that weekend iKC was inclement weather   so it was freezing   Excessive dog barking throughout the night  dog feces in the hallway all weekend   the elevator had trash in it  the downstairs foyer was filfthy with cigarette butts and leaves lying around   All which I have photos and shared with Zencity and AirBnB  The mist disturbing   was when we tried to lay down and found hairs in the bed  and decided to change linen  When changing the linen  we noticedmultiple stains on pillows andmattress cover   The mattress was in fact flipped upside down   to hide the portion that was the most soiled  I immediately contacted Zencity support   with my concern and he instructed me to send photos   I  sent photos of the pillows   mattress cover   hairs in the shower  the wall  damaged blinds and nose matter that was on the shower curtain   He offered to send someone up in the a m  to clean  but it was already after   a m  and we were beyond tired  Seeing my frustration   he offered to move us after a hour of going back and forth and also stayed how he would request a full refund  The unit he moved us too  was cleaner  but freezing as we can not control the heat  I have complained to Zencity and AirBnB   multiple times and sent over a dozen photos   multiple times  Even though I was subject to a dirty unit  I still clean and took photos   so they are dated and times stamped  so no one can ever say that I was a poor guest   I have requested a refund  in which the offer was     off next stay  I will never stay in Zencity properties again  So declining that offer they told me a     refundis all they can do for     dollars After all the BS we were subjected to  that was the ultimate disrespect   Zencity   was a horrible host  that only cares about their accounts and not the guests       I  suggest anything other than Zencity Out of all my years of traveling   this was by far the worst experience ever  My initial reservation was booked for another unit  but the dates conflicted  so I requested to cancel  Zencity   mentioned that I would be penalized     for a cancelation so I did request for another unit  that could accommodate those dates  The new unit was more expensive  yet smaller  but once again I would be charged a     cancelation fee  so I had no choice but to accept   The day of checkin was scheduled for          at   p m  in which upon check in  I would receive instructions   I didnt receive those instructions until almost   p m  and that was after two attempts of contacting Zencity staff   The late check in was the first issue  Secondly   after arriving back to the unit after our New Years Eve plans  we were prepared to lay down for the night  but when the sheets were turned down  we saw multiple hairs in the bed  Seeing that therewas spare linen in the closet   we attempted to change the sheets in which the pillows and mattress cover was heavily stained  In fact the top of the mattress was flipped upside down  because of how soiled the cover was  I instantly called Zencity support in which he asked to send photos  I not only sent photos of the soil mattress cover and pillows but the extremely long hairs in the shower  and on the wall  The most disturbing photo was the snot that someone blew on the shower curtain   I made my complaint and frustration known to the support and told him that this was totally unacceptable  He did mention that he received the photos and how apologetic that he was  He did mention that he could send a member to clean the unit in the morning   but it was already after   a m   and we wanted to turn in for the night  so he offered to switch us units  due to the fact that it was so late  I only accepted because I already had so much invested into this unit  and being New Years weekend hotels were almost obsolete   After changing units we didnt lay down until almost   a m  Third complaint came from me searching for the Zencity customer support   I noticed that the unit we were staying in  was advertised at     per night  when I was charged almost          for a weekend and was told that the unit was more expensive that the original      per night unit  I had booked  So that was a whole other issue  The list of complaints can go on and on  Guests arent allowed to adjust heat  and need a access code  to use  The entire building was filfhty  from trash in the elevator all weekend   dog feces in the hallway  excessive dog barking all times of day  the downstairs foyer was dirty  cigarette butts  lying and around   and the place was just nasty  I took photos of everything that I mentioned and sent to the support team  making complaints and asking for some compensation   for such a horrible stay  They had the nerve to offer me     discount on a future stay  I will never stay or recommend Zencity to anyone   by the way I stayed in the KC location on Main Street  I did request the help of AirBnB  and displayed all photos of everything mentioned   So I am still waiting on a resolution   Final response fro  Zencity was a offer for      which is around     of what I paid for the entire weekend        I had the worst experience through Zencity and I recommend everyone to consider all other possible options  before booking with Zencity  to avoid the disrespect that I received 
571803248732316080,The location was great  The price was good for the area  But the bed was hard and uncomfortable and the bed frame squeaked loudly with any movement   The unit is sparsley decorated but clean  The location was great  The price was good for the area  But the bed was horrible   It was a plastic matress that was hard and uncomfortable   The bed frame squeaked with any movement and kept us up all night   We contacted Zen asking for them to fix the bed   but didnt hear back until  am while we were asleep  By the time we got their reply in the morning saying that someone could come by we were already checking out  The toilet didnt fully flush and the shower fluctuated between hot and cold  The sparse decorations made it feel cold and uninviting   Would you consider refunding us for one nights stay 
478172232768418386,My stay was splendid  The place is nice and  spacious but however  a thorough clean couldve been done  There were dirt under the bed  I took a book from the shelf to read but had to clean it before reading because it was very dusty  I had to wash a few of the dishes before using it  I wiped every surfaces  handles  remote  extra precautions I use because of Covid  before touch and placing my belongings  Other than missing a thorough clean  I felt safe in my airbnb  The instructions on how to find the airbnb and get into the airbnb was precisely clear and easy to follow  Everything I needed was provided  All types of entertainment was provided  I truly enjoyed my stay  Thank you  Zen   Lets talk about parking  Unless you have a permit to park  Id suggest you park you car where it wont get towed or ticketed and leave it there and just take the bus or train to your whereabouts  Save yourself extra money from paying to park when youre branching around   I hope you have an awesome GPS on your phone  The GPS guided me on how to get on the bus  train and anywhere else I needed to go  Thank you so much  I truly enjoyed my stay  I felt safe and comfortable  Things I needed were available  Thank you so much

562327953599479795,  night stay   Good location  bed was comfortable  did not find street parking to be an issue  I would offer two suggestions    We were not in the room a lot but when we were the internet would drop frequently   This rendered the TV useless during the day   Late at night it did seem to hold connection     The other concern is the thermostat sensor   I get that you want to save money but this is extreme   The room was    degrees when we came back from dinner Saturday evening    After an hour it was mid sixties   We had to remain in our winter coats 
562293100878459592,I was accused of taking the door fob  Something I would never do  The host wouldn t fix my dates like I requested and I ended up having to check out on Valentine s Day and I was not happy  Parking is absolutely horrible there is no available street parking at night and they feed the crow s outside the building I woke up to bird shit all over my car literally all over my car I suggest you pay to park  I always leave an air bnb in wonderful condition and I always leave the peoples stuff as is was before I arrived  I was very upset when I received a request to pay for the key fob that I left hanging in the room as instructed  The host never even asked me did I take it she sent a payment request first  Wow  I love Zencity properties but I must say this was the worst experience I ve had with them   Thanks  I was accused of taking the door fob  Something I would never do  The host wouldn t fix my dates like I requested and I ended up having to check out on Valentine s Day and I was not happy  Parking is absolutely horrible there is no available street parking at night and they feed the crow s outside the building I woke up to bird shit all over my car literally all over my car I suggest you pay to park  I always leave an air bnb in wonderful condition and I always leave the peoples stuff as is was before I arrived  I was very upset when I received a request to pay for the key fob that I left hanging in the room as instructed  The host never even asked me did I take it she sent a payment request first  Wow I love Zencity properties but I must say this was the worst experience I ve had with them   Thanks 
531220076593504361,Apartment was nicely designed and cozy  Some minor issues with check in but it work
485488215027582976,Zencity support is almost exclusively text based   The front line staff are responsive  but cross your fingers no trouble happens  We were sent the wrong  unit entry code for our arrival at  am  and theres no phone number to call to get instructions on how to handle this   No text response in the middle of the night  had to google a number   Fortunately  someone answered and was able to reprogram the door code remotely to let us in   The wifi didnt work  but they were able to give us hotspot substitutes   Laundry wastewater from another unit in the building backed up into our kitchen sink  we reported it  and the next day they asked us to make the unit available to plumbers during our prime stay day  One of the beds had linens that reeked of human sweat  Fortunately there are plenty of clean sheets available  so we changed the sheets and put the smelly ones in the hamper for housekeeping  They offered late check out as a kind of apology  then retracted the offer on check out day   Otherwise  it is as described  Good location   Zencity staff on phone and text are pretty capable   as far as they are allowed to be   and kind  but the set up is frustrating when things go wrong   Hope you all have a better experience than we did  Im actually shocked that Zencity had another guest check in after us without the time to fix the wastewater back up plumbing problem   This is a health issue   Some OTHER apartments laundry soap wastewater backed up into the units kitchen sink twice in the first days we were there  Loud gurgling noises  then     inches of laundry soap bubbles  We declined to have maintenance come while we were there   we had paid for our time in the unit  and were avoiding the kitchen sink   but the next guests would be unaware of this  health  issue   The wrong entry code for our  am arrival  the non working wifi  and the sweat smelly sheets are a bundle of bad news  but the plumbing is a health concern   Moreover  since new staff  all nice and professional  by the way  and Im grateful for their kindness and for Arvis help at  am to reprogram the door  take over different shifts  theres no continuity  I reported the sink problem on Friday afternoon  didnt get much response until a proposal for a fix until Saturday morning when we were asked for permission to do the work while we were paying for the unit   I was never told that the wifi work around  which did work  thank you  was the final fix   The sweat smelly sheets went without comment   All in all  this felt very corporate greedy  not like a customer focused airbnb experience   AND I have learned theres no way to communicate directly with management   cowardly corporate greedy   And I paid about      for this experience   Sheesh 
508684261000486446,This place was really neat and clean  I had no trouble checking in  There were several bars and restaurants near by so getting food and groceries was within walking distance   I would stay here again especially for the price
561572539449677992,Great location  This space needs a major deep clean  Walls in all the rooms are so dirty  Basic space  a good option if you plan to be out and about and not looking for a very elevated  curated and aesthetically pleasing space  The walls in every single room are so dirty  A deep clean and repaint is need  immediately 
561563980752766057,Very clean  great area  Me and my friend were going to a show at the Vic  Perfect place to stay if you ever are coming in from out of town to see a show at the vic  Thank you so much for letting us stay at your airbnb  We had a great time and it was perfect for our situation  Really enjoyed the stay

559392817829097732,Amazing stay  Was pleasantly surprised it was a two bedroom  Had a big kitchen  living room a cute work station  Floors are creaky but only a dentist office below so no need to tiptoe  Very clean  Lots of towels  extra bedding  etc  Everything was great  only thing I would suggest maybe changing is the photo of the front of the building thats used to describe where key  entry is in the check in instructions   The property pictured when I checked in doesnt even resemble the actual building and theres even mention of a gate  theres not a single gate anywhere near the building

555845541453628449,Great apartment in a great location  Extremely spacious for a one bed unit   Apartment was sufficiently clean  but some guests would have been perturbed by the below average cleanliness of the floors nooks television etc   Apartment is reasonably well stocked for longer stays and host was helpful and responsive throughout   Laundry access required a laundry card that was not provided  which may be of concern to some   All in all though  a great stay  Please ensure future guests have access to the correct cards required to use the laundry machines  Would also recommend a slightly higher clean standard  Floors were quite dirty  as were things like the television screen and remote  as well as in between the couch cushions etc  Otherwise  my stay has been excellent 
555771110670108321,The unit is cute and the location is good  The unit is on top right on top of a bar that closes at  am   Monday and Tuesday night were not to bad but Thursday and Friday night was  a nightmare 
523905596940823531,Great looks better in person Awesome that s it that s all
552948398336714064,Great stay   Close to wrigleyfield    Great stay 
475368346259104071,Amazing view  Trading parking convenience for a great view far enough back from the arch to see it in full and a nice lit up downtown  If you dont have a second person with you that can run into the building  while u wait outside in the no parking area  when you first get there to grab parking pass and parking gate building door key fob in can be overwhelming to find all surrounding area is pay to park with fear of getting a ticket or yelled at by a resident for taking their spot so you can get the scan key to open parking garage gate  I parked in a No Parking spot at beginning and end of my trip to be able to start and end my trip with ease loading unloading getting keys  leaving keys  Otherwise the walk to my car didnt bother me and the elevator in the parking garage was convenient  Roku TV came with Netflix ready to go was a nice feature  Clean home with care put into bedding and linen quality so it feels like a hotel and not a residential apartment  Definitely recommend staying here for the view alone  Big wide glass windows with shades that can be pulled back 
555104903361188432,Wonderful location        minute walk from everything in Wicker Park or the blue line to go downtown    I ve lived in the neighborhood for    years but have been taking advantage of WFH life to travel   I needed to stay for a few days so chose this unit    Parking is easy  check in instructions are very clear   easy to follow    The coach house is older so the steps are pretty narrow going up to the unit just be careful  The   digit lock code I couldn t ever remember but does make you feel extra secure    The unit was clean but felt like only high spots Lots of dust bunnies on the wood floors   no soap in the bathroom which makes it feel like not a super thorough job    The space itself is great  especially for the price  Could easily have   couples here    There is a  Minut  security system in the living room which upon googling included sound detection  etc  the listing only mentions on site security  not within the unit so I just wish they would ve been more transparent about that    Wifi was stable overall for zoom calls  only briefly dropped during meeting on Friday afternoon    I was there during a snow storm  I had to text them to inquire about when the long walk from the street to the coach house would be clean  stopped snowing around noon   I sent message around  pm     hours later  it still wasn t scooped so I messaged again they said they were short staffed which I can empathize with   it was cleared shortly after  Just be prepared to initiate   follow up with  the help if you stay here    Overall it was a great place for the price overall  but you will need to initiate any kind of help during your stay  No coffee maker in the unit  floors were swept but lots of dust around the unit  No soap in the bathroom  all of it felt like high level clean but nothing in depth which is concerning especially during COVID    Please be more transparent about the sound detection system within the unit  There s a big difference between on site   within the unit   Also more communication about the delayed snow removal would ve gone a long way 
554392824492427778,Good size  comfortable beds  and comms check in instructions via Zencity was terrific      minute walk from DePaul University  so not just a few steps    Place is tired  paint  couch ready to be replaced  drafty old windows  small dining table only good for two people with few items  and could use a good clean in spots  e g  orange mold in the shower   Must be ok with music noise coming through the floor from the Greek restaurant on the ground level  Good restaurants nearby  Comms check in instructions via Zencity was terrific      minute walk from DePaul University   so the bi line of  a few steps  from the university is misleading   Place is tired  paint  couch ready to be replaced  cushion springs are shot and you fall in   drafty old windows force you to turn up the heat  small dining table only good for two people with few items  and could use a good clean in spots  e g  orange mold in the shower   Should disclose the music noise coming through the floor from the Greek restaurant on the ground level 
531201955786769602,Great place and location parking sucks Needs parking for guest

531153741415245410,Bien ubicado  amplio  cuenta con lo necesario  le recomiendo hacer una buena limpieza  la alfombra necesita ser lavada  se percibe polvo y mal olor  En si al apartamento le faltan detalles de mantenimiento  pintura  Buena ubicaci n  edificio antiguo pero bien conservado  El apartamento tiene lo necesario  como se ve en las fotos del anuncio  Le sugerir a  reparar el ba o de la entrada  el agua se sale de la tina hasta la puerta del apartamento  generando mal olor a la alfombra  En general la alfombra del apartamento necesita ser lavada  se ve sucia y de mal olor  en general ser a bueno hacer una buena limpieza

551472962716184047,The place was in a great location  easy to check in  easy parking  will stay here again when back in Chicago  The place was great  thanks for a great stay 
492823353341692555,Do not book here  They are at the point where they have so much success that they don t care to make sure their guest are heard  I booked this last minute because i needed a trip back to my hometown for a family emergency  I had forgotten my ID  I didn t need my ID since my husband is the one driving  Not to mention I contacted them saying if the application itself was all I needed to present at the door and they said yes   I have photo evidence of this chat  I made the mistake to not bring it but my husband could present his ID  They did not let me in the room  I was left without a place to stay and the did not refund my money  I filed a refund and still no one has reached out to me  Do not book here  They are at the point where they have so much success that they don t care to make sure their guest are heard  I booked this last minute because i needed a trip back to my hometown for a family emergency  I had forgotten my ID  I didn t need my ID since my husband is the one driving  Not to mention I contacted them saying if the application itself was all I needed to present at the door and they said yes   I have photo evidence of this chat  I made the mistake to not bring it but my husband could present his ID  They did not let me in the room  I was left without a place to stay and the did not refund my money  I filed a refund and still no one has reached out to me 
551422072693909217,There were bugs in the shower  but other than that it was a pleasant stay  Thank you for hosting  It does seem like there s a slight bug problem in the shower 
550768658228486429,AVOID AT ALL COST    the place was filthy when we arrived  It was superficially clean but the whole flat needs a deep clean  The bathroom was dirty  the soap dispenser was not working  how expensive is a replacement     the blinds in rooms were covered in thick dust  the dishes  pots and cutlery were grimy  the dishwasher dirty  the vacuum cleaner clogged  the bedsheets had hairs on them and looked used   general TLC needed  the ceiling tiles were broken and looked like they were about to fall down  It s an old building and a flat and really needs some easy fixes     the central heating was loud and one bedroom and the living space did not get any heat  no extra heater available  awful in winter    there was ice in front of the main entrance  so it was a struggle each time to go in and out without falling and breaking your necks   the communication with Zencity was half decent  they replied when they wanted to  not when you needed them to communicate with you   frustrating checkout  in the end we were lied to  told there was another booking when there wasn t  and told no late checkout was available even though they offered it first in an email  Then basically kicked us out without any reason other than  instructions from higher levels  even though we repeatedly requested some assistance  Felt like this was vindication for complaining about the filth and coldness from the start of our stay    An absolute disgrace of a company to deal with  it s really not worth the hassle    I will give credit where the credit is due     the flat was pretty and nicely furnished if you don t consider the layer of muck on top of every surface and the general state of being worn out and things not working  eg the record player    great location for public transport to city centre and not far from the O Hare airport     great location for some local caf s  food places  even vegan food  and a Target I was happy enough after the apologies and a partial refund for giving us the flat in a filthy state and having it cold   Got really frustrated after being spoken to like a total idiot for asking for a late checkout  First you offered the option  Then denied it to us  Then lied for the reasons  Then said you didn t need a reason  just instructions from  higher levels   didn t help us out with storing our luggage for a couple of hours  then threatened me with a bad review and charging more money   An absolute disgrace of a company  you should not be in business for how you treat your paying customers 
550749966253204537,Amazing value if you re at UCHICAGO  super comfortable spot  sunny and clean  I love this place   I do feel that the wifi is still not great  I used a hot spot most days  but the TV worked much better than before 
550693471379083643,Good experience
550691461902034456,This was a last minute booking and it worked out great  Great space  Exactly as pictured  Kitchen had everything you needed if you wanted to cook  Quick communications  easy checkin out  Would be great for   adults visiting the city  A door mat at the entrance would be useful now during the winter to minimize snow salt on the hardwood floors 
549987432278282969,Apartment was perfectly located  clean  and comfortable  Thank you so much for a lovely stay 
549334113495179431,The unit was in a beautiful neighborhood in Chicago and the building residents were quiet and respectful  The unit is also nicely updated with special attention to detail to make sure occupants are comfortable 
500773928092368680,Check in can be a bit cumbersome  Lots of numbers and buttons to push to get to room  Our didn t work  but once we decided to call the number provided  they got it worked out  Parking on the other hand is non existent  We parked a block away on the street and walked  Do not use this place if you have a trailer  Streets are tight and a trailer would have been a major issue  Thanks
502145251059805612,Loves the apartment  Cozy for   people  Enjoyed the sunlight with the multiple windows  Only thing is that you can hear the hustle and bustle outside  including the club across the street   Coming from a busy city  were accustomed     Full fridge was perfect for the snacks water and leftovers  Kitchen supplies everything we needed     There are a handful of steps to get to the apartment  but not too long it got easier and quicker    We took advantage of one of the   parking spots our rental car  they share a detailed map  but the slots were really narrow   No door dings  so were good 
475344533894479508,Clean  comfortable studio very nicely located for UChicago  All the basics nicely covered and close to Valois for a breakfast or two  There was an issue with the lock code for the indoor lock and since my flights had come in quite late I feared I would be stranded at   am  but the response was very fast and got things sorted out  Great service  Id give     stars if I could  off     for having the lock problem in the first place   Will definitely stay again  Thanks  Thanks for the middle of the night response to reset the indoor code  The smoke detector  not in     but in the hallway  continued to the low battery beep all weekend 
520989751196897924,Awesome stay  close to the park which was even better about it  Good view from the room  customer service was on point at the residential and the host  Will definitely recommend this  It was great staying there  I appreciate the help and it was last minute so it worked out perfectly  Thank you again 
549267372575572495,Great place to stay    Loved the great location Thanks for the great stay   You please was very nice  
539123079349176699,Love it
524611023227821802,Great location
549232050457937619,Decent location  good space  Space only provides a basic bar of soap and conditioner  High service and clean fee that offsets the low nightly rate  Thank you for being so responsive and allowing me to stay at your property  Just a few more amenities would be nice though  Shampoo  laundry detergent etc  especially with such a high service clean fee  it seems that should be included 
548594253966421874,Fantastic place and location  and the apartment was excellent   couldnt recommend it enough  Couldnt have asked for a better stay  Thank you 
548578631756354396,I loved everything about the stay but the check in process is a little difficult  They have you check in in one building and you stay in another  Can be a little confusing at first but your stay will definitely overshadowed that 
567366638037904942,The place was very clean and neat  The location is great  The place is close to the science center  the museums  and there are some restaurants within walking distance  Although there is no on site parking  parking was easy to find in a near by parking garage  I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely come back again  I thought the stay was great  The call box in the front lobby was broken and it took a while to get in after hours  Also  the treadmills didn t work in the workout room  Overall  I thought the entire stay was wonderful  The room was nice and clean  It was quiet and peaceful after       pm  I loved the detailed communication  Thank you for the stay 
567351637356888319,Not great  dirty and not well maintained  This rental was disappointing   It was soooo dirty  from dust so thick on top of headboard  chipped paint throughout the unit  no coffee maker  front door keypad loose  problems connecting with WiFi  someone parked in the parking space and key fob didn t work with entrance on Dolman   If you are paying someone to clean  they aren t doing it   It really could be a nice place but it needs much attention 
567351415904989911,This place is awesome  Walking distance to Whole Foods  it s in a great radius of really good restaurants  the bed and pillows are super comfy  Definitely a great spot for all of the St  Louis attractions Thank you so much  We loved the location and had a great time 
566734538614533825,Great spot very clean close to everything just sometimes hard to park otherwise location great apartment nice and clean would love to stay there again next time I hit the Stl Great spot just hard to park
566731321149465060,Very clean and in a great spot 
566728142073015686,It s was really good   Very very great place and area thank you  
566695477544861258,Nice clean place   look just like the picture Enjoyed the time there  loved the place
491342648828067324,Absolutely loved the place   Super clean and looks exactly like the pictures  Great communication and an overall       experience 
474602095889029913,The apartment was nice and well appointed  However  the host failed to provide us with a fob to enter the main building after hours  We requested one multiple times and he never provided one and in the end did not even respond to our requests  I would not recommend zencity to anyone  The first night we were able to get in the building only because one of the tenants let us in  We were very disappointed with tour lack of response  We communicated with you that the fob was missing and you never provided one  We also told you we couldn t get into the building without a fob after hours because the code you gave us didn t work and the main door was closed  You never responded or provided us with one  This is not how you treat a guest or get good reviews 
566678116726648605,Check in was so easy  Location was great  We walked to sqwires which had great food for brunch  The rooftop was really amazing and I loved that you can see the gateway arch from the room 
566675639220969776,This place was ok  This is my first meh review for an Airbnb place I have stayed at and I think the sole reason for this is that this is a company who manages this property and not a normal person like I ve experienced with so response time with any questions or concerns I had was almost non existent  For example I messaged them at   am and didn t get a response until  am the next day so my issue didn t get addressed or anything  My only other complaint is that yes this place was not clean at all like very obviously not clean or at least not well  I wish I had taken times to read the reviews on that one  Location is great it s near by to a lot of good food places and park  It is what you make of it  Having better response times when messaging through Airbnb app and making sure residence is clean  Two biggest complaints but otherwise fine 
499290295548671582,They should do a better job at communication  I wouldn t recommend this location to anyone  It s hard getting in contact with your host if you have any problems  They are very rude and when I did have a problem they did not provide me with the help I needed neither care about my time or accommodate me for my stay  The temperature would not change because they have a control system on it so the whole stay I froze  It was an unhappy experience and rude customer service  Customer service was horrible  Do better at communication when dealing with your paying customers  I wouldn t recommend this location to anyone 
486256540917675341,This apartment has a noise monitor that went off regularly  even when operating the kitchen    The bathrooms both had separate issues that were never remedied when brought to attention    Overall stay was mediocre  but we left unsatisfied  and frankly annoyed unfortunately  The noise monitor is over the top  It was going off during times we weren t in the apartment  as well as when we turned the fan on to use the oven    Also listing that there are no basic seasoning  like salt  pepper  oil  would be helpful    Please have a more thorough clean crew  I sent multiple photos of hair in the master bathroom shower  One of the toilets were also not working in the guest bathroom 
521012735870293812,Great location  Great space  Easy check in  Will stay again  Please fix issues like screws sticking out of drawers before people check in  It s a hazard to have those out  Also there is a hole or drywall peeling off the ceiling in bathroom in apt        that should be looked at too  Also make sure your clean staff puts the correct key in the correct lockbox so your guest doesn t have to run around and try to track down the correct key 
566647946415128326,Overall  the stay was mediocre  Parking wasn t an issue as the street parking wasn t far away  The location was great  It was very walkable and everything by car was only      minutes away   The apartment building was old and had a smell to it in the hallways  The Airbnb looked like the pictures minus some cracks in the wall  I appreciated the stocked kitchen and bathroom  Also  there was a variety of streaming services on the television  The walls were very thin and you could hear neighbors talking or playing music after quiet hours  I let the host know and they were very timely with their response  I only give it a     because it was underwhelming  There was no additional effort put into the stay  Although the place was clean  there was a lack of attention to detail  For example  there was smudges around the light switches 
538361936265445337,Great rooms  Beautiful building  Thanks  It was a gorgeous place and we greatly appreciated relaxing 
566640008960146473,Great location and comfortable stay  Loved the location it was perfect for us  We will be back to visit when the weather warms back up  The room was very clean and neat 
566638105040975972,Overall a good stay   Pros  You are within walking distance of the City Museum  Enterprise Center and lots of restaurants You get a parking spot included with your stay Hosts are quick to respond  Cons  It was a little noisy The apartment needs a little TLC  If you end up staying here keep the fob you are given with you  It gives you quick access to the apartment and parking garage The stay was a good  Great location and price  A couple things for you to look into    The bathroom sink had very little water pressure The shower head was leaking The outlet by the bed was coming off of the wall
508010855772943756,Great spot  Probably will stay here every time we come back to Chicago
531204526239508386,Great place    Loved our time there  Will definitely be booking again 
491302989777020710,Great location and great host  
475359299560474435,Good amount of space for   people including a complete kitchen  Clean and relatively quiet  location is great and a parking spot was included which is a big plus 
521727018128595836,This is a great place to stay in Chicago  the area is perfect  You will be next to everything and not far away from things  I extremely recommend this to new visitors and people that need a very nice amazing place to stay  Thank you for letting me stay at your place  thanks for replying whenever I needed an answer  I had a great experience and next time I come back  I will definitely book your place again 
565989256240370895,I didn t enjoy my stay  Had to cancel and go to a hotel nearby  Beds wasn t clean  No heat  No WiFi  Cold air was coming in by the AC unit because it wasn t properly sealed  Can have cleaner bed sheets  WiFi that works  Working heat  Sealed off area around the AC unit so cold air doesn t come in 
470263395862552721,It s accurate  the only downside was the self check in  and low towels toiletries  The space itself was clean and modern  The self check in was difficult  the code I received didn t work and a resident of the building had to let me in
497785043023999098,First off I will say we really enjoyed our time in Chicago  the place is within walking distance to a CVS which is great for some items  However it would have been nice to have a grocery store close by for fresh items  Check in was simple and very easy to understand  However many of our Uber drivers got a little confused in finding the place  The bedrooms are great and comfortable  However in the master bedroom we noticed that there were still slats missing from the vertical blinds which would allow people across the street to see in  I had noticed previous complaints about this under their reviews  But apparently they dont seem to care to fix  We ended up changing in the bathroom or the walk in closet  Which was a slight inconvenience but still worked out  The bathroom doors when we checking in did not close properly as the too hinges were falling loose  But thankfully they did send out a maintenance guy to fix that the next morning as well   I thought they would of fixed the blinds at that time as well since I had brought that to their attention as well  but no luck    I would recommend a  nd couch or wide couch chair just for some extra seating   There were a few small things that people should be aware of  there is no toaster or coffee pot  only a French press  so unless you know how to use one you are out of luck   There is no sponge for washing dishes so we bought one at Walgreens while we were out  the dishwasher didnt always leave dishes clean   It was very convenient to have a washer there on site to clean our clothes  however when we went to use the dryer it sounded like someone was drilling outside  Immediately I sent a message to our host to ask if they knew what was causing it  Only to get an automated text minutes later saying there was a noise complaint  So I called the host and waited on hold till I spoke with someone  Was told they could have another maintenance guy come out to check it  So I said sure and she would message me when they would be able to make it out  Only I never heard anything back  So we ended up just hanging our stuff up around the airbnb to air dry with the central heating   Even though we did have some hiccups and minor inconvenience we didnt let that ruin our time in Chicago   And one last thing  nowhere in the welcome message does it say where you can throw away the trash  Luckily we found it on the  st floor through a few doors  It helped us keep the place tidy since to go boxes tend to fill up the trash quickly  If you are looking for a cute  rustic restaurantand want to try new food  Go to Staropolska  The polish food was delicious and such beautiful decor  Thank you for allowing us to stay in your place   We really enjoyed our stay but there were a few concerns and suggestions we would recommend  A few things we would recommend in the kitchen is a toaster  kitchen towels  keurig or coffee maker especially for those who drink more than   cup of coffee  A sponge for clean dishes  the dishwasher left residue on some of the dishes  Fix the dryer since it sounds like someone is drilling outside  Replace the vertical blinds in larger bedroom  I had to change in the closet because anyone could look in through the gaps 
539161900092364584,Very nice clean and safe place Thank you for the stay
474588488973671421,Great place in a great location

565961991742887700,lovely central safe building
565901486055107172,The only issue we had was with the Wi Fi not working for the duration of our entire stay  Everything else was perfect    The only issue we had was with the Wi Fi not working for the duration of our entire stay  Everything else was perfect   
565290437516060908,Loved the place and it was in a cute little neighborhood  The check in and checkout was super easy 
531138285564340357,So many things wrong with this place beginning with the host  Zencity consistently takes over    mins to answer phones and even longer to answer text  The entry code was wrong as I saw other ppl have stated but I assumed that they had cleared things up  Took an hour to check in  The place Itself is decent enough but several issues  The bathroom has no sink  The only sink in the unit is in the kitchen  The door to the bathroom is a sliding door that doesn t want to stay closed and even when closed leaves Little privacy as there are huge gaps on the sides  The ice maker in the fridge doesn t work  This unit does not have controllable ac or heat  I informed Zencity that it was hot and asked them how to turn the heat down they told me to open a window  Temperature outside was     degrees btw  The thermostat said that it was being controlled at a central location so apparently they don t allow guests the option of changing the temperature  Also parking is across the street which isn t a huge deal when it s warm outside I suppose but in   degree weather with snow on the ground it s a huge hassle  The front door locks automatically but it is fickle and sometimes you have to reopening it and hold it closed until it locks  The fridge is so close to the wall that it is really akward to open the door  Also didn t smell great when first walking issue All this aside it s a decent place if u catch it for cheap 
535539266723366837,wonderful place thanks
565920078653342363,Very good property  a must stay Your staff need to respond to clients

565279924094309513,Nice place to stay good neighborhood
565276277234904569,Great location and cozy apartment  My only complaint is with the check in process  I was provided an email before arrival with location of the lock box but unfortunately that lock box area had not been used for a while  I had to wait in the lobby for a good half hour until I finally figured out I needed the call CS to get the new lock box   and pin  Last day of my stay the Wi Fi stopped working  and someone contacted me immediately asking if I disconnected the Wi Fi   I let them know I had not and then we went back and forth trying to trouble shoot  At the end I was not able to fix it which I didn t care because I was leaving the next day    Overall okay stay and like I said location is great  If check in is improved I would have given higher stars  Great location and cozy apartment  My only complaint is with the check in process  I was provided an email before arrival with location of the lock box but unfortunately that lock box area had not been used for a while  I had to wait in the lobby for a good half hour until I finally figured out I needed the call CS to get the new lock box   and pin  Last day of my stay the Wi Fi stopped working  and someone contacted me immediately asking if I disconnected the Wi Fi   I let them know I had not and then we went back and forth trying to trouble shoot  At the end I was not able to fix it which I didn t care because I was leaving the next day    Overall okay stay and like I said location is great  If check in is improved I would have given higher stars

396290062790479017,Slawik s house was very charming  spacious  clean  and comfortable with modern conveniences  It has a lot of character and special touches  Although we didn t cook  the updated kitchen seemed well stocked with utensils  dishes and cookware    We particularly appreciated  how responsive Slawik was to any questions or concerns we had  He lives next door and went out of his way to be hospitable without being intrusive   This historic cottage is a great place to stay while in Kansas  City  and we hope to stay again on a future visit  Thanks  Slawik  for your responsiveness  and hospitality 
500060125117707631,Poor WiFi signal
565244842679950734,Very clean and comfortable  Great value  Will stay again when in St  Louis   The place was in a perfect location for me and the price was great  Thank you
565222092652156480,Cute and convenient  Only Thing missing was a hot tub lol
565219212304067874,Great location   Free coffee  st floor A real bar of soap would be nice
510177911901261675,Awesome  Highly recommend Great stay  thank you
565207411614017242,A lot of the other reviews say that this listing owned by a company instead of an individual is a negative aspect but from my experience  it was the opposite  I thought that for it being a company  the response was fast and it seems like they have a night shift agent to respond whenever needed  I needed the heat turned up because the area got so cold last minute and within    min of sending the message  the heat was on and I wasn t freezing to death   The place looks exactly like the pictures and it was beautiful  It is dark in the bedroom because there are no windows but I was content with creaking the door open and letting the light come through the living room window  I will note that this listing is on the Ground floor but I personally had no problem with it  Pedestrians outside cannot see the inside unless they are creeping into your window  I would most definitely book this listing and this company again   This place was beautiful and thank you guys for being so responsive 
467361171223656880,Excellent location  No wifi entire stay  Kitchen amenities not what is listed  plan on supplementing if you use the kitchen at all and be prepared to do some clean first  Location excellent but that s a given   Email with checkin instructions came day after checkin  Had to pull up instructions online on website to know logistics  We had no wifi the entire stay  Reported it from very beginning service came next afternoon had to check unit next door was never seen again and connection never came  Kept checking  With added in fees for service expected things ready to use  Had to wash utensils in kitchen before use to get garbage off them  Amenities listed salt pepper and oil for cooking but not there  So had to add that to our to do list  Coffee press was broken  stem not attached to filter base of the press  Bottom drawer of refrigerator had crumbs from previous use as well as bar soap scum on the shower caddy even though only liquid soaps supplied  The sofa was horrible for back support especially if two people are sitting attempting to watch something  Removed the dust from the trim by bathroom radiator and kitchen back splash so I wouldn t have to look at it Overall a major disappointment at an excellent location
565043945080625905,Make Sure you call them and confirm that your stay   check in  is at a specific time and that no one is there clean your space and if they are there clean take pictures and at least meet the clean staffer   I didn t   very odd experience  Just on a respectable conversation of opportunity   When a guest arrives after the time allotted to check in   after traveling all day   your rental has to be ready to rock and roll and ready to accommodate the guest with relaxation   Check in time was  p  Arrivals     p Instead I find a clean staffer with all of her clean supplies scattered in the dining area with a response    It will be a minute     Ok   my check in is  p    Well you can set your stuff down and will be done in a minute    With all do respect I don t feel comfortable with you in here while I have all my stuff    Well you can leave and come back in     minutes    Sure I will contact the host and take pictures before I go   Do what you need to do I m Running behind    Contacted the host   respectfully they were really responsive  gave me a solution to the top apartment  beautiful place    Then I could let help to notice there were gnats in the bathroom trash can and on the couch   I would love to see this place really get all their attention to details figured out with communication and a slight better clean job  It s a beautiful place but needs to buckle up a lot 
564533096663115201,The code were were given to access the unit was incorrect and we didn t hear back from Zencity when we reached out to resolve the issue  We had to cancel the reservation and find other accommodations at the last minute  The code we were given to access the unit was incorrect and we never heard back from Zencity  We had to cancel the reservation and find other accommodations at the last minute 
564501200898165618,Loved this place  Parking wasnt too bad  place was super clean  Kitchen was well stocked and bed very comfortable  Loved the setup and great view  Thanks so much  We had a great stay 
564477604638834417,Great stay will Definitely recommend to all  Big     in  gap in the top Part of the kitchen door  You can see daylight through it   Otherwise perfect    
563830666020202742,Great deal  amazing location  very clean  and quick communication  I would definitely stay here again   We had a great stay   Thank you for the quick communication when our door code was changed 
563805402765430743,Super clean  beautiful view  perfect location  Only thing to take note of is that that parking garage is about a block away  Communication and friendliness with the owners deserves   stars  Thank you so much for your kindness and hospitality 
563763682817062110,The check in out process was very simple  Overall the place was nice but the entire floor and the room itself smelled like cigarette smoke  We walked in and the place immediately smelled of cigarette smoke  Also the blinds were broken and the curtains to close the window got stuck on the track    Mostly just the stench of cigarette smoke was off putting 
563741542265071123,Came in to town for a short business trip   Great views   Clean and inviting apartment   Garage parking was nice    Would stay there again  I couldnt figure out how to make the dishwasher work   It may be broken or user error but thought you should know 
563737723382593910,their a little pricey  yet make up for it with the space  so much space  simple  yet modern  very convienant location 
563734276216488217,A good place to stay for a while will definitely book again 
563118442473057390,Check and confirm all details first Overall  I will say this  We have stayed in MANY AirBnBs over the last     years  and this was  by far  our worst experience yet  The unit itself to look at was decent enough  but given the area  parking issues  and the multitude of issues  it was in no way enough to make our stay pleasant  I should have known better than to secure a place run by a conglomerate  Details are outlined below   I did mention my first impression wasnt awesome  and that was an understatement  First  the description of the place definitely says free street parking  At the very least  this is very misleading  At worst  a complete lie  Very little parking to be had at all  plus I spent almost as much parking as I did for the space  Second  the entire place smelled like smoke  Not as much in the unit  but the entire building  After we settled in  we kept finding things that were either subpar or completely unacceptable   Ill start at the beginning  As we came to find out later in the day  the front door security is rendered useless during the day  as anyone can enter the restaurant and gain access to the foyer through there  without the use of a code  Once you reach the unit  the  coat hooks  at the front door were both literally falling out of the wall  Pretty big oversight as a first impression  Bathroom was the first stop  as we had just gotten off the road  Toilet wont flush  Having some experience in these things  I was able to get the flush valve going  but had to mess with it every time we used the toilet  It needs to be replaced  The outlet by the bed only works when the light switch is flipped  Again  Im no stranger to this type of thing  so I figured it out  but most folks will just be frustrated  Needs to be put in the description or welcome blurb  Once we settled in for the evening the first night  we wanted to cuddle in front of the TV for a bit  The couch is HORRIBLE  Not comfortable in any way  unless you grab all of the pillows from the bed and drag them out to be strategically placed  Then we couldnt get the overhead lamp to shut off  as the footswitch is broken  Tried  and finally succeeded getting the curtains closed  but one side only went so far  Mainly because of the joint in the rod holding them up  but if the wands werent missing  this would have been easy to overcome  I know Im leaving a few things out here  but that should give you plenty to go on    Thanks  but no   John
476011452567541825,Such a lovely stay  Thank you    
563070581148768097,Very great spot  Close to attractions  Everything was clean and no issues checking in and even using the Wi Fi looking forward to staying again     Had an amazing time  No complaints whatsoever  No issues when it came down to checking in or even using the Wi Fi  Every room was clean  tidy  and organized  I look forward to using zen city again

562394221444552481,it was a nice quiet comfortable stay a lot of restaurants and activities to do in the surrounding area but they are very fast and helpful with communication or any problems great cozy apartment everything I expected nice clean apt   had a little trouble getting a refund but other than that it was a nice quiet comfortable stay
562387342752708214,Wow beautiful apartment and great location  Will absolutely stay there again the next time I m in town        and      recommend  Had an amazing stay and the apartment was beautiful  We would definitely stay there again  Only   minor things that stood out in my mind that I would like to know if I was in your position  I would add a pizza pan to your pots and pans collection and also the water pressure is very low in the shower  Overall the stay was great and I will      stay there when I visit again  just wanted to let you know those   things  Thank you again   
562368972499387029,In a great area of downtown  Right by the hospital  Nice and clean  Enjoyed our stay  When we first walked in  it was extremely hot  It took awhile for the room to cool down  Other than that  no issues  We had a great time  Thank you  
562329828490401140,the shower   kitchen water was cold my car got broken into   the doors were locked   other than that great stay   nice heat   nice space
531913242490693647,Great location
489827352422920317,This is probably the worst stay I ve ever had with Airbnb Although the property was extremely nice Good luck having Managment or ANYONE from Zencity accommodate anything they promised      I got locked out of the apartment took   hours for someone to return my call and unlock my door      located right next to a busy street  you hear literally every car passing by to sirens and semis      wash and drier did not work   I was there on business for a   day trip  let Managment know the first day They weren t working   they told me they d have maintenance come at a certain time   they showed up   hours late missed work meetings and had zero clean clothes  Didn t address the situation from day    didn t even return my phone call Now   days after the trip still no phone call when I was assured by Andrea and Eric  Managment  they would look into the situation and get back to me    Being an Airbnb owner in several states I would be appalled if my management treated guests the way zencity treats theirs Highly do not encourage you to stay with this property This is probably the worst stay I ve ever had with Airbnb Although the property was extremely nice Good luck having Managment or ANYONE from Zencity accommodate anything they promised      I got locked out of the apartment took   hours for someone to return my call and unlock my door      located right next to a busy street  you hear literally every car passing by to sirens and semis      wash and drier did not work   I was there on business for a   day trip  let Managment know the first day They weren t working   they told me they d have maintenance come at a certain time   they showed up   hours late missed work meetings and had zero clean clothes  Didn t address the situation from day    didn t even return my phone call Now   days after the trip still no phone call when I was assured by Andrea and Eric  Managment  they would look into the situation and get back to me    Being an Airbnb owner in several states I would be appalled if my management treated guests the way zencity treats theirs Highly do not encourage you to stay with this property
562297975690188544,Great location  clean and very spacious   The communication was on point and we are def coming back and staying there again 
562280687402653773,That bathroom sink is wild  The faucet comes out enough to barely provide water to the actual sink  It s such a much if you need to wash your hands 
561751477559912722,This was a nightmare  The access code did not work  and I didn t get a new one until an hour   half after checkin time  after I finally got in we noticed it was freezing and NONE of the radiators worked  It is the middle of winter and freezing outside  so I reached out about it and they informed me that Maintance would come in and fix it that day but then hours later after no show from maintenance  they said that they would drop off a space heater the following day  the Wi Fi router did not have a power cord so no Wi Fi or apps on the tv  THEN we notice someone trying to get into the room  it s   people and they say they booked the same place for the same dates we booked it was unacceptable so we left
561641698893753655,The apartment was beautiful  It was in such a nice location  loved being able to see the arch from out window  They responded to all our questions very quickly  Would absolutely recommend this apartment and Zencity in general  Thank you for the wonderful experience  staying in the apartment was so relaxing and nice 
472409791802109415,Previous reviews spoke on access  But as for me  easy  Followed texted instructions  wa la  Location was ultra clean  Beautiful view  All needs wants we re within walking distance  I d do it again  I have nothing  All that was promised was done  Thanks for addressing access concerns  It was easy 
561624248980129741,Awesome stay in a great location Great visit
475365853030071257,Nice cute place 
563077234853113129,great place to stay 
405028033571141954,This property is not adequately represented in current posting   Shower  lighting  basic supplies  and back yard area    Check in process was    minutes  Positives are the workmanship of the home is magnificent  Communication and check in was not good   Representation of back yard and loft area was very misleading  Ice maker not working  Refrigerator freezing food  Front door lock  Only   towels provided   Upstairs shower was unsafe and misrepresented in pictures   Ceiling fan not operable in master  as well as lights  Laundry room had no soap   Old food and alcohol left in refrigerator   Ants in kitchen sink and cabinet 
563067419664364458,Checkin was tricky but the host was very responsive   The microwave didnt work so that was a bummer   Good deal for the money 
563048421572784713,Cozy spot   really nice   owner responds right away if you need help
537690908532469162,Smooth
536954803723794478,Clean and everyone stayed to there self in building
563034236062618685,The property was beautiful and decorative  I just had a few hiccups entering the building  but the response time was not to bad  Im not sure of how you handle the problem with the TV in the future  but I would have backups that matches the same TV  Universal remotes usually do not work  Also  list a number to call if the guest has problems entering your property like I did  Luckily  a tenant entering the building was able to give me a number to call 
562370592354817448,The apartment is different than the one shown in the photos  You can only access the access the gym  not all of the amenities in the building  and it was certainly not as clean as clean as youd expect with COVID precautions 
521029702765730608,A little  but very nice place  near to a lot of activities and with a lot of amenities Thank you so much  I think the instruction for the laundry place are a little unespecific  but the place is comfortable
562290945548863093,I initially booked another place before this one but while I was on the road there they switched up my reservation to a completely different place which is this one  The room was really nice but that was it  I couldn t find any parking  my first room couldn t open so I had to go to another room in which I couldn t stay the rest of my nights in because I had to move back  well Atleast I was suppose to but i never got a call back  Really didn t feel like it was planned well on they re part  No one really knew what was going on
562278246124942894,only a little trouble upon arriving with a mismatched door code  but support was available super late and everything was handled so well  love the location and easy shuttle access  loved the full kitchen  super well equipped  and love the little raised floor next to the window  great for sitting and appreciating the huge windows  recommend   Thanks for everything  Love the location and the availability of support when I arrived late  Appreciated so much having the full kitchen for coffee in the morning and dinners at night 
561605543927966909,Great location  safe  and very clean 
561559508699032637,My stay here was alright over all  The location is super close to Westport Downtown so that is good if you re looking for fun things to do close by  The only thing I d say is that I never had communication with the same person  it was someone different each time 
561029385819850870,Terrible experience never even got into my unit to stay due to locks not working and keys missing  They told me to cancel my reservation and they would give me a full refund but I only got    dollars back out of     and I never got to stay  We had nowhere to stay and had to go back home  I had the worst experience  I never even got into the unit due to missing keys and a lock that would not unlock  I jumped through every hoop  sent video repeatedly as they suggest and still never got into the unit  I spent almost     dollars and they told me to just cancel my reservations and I only got    dollars back  I will definitely be calling everyone I can to tell them to do something about this 
533314299265808531,Anything by Zencity is great  Really  What s most impressive about this group is their professionalism and their kindness  Truly hospitable   If you get the opportunity to be in one of their spaces  your best bet is to jump on it  You won t be disappointed   They are making it their business to be accommodating  You can trust that 
560931705320115207,Good location  nice coffee shop downstairs  Place needs some TLC and maybe better clean  Easy check in with the exception of the key kiosk being out  Quiet place in a good location but definitely need some TLC  The place was not very clean  floors had obvious dust and bed was not very clean 
560891538942593467,Our stay here was great  Everything was exactly as described  the place was extremely clean with beautiful aesthetic   great views  We were also in walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go so location was great for us too  Would definitely recommend staying here 
560875226228299399,great place nice area check in was hard but other than that everything was fine
560267820703626198,Complicated check in  no real time support  Communication terrible  couldn t even get in  instructions were not accurate 
560215123165861896,workers could easily be ok following some eiquette and basic instructor  but   definately not happy with her ugly attitude an non customer friendly cleaner
560212975881404426,love this location
560206839039718504,Very nice place for a short stay 
499967812043371760,Great space close to power and light with a beautiful view
560194660550794253,the location is great nice view and super clean plan on coming back  thank you so much I had an amazing stay I still have   weeks left if working in Kansas so I may be planning on coming back I love the locatio 
526091903940296490,Great stay  The apartment itself is very spacious and clean  The building is located in a great area with easy access to Washington Ave  Ballpark Village  and the Arch  I would definitely stay here again  Thanks for a great stay  I saw other reviews about getting out of the garage  I didn t have any trouble with this  I think guests need to pay attention to the  swipe here  sticker  If so  the swipecard works great  
470967695193837695,Comfortable and in a good location  Be prepared to find street parking  Kitchen and laundry room stocked with essentials  Would stay again  The stay was great and comfortable for our long weekend  Everything was ready to go and be used when we got there however check in and parking were confusing especially after a long drive  The apartment was also in a good location as it was in walking distance of shopping and food  The only bad thing that happened during the stay was a rotten smell coming from the air vent on Sunday but was gone when we came back later that night  All in all it was what we wanted and we would stay again 
526103642358352883,Nice place I want to thank you for allowing this to be on of the best Christmas for our family  I hope you enjoyed yours as well 
560170319170205382,BEWARE        BEWARE     BEWARE       DON T EVER USE ZENCITY IF YOUR LIKE THINGS CLEAN NICE AND SMOOTH  ZENCITY ARE THE SLUMLORDS OF AIR BNB  BEDDING NOT CLEAN  THE APT WAS SPOT CLEANED AFTER BEING TOLD A DEEP CLEAN WAS PERFORMED  APPLIANCES DIDN T WORK  TOWELS WERE STAINED  COUCH WAS STAINED  WAS BEING CHARGED      FOR A RETURNED KEY FAB  HAD TO PURCHASE DISHWASHING LIQUID  DID I MENTION THE BEDDING DUVETS WERE FLIPPED OVER TO APPEAR CLEAN AND UNSTAINED  WHEN YOU USE THE HOT WATER TO SHOWER IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE THE ENTIRE BUILDING CAN HEAR  ZENCITY PROVIDED THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER  DAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND FRUSTRATION  OH YES WAS UNABLE TO GET IN DUE TO THE INCORRECT CODE BEING PROVIDED AND THE CLEANERS NOT RETURNING THE KEY  SPENT AN HOUR TRYING TO GET IN WITH POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM AVA AND JEM  TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE  JUST DON T   ZENCITY the slumlords of Airbnb  You people and associates should be ashamed of yourselves  Poor customer service and communication  Problems yet to be resolved  I m reporting to the better business bureau 
559449475119725219,Clean place  great location for price  Parking was kind of complicated  Lots of construction going on in front of apartment made it a little harder to navigate  Clean  modern and centrally located  Checkin was a little complicated since we had to switch rooms  and the room had a very musty smell  Not sure where it was coming from  but might want to add some scented plug ins or something 
559403937089015356,great and convenient stay
558021681863214294,This apartment was absolutely fantastic  Walking distance to everything and the street car stops directly outside the apartment building  For me  the biggest bonuses were the    hour access gym and indoor soccer field inside the building  The gym has everything you need to get a great training session in  I can t wait to come back    Thank you so much 
557994059192311052,Terrible water pressure Terrible water pressure
557226063211109425,Awesome  neat   quaint space 
557201650447489749,My stay was wonderful  Everything I needed and more  Thank you for the stay  I enjoyed the hospitality and the only hiccup I had was the check in with the code but that was resolved quickly  Thank you 
556565056716983522,Very clean and right downtown  Very easy to get into  Would stay again 
556549902308391290,The host was so nice   the place was very beautiful I would definitely book again
555760060060524681,Clean place with great communication and an awesome downtown location  Stayed for a week and it was everything we needed  Clean place with great communication and an awesome downtown location  Stayed for a week and it was everything we needed 
492026506963151873,Fabulous views that can t be beat    Great parking  friendly staff  just phenomenal  Great place  Thanks so much 
525348700422072696,We spent a few days on xmas and everything was great  we didn t find messes or bugs as we read on the reviews and the space was enough for our family  Thank you for the same day booking  we loved the apt  only bad thing was the floors were a little dirty  Other than that our stay was great
526146649068006372, nd stay in a week   love the place   will be my go to spot Awesome
529746233788132375,I have stayed at zen city a few times  This is one of the best places they offer
555127801025202206,This Studio was exactly as pictured  Great location  Having everything you need including a washer and dryer  The bed and bedding was outstandingly comfortable  Closet had extra bath towels  pillows  and sheets plus plenty of hangers to hang your things  Everything was new  Laundry detergent and clean supplies  you name it  Fully equipped studio apartment  Full kitchen with full size refrigerator even  There s also a nice little rooftop to enjoy if the weather permits  Zen city apparently has many Airbnbs across the city and I would stay in any of them again in the future  Thank you for a clean perfect for everything I needed place to stay 
555126093043305324,The space was great  Parking was fairly easy  off street but still very accessible  The space was clean  all appliances in working order  and no issues with the neighbors or access  Keep in mind  the key fob both unlocks and locks the door   when you have to leave out make sure to swipe the key fob on the door so it will lock behind you  Everything was perfect  the only downside was the check in front door  Occasionally the door would not open  luckily there was another patron that was able to let me in  But everything else was great

555029411408263289,DO NOT BOOK WITH ZENCITY IF YOU LIKE TO LIVE COMFORTABLY  If you re looking for something up to par  nice and clean then this is definitely not the place you want to book  Now if you are accustomed to project living or low income living then you ll feel right at home but other than that just don t do it  Trust me  They tried to charge me      for a key fab that was returned to the key cafe  The bedding was stained  Had the nerve to be white on top of that lol  The appliances don t work hence the microwave was broken the last time we were there but I didn t know it was the same exact unit because they relisted it as new so the reviews could go away I would ve never stayed twice  The review will not be positive  The reason you all took the listing off and relisted in the first place  You get what you pay for I guess  Cool for the price if you like to do things yourself like clean and buy things to wash dishes  The couch has more stains than a toddlers tshirt  The duvets are stained  There was nothing here to clean with  The vacuum doesn t work  Microwave doesn t work  Pots n pans have stuck on burnt food  ZENCITY is the slumlord of air bnb  Experience wasn t the best but again you get what you pay for right  This was trash  But you all knew that already  The cleaners spot clean  All around bad experience  Don t book  Save yourself the time and frustration and just some book with ZENCITY like EVER  The shower makes a horrible noise if you try to take a hot shower  The unit above it does the same thing my guy and I laughed every time we heard them shower because it was so loud like well at least it s not just us  You can t adjust the heat so you have to bring a space heater if the temp is low  THE SLUMLORDS OF AIR BNB  THAT NEVER FIX ANYTHING BUT ALWAYS WANT MONEY  Zencity is the slumlord of AirBnb  You need to hire cleaners who actually clean  You need to replace the furniture that is stained worse than a toddlers tshirt  The blinds are broken in every area of the apartment  The microwave doesn t work  The sheets duvets were previously stained n washed  The pots n pans have wore to the point the next step is disposal  I m upset my son booked the same stay next week which is horrible due to the experience and the only rep that is within your organization willing to help anyone is Clifford  Ava Jemima have done nothing to make the situation better  Do better as a whole this place is trash  I would have never booked it if I had known it was the same listing I stayed back in August and had the exact same experience  THE WORST  THANKS FOR NOTHING  And the place you didn t even want to sit on anything without first putting a sheet or something over it  Disgusting 
554329734222703111,Phenomenal place to stay  Would highly recommend to anyone  Was in a great location and felt very homey  The hosts were very helpful as well 
554305641357928375,Great location  Easy communication   We felt very safe and for it being an apartment it was very quiet and we NEVER heard neighbors  Will stay here again  The apartment was clean however the dishes all had debris stuck to them and a lot of water spots  There were no coffee filters  and the coffee pot had molded coffee in it 
553636303343688900,The accommodation was perfect  great style  everything was great value for money and I can only recommend it The accommodation was perfect much better  much more style than the accommodation you had before  Therefore I will not rate the previous accommodation  the rating would be negative 
553617816658526423,The worst experience I ve had using Airbnb  Stayed in the unit for    plus days  it smelled very bad from sewer gas for the first   days without resolution  it s in a poor location  next to the trash room  poor communication from host  charged extra fee without explanation or resolution  STAY AWAY The unit smelled very bad for over a week without resolution  poor communication with very long response time  asked to speak to a manager I was told that would happen and it did not  a     charge was charged against my credit card without explanation  and I still don t know what the charge is for  This was the worst experience I have had with AirBnB

553617631843988013,This apartment was a really good value for the money  Great location  and incredible amenities in the apartment complex itself  an indoor basketball court  gym with pelotons  multiple working stations with apple computers  a great little cafe and coffee shop and a small convenience store are all in the lobby   The building elevators from the parking garage were down  so our only access in to the building and to retrieve our keys required us carrying luggage up and down a few short flights of stairs that we werent expecting  Parking Is     day  but was very convenient  Figuring out the main elevators was a bit confusing  you have to scan in to the elevator AND when youre in the elevator you have to scan again  pushing the standard call button doesnt work for apartment access     The apartment itself had very comfortable beds with great privacy  I couldnt hear my coworker at all in her room  and there were great kitchen seating areas and amenities to cook  The apartment itself has some obvious damage wear and tear and some minor cleanliness issues  but for the price  it didnt bother us    Last thing to consider is this unit is managed by a corporation  not an individual  so communication wasnt very clear after check in  We got  canned  responses that made it clear our messages werent actually being read  We didnt have any major issues  but this would have been frustrating if we had    All this being said  Id still stay here again  Hi  The value for this stay was great  but there were a few issues with the unit that should be addressed     There was a very strong odor in the entryway kitchen area  It smelled like cat urine litter     The sink in the smallest bathroom does not work  There is either a significant clog or some other damage     Communication with your team wasnt very clear  It was obvious to me that people werent reading my messages before replying  For example  when I communicated that I was checking out a day early  the response was  looking forward to hosting you soon    It was very clear my messages were not being read and addressed appropriately  Last  the elevators are down from the parking garage  so there is no easy accessible access to the apartment  we had to go up several flights of stairs   While we could manage  someone with a wheelchair could not 
552897913162179556,Awesome place to stay   spot clean  nice location  We will definitely be coming back  Hi  We really really enjoyed our time at your place  Eveything Was s per clean  the bed Was AMAZING  so were the pillows  Just want to give you a couple of tips  not because we were angry about them  or anyhing like that  but because I also have a property as a rental and all comments are to be better     the outlet closest to the fridge wasnt working  At first I thought the kettle and coffee grinder didnt work  but it was de outlet      you left   bottles of conditioner  and we coudnt find shampoo or body wash     the bathroom door doesnt close all the way  so it was kind of ackward going to the bathroom with someone Else in the Room hehe    we had some Issues with at the Arrival with the keys  but it was fixed in    minutes   wouldve love if there was a regular coffee machine  cause we kind of Made a mess just with the kettle and beans    We will come back for sure and recommend your place to our friends    Saludos  Mar a

551511047688228865,first the good  super clean  awesome location  right next to free trolly stop   view is beautiful   the bad  for four guests and two bedrooms only one key and fob  you need fob to get into building and use elevator  I asked host and they said extra fob only if we were staying    days  the second bedroom had window into the living room and the curtain only covered    percent of window  the water pressure in second bathroom was super low

550060381437867597,I will never ever rent an Airbnb from this company again the check in process and the communication with Company is absolutely horrible and their customer service Isn t much better  I had to stay there because my house was being worked on the first time they gave me a late check out but then locked me out of the unit    minutes before and I couldn t get anything out for four hours unfortunately I had to stay another day so the next day they gave me a two hour late check out but the housekeeper was there at    o clock and I had to leave so they did absolutely nothing for all my hasslesCommunication between your housekeepers and yourself is key and don t lock people out of the unit just because it s after    o clock I couldn t even get to my phone to call anybody worst experience ever Check in is horrible the process takes forever  My suggestion would be also if you re gonna let somebody have a late check out to actually give it to them don t Lock them out before they even get a chance to get their stuff out
549989433500903753,Very nice
510153271514404979,Nice little place  Clean Hey thanks  Nice place   Will be back
510144271019327650,Nice place but area a little rough 
459357793131125412,Despite some confusions during the checkin process  finding the right entrance door   overall we enjoyed the stay   The place is in a safe neighborhood and very close to UChicago campus   The host was very prompt and responsive in helping us  solving the checkin issue   Wed definitely consider using Zen again if we revisit Chicago next time  Despite the challenges encountered during the checkin  overall we enjoyed our stay and Thank you for the service   We suggest to make some improvement in the checkin instruction as some of the description can be a bit more accurate 
455743795481378495,It s a really cute spot  it doesn t get much sunlight but there are enough lights inside to accommodate  Would definitely recommend
445647890647160678,  There was rats     I would like either half refunded back or full refund   I was difficult for us to sleep with them running around  
429667189783905672,Nice little studio located in the middle of Hyde Park  Safe  clean neighborhood  no issues getting around or finding the place  The apartment was nice    plenty of room for a studio  The bedsprings were a bit noisy  but the linens were clean and comfortable  Apartment was quiet otherwise  Check in was super easy  Thanks for the rental   this place was very good for my needs 
428281784073549266,Got locked out multiple of times because the only way to get in is a call telecom which unlocks the first two main doors to the building which didn t work many times during my stay I contacted the host and didn t get a response the entire stay or at all for that matter  it was a very upsetting experience I have stayed at multiple location by the host and has been a loyal customer this was a very bad experience never got an apology nor any acknowledgement about the situation
531142914368657179,Good place to stay  great location  great value  and well pleased with the overall place  Bed was comfortable  Access to building and parking was easy  Everything was clean  only thing that could have used a little clean was the shower floor  Thank you for a good stay while we were on a mini vacation  We enjoyed our selves and will be renting again  Maybe just a small suggestion  it would be great to have a fob to open the door or a little shorter passcode  Was a little long to enter each time  Just a thought  Thanks again  
538384108652306289,Great stay 
486932770033969519,great place and location  very close to restaurant and shops  walking around the neighborhood was cool  the blue line train station is just a    minute walk away great place and location  having a Keurig wouldve been cool but really enjoyed our stay  thank you
485536166956809915,Forgot very important and meaningful items and I m sure whoever clean the room after we left took my items didn t report they were lost and found and NOBODY bothered to help  This was a terrible experience I forgot very important and meaningful items here and  no one was answering or bothered to help  Very very poor service  
526822477038544406, loved my stay they were very prompt with communication and I had access to someone when I needed them I love the timely response
526808479242825255,  Couch pillows had a smell  When someone in the building took a shower the pipes were very loud  got woken up many times in the middle of the night from someone running water 
417314396329983227,This apartment is in a great location if you want to be accessible to Hyde Park  The neighborhood is walkable with lots of restaurants and coffee shops close by    Check in directions were clear and easy to follow  The wifi was strong and reliable the entire time  I appreciated the nice TV  the shower supplies and the extra towels that were available  The building also has laundry at the end of the hall which accepts credit cards  which was super convenient    That being said  it s clear that while the unit does get routinely clean in between stays  it has not been deep clean in some time  The corners all have built up paint flakes and dust  there are mysterious stains on the chair and in the fridge  and I encountered a couple of bugs as well  Some surfaces are sticky   Also  the bed is loud  very squeaky  and quite uncomfortable    Overall  it s essentially a college dorm  It will be a safe and mostly quiet place to sleep  work  and do light prep in the kitchen  However  don t expect a fancy type of stay from this unit 
408641768263484944,nice looking  very clean  stocked well  Great location  loved it  it was very nice looking and clean  I enjoyed my stay  thank you  
405757043268876737,Very very clean space  It is literally a perfect spot near so many attractions and stores in Hyde park   I would use this space again as a personal get away  The only thing I hated was how squeaky the bed was  It was very hard  to rest because the bed was super squeaky    Like it was very hard to rest 
394137909279790292,Very private  it s a lovely space in a great location  Everything was clean and it has everything you need for an out of town trip  Zen is very responsive and helped us out a lot  Thank you  Thanks for having us  Your property was delightful 
507308828670286161,Suited our needs for a few days  Great location  Comfortable spot  Thank you  The apt was a great place to stay for our time in Chicago 
547140106369146898,This property  one of MANY  Was absolutely amazing the perfect place located right in the smack dab center of life   Thank you soooo Much  for a first time visiting Chicago this location was perfect the community was amazing even the interaction with people here was awesome would love to stay at more of your properties on our next visit to Chicago which will be soon    
543526569455603831,The location was great  pretty much within    minutes of anywhere in the city  Parking was really simple as there s plenty of free street parking around  The place wasn t exactly the cleanest but it was liveable   The last posted  clean  date was       and I stayed in mid Jan   There also was no shampoo or conditioner despite the listing saying there would be which is fine just a minor inconvenience and would ve been good to know beforehand 
541983504733222858,We stayed at this property in January   very cold outside  and it provided a lovely little escape  If youre not familiar with Chicago  Pilsen is a thriving area with a vibrant Hispanic culture   much of the local cuisine and the shops are Mexican Hispanic  If you like authentic street tacos  you will love this area  The property is about   blocks from the nearest train station  about a    minute walk   We did the walk  I think   times and  even in the cold  it wasnt a big deal for us   The property itself was lovely   bigger than we expected  Full kitchen  two bedrooms with full or queen beds  two full bathrooms  and little living  eating and working areas  It was a lighter on extras than some other places Ive stayed  if youre choosing a place for the snacks  coffee  local recommendations  or notes that are sometimes left by hosts  you will be disappointed  but it has all the essentials for preparing food  soft blankets and great pillows for sleeping  plenty of towels  a hair dryer in both bathrooms  and TV and wifi  Despite being in a shared building  it was fairly quiet   we had no issues with noise or disturbances from other apartments   A note  the directions for getting into the property might seem a little overwhelming when you first get them  but even half asleep after driving all day  in the dark and cold  we were able to follow them and got right in   We dont often visit the Chicago area  but if we do again  we would definitely consider this property again  though probably when its slightly warmer to make the walk to the train even more pleasant    Hi  We really enjoyed our stay  A couple of very minor suggestions that could help future renters     a rug or mat by the door   we felt terrible with all the melting and snow and salt that came in  we took our shoes off in the hall to try and keep the mess down     change the thermostat settings  it was so cold in there for most of our stay     add some coffee  or a note for people to bring their own to the listing   you have all the coffee making supplies  but no coffee     otherwise our stay was great  the property was perfect 
539893205399427334,Excellent location  great value  speedy communication  would recommend  Thank you so much  I really enjoyed the space  location and appreciated your help with the Wi Fi 
486908678182249600,It was awesome to stay here  It was very good to stay here  we liked it a lot  We only have a suggestion  we didn t really like the idea to lock the thermostat  We are very sensitive to cold  so every morning we would think it s too cold after shower and it was bad for us not to be able to change the temperature  And at night would be really hot
499241197840902303,I was locked out of the building one night for   hours until someone who live in the building let me in  The call box outside didn t work so I was locked out
526794198626402094,I simply LOVE ZENCITY Thank you for another comfortable stay
537633244924030892,Great stay 
537014558993613743,Perfect studio apartment for a couple nights   clean and location was perfect 
477536047335566343,We stayed for a doctors appointment and we live   hours away  The check in process was awful and communication sucked  Check In time was at   and didn t get check in details about where the apt was or the   codes you need to get In until almost    Then when we got there  the code for the door didn t work  we had to call the doorman  We got up to our apartment and the code they gave us for the door went off  They had given us a wrong code  no one responded until I had to call the immediate service line to get help which proceeded to take over    minutes so at least an hour just to get into the apartment  While it is a nice and spacious apartment  it was enough to where we won t be using this host again 
499963037937096090,Nice stay  Only problem was finding parking 
504306600866166603,We really loved the location  communication and ease of access and check in  We had some issues with the internet for teleworking purposes  Zen city provided other options which worked  Out well enough so we were able to work remotely  The connection was somewhat slow though  But it worked it out great and we really enjoyed our stay  Hope to be back 
492718285110253209,Great place  Great location  I will definitely stay again  Thank you  Place was great and worked perfectly 
560868519466725508,Fantastic spot but ambulances are frequent and there weren t anyways to control the furnaces that ran constantly  The temperature of the room or the living area was far too hot with no ways of adjusting 
560194096824992861,This place has so much potential  I want to start with the good things    the check in Instructions are super clear  and walk you through step by step  The unit itself was immaculately clean  and it was decorated cutely  The building it s in was nice  clean  and an amazing location so close to everything    First issue  I sit down on the couch and it was still SOAKED from whatever the cleaners used to clean it  not a big deal in my head im like at least it was clean throughly    second  the living room tv is plugged into an outlet that is on a switch by the front door  not normally a big deal but this switch also controls every overhead light in the space so you cant turn the lights off without turning the tv off  so if you want to watch tv you will watch it with every light on   supper annoying    third  my first night at  am the smoke detector starts chirping and wakes me up  i message the host and they send someone over while i was gone  i get a message saying   we have stopped the smoke alarm from chirping but in the process lost all power in the living room and kitchen   my jaw dropped  so i messaged back saying    am i supposed to sit in the dark or    they then let me know that they ran an extension cord for the tv and that they arent sure if they can get the lights working before my checkout    i finally get back to the unit  guess what  smoke alarm is STILL chirping  i have no lights  etc  i ended up calling the host snd they couldnt do anything  i found the breaker box and at least got the lights to turn back on  how did their own staff not check to see if they popped a breaker  then lied about the smoke alarm    two nights with no sleep  a useless host  etc   it sucks because this place has so much potential but i have zero confidence in any one on their team except their clean crew 
499955046289146141,It took over an hour to get checked in as the door code provided was inaccurate  The room was not very clean  the bathroom had hairs in tub  on back of toilet  etc   The smell was terrible and they had left the windows open to air it out when I arrived 
474627569324068364,Nice  quiet and well maintained building with pleasant staff in a good location if you re visiting U of Chicago or other south side Chicago sights   Only complaint is the unit was listed as having a  fully stocked kitchen     Maybe my expectations are different from the usual user  but this fully stocked kitchen didn t have a pot big enough to boil pasta  any pans that could be used in the oven or even a cutting board 
560138151856122311,Great place to stay
521061893914366667,The access into the building was non existent  Other people let me into the building  The whole apartment was dirty  Stains on the furniture  Hair all over the bathroom  No garbage bags  No salt or pepper  The soap was just water   Someone walked up and down the hallway speaking loudly on their phone all day long  The people right above the apartment were fight so bad  I could hear cussing and sounded like someone being beat  SThe access into the building was non existent  Other people let me into the building  The whole apartment was dirty  Stains on the furniture  Hair all over the bathroom  No garbage bags  No salt or pepper  The soap was just water   Someone walked up and down the hallway speaking loudly on their phone all day long  The people right above the apartment were fight so bad  I could hear cussing and sounded like someone being beat

466619307919834948,This place is in a great location  walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and stores  You are a couple blocks away from the Metra that can take you to downtown  The place is cozy and true to the pictures  Enjoyed my time staying there  Amazing apartment and location  Super cozy and gave me true Chicago vibes  Thank you for the opportunity to stay at one of yours locations  Look forward to stay at your other locations

559431938019883450,Great location safe parking and secure entrance to apartment  very nice spot  just a fyi the air filter need replaced and the air vents have majorbust build upon them 
477465948227496070,The place was beautiful and everything the photos showed  Very convenient to walk to different restaurants and explore the city  There is no elevator and the stairs going up to the apartment are a steep incline Your Airbnb was beautiful and it was nice to get away from our  city  and enjoy someone else s  However  those stairs were a thing of themselves  My friend has a knee injury and if we had known how steep they were and there was no elevator access  we wouldn t have stayed here 
559411725741785875,Great location  Spacious  Stocked with necessities  It was great  I used one bedroom of the three  Didn t realize it would be so spacious  I would check your smoke detectors  One of them is incessantly chirping  Great stay  Would stay again

558701422989874004,Check in could be better code was wrong and I had to wait outside apartment for about       mins  Not sure what issue is with carpet but it had a darkish tent to it when I checked in but host felt I stained carpet with chewing gum and I don t chew gum and have never had a bad review for cleanliness so that doesn t make sense  Also the tub is peeling and should be fixed  Great location plenty of silverware and plates also has Netflix and nice kitchen  Check in could be better code was wrong and I had to wait outside apartment for about       mins  Not sure what issue is with carpet but it had a darkish tent to it when I checked in and the tub is peeling also just a few things that could be changed  Not trying to be malicious in any way I appreciate your communication as well as plenty of dishes and forks  Thank you
558693274496907897,Awesome place to stay  Very clean and spacious 
476752360549831418,I love this place   Safe neighbourhood  grate location  Restaurant is few minutes walk  An entire apartment is very convenient   The only thing needs pay attention is that the entrance is not on the listing address    You will receive it in your instructions   I assumed they are the same and went to a wrong door

556546831532063237,Traveling for work  this had everything I needed  Love the proximity to the local night life  Easy access to building and room  Safe area  Thanks   Third stay with you guys  enjoyed them all 
505847827149896877,This studio is in a great location    blocks from Enterprise Stadium and very close to Ballpark Village  The parking garage was excellent as it was free and we did not have to worry about parking on the street  The closet area is very large was much appreciated  Cozy bedding and a comfortable mattress made for a relaxing weekend  We would stay at this location again  The price cannot be beat  Bathroom sink had water pressure that was a trickle and the sink did not drain well and was almost completely clogged  This was not a huge deal and is a quick fix  Overall a great stay  Please checking other messages for comments regarding the clean person we encountered 
556543247220445939,Nice location and nice house very clean Very nice house clean and well put together
531878214589417802,Great location to stay  Stay is exactly like pictures  They take up to a day to answer  Seemed like one switch in the kitchen controlled the power for the entire place  The smoke alarm will beep if you have the power switch off  This happened one night and when we reached out for someone to fix it and we got no response  We were able to leave the lights on outside of the bedroom and close the doors at night so no beep and we could sleep  The location  rooftop  and parking garage is a huge help  Would stay again and suggest to others as we love LS park but would preface with this air bnb is ran by a rental company 
492051826911315690,Ive stayed here previously and it was a pleasure  This time around not so much   During my stay  The heat didnt work while it was    degree weather   When I called for assistance  the assistant asked me the temperature inside the apartment and hung up on me   There were no replies to my heat related questions on the app during my stay   Outside of this experience  the airbnb sufficed  But this ruined a good stay  Ive stayed here previously and had a great stay  This stay was not the same  The heat didnt work while it was    degrees outside and the person meant to assist hung up on me   This was a terrible experience 
556499630127835177,Zencity always comes through for me  Zencity always come through for me 
555821201434739689,I do not recommend this Airbnb  I wish I could  The Host is just simply bad  The location was decent  These are some of the issues we encountered during our stay  a shower that didn t give much more than a trickle  A smoke detector that beeped at night when lights were turned off  A dryer that did not dry its contents  And a strange electrical wiring arrangement that turns off all of lights  lamps  TV  speaker  and apparently the smoke detector too with the flip of a switch  So no mood lighting  When I reached out to the host the morning after our first night about the shower and noise  we got a response that they couldn t be fixed until the next day due to a snowstorm  I said this wouldn t work for us because these were not small issues we could work around  No response  After some back and forth with various people from Zencity  but mostly me being totally ignored every time I reached out for an update  over our   night stay NOTHING was fixed while we were there  A complete lack of care  I didn t feel like I got my moneys worth  that s for sure  To top all of it off  I reached out an asked for a later checkout and no one ever replied after multiple messages  I received an email the night prior asking if we wanted to extend checkout to  pm  Instead of replying  they sent their clean team they failed to communicate with  I did finally get a reply when they asked why were still in the unit  And they even went through the effort of trying to charge us     for late checkout with Airbnb  This is what they do instead of addressing their guest needs  Zencity needs a lot of help on what it takes to be a good host  Most definitely not a legitimate SuperHost  Communicate with guests and promptly fix issues without excuses  Your guests are what keep you in business and you need to do everything you can to ensure you resolve inquiries in a timely manner  You were overall not a good host  not because of the issues but because your lack of communication and compassion  If our issues continue to go unresolved we feel like we aren t important as guests 
555124969490732878,Easy to get to  close walk to BJH  Great location  Very clean  Thank you for the wonderful stay  Everything was great  It was clean and a convenient location for us nurses walking in the snow storm
555109071034871530,Great place to stay Very nice place to stay  Close to all major highways
492754149996736846,Great stay  and good location  Great stay  carpet could have been vacuumed and the table is really wobbly  beds and everything else were great 
555036277559724413,I loved my stay   I highly recommend      percent   I appreciate it thank you so much I loved my stay   host thank you so much  
554405356338901104,Apartment was clean   spacious  Communication was good  Check in was a bit confusing at front desk  But overall great stay 
494895186193030831,Nice studio apartment  well located next to the train   Good wifi  Hi   I enjoyed my stay and this was my second or third stay at the property   One comment   Usually when I stay at a place with a kitchen there are some bare minimal items e g  salt and pepper   Your property had nothing at all as a kitchen starter  which was a bit disappointing 
553639553728111096,Big apartment  lots of space  great views   Building was very busy  but noise didn t seem to carry into apt  Working elevator  Thank you   Another great stay  
487638247678394012,The unit was not clean  I arrived to trash on the floor in the bathroom  dirty walls  rugs not swept  The internet is google fibers free plan   Mbps down   Mbps up  very rough to use for basic work needs  Free parking was easy to find all times of day within a block of the entrance  Support takes multiple hours if not days to get back to you and they can t do much besides pass it along to their manager  The phone number provided for around the clock issues just tells you to try again  no one answered  Not worth the price  had a terrible experience  Have support that can actually help  Clean units before guests arrive  Internet that actually works not some terrible free tier service 
523201786502204600,Great stay Great
552246277017941240, rd time staying here   a great value near Lafayette Square 
552207716343036247,Zencity provided a clean apartment for my stay  The communication was great and the check in process was smooth  The apartment was affordable and nicer than I expected  Give them a try  I enjoyed my stay in this Airbnb  The apartment was very clean and comfortable  I loved the view of the skyline and the Arch  It was also close to the train station which I really appreciated as I did not have to call an Uber to get to and from the station  There was a keyfob that I couldnt get to work  but thats probably more so on me than the fob  There were no issues getting in and out the building or apartment  You could hear some of the neighbors talking in the hall or through the walls  but that didnt really bother me  Overall  a great stay in a nice apartment 
552173294336810447,Apartment is great for short term stays  Host responded to my questions promptly early on  There was just an issue with the heating system  It is window unit in the living room that never reaches the bedroom so when nights get cold make sure you bring extra blankets and maybe a space heater  Since it is an old building there is a chance that the pipes will freeze so you might not get to take a shower  The host did respond to attempt to fix the issue sending a maintenance man but he said there was nothing he could do  When I did arrive a lamp was missing and there was already damage done to the apartment so it wasnt properly being maintained  It is good for a short term stay     days definitely not long term 
552134540145471727,I loved this space  It s efficient and clean  The bathroom is a bit dated but works fine  The parking is a bit dodgy and someone did trash the inside of my truck while it was parked but nothing was taken  So parking was a little tough and if it s cold outside it could be frustrating with little ones but the unit was nice and the person at the front desk was helpful  I would recommend staying here if you don t have little ones or if weather conditions are favorable
551523521837099777,Area close to nice food options  Right next to the hospital and park  Street parking takes a little work  Nice small touches  Bathroom is a little beat up but nice place overall  the tub and shower curtains could use replacing 
551518306204163339,Great place to stay for the weekend  Thank you  
536303373372344430,Small but perfect in a great neighborhood  Absolutely easy check in and very modern feel  Unit has washer and dryer to do your own laundry  Perfect for longer stays  Surrounded by great places to eat and have a few drinks  Highly recommended  Thank you for hosting us  Place was awesome 
507974238831330146,the facility was great and the location was great for my needs and the price was spot on  Response time to entry information and f u was not timely
536300962129731545,The place is exactly as described and a nice little place to stay  The upstairs neighbors were a little loud but not too bad  All in all it was a good weekend and would definitely stay again  Thanks for the stay in the beautiful lil place  We had a great time and would definitely stay again 
549972777289436449,Great location and really easy to check in  The couch smelled a little funky so I bought some fabric refresher and that helped  Check the key fobs I couldn t get into the gym
549337804225588041,No free washer and dryer and make certain you got the right door code The no free washer and dryer the sliding door open the cigarette butts and contact wrappers all were not ok and the inability to check in cause wrong door code everything else was great
549300928537598443,This Loft was everything and more  The view was beautiful  easy check in   and you are literally in the city of everything  We love KC   thank you zen city for providing such a clean modern space  We loved it and will be booking again soon  Thank You so Much for providing a clean and neat space  We will definitely be visiting again soon and will be booking with zen city 
547174849679215200,Great location  clean and spacious   A couple little quirks but good communication overall   Great bakery in the lobby  and having the gym was nice     min walk from Convention Center Theatre   Know that if you re a light sleeper  you may want to bring a sleep mask if you re in the front room   it gets a bit bright in the morning   Would recommend overall  Thank you   We really did love our stay but had a couple constructive things to share   We had to communicate frequently with the building itself  especially when trying to get another fob   I realize it costs you to get a fob from them  but   weeks is a very long time to expect more than one person to use the same key   Also  we were always very conscientious of the noise level and the noise device location was a bit frustrating   even if you said a sentence or two at a low volume near its location in the kitchen island  you would receive a notification   Lastly  the address of this particular location tells you it s in Grandview so that might need to be updated on you end to not confuse anyone   Outside of that  we really did have a lovely stay   Thanks so much 
536964045719453126,Awesome location and beautiful interior  There were some problems checking in because the PIN didn t work  but someone was readily available to troubleshoot the issue at night  Zencity also sent someone to change the batteries in the door  which was appreciated although I didn t receive a notification before the individual came to the unit and proceeded to open the door  Lots of food options nearby  The shower door never stayed closed for me  but the unit had great climate control  so it didn t bother me   The bed was very hard but did the trick for my short stay  Thanks for the stay  Be sure to advise your guests when someone is coming to make repairs  Beautiful unit you have here 
536205419307987616,It was a nice unit to stay at in Kansas City  It was a nice place to stay 
531947479780039401,Great place  very quiet and great security  Close to restaurants and shopping  Would definitely stay again 
526807488094425215,This is a  functional  place to stay  Your expectations need to be measured  It is not a luxury building or sophisticated apartment  it s a place to get a decent night s sleep  I was unimpressed with the way the apartment was presented  visible dust  dirt  hair  The paint job is very patchy and makes the room feel more neglected than it is  It s quiet  especially considering it s proximity to the train  Heating works perfectly  It s a solid   star place to stay  I wouldn t stay here again  Hi   So  I don t like leaving negative reviews  but this property is pretty lackluster  It was incredibly dirty  hair in the bed  stains on the towels  visible dust and dirt on the floor  I wouldn t accept this room if it was presented to me in a hotel  but I know Airbnb would a different  I think the bad paint job and sparse furniture didn t help the feeling that this was a neglected apartment  The pillows are very poor quality  almost unusable  The location is great  I was upset that the check in process wasn t smooth  but you did call me with     an hr to help me out   It s definitely a   star experience  I ve stayed in better places for less  but the holiday season is always more expensive  The WiFi is great  The heating works well  There was no laundry detergent 
534079206819182867,Exactly the same in photos uploaded  Highly recommend this condo  Satisfied of the cleanliness of the place  Please provide disposable slippers and coffee maker  Thanks for comfortable condo with almost complete equipments  It s exactly the same in the photos  Kindly response to your customers immediately specially in emergency situations  Felt disappointed honestly of what happened in the my first day 
526123615801537544,Exactly what I needed for a short trip  Great value and location for a very affordable price  Thanks for hosting a great last minute stay  Just one very small piece of feedback  but one of the small hotel like toiletries in the bathroom had been used and not replaced prior to my arrival  Other than that  everything was great 
442660719256824929,We enjoyed our stay at Slawik s place  Our granddaughter needed a place to rest and recover from a procedure at Children s Mercy and it was so nice to have such a spacious place to spread out  The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking meals and the beds were comfy  The shower had good water pressure and everything was clean  And access to a washer and dryer was great too  We had no trouble parking or accessing the lock  The house is old but everything has been updated still keeping the charm  It has so much character and style   Slawik always responded quickly to answer my questions  We would definitely stay again  Thank you for such a nice place to hang out while we we rested from the medical procedures my granddaughter had to have  She loved the rocking elephant   I would like to suggest having a few kitchen towels available to wash and dry with  We only had the one tea towel and we had to use one of the black wash clothes to wash dishes   Also the light in the  nd bedroom is going out    I really like all the remodeling  Such a nice job   I like the flooring you put down in the basement  Could you tell me what you used  I m needing to do something with my own basement floor      Thanks again Slawik 
526794484305207011,This is a great unit right next to Barnes Jewish Hospital and in a safe area  The staff at the front desk were helpful getting me in and the unit was very clean  The building has a furnace on that made the unit warmer than anticipated  Random warm December weather   but I was able to open the window and compensate for it  no problem  A good value stay  Appreciate the stay
536265885170277897,Unit was nice  Reserve parking somewhere nearby ahead of time
535575223304244143,Perfect Location just minutes away from everything 
534774056739555326,Great home to stay at  Clean when we arrived and beautifully decorated  Great place to stay at 
534115104136814144,If you want to visit the Hyde Park area  then this apartment is in a great location  The apartment is very roomy  however  we were disappointed with our experience because the apartment had several issues  mostly minor   but they sort of added up to a negative experience   For example  the water in one of the showers did not work  the controls on a couple of the radiators were not functioning  a maintenance worker came and fixed one but for some reason did not fix the other   the carpet needed clean  the coffee maker was left with moldy coffee grounds  and the French press was cracked  we were told that we would receive a new one but never did   With some more TLC  this could be a great apartment 
532675936157235530,This was a great Airbnb experience  Hosts were nice  even shoveled the snow for us    check in out instructions were clear  and neighborhood was in perfect walking distance to shops and restaurants 
510855542568043431,The place was magnificent  Great view of the city  safe   secure  Loved every min  Definitely booking again  kudos  Thanks and everything was perfect the only thing would be better is parking which I would not put in Review just for you I got parking ticket but no worries
531861774296466873,Great location  Beautiful downtown scenery and very simple checkin  Thank you so much for the stay  We all had a great weekend and wonderful time and in KC 
532655337805887211,Harassed us about every little thing   kept telling us to keep noise down despite there being   of us   no TV no music  Unit   D has the most amazing miserable neighbor who bangs on your wall and leaves nasty notes under ur door   I have screen shots I kid u not  we actually had to pay for   places to stay bc it became so much of a headache Harassed us w texts about noise when there was   of us no music no tv  and we were kept up by noise not making it  We actually had to pay for   places to stay bc we were so uncomfortable
532607951566819662,Great place  Would highly recommend to anyone  Great place  Would love to stay there again
530436313454673768,Clean  smaller than what the pictures show  attentive hosts Thank you  
529738055211789647,The internet was very intermittent and slow and only worked in one room and the host did not respond to messages about it   Otherwise  fine place and great location 
526878455833004454,Worked for our needs  would stay here again  Worked for our needs  would stay here again 
526834761248815398,An awesome stay  The location is close to Target  and many cool restaurants  The kitchen s well equipped  and the bathroom is pretty spacious        would stay here again for my next Chicago trip  An absolutely phenomenal stay  Everything was wonderful and I particularly appreciate the well equipped kitchen 
430376916572837057,Such a gem  This place is full of charm and character  Warm and authentic feeling  this is not your typical airbnb  This feels much more like a true lived in home  Beautiful historic interior full of antique relics and stained glass windows that reflect magical shimmers of rainbow light throughout the day  I enjoyed time playing the piano  brewing fresh mint tea from the back yard   relaxing in one of the bathtubs and planning our activities around the kitchen table  Coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance  the perfect location to get around  The host was incredibly friendly and responsive  I think the value for what we paid for was a super good deal  Ill be sure to stay here again next time I find myself in KCMO and will be recommending to all my friends    Regards    Weston Broache  August       We had a wonderful experience  The only minor issue was the shower head zip tied in the upstair bathroom and the shower curtains that hug you which im sure you are aware of already  I think just a better mount and some weights on the shower curtains would be a huge improvement  However  I had a lovely time just using it as a bath tub so it was no problem for me personally 
426086487289365795,You can expect a great stay  The Zen Rentals are clean  spacious  vibrant and actually look like the photos on the app   The free Hulu and Netflix is a phenomenal touch  The hotel style amenities are great in case you didn t bring basic toiletries   I ve stayed at two Zen properties so far and my experiences have been beyond my expectations   I m a chicago resident renting an airbnb in Chicago and I couldn t be more pleased  Thanks  Our stay at The Windermere in Hyde Park was lovely  The rental is very large and comfortable  Access to the lake in less than   minutes ON FOOT  Restaurants and activities near like the museums  divvy bikes  architecture tours and more   The hotel style amenities are a great touch  It seems to me that all of the Zen Rentals have the same amenities  consistency is key  The pictures on the app actually look like the rental    The front desk staff is pleasant and interactive  No issues being a temporary guest   I ll definitely be staying here and with Zen Rentals again  I m spoiled lol
551503615470830563,It s a really nice place    Great place   
526811505425249900,The place is nice  It s close to BJH hospital which is good for traveling medical professionals  however  The bathroom flooded one morning  It took    hours of conversation before they would even send a maintenance man  Said maintenance man never showed  The next morning the bathtub filled with feces after I flushed the toilet and the entire bathroom flooded again  I have yet to hear from them regarding this and I messaged them    hours ago 
551488877740894091,Great area  black out curtains  beautiful dark walls  exactly the look on the picture  modernized everything in the suite  workout center  so many restaurants and entertainment  close to downtown  central west end  dogtown  southside  etc  The suite was beautiful  clean  alot of newness   Love the dark walls and blackout curtains      I grew up in St  Louis  MO and Lafayette Square is one of my favorite areas  especially with all the beautiful modifications  add ons and restructurings   Few issues I had was  remote was going in and out and found two open bags of chips in a cabinet and very squeaky bed   Other than  if available will book again  
551487031128045180,This place was perfect for seeing an event at Americas Center  Such a short walk to many local eats  Parking wasn t an issue  plenty of street parking  Personally parked down at Central Downtown Garage    The only BIG issue we had was with the other residents of the building  Between the hours of  am  am each night there was a lot of yelling and loud banging that we were awaken by that made it impossible to sleep  Not much you could do  but other residents in the complex were unbelievably loud between the hours of  am  am every night or our stay    The place was everything expected and a great location  we just had hard times sleeping each night from loud banging and yelling between  am  am   Thank you 
551463371190488732,The home was accurate however  the home could use some improvements  The toilet seat was not attached to the toilet which made the toilet not usable  The home was full of gnats and the walls could use some clean and a fresh coat of paint  I was glad everything was so close but if I am paying for a clean fee I expect the home to be up to par and not full of bugs and broken furniture 
551459820723329794,great value  good communication  big apartment please make sure the thermostat is unlocked  it was very annoying to be at the mercy of a fluctuating thermostat that we had no control over   great communication though  thank you
551450936135946664,The place was very clean  beds where very comfortable  in a great location to walk to stuff  communication was great with host   We will definitely stay with them again  Place was great only issue was trying to get hot water  Sometimes we had it and sometimes we really didnt   Would definitely stay again 
551414368611230418,Great location downtown  easy to find and check in was simple and clear  The place was clean and had everything we needed for our stay  Definitely a great find in St  Louis 
550789585221540733,Great hospitality and security  This is a great place to stay  Thanks  I enjoyed the hospitality and security of your  property 
550773476213881398,The building management along with the people at the front desk have nothing to do with zencity  so that whenever there is an issue  e g  with getting into the apartment  you can call and leave a message and hope that zencity would reply  Also their code generation system is messed up 
550732472143375511,this is a must rental  he place is beautiful  area is beautiful  staff is amazing  will rent again  I absolutely loved it everything was exactly as described
550723391017141278,Traveled for work  had everything I needed  Great location  Thanks  Place was perfect 
550717594281895861,You must rent this spot Very chic elegant Martin and very accommodating The owner was Johnny on the spot  Once I would message him or her  They would respond ASAP  The only issue I may had was the climate was very cold  They would adjust it when I asked  I guess because it s on auto once it went off  it instantly went cold  Because of that I have a bad cold  How we the owners and the place was fabulous  The area has nice Restaurants and amenities  In short I would stay a million times again
550001166646813145,Great location for BJH   Comfortable and well appointed French press is cutesy but I d prefer a keurig  Also would really be nice to have better toilet paper rather than the really cheap stuff  Great place overall
549984554929950512,Perfect  love the building and the location  Easy street parking too  Thank you  
549977106417539594,Great place to stay  Rooms   living room den was spacious  Host was quick to answer any questions or concerns  I would definitely stay here again   The place was great  I don t have any suggestions  I thoroughly enjoyed the stay

549241753692792552,Was a very good stay Have to make sure to get the parking right  Very good apartment and very good communication with the host A lot of noise from neighbors  A little bit of bugs Personal room should have a tv
539123121163616016,Check in took me    min  I was on calls with different Zencity representatives since there s no doorman who was going to accommodate me  at least it was said in host s instructions  Originally I booked an apartment for   days and decided to prolong it for   more day and did it through airbnb  Zencity confirmed  and charged me  On a day   I wanted to leave the apartment to get some fresh food and drinks  and since there s a code doorlock  luckily and thankfully to my tenant experience I decided to check if the code is still valid first  And it was not  I texted Zencity through Airbnb to get a new code  which they sent to me in an hour  and it didn t match too  After I said about it   they just ignored me  I had to stay in the apartment and drink tap water until the next day without any possibility to leave it cause I wouldn t be able to get it again  I couldn t get a delivery too since I d have to go to lobby  and leave an apartment  Thanks to God I didn t leave it and checked the code first cause I could spend the last night in a lobby  But they didn t forget to remind about      charge  if I d leave it after       am     times  Apartment itself was okay  nice and clean  but the service is terrible  It s not the experience I d like to have when booking a fancy apartment in a city center
548620945079468743,Good location  Clean apartment  but elevator and hallway in the building are dirty  Amenities are not matched as described 
546946150493646226,This Airbnb is located in a beautiful location  in the heart of the Central West End   Cosmetically  the unit appears unfinished especially in the bathroom   For those who love Sports  Channel   aka Fox   is not available and neither is the Fox Sports streaming app  so NO BASKETBALL AND NO FOOTBALL  Upon  entry I noticed that the blinds were broken  as though they were strategically cut  The same goes for the blinds in the kitchen  they re barely hanging on   There are some dust bunnies    but overall the unit was fairly clean  If you need a decent place to sleep  access to a kitchen  laundry  a bathroom  and Netflix  this space will satisfy your basic necessities  The space is being utilized well  in that it s being rented out via Airbnb  However  the outcome of the renovations do not seem complete   The apartment building is aged  which is ok  but within the unit s bathroom  for example  one can still see stucco or whatever material was used to resurface the walls is not done well  It s uneasy on the eyes  making it seem dirty  The renovations appear rushed and unfinished  The blinds were broken when we walked in  The apartment could be cleaner and the sheets smelled unclean 
529009097240618324,Easy check in and check out  quite building  Very close to bars  restaurants  attractions  Would stay here again  Easy check in and check out  quite building  Very close to bars  restaurants  attractions  Would stay here again 
528977611999045275,Keys were missing at first location  but they moved us to a second within a few hours  Both locations were clean and well kept 
528966229780616916,Great place checking in was a pain  but great cries of KC  It was very hard to get are key card to get into the building but once we got in the apartment was pretty nice there was some pre made damage to the apartment that wasn t very pleasing to see  but over all it was a great view of Kansas City 
527533410788249323,Make sure youre really clear about the parking instructions  Ultimately  I had to pay to get my car out of the parking garage  There were snacks left in a kitchen drawer and crumbs on the couch and area rug in the living room   The parking was a problem because unclear how to use the pass  I ultimately had to pay to get my car out of the parking garage   not free as stated in the AirBNB post 
526775078290648821,LOVE THE SPACE AND THE LOCATION
526137726125961502,Great value nice studio  The area isn t that great and there s no designated parking but I always found parking on the street relatively easily  Would stay here again
525347389359924783,Great clean place Couldnt check in for over an hour due to a double book  but apartment was great
540587809679618125,I enjoyed my stay  Would definitely recommend
524665012565479324,The space was very clean and the beds were comfy  We had a nice view and a good time hanging out  Thank you so much  Everything was great   very clean   There is a bit of a weird smell when you first walk in  I m not sure what it was exactly   Also   the noise complaint seemed like a bit of an overreaction  There was just   of us and we were listening to music  watching tv and laughing  I get that the walls may be thin  Or the neighbors may not love that there s an Airbnb next door  but I don t think we were being very loud    Oh  Also the garage elevators weren t working  so getting up via the regular elevators was a bit confusing with the key card and which elevators we could use    Overall a great  short stay 
523906123367949418,This is a great place to be low key and get away  
522506472704392690,Visited KC for a few nights  The place was beautifully decorated and clean  Great view of downtown  Security was kind and helpful  Parking was a hit or miss on the street so we paid to park in the parking garage  Overall  great stay  Thank you  We had a great stay 
522497200954707429,Great location  clean  and way more amenities and room to move then your standard hotel room  Maybe I m just old but found check in  check out  and use of garage a little confusing  But all in all a great stay    Thankfully check in was aided greatly by a very helpful person at the front desk    For check out I left the room unlocked  I guess I could have swiped the key on the outside of door and thrown it into the apartment    Garage use across the street was convenient  However I m not sure I really understand what was happening  Upon entering I took a ticket each time  then the metal overhead gate went up  When exiting the crossing arm was always up and when I drove past it the overhead door automatically opened  This was the case until  I went to leave for the last time  The gate didn t go up as it had the previous    or    times  I waved the blue key fob everywhere I could imagine with no success  Then unexpectedly the overhead door opened  Is there a person controlling this door    It might be helpful to have directions in the room near the front door for checkout or garage use  I ve probably dwelled too long on the negative  Cause it was a great stay and great location 
521722150219373335,I loved my cozy apartment  It was close to fine dining and live venues  My bed was so comfortable I didn t want to leave      The convenience of self check in was so nice  I didn t have to wait for someone  Genius  Thanks so much  I will be back  I loved this apartment  It was close to downtown   midtown  After spending the day with family it was nice to have a cozy place to crash  My first Air BNB   Zencity nailed it       Parking was a challenge but I was gone most of the time  I managed  
531904222823151699,Perfect area for downtown KC  Especially loved the simple check in and check out  Made my busy life a lot easier  Accurate descriptions of the space  Very cute and very clean  Will stay again for sure  Thank you for the short notice stay  Love the space  view and cleanliness  I hope to stay again  It s the perfect place for my contract at research hospital as I love downtown  Thanks again
