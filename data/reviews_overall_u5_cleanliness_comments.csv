616467131,I have photos   video footage of how the place was when I checked in  I had   clean up myself   I still didnt sleep in the bed  The doorman that checked me in even had   take the trash out when I checked in bcuz It was full  I even purposely poured sunflower seeds on the floor under the chair that was there and I went back in the unit the night after I checked out due   my wallet missing and after the clean lady left   guess what was still there   Sunflower seeds  under the chair    Besides these units being unclean bcuz I had   different units    I will NEVER rent from them again  my wallet seemed to magically disappear when I was the only   in the unit besides the clean lady   Thats not even the half of it     Way   much   write but I will say I spoke to  of the owners of Zencity by the name of Marty and he didnt help the situation at all  He didnt even care  Told me hell call me back and a week later I still hadnt gotta call back so I called him and he didnt even care  remember who I was    And the Way he was talking  me really pissed me off  I have also told my family   friends to stay away from Zencity properties as well

650177993,The water tasted off

348035318,The apartment had not been clean thoroughly  Laundry behind the drapes  a panful of food in fridge and old bread in cabinet 
626826592,The entire apartment smelled like cigarette and or marijuana smoke when we checked in   We notified the manager   Zencity   who basically shrugged their shoulders and did nothing   Their first response was to look for clean supplies under the kitchen sink  and there were not any there that might have helped    We found the packaging for an air filter and  smoke trapping ashtray  in a kitchen cabinet  so putting   and   together a smoker had been staying there   Zencity appartently did nothing to get rid of the smell before we arrived  in spite of the prominent notice in the apartment that no smoking is allowed and there is a      extra clean fee for smoking   We left the windows open day and night and it did reduce the odor but did not get rid of it   That led to other problems because the weather was rainy and variable and it was hard to keep the apartment at a livable temperature   And for   nights there were people partying on the building roof above us very late  so we could not keep the windows open because of the loud noise   By the way  there are big signs on both rooftop entrances saying that area is closed  but that apparently did not stop groups of heavy drinkers on   nights   We sent an email to  Zencity asking them to consider refunding     of our total charges  and the their answer has been   silence

630121342,Your blinds are messed up I just don t want you to think I did that but other then that I loved it
624934962,When we arrived  it was obvious that countertops had not been wiped down thoroughly as there were multiple watermark rings evident  Some glasses and plates were stuck to cabinet shelves  or hadnt been clean fully in the dishwasher  so they had to be ran in the dishwasher again  There were hairs in one of the bathroom sinks  and the trash had not been emptied in the other bathroom  There was also a large sticky spot right at the apartment entry kitchen area that we had to mop down    Given the obvious lack of attention given to clean and the current pandemic situation  we had to wipe the whole place down with disinfecting wipes when we arrived  as we werent sure which other areas  light switches  door handles  etc  could have possibly been missed

618022259,The bathroom witthe window had a toilet that probably cant get clean   possibly due to age  The first impression was that it was dirty but I dont think that was the case  Also   with the wood blind in the shower there was paint peeling and there was a smell of wet wood  However  overall we loved the place  We are mentioning this to help improve it 
664080907,The towels and sheets were very crisp and clean  Overall we had a great experience but these are some areas that need to be addressed especially for the price of the stay  The floor was dirty  Base boards were dirty and had water damage  the shower had mildew along the base  the garbage can was dirty as was the wall behind the garbage can there was old garbage on the wall  The blinds were broken and the toilet paper rack fell off the wall during regular usage 
622864247,After I left host asked me to pay for a Pillow that was drawn on which was not for me for a payment of     which I accepted and paid  which I should not have  after that then they requested another    for the same issue

622809734,Main bathroom toilet was clogged up after never was able to flush

700435530,The worst out of a few things on this list was the horrible cigarette smoke smell  Despite being a non smoking unit the smoke smell was obnoxious and undeniably coming from the room  The building and halls didn t smell like this until you went into the apartment unit  Had to go to the store and buy odor eliminator and air freshener  The rug in the living room had physical crumbs trash on it  The couch was just simply dirty when we had to remove the cushion due to the remote falling in the crevice  The whole floors felt like there was a layer of grime on them  The shower floor was brown in the area where one would stand to shower  I had to get on my hands and knees and try to scrub out as much as I could so my girl friend could shower without being grossed out  The white comforter had a yellow stain on it  The walls in the bedroom and bathroom had stains that appeared to be bodily fluids when using a black light  The laminated card on the little chalk board that says  clean by  didn t have a personnel name or a date  For all I know the place wasn t clean before my stay

476678832,There was a bag of open coffee in the cupboard and sugar spilled in there as well   There was also a dirty pizza cutter in the drawer   The soap dispenser didnt work either and the water pressure was so low in the kitchen it was very difficult to clean anything 
476591037,bed sheets were clearly not clean  there was dirt   hair all over  bed sheets in the closet were also not clean so i had to go to Target and buy my own bedding because i didnt trust they would bring clean sheets    overall  the apartment is in desperate need for a deep clean  its obvious its been quickly clean over and over again but with zero effort    when running the water in the bathroom  it came out brown at first   the garbage was full in the bathroom with toilet paper and paper towels   view was really nice

563059410,There was hair in the shower and the floor made our feet dirty  Would help to have a rug somewhere in the common area because the hardwood was dirty very quickly  Also you all should figure out where the foul odor in the kitchen is coming from because it was very prominent for many hours of the day  Probably the only thing that will keep us from using that space again 
562389164,Pretty clean  the kitchen stove had a little of left over burnt grind stuck to the burner covers  The floors could ve been a little cleaner but other than that the rest of the place was spotless

658590192,There were a couple of hand prints on the wall  some we wondering how they got there  I figured it must have been from the clean crew   I traveled with a female companion and there was a reptile of some sort that was crawling on the wall  It didnt bother me knowing the  type of building that we were staying in  but it scared the living day lights out of her  Other than that the place was exceptionally clean 
660626477,Sticky floor
640172989,My husband found a ball of hair on windowsill of bathroom  right after we arrived  This made us question how thoroughly the studio was clean    Baseboards throughout not clean   Looked as if only center of room clean   Under the bed and under desk still dirty  Windowsills dusty  Quarter size splatters on floor around stove  Flimsy plastic toilet seat had loose screws   Kitchen trashcan lid broken  white tape to hold lid to hinge did nothing 
671114187,It seems the vacuum used isn t working well   there was hair and dirt  lint clumps on the rug in the living room  There was also a ball of hair in the corner of the bathroom  white soap gunk on the hanging rack in the shower  and food crusties in the fridge  The tub drain for the shower wasn t draining well so when I checked it  the entire drain pulled out and I found a huge hair ball all matted inside the drain stop 
711477951,The bathroom towel hanging on the rack for show was dirty
633852201,The floors were extremely dirty throughout the apartment  There were broken window blinds  water damage and peeling drywall in the bedroom  and hair dirt on baseboards and in corners  The kitchen appeared to be well clean  though 
640239912,The tub and floor had hair all over 
631475383,Things were not super restocked  no paper towels  not a lot of TP  And it seemed like they dont replace the little hotel sized shampoo soap bottles  There was one that had the shampoo seeping out and crusted on the outside and one that had a tiny hair in it  Which during COVID  wasnt super comforting  Just made me question how thorough they were in the rest of the clean  Everything was put together nicely though

640248782,Under the living room couch cushions was very gross  There were liquid splash marks on the walls
657439748,After a few days following routine pest control  there were roaches appearing  I dont believe this was a  direct cleanliness issue but renters should be aware 
652913746,The floors needed to be swept  The rug and carpet needed to be vacuuming  Had to clean spider webs out of the windows 
656397328,When we first arrived and I used the bathroom  there was a ponytail with hair wrapped around it on the floor  The trashcan in the bathroom was full of qtips and a feminine product  Later on in the evening  we discovered the the kitchen trash had not been taken out either and was half full  During COVID     I did not expect to pick up and have to clean the place before feeling comfortable enough to stay there    Just makes me wonder what the clean fee is going towards 
700455037,The Main bedroom had what looked like dried bloody snot on the comforter and blood stains   There was an extra comforter to use   but to say I was a little grossed out when I went to go to bed is an understatement
636502895,Found different types of hairs in the bathroom tub  Couch had unidentified stains 
635468570,When I first arrived  the house smelt really bad like a dead mouse in the walls  I did message the company and they responded fast which Was great but issue was not fixed  I had to get air freshener during my stay  
658519746,The bathroom lacks ventilation and had a bit of a musty smell  They were also on a tight schedule and still clean the apartment when I attempted to check in       hours after check in time  It also would be awesome if they stocked detergent for the in unit laundry machine  I did buy some and leave it behind for others  
662423193,Kitchen sink around drain needed scouring  The walls are visibly soiled with scrapes and handprints 
639135171,Broken lamp next to the dining area  as well as some type of liquid in cups in the pantry
642277952,Had an amazing time at this location  Only thing I can say negative was there was no elevator and it was a lot of stairs back and fourth 
643371956,this place is so dated and shows  the pillows did not have protective covers on them and several were ripped  The iron had a black coating that could not be used on clothing bathroom mat did not seem clean I have stayed in this unit before
636247287,The place was clean however under the bed there was trash  In the bathroom the towels had hair on them
662438412,I felt the linens made me sneeze quite a bit and needed a little better washing but most other things were clean  There was also no coffee but a coffee maker  I wish I had brought some along

658709793,I previously stayed at this unit a few months back then no major issues thought it was a great place to stay  Now on my recent visit was different  Upon arriving inside unit I went to bathroom and notice shower was not clean and had old used bar of soap on soap holder inside shower  I was very disappointed I refuse to shower in a unclean shower  So I bought clean supplies to clean myself  The other issue was the front room couch it was finger nails clippings on couch seat cushions and a  lighter stuck inbetween pillows  I knew this place was not properly clean  Its a beautiful place but wish the unit was clean properly  The kitchen floor needed a good sweep and mopping also  Other than that I would recommend if unit is clean 
637520734,There was quite a bit of water sitting in the bottom of the oven  The bathroom sink is probably close to being completely clogged  Finger sticky finger prints no the inside of the windows  The stairway needed to be clean from things people dropped 
639091775,The towels didn t look washed  full of hair  and the sheets didn t appear clean so I went and bought some 
638488093,Some of the plates had crusty edges
705869764,I had to clean the toilet and tub but everything else was perfect 
704499224,The bathroom was covered in tiny black hairs  namely on the floors and walls  The rug was still wet so it seems like the clean job may have been rushed  Otherwise  everything else was pretty spotless 
662987177,Extensive mold issues in the bathroom ceiling   The ceiling required an application of Kilz and new paint which should fix it 
653877363,sink had mold  cobwebs in living room  baseboards were not clean  windows were so dirty you couldnt see out of them 
661662584,First when we got there   we like this place  good area  and security but when we get in to the room C  the floor was very dirty with a lot of blond hair on the floor and on the rug  we have to find the vacuum and clean them   I am Asian and I have black hair    we are couples but they provide only   big towel   in the bath tub when I start to take  a shower by run hot water and I felt soap scum on the  tub slick and slide when hot water hit the tub  I clean your room really good before we check out and I got email about I split something on the rug  and want to charge me    dollars to clean that   the photo of the rug the you showed to us  was not accurate   it was crisscross weave in the room but the picture that you claimed that we split something its different  we did not split anything and I do not mind to drive     miles back to your room to confirm that   I am very disappoint    
655577623,The rugs are girly and need to be deep clean  There are stains all over 
669124424,A couple of minor overlooked clean points that we easily took care of ourselves  Outside of these things the space was clean and far from being  nasty  
474887578,Overall a little junky 
332186324,There were makeup and blood stains on the comforter  and black hairs in the shower 
656455101,There is a layer of dust on the base boards and on top of ledge in shower  Ashes in window ledges  You can tell the floor was mopped with a dirty mop 
662115704,It was hair all over the bathroom and shower   and there was glass on the floor     and the Tv came off the wall when i turned it away from sun
718860812,I found a burnt towel In the closet the common area wasnt all that clean 
661840266,There was a couple of dust balls around as id someone swept and left a small pile

665746865,No major issues but our socks were black after walking on the floors and many long hairs throughout the apartment 
718435194,Just different little things  I have a baby so I was close to the ground a lot  You can tell who ever cleans just does a what makes the place look clean clean job as opposed to actually clean the place like it should be 
659706694,Balcony needs love  windows were very dirty and t there was at least   good size spiders that have webs all over above your head

710615348,There was a lot of debris under the bed and around the couch  The ceiling fan wouldn t work  They either took the remote or it doesn t work at all  There was   light switch that didn t turn anything on  so that could be why the fan wouldn t work 
669933110,There were multiple areas in the bathroom and kitchen that had not been clean for some time  Corners of the room  baseboards  cracks in the stove had food in them etc  These things made me question how well clean the rest of the space was  In addition  the tub   shower backed up after about   mins of running the water  meaning you had to stand with your feet in disgusting back flow while you showered  The bedroom also had no top sheet   Only a duvet  Since most of the time the duvet doesnt get washed every guest  this was an additional gross factor 
669913774,Shower curtain should be replaced
716085187,There was holes in the sheets like cigarettes holes   We didn t have heat at all for   days stay on our extended stay the  th day they decided to let   men we didn t know in our bnb he gave them our code without telling us as we are returning back to the air bnb the men are coming out of the apartment  Unprofessional as hell  The boiler room was leaking all the way to the bedroom floors and now they are trying to charge me for damages what damages

82806476,""
443704036,This review is in reference to the original booking at      S Blackstone  It was clean on the surface but not when you looked closely  Ex  There were food wrappers crumbs under the bed  The kitchen table had not been moved when the floor was mopped  there was sticky pink juice under the table base  The issue with cockroaches is clearly a problem with the building  but you could do a better job of sealing up the spaces within the unit so they cant come in  After the cockroach issue  I really appreciate you being accommodating and providing an alternative building for the remainder of our stay 
594418100,Just some dust around corners and what not  nothing atrosious 
442501196,The sheets and bathroom did not look like they had been fully clean after the guest prior to our stay  I was able to get in touch with the host and they ensured me it had been clean  so may have been an issue with the clean service they used

508873974,All the place was clean except because there was a cockroach in the kitchen  I saw it the last day before leaving  Not really an issue because I did not cook but definitely it can be annoying for other people
453730649,consider another shower curtain such that the wood in the bathroom doesnt get so wet
505676459,The kitchen and bathroom floors both felt oily  and because there is no dishwasher in the space  the cleanliness of the dishes was a bit touch and go  The water damage to the wall and window in the bathroom was pretty severe  The giant stain on the couch was off putting
